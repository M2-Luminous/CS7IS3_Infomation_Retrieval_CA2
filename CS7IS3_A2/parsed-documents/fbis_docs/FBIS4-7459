The following is the full text of the accord: The signatories accept that all armed hostilities between the two sides should cease immediately and that total observance of the cease-fire along all confrontation lines [linija dodira] (henceforth the confrontation line), as they were on the day of 29 March 1994, should begin at 0900 on 4 April 1994. To achieve and maintain a permanent cessation of hositilities, the sides agreed to accept, and act in accordance with, the letter and spirit of the following points: 1. All armed hositilities to cease immediately and the cease-fire along the confrontation line to begin at 0900 on 4 April 1994. 2. From the day of the signing, the tactical deployment of the forces along the confrontation line and within 10 kms from the confrontation line to be frozen on both sides. There will be no movement of units within this zone except for the purpose of implementing this accord or with the prior authorization of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. UNPROFOR will be informed of the passage of units with more than three vehicles through the zone during the first 14 days from the signing of the accord. 3. By 0900 on 5 April 1994 at the latest, all indirect weapons [indirektno naoruzanje] to be deployed beyond the range of the confrontation line (as defined in Point Four) as follows: mortar launchers and anti-aircraft guns at least 10 kms away and artillery weapons and tanks at least 20 kms away. In an exceptional situation, the sides can store some of the indirect weapons within the 20-km zone, as provided for in Point Four, Annex B, "The Rules of Disengagement." 4. By 0900 on 8 April 1994 at the latest, all units along the confrontation line will be disengaged. On the basis of the disengagement, both sides will pull back to at least 1,000 meters from the confrontation line to their line of separation (henceforth the line of separation) [linija razdvajanja]. The lines are as marked on the maps endorsed by the sides and attached in Annex D. The units are to withdraw to a distance from where the sides will not be capable of targeting each other from direct firearms [direktno vatreno oruzje]. The separation line should be easily indentifiable (preferably to run along a geographic feature such as a road, a river, a pass, and so forth). The zone between the separation lines will be under the exclusive control of UNPROFOR, and except for the personnel identified in Annex B of the Accord, no military, paramilitary, militia, or police personnel from either side will be allowed to remain in the zone. The sides will, however, be obliged to help UNPROFOR in preventing crime and upholding law and order between the separation lines, as specified in Point 9 and 10 of Annex B. 5. UNPROFOR and the ECMM [EC Monitoring Mission] will supervise the cease-fire. UNPROFOR military observers will be granted full freedom of movement on both sides of the separation lines to enable them to check that the weapon systems as specified in the Accord are deployed beyond the minimum distance from the separation lines. Freedom of movement in the areas as defined above implies the right to inspect all military and paramilitary units and facilities, provided four-hour prior notice is given. In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding, the ECMM will be given full freedom of movement in all areas covered by the Memorandum. UNPROFOR, which is to operate in accordance with its mandate, will be granted full freedom of movement in all relevant areas and the right to inspect all military and paramilitary units and facilities as described. The freedom of movement in the above areas implies the unlimited use of helicopters in those areas. 6. Joint commissions will be established at all levels. Their first task will be the demarcation of the line of separation on the ground, in keeping with the principles set out in Point Four. This should be achieved by 13 April 1994. Their main task is to investigate immediately any cease-fire violation. The aim of an investigation is to establish responsibility for such a violation. The commission investigating a cease-fire violation will be informed -- by the side which is deemed responsible for the violation -- of all disciplinary measures or other actions undertaken in connection with the incident. These commissions will be established before the cease-fire comes into effect. The commissions will be chaired by an UNPROFOR representative who will -- at his or her own initiative, or at the request of the sides -- schedule meetings for the participants. Meetings will begin, with all sides attending, in the shortest possible time after receipt of a request from the headquarters of the members. Details concerning the composition, the venues for the holding of meetings, and documentation are, as agreed, to be found in Annex B. 7. If any violation of the cease-fire or other provision of this agreement comes about, neither side will return fire; instead, they will rely fully on the procedures envisaged in Point Six above. 8. The participants are agreed on the opening of a specific number of crossing points along the confrontation line. These new crossing points, as well as those which already exist, are listed in Annex A. UNPROFOR will have its own checkpoint on all these crossings. All the checkpoints or other positions of the two sides must be located sufficiently far from the UN checkpoints as to render sniper fire or fire from heavy machine guns ineffective. At all the checkpoints UNPROFOR will specify facilities for the holding of meetings of the joint commissions. All crossing points will be opened at the latest three hours after the cease-fire comes into effect. 9. The sides will meet and agree on ways to reduce their forces within a 10-km zone, stretching back from both sides of the confrontation line, by 0900 on 19 April 1994 at the latest. This reduction in the forces will be completed within five days of reaching agreement.
