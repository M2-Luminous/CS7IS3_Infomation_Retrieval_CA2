He said that the inter-bank agreement did not have anything to do with the unification of the monetary systems. This may happen when both Russian and Belarusian governments take a corresponding decision, he said. So far, the Russian and Belarusian prime ministers have only signed a statement on the forthcoming, not actual, unification of the monetary systems, he continued. Moreover, the agreement envisages a detailed analysis of all aspects of both countries' monetary emission and credit policies. Solovov believes that Gaydar deliberately distorted facts and that the financial policy, pursued by the government has pushed the Russian financial system on the verge of ruin. Moreover, "many people claiming to be experts are in fact dilettantes looking for a way out of the crisis in the banking policy, instead of concentrating on economic restructuring," he said. He stated that Gaydar's resignation was not motivated by the inter-bank agreement. "Gaydar used it as a pretext for covering up more complicated problems," he said. An attentive reader of the inter-bank agreement will not fail to see that the actual unification of the monetary systems will occur when the purchasing power of the Belarusian monetary unit will become equivalent to the Russian ruble. Only then will it become possible to exchange the national banknotes according to the 1 to 1 rate. This work is already being done by experts of ministries, by the Committee for Prices and by the Central Bank. This requires a serious analysis not slogans," he said. To quote Solovov, Russian industrial enterprises owe Belarus 211 Bn rubles (as of December 1, 1993). If this money were repaid to Belarus, the exchange rate between the Russian and Belarusian rubles would not be so striking, he said. The Russian enterprises' insolvency was largely caused by the economic policy pursued by the government in 1992-93. It had a strong impact on the exchange rate and strongly influenced the economic processes, stated Solovov.
