Reasserting its continued commitment to seek solutions, the Inter-party Board supports the demands of peasants. Moreover, it denied that the Inter-party Board had experienced a crisis. After almost four hours of negotiations, Vice President Angel Roberto Seifart read a communique through which the Inter-party Board members reassert their determination to continue to seek solutions to national problems. The communique adds that they support the demands by peasants to increase cotton prices for the current harvest. The communique adds that the Governability Pact seeks to prioritize all technical studies that urge the government to grant needed financial increases for farmers. They express their hope that the establishment of the Social Development Council, which was proposed by the Inter-party Board, will be an effective way to solve overall social problems and to implement social welfare policies, and not just to solve current problems. The communique urges the national government not to resort to foolish repression in answer to popular demonstrations which have been silenced for so long without first exhausting the possibility of dialogue as a way to find solutions to the demands. The communique states that the Inter-party Board is willing to mediate. The Inter-party Board members call for an urgent meeting with the president to discuss the extent of Decree 436/93 issued on 25 September 1993 establishing restrictions on the free marketing of cotton. This meeting will probably be held sometime this week. Asked about the role of the Governability Pact within the Social Development Council, Vice President Seifart said it will continue to work because political parties will play a relevant role in this new council. Seifart denied that the Inter-party Board experienced a crisis. He said that some political party leaders have refered to the current situation. PLRA [Authentic Radical Liberal Party] leader Domingo Laino explained the extent of his statement, stating he never mentioned the possibility of breaking the Governability Pact, rather of making demands on the government. The meeting was attended by representatives from several political parties, including Miguel Angel Montaner (PDC) [Christian Democratic Party]; Victor Sanchez Villagra (PRF) [Febrerista Revolutionary Party]; Juan Carlos Galaverna and Eugenio Sanabria Cantero (ANR) [National Republican Association - Colorado Party]; Domingo Laino and Juan M. Benitez Florentin (PLRA), among others.
