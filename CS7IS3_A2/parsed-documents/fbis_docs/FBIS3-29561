According to the joint statement, a delegation of the Communist Party of Uruguay composed of Executive Secretary General Petro Balbi and the executive member and international secretary of the Central Committee of the Party visited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from Feb. 11 to 17, 1994, on the invitation of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. During its stay in Korea, talks were held between the delegations of the two parties, at which the sides informed each other of their conditions and activities and exchanged views on a series of matters of common concern about the present international situation and reached a consensus on the fundamental matters discussed. The WPK expressed firm solidarity with the CPU in its efforts to develop the party on the principle of Marxism-Leninism and its struggle against the "neo-liberalistic" strategy of the imperialists, after it reaffirmed the continued maintenance of the socialist idea and its working-class nature. The CPU noted with high appreciation that the Korean people singleheartedly united around the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, are confidently defending and advancing the socialist cause under difficult conditions in which the imperialists are persisting in their anti-socialist, anti-DPRK moves, and expressed full support and solidarity for it. It also manifested full support to the struggle of the Workers' Party and people of Korea to achieve the reunification of the country in the form of confederation based on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments on the basis of the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity laid down by Comrade Kim Il-song. The sides shared the view that an immediate end must be put to the unwarrantable acts of the western powers, particularly, the United States, in violating the inviolable principles of self-determination of peoples and non-interference in the internal affairs of each country, exercising privileges in the international arena. They expressed their willingness to make joint efforts to destroy all the old international political and economic orders of domination and subjugation and establish new orders based on equality, justice and social progress.
