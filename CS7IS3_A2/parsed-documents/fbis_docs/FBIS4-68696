The participants in the training of the new ministers of law and order will also include Moscow, but to a rather small degree: 45 future Palestinian policemen will undergo training in Russia, and, in addition, Moscow will provide certain equipment to the PLO. On the part of Israel there are no obstacles to this kind of apportionment. The main problem is to carry out the pledges promptly. But it is difficult to do this without a good economic base. The lack of this base also largely influences the placement of the foreign forces in the Near East, where one currently senses to a greater and greater extent the dominance of the United States. Naturally, a rather large part of the financial and economic support for developing Palestinian autonomy directly or indirectly -- by way of Israel -- comes specifically from there. Tel Aviv has traditionally gravitated toward Washington, but now that tendency is also typical, to a certain degree, of the PLO. Understandably, Yasir 'Arafat currently, after the attainment of peace, has a self-interest primarily in economic support, in order to demonstrate to his people the fruits of peace and to prove to them all the practical advantages of goodneighborly coexistence with Israel. The appeal was made to Moscow when Israel and the PLO were confronted by questions with regard to which they did not trust one another, and it was difficult to manage without Russia. Evidence of this is provided by the recent visits to Moscow made one after the other by Yasir 'Arafat and Yitchaq Rabin. Judging from the fact that the agreement of autonomy was signed two weeks after the visits to Russia by the Near East grandees, Moscow succeeded in playing its role in this matter, by speeding up the settlement process. It would seem that no small role has been played here also by the traditional ties: Palestine-Russia (in the past,, the USSR) and Israel-Unuted States. Trust does exist along these lines. It also exists along the US-Russia line, especially since both these countries are acting as cosponsors of the Near East settlement. The fact that the two sides of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict could not talk to one another face to face was transmitted until recently along the chain PLO-Russia-United States-Israel, or in the reverse order, or even without the third link. Now, however, the Palestinians are seeking greater trust and ties on the part of Washington. There was also a clarification of the details of why Rabin and 'Arafat signed the agreement twice. The PLO leader, while viewing the so-called Blue Folder -- the detailed appendix to the agreement -- at first did not want to sign it, and appended a statement to the part pertaining to questions of security, with demands for additional guarantees from the cosponsors -- Russia and the United States. During the urgently announced break they were given to him, and the agreement was consolidated by signatures a second time. Speaking about peace in the Palestinian sector, Shim'on Peres, Israeli minister of foreign affairs, stated that his country would strive for the same resolution with respect to Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. As for the first of these states, it is assumed that here Russia has certain levers for exerting pressure on the Arab side, confirmation of which will be provided by the definite results of the visit to Damascus by a delegation headed by Oleg Soskovets, RF first vice-premier. Most probably, the direct contacts between Israel and Syria will proceed secretly, as was the case with the PLO.
