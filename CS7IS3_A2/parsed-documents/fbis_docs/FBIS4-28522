FBIS4-28522 "dreas112_d_94024" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 South Korea * Dailies Upset Over Han Sung-chu's Vietnam Speech * Dailies Upset Over Han Sung-chu's Vietnam Speech 11111111 11111111 CSO [Editorial Report] Nearly all Seoul dailies disapproved of Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's remarks during his 20 May meeting with Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh. The 22 May papers all mentioned the portion of Han's speech that brought heavy criticism. Except for HANGYORE SINMUN, all the dailies were angry over Han's statement that "regretably, there had been a period of wounding between Korea and Vietnam..." The papers called this "irresponsible words by a responsible official." CHOSON ILBO, in its editorial called this one of several blunders Han has made since his appointment and urged him to "rein in his tongue." HANGUK ILBO expressed its disapproval: "The Vietnamese government has not asked for an apology; our government has no policy of apologizing for participating in the Vietnam War; why did Han apologize?" Both CHOSON ILBO and HANGUK ILBO pointed out that "the Vietnam War was a war between the free and the communist worlds during the cold-war era and our role was part of a mission trying to maintain regional security and protect freedom. We need make no apologies or excuses for our part. HANGUK ILBO asked rhetorically: "Did the Chinese apologize for fighting against us during the Korean War?." According to the CHOSON ILBO, Han should know better than anyone that the United States and Vietnam are negotiating to establish diplomatic relations and that the subject of the Vietnam War is on the agenda, thus it was not an issue in which South Korea should be involved. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' [MOFA] spokesperson tried to represent the issue as a "mere diplomatic gesture" and urged the media not to read into Han's statement what is not there. The media was not satisfied: HANGUK ILBO demanded "how can a diplomat make a speech without the support of government policy?", adding that Han's speech was an "insult to our many soldiers who gave their lives as well as to the surviving veterans" of the war. While most Seoul dailies protested Han's comments, HANGYORE SINMUN carried an article on pages 1 and 3 praising Han's remarks as a "step towards national diplomatic maturity" while saying that they "did not amount to an official apology." In reality, the paper claimed, Han had acknowledged "our involvement in an `unjust war'". The paper said Han's statement to the Vietnamese "improved our diplomatic position a notch" relative to the Chinese and Japanese. HANGUK ILBO and CHOSON ILBO reported that MOFA, however, cautioned the media not to compare Han's statement in Vietnam with Japan's apology to Korea.
