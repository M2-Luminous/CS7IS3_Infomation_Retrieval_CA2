In a letter to parliament Speaker Ulo Nugis, the Council of the Russian Community suggests that persons registered with the Citizenship and Migration Department as resettlers be allowed to privatize their apartments without delay and either sell them freely or mortgage them to raise funds. The council also proposes that one member of a repatriating family be allowed to cross the border freely and free of charge either during a five-year period or until the family completes building housing and resettling. The problems involved in privatizing and selling their apartments and the lack of documents necessary for the unavoidable trips abroad in connection with repatriation are at present the major stumbling blocks for the non-Estonians who want to leave Estonia.
