Chancellor Kohl's candidate, Roman Herzog, is still the favorite, but polemics have continued to rage within the coalition: The liberals, divided between their loyalty to the government pact and the temptation to vote for the opposition's popular candidate, Johannes Rau, warned yesterday that they would not give in to pressures. Absolute solidity on the part of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] is not guaranteed. Against this background, both candidates are placing their stakes on a unitary approach, toning down polemical accents. Their positions would look even more similar if it were not for the tension resulting from the election campaign which is already under way in view of the October elections, and for several decades' history of almost bipolar democracy. We listened to left-wing opposition candidate Johannes Rau, who is the oldest of the regional ministers-president as well as the SPD's [Social Democratic Party of Germany] senior leader. [Tarquini] In your opinion, what are the next president's priority tasks? [Rau] Above all -- I believe -- trying to bring people together, to unite the country. Not only the citizens from the East and the West, I am also thinking in terms of the huge generation gap and of the growing dissension between social groups. This will be a difficult task, bearing in mind that the president's powers are limited. His greatest asset is the spoken word and, in this respect, having as I do almost 40 years of experience behind me can be an advantage. [Tarquini] Do you believe Germany requires a new awareness as a nation? [Rau] Richard von Weizsaecker said that we had to settle accounts, in particular, with our history, and he was not alone in saying this. We cannot minimize the pain we inflicted on other nations by offsetting it against the suffering history then inflicted on us. Considering the last 100 years, our national sense must necessarily be a bit fragile. As former President Gustav Heinemann once said: "If we want others to forget what we did to them, we must never forget ourselves." [Tarquini] To what extent is extreme right-wing violence dangerous for German democracy? [Rau] There are always a few incorrigible individuals in all countries: in France, England, Germany. However, we Germans know -- or ought to know -- better than others where incorrigibility leads when it becomes widespread. This is why we must answer the challenge sensibly. [Tarquini] Is a right-wing turn currently taking place in Germany? [Rau] Our country is facing economic problems and social tensions as well as their consequences. The extreme Right aims to win support in the hotbeds of social tension, where young people lack employment prospects. We must combat the causes that make young people receptive to such messages, but I do not think that extremism is stronger in our country than elsewhere. We need more solid barriers, because we have already been scalded by experience. [Tarquini] In economic and demographic terms, united Germany is the first power in developed Europe. Should it also become the first political power? [Rau] I believe that we should not be seeking to fulfill a special role in any sense. Clearly, what really matters is that we want a European Germany rather than a German Europe. We are bound for European integration, because such a large country right in the center of Europe will end up being perceived and treated as a threat unless it becomes integrated. [Tarquini] Would you agree with your Army being given more international responsibilities? [Rau] I believe that Germany must take on a greater share of responsibility worldwide, but it remains to be seen whether assuming new responsibilities can only be done by sending out troops. I do not think that international aid to peacekeeping missions can be exclusively military in nature. What I would like to see is the establishment of a European peace corps for development. [Tarquini] Can a German be a patriot without becoming a nationalist? [Rau] Yes. Despite all the tragedies in history, a natural relationship to the nation is necessary, and this idea cannot be left in the hands of extremists. A patriot is someone who loves his fatherland, a nationalist someone who despises other people's fatherlands. Being a good patriot is what I essentially wish to be. [Tarquini] How long will it take yet for unification to be completed? [Rau] Living conditions in the East and the West are still marked by differences in many fields. Forty years of division have left traces in people's minds and given rise to new prejudices. I believe we still have a long way to go before people learn to speak to each other without preconceived ideas, and learn to understand each other. An investment campaign is not enough. Human understanding is the real issue. If I am elected, this will be one of my priorities. [Tarquini] Many are demanding a stronger president for Germany, elected by the people. Do you agree with this? [Rau] I do not support an American- or French-type presidential system. However, if a direct election system is eventually introduced, it will be necessary to consider broadening the president's authority without thereby changing the balances provided for by the constitution.
