FR940202-2-00005 FR940202-2-00001 Four respondents objected to discontinuing the discounting test. They stated that discounting provides an incentive to counter the hoarding tendency of some purchasers and enhances the continued harvest of timber sales in a timely manner. These respondents think that an incentive-based approach encouraging early harvest is much better than the proposed policy which they considered a disincentive. Two respondents objected to use of discounting procedures on an individual sale basis. Stating that the proposal was inadequately defined, was an administrative over-reaction, and was costly and complicated, these respondents concluded that the Forest Service will be reluctant to apply discounting to individual sales. The agency recognizes that incentives such as discounting are effective in encouraging early harvest of timber. However, the agency believes that continued area-wide use of discounting as an inducement for early harvest of timber is not warranted based on current market conditions, low volume of timber under contract, current rapid rates of harvest, and anticipated lower sale levels. The agency believes that blanket use of discounting unnecessarily devalues the timber when there is no need for prompt harvest of timber. Further, the agency believes the continued use of discounting could contribute to speculative bidding by persons who expect to harvest timber early in the contract period. Such speculation may result in an unfair competitive advantage for some purchasers. Also, if a purchaser's expectations of early harvest cannot be realized, payment of undiscounted prices higher than expected could cause default. Despite agency concerns about the blanket application of area-wide discounting, the agency believes that there are some situations (e.g., early removal of fire-damaged, insect-damaged, and wind-thrown timber), where the use of discounting can be warranted. In such situations, the expectation is that lower payment rates and the other disadvantages of discounting will be more than offset by the benefits of prompt harvest of timber subject to rapid deterioration and by protection of other resource values. Further, discounting procedures on an area-wide basis may become warranted if the present market or other conditions is an area change to the degree that encouragement of prompt harvest is in the government's interest. For example, high levels of uncut volume under contract could cause the agency to consider area-wide use of discounting. Recognizing that the discount procedures are complicated and that there could be some reluctance among Forest Service officials to include discounting provisions in an individual timber sale contract or to seek approval for area-wide use, the agency believes that justification and approval processes will ensure that discounting is applied only where and when there is good rationale for its use. Therefore, having considered all of the comments, the final policy on discounting is the same as that proposed. The final policy provides for use of discounting upon an individual sale basis when specific situations justify the need for immediate harvesting and on an area-wide basis only when warranted by market conditions and upon request of the Regional Forester and approved by the Chief. Under the final policy, situations requiring the use of discounting must be documented by the line officer with the authority to approve the sale on which it is to be used. When market conditions warrant discounting on a National Forest or area-wide basis, the Regional Forester may request approval to use discounting from the Chief of the Forest Service. The request for approval must document the existing and anticipated market conditions (e.g., volume under contract, rate of removal, when volume is removed during the contract, expected sell levels) for the Region or area affected. Conclusion The objectives of the financial security measures contained in this final policy are to assure timely execution and completion of timber sale contracts, to maintain competition by qualified bidders, to discourage speculation, and to minimize the financial risk to the Government in instances where purchasers do not complete contracts. The final policy eliminates the present $500,000 ceiling on the amount of performance guarantee required by the timber Sale contract, and establishes the minimum performance guarantee at 10 percent of the total bid value. The final policy increases the amount of bid guarantee required to bid on National Forest System timber sales to 10 percent of the total advertised value. Under the final policy, repudiation of a bid will be considered a breach of contract and damages will be based on the bid price of the reoffered timber plus administrative costs, such as the costs incurred by the government in making the reoffer plus interest. Further, if no bids are received on the reoffered sale or if the timber cannot be immediately reoffered due to delay or other factors, damages will be the difference between the repudiated bid value and the appraised value of the reoffering. Administrative costs will then be added to the difference in values.
