FR940720-2-00064 FR940720-2-00052 Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains from Maine in the Possession of the Robert Abbe Museum, Bar Harbor, ME AGENCY: National Park Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice. Notice is hereby given in accordance with provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d), of the completion of an inventory of human remains from four sites in Hancock County, ME, in the possession of the Robert Abbe Museum, Bar Harbor, ME. A detailed inventory and assessment of these human remains has been made by the curatorial staff of the Robert Abbe Museum and contracted specialists in physical anthropology, in consultation with representatives of the Penobscot Nation, Aroostook Bank of Micmac, Houlton Band of Maliseet, and the Passamaquoddy Nation, collectively identified hereafter as the Wabanaki Tribes of Maine. The partial remains of six individuals were acquired by the Robert Abbe Museum between 1931 and 1945 in archeological excavations of three prehistoric shell middens in Hancock County, ME. Partial remains from three individuals were recovered between 1931 and 1936 from ME Site 44.12A. The partial remains of one individual were recovered in 1939 from ME Site 44.25. Partial remains of two individuals were recovered between 1941 and 1945 from ME Site 44.6. Radiocarbon dates from ME Site 44.6 yielded dates of 955 BP +/- 75 years and 1,120 BP +/- 80 years. The radiocarbon dates and other archeological evidence indicate that all six individuals lived during the Late Prehistoric Period (1000 AD_1500 AD). A human cranium and maxilla were acquired via donation from H. Lawrence Angel in 1946. Mr. Angel indicated that he had collected the human remains from ME Site 31.31, another prehistoric shell midden in Hancock County, ME. These remains are also judged to be associated with the Late Prehistoric Period occupation of ME Site 31.31. Inventory of the human remains and review of the accompanying documentation indicates that no funerary objects associated with the above mentioned human remains are part of the collections of the Robert Abbe Museum. No known individuals were identifiable. The Archaeological Advisory Committee of the Maine Historic Preservation Program has found it reasonable to trace a shared group identity from the Late Prehistoric Period inhabitants of Maine as an undivided whole to the four modern Indian tribes known collectively as the Wabanaki Tribes of Maine on the basis of geographic proximity; survivals of stone, ceramic and perishable material culture skills; and probable linguistic continuity across the Late Prehistoric/Contact Period boundary. Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Robert Abbe Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these human remains and the Wabanaki Tribes of Maine. This notice has been sent to officials of the Wabanaki Tribes of Maine. Representatives of any other Indian tribe which believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains should contact Rebecca Cole-Will, Curator, The Robert Abbe Museum, P.O.
