In giving the reason for their reservations, the financial institutions argue that a number of inequities place private pension funds at a disadvantage compared with the Social Security Institute (ISS). Nevertheless, it is hoped that with proper regulations, not only will there be greater competition, but also a smooth implementation of the law. For insurers, the reform is a positive step because it ends the government monopoly over pensions and health care and launches a process consisting in offering a pension based on the savings of every worker. In addition, it is emphasized that for the first time in the country's history, competition is allowed between public and private entities, with complete freedom for every worker to choose between the systems based on the quality of services offered in terms of pensions and health care. There is one drawback, however: The cost of the reform aimed at expanding retirement and health care coverage will be substantial. William Fadul, president of the Union of Colombian Insurers (FASECOLDA), said it will be necessary to review differences established in the number of weeks of payment required and the age at which one becomes eligible for a pension, as well as the generous criteria for determining disability. For the National Association of Financial Institutions (ANIF), the reform could be described as "battered but surviving," inasmuch as the imbalances favor the ISS. "They did everything possible to discriminate against the funds, meaning that the workers earning the lowest wages will have to pay a kind of toll to join," ANIF President Javier Fernandez Riva said. He emphasized the workers' freedom to choose because it will promote competitiion and improve ISS services, but he is concerned that before one may transfer to a fund, a statement before a notary is required. Invertir [Invest] President Fernando Borda said the reform is good, but could have been better. He did admit, however, that it was impossible to do more because it was very difficult to juggle the interests of employers, workers, financial institutions, and the unions. He said that for those earning over the minimum wage, it may be better to join a private fund because with a good yield, a larger pension can be had. Invermanana President Juan Francisco Hernandez said that much of the working population earning the minimum wage should stick with the ISS because if a minimum wage is guaranteed, why pay 150 weeks more?
