Finland wants the whole country to be classified as an unfavorable agricultural area and to therefore receive the EU's special support, LFA [less-favored areas], for such regions. The EU has been unwilling to provide support for the whole country -- at most to Hame province northwards. However, it is now being reported that the EU side is showing greater flexibility on this point and is prepared to move the limit further south. As well as LFA, Finland wants special Nordic support for agriculture, and here too the EU is said to be cooperative. However, it remains an open question what criteria should apply -- latitude or the short growing season. The EU has nothing against such support being paid in Finland, as long as it is paid for by Finland, but the Finns would ideally like to have EU money as well. At Tuesday's [8 February] ministerial meeting the EU put forward its first negotiating bids in the agricultural field -- and these were rejected by all the applicant nations. But it is only now that the agricultural negotiations are beginning in earnest. This week a working group consisting of agricultural experts from the EU countries has gone through all of the applicant nations' almost 400 negotiating demands in the agricultural field, to sort out the really difficult issues from the purely technical. Around 40-50 difficult issues have been isolated, including the transition to EU prices, production quotas, and Nordic agricultural support. These questions will now be handed over to the EU ambassadors and foreign ministers for discussion and will be resolved -- if they are resolved -- in the final phase of the negotiations, at the marathon negotiating meeting from 25 to 28 February. The working group did not change the production quotas for milk and sugar that the EU Commission has proposed and that all the applicant nations have rejected as too low.
