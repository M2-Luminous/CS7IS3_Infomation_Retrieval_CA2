They provide good information on the tactics that were used. At the same time. [text as published]. The accomplices acted at the same time. That means that if the attackers had been prevented from entering, even so the prisoners could have left their cells and attacked the guards from the other direction. The latter would not have been able to do anything. They did not have enough ammmunition. "We had just enough bullets to discourage an uprising," we were told. We have learned that the guards on duty in the detention quarter, i.e., in the corridors, in common rooms, and in cell blocks, were not carrying any weapons (this is a tradition). A.D.: "Betrayed By Ourselves" Seriously wounded, for a long time this prison guard resisted from the observation post to the right of the main gate to the Lambese prison. Possessed of exemplary courage and composure, this man stood up, alone, to the attackers who outnumbered him. In the operating wing of Batna's university hospital center, he is under observation. He runs the risk of losing his left leg. Despite his pain and with medical authorization, he was willing to talk to us. [A.D.] I was at the observation post. Just after the call to prayer. I was getting ready to break the fast. Things were normal. There were three guards, including the one who died. Suddenly there were gunshots. I looked and at that moment they fired at me. There were a lot of them. I fired towards the outside. Once they fired on me from the outside. The gate had been opened for them. They wounded me. I fell and lost consciousness. [Benmohamed] How do you feel? [A.D.] Not well. [Benmohamed] Had you noticed something abnormal? [A.D.] Very little car traffic about three-quarters of an hour before breakfast. At the entrance there was no one. It was when I looked that I noticed vehicles and armed men. My colleague, the accomplice, was standing a bit further up while everyone was in the mess hall. That was abnormal. We were betrayed by ourselves. If we hadn't, the attackers wouldn't have been able. M.E.H. (In the Sentry Box): "Impossible Without Accomplices" [M.E.H.] A minute after the call to prayers, I heard gunshots and rounds of fire. I didn't know where they were coming from. I was in sentry box No. 8 where there's no telephone. My colleague who was on duty in sentry box No. 3, not far away, called out to me. I thought they had fired at him. But it was the chief of the detention post located at main gate No. 2, below enclosure wall No. 5, who had called me to ask to go back up guards who were under attack. We ran but they fired on us from the street from a truck. We fired back. Once we got to wall No. 5 we fired. Its gate was open. Alas, we could do nothing. We each had 10 bullets with us. I had a Mag 51 that was made in 1936. Without ammunition I hid near wall No. 4 until the soldiers came. The attackers were dressed differently; some were wearing our uniforms, others military uniforms, others Afghan clothes, and some others were wearing other clothing... M.L.B., my colleague, was the only one to have a Thompson and three loaders with 80 bullets. We really didn't have working weapons. We were in danger. We couldn't even defend ourselves. If the five guards hadn't been accomplices, this couldn't have happened. The strategic post, where the access door to the detention area is located, was under the orders of an accomplice. We were afraid for our lives. We fought back with what we had, that is to say 10 bullets. You can't even defend yourself with that. A.S. (Head of a Guard Post): "I Heard Some Cries" [A.S.] Everything was normal when the day guard staff left; I was with L.B. when I was checking the office. The guards were in place. Next the day guards were allowed to leave. I agreed with L.B., the head of the police station, that he would do an inspection of the upper quarters while I would check the lower quarters. Everything was normal. Nothing worth reporting on death row. Then I called out to a guard and we sat in the office to finish the registers. Shortly thereafter I called T.A., the accomplice guard who fled (editor's note: he had been transferred from Barika prison on 6 March 1993), so he would help me serve meals to the death row prisoners. This was about 30 minutes before breakfast. We went to the kitchen and we were even helped by four prisoners to carry the meals with us. Upon my return I asked him to help the four prisoners and accompany them to the death row prisoners' cells. There were 10 common prisoners sentenced to death in the cells. They came back a few minutes later. At that time I accompanied them to serve the meals to the death row prisoners on top. Then I turned over the keys to the kitchen to T.A. for him to close it and have the prisoners come into room 14. I returned to my office. Next they came back and returned the keys to me. L.B. and T.A. came to break the fast with me. Five minutes remained. I was standing and suddenly I heard cries. I left my office. Two minutes remained before the breakfast hour. I must tell you I had previously agreed with the wall guard that he would alert me to the breaking of the fast so I could sound the bell to inform the prisoners. I was just at the door to my office. At that precise moment two accomplice guards came towards me, they were Z.B. and H.B. They were armed and they said: "Raise your hands. Hands up." I was surprised, then I regained my composure and I tried to close the door to the office. L.B. did the same by helping me close the door. They were stronger than we were and they managed to get in. I threw myself onto H.B. who had an automatic pistol. It was an old weapon. It doesn't belong to the prison. I tried to take it away from him with L.B.'s assistance. While we were fighting, H.B. said "Leave me. I swear to you that no one will get killed." I didn't want to because I had my doubts. Physically he's stronger than I am. He put the weapon to my head. The bullet grazed me. I fell. I got up to leave. He or the other accomplice guard fired at me a second time. I managed to reach the detention square and I heard other gunshots in the office. There was no prison guard on duty, no guard. They made them go into a cell that was closed behind them (editor's note: who brought these guards in? Were there only two accomplices in this detention quarter?). I think these two accomplices first locked up the guards before coming towards us. As I was running I met a prisoner we employ. He gave me the key to one cell and told me: "Hide here. Otherwise they're going to kill you." Then from there I returned to a control post. I was frantic. I phoned the switchboard, the director's house, main gate No. 1, wall 4: no answer. I contacted, still by telephone, wall No. 3. The guard answered, I asked him to get back to wall 5, to contact those in charge. At wall 5, there was no answer. Finally...I thought all the guards had been killed. I've been there 11 years...The two accomplices have been there for about three years...They stay here but they live far away... M.M.: "I Only Had 10 Bullets" I was on duty at wall No. 3. At 1830, I received from the guard on duty at wall No. 7 the chronology register, which I was supposed to sign, as usual, then in turn I handed it over to the guard at wall No. 8. A few minutes later, I was supposed to go downstairs to get my breakfast plate. I was walking past wall No. 8. My colleague asked me to hand the chronology register to the agent on duty at wall No. 4. There was nobody there. I came up to wall No. 5 where guards L.B. and Z.A. were (editor's note: the accomplice). I handed the register over to them. They had three breakfast platters. I asked them to give one of them to me so I wouldn't have to be away from my post for a long time and since they were next to the mess hall. Z.A. gave me one of them. Next I got back to the post, it was time to break the fast, and I heard rounds of gunfire. I called my colleague at wall No. 8. Next the phone rang. The chief warned us to come down to wall No. 5, below which is main gate No. 2, which provides access to the detention area. I loaded my MAS 51. I had 10 bullets. As I was loading it, the phone rang a second time. The same supervisor asked us to call the director and come down quickly to wall No. 5. I called the director, there was no answer. Then, together with my colleague, we went downstairs. Hardly had we crossed wall No.8 when we saw a blue K66 truck that was moving alongside the wall; a man fired at us with an automatic pistol. Unless I'm mistaken, he was carrying some of the dead because white sheets were covering some human forms. Personally I fired back with two bullets. Once we arrived at gate No. 2, we experienced rounds of gunfire. We responded until our ammunition was used up. I had two bullets left because my weapon jammed. I climbed up wall No. 5 where I found B. We stayed between walls 4 and 5 until the security forces came; we were without ammunition. I'm an agent on probation. I'm unable to recognize the five accomplices because I don't even know them. Together with my colleague, I saw we were the only ones still alive. I had decided to jump over the wall. The only one who could respond was the guard who was kidnapped. He was at the right-hand observation post and had a Thompson and some ammunition. In my opinion the bodies on the truck were those of the attackers he had shot. Our photograph shows main gate Photo Caption Behind main gate No. 2 (photograph 1) are the detention areas.
