Mentese issued a statement in connection with demonstrations held in certain cities in recent days disrupting public order. He said that marches and rallies might be curbed with the aim of securing public order and preventing the disruption of city security. Pointing out that the way in which rallies and demonstration can be held are stipulated by the Constitution and the law, Mentese said: Everyone should be aware that the rights and freedoms granted to individuals and democratic organizations through the law, can be curtailed or banned -- without damaging the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms -- in the event laws are trespassed or crimes committed while these rights and freedoms are being exercised.
