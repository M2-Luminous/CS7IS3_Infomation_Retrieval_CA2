Operational Checks and Calibration Maintain a record of performance of each item. 6.1␣Use the procedures in Section 6.1.1 to calibrate the headspace analyzer and FID and check for linearity before the system is first placed in operation, after any shutdown longer than 6 months, and after any modification of the system. 6.1.1␣Calibration and Linearity. Use the procedures in Section 6.2.1 of Method 18 of Part 60, Appendix A, to prepare the standards and calibrate the flowmeters, using propane as the standard gas. Fill the calibration standard vials halfway ( # 5 percent) with deionized water. Purge and fill the airspace with calibration standard. Prepare a minimum of three calibration standards in triplicate at concentrations that will bracket the applicable cutoff. For a cutoff of 5.2 kPa, prepare nominal concentrations of 30,000, 50,000, and 70,000 ppm as propane. For a cutoff of 27.6 kPa, prepare nominal concentrations of 200,000, 300,000, and 400,000 ppm as propane. 6.1.1.1␣Use the procedures in Section 5.2.3 to measure the FID response of each standard. Use a linear regression analysis to calculate the values for the slope (k) and the y-intercept (b). Use the procedures in Sections 7.2 and 7.3 to test the calibration and the linearity. 6.1.2␣Daily FID Calibration Check. Check the calibration at the beginning and at the end of the daily runs by using the following procedures. Prepare two calibration standards at the nominal cutoff concentration using the procedures in Section 6.1.1. Place one at the beginning and one at the end of the daily run. Measure the FID response of the daily calibration standard and use the values for k and b from the most recent calibration to calculate the concentration of the daily standard. Use an equation similar to 25E&hyph;2 to calculate the percent difference between the daily standard and C s . If the difference is within 5 percent, then the previous values for k and b may be used. Otherwise, use the procedures in Section 6.1.1 to recalibrate the FID. 7. Calculations 7.1␣Nomenclature.
