Chiang said Wednesday [16 February]. As a matter of fact, Chiang said, Taiwan might end up benefiting from the appreciating Japanese yen and eventually increase its exports of semi-finished products and spare parts to Japan. In the wake of collapsed trade talks with Japan, the Clinton administration is taking steps to impose trade sanctions against the Japanese. Chiang said Japanese-made cellular phones could be the first victim in a string of US trade actions against Japan as the Clinton administration seeks ways to reduce a trade deficit with Japan that soared 20 percent last year to nearly US$60 billion. As the yen soars, Chiang said, the Japanese manufacturers will be forced to increase imports of semi-finished products and parts to cut production costs. Such a move would bring more orders for Taiwan exporters, he added. Chiang warned, however, that many Taiwan manufacturers will suffer from the yen's appreciation because of their heavy dependence on Japanese parts and components.
