Effective today, the Ecuadoran State will have a new 1994 general budget: 5.985588 trillion sucres is the money that the state will have available next year. Members of the Congress Budget Committee and Finance Minister Cesar Robalino signed the pertinent document. [Begin Budget Committee Chairman Jorge Marun recording] We completed the presentation of a draft fiscal budget for 1994 which is totally financed. It is a budget that will allow the Executive Branch to carry out its [word indistinct] program. This is great satisfaction for the National Congress and the Budget Committee and we honestly think that we fulfilled our duty to the Ecuadoran fatherland. [end recording] Meanwhile, Robalino described 1993 as an economic success. The 1994 budget, based on an average of $13 per barrel of oil, mainly includes plans to help the social sector. Thirty percent of the budget will be spent on education. Other sectors are also included in it, such as health, public projects, and social welfare, areas that did not have a budget before, this is the opinion of Eduardo Villaquiran, a member of the Budget Committee: [Begin Villaquiran recording] The country has a budget that is fully financed, and financed without taxes. It was financed at a lower figure than that which the Executive Branch sent to us. This is very important. Every year the draft budget is sent to Congress and it is usually approved with its financing, but with higher figures. This time, it was a lower figure and this is due to a lack of revenues caused by the drop in the price of a barrel of oil. [end recording] In addition, each deputy will get 600 million sucres to carry out projects in their provinces.
