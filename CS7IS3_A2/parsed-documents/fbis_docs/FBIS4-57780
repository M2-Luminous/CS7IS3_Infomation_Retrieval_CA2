These measures, which will begin to be implemented 1 June and continue throughout the year, concur with one of the recent decisions reached by the National Assembly, and they mark the beginning of a phase during which interrelated measures that are part of a larger process will be implemented. These measures should result in the improvement of our internal finances and thereby lay the foundations for other actions that will benefit the country's economic stabilization and reorganization. Although it has been said and repeated many times, it is necessary to reiterate this once again: There is no alternative to these measures and their implementation cannot be delayed any longer. During the first quarter of the year, the excess of currency increased by 591 million pesos. By the end of May, our monetary liquidity will be approximately 12 billion pesos. Any delay in facing this problem will only be against the vital interests of the nation and the working people. It is true that these increases represent new sacrifices that will affect all of us to some degree. This cannot be denied. We have, however, faced sacrifices and hardships before, and none would be worse than the ones we would have to face should the current situation related to internal finances continue to deteriorate. We should reflect on this seriously because it is not a matter of applauding the measures. Nevertheless, we should be able to understand them and realize that the country has no other choice. Higher prices and fees, particularly on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages -- price increases that were widely debated in the parliaments in the workplace -- are measures that can give us the best results in the near future in terms of generating revenues. According to forecasts from relevant state organizations, their implementation should contribute by the second half of the year to stop the increase of money in circulation, which should begin to recede before the end of the year. This would be an initial success and an encouraging step on the path we must take. A key factor that should be explained to all workers in the country is that it is impossible under the current circumstances to think that these increases in prices and fees can be accompanied by a parallel and compensatory increase in salaries. We would be deceiving ourselves if we tried to make a general wage adjustment under current conditions. We must give real value to current salaries instead of issuing more paper money, which would only contribute to foster an endless vicious circle. This can only be achieved by increasing productivity, expanding the supply of goods and services, and gradually recovering the purchasing power of the Cuban peso. The first step should be reducing to acceptable limits the internal financial imbalance. This, of course, does not invalidate the specific measures now being implemented in various parts of the country to encourage workers engaged in vital economic activities, to identify those who contribute the most, and to increase their real income through various means. We must emphasize that, along with the strict measures, our government has taken steps to protect the most vulnerable and lowest income sectors. Even cigarettes, non-staple products that are hazardous to people's health, have been protected as much as possible for consumers who received fixed or controlled quotas through the application of different and lower prices than the ones that will prevail in the free market. Another proposal that received broad support in the parliaments in the workplace was the move to eliminate subsidies in staple products obtained by ration cards and instead subsidize the individuals and families that are the most needy. In practice, the implementation of this proposal is turning out to be a long and complex process. This means the state will continue paying 365 million pesos a year to subsidize essential goods whose price has not been adjusted. Products whose prices will be increased do not represent an amount that cannot be paid by the lower income groups. Another concrete example concerns electricity fees. Fees paid by those families that consume less than 100 kilowatts, approximately 53 percent of all families, will not be raised. The increase in electricity fees will be applied to the other 47 percent of the families, those with greater incomes because they use 76 percent of the electricity supply assigned to the residential sector. This measure's essential goal is to encourage savings by spending less on fuel. In turn, it has been noted that the new fees will not replace or override the consumption plan or lead to the suspension of services for those who time and again exceed this plan. The increase in train [word indistinct] fees, which prompted appropriate criticism, was wisely corrected while a 30 percent bonus was established for workers and students who regularly use this service. Some measures, such as the one aimed at eliminating the $100 million peso annual subsidy to the workers' soup kitchens, are economically significant. Meanwhile, other measures, such as the fixed fees for water and sewage service, and the increase in postal and telegraph services, although they are far from making the institutions that supply these services financially independent, will help the economy and will have a [word indistinct] and educational effect. It is important to point out that these increases in prices and fees will contribute to one of today's most important goals -- namely, the reduction of the fiscal deficit. Consequently, the additional money collected will not, as a rule, remain for the most part within the companies or institutions. Rather, it will be included as part of the state's general budget as a circulation tax. This will also create a more favorable situation to progress toward the elimination of subsidies for losses and to gradually do away with this phenomenon. It can be added that, despite the additional charge this represents for the family's economy and the harshness of the crisis we are experiencing, Cuban workers with modest salaries, thanks to the social policy of the revolution, spends less proportionately in housing, electricity, transportation, and basic staples than other Latin American workers. Food supplies and other basic services supplied by the state will represent at most, after this reform, 43 percent of the minimum salary, while in Panama, the hemisphere's nation where this proportion is the lowest, it rises to 56 percent. [sentence as heard] In Cuba, more than 80 percent of the families own their house and only 10-15 percent of salary is paid as amortization. In the Latin American nation where this indicator is lowest -- Honduras -- rent is not under $105 a month for a modest two-room apartment. In the majority of the nations, as a rule, housing will cost as much as 50-60 percent of salaries. We must preserve and defend these gains and these realities over and above any circumstantial impediment. Decree Law 149 on illegal enrichment and now these government decisions confirm the willingness to progress in a serene and decided manner toward the fulfillment of the policies outlined by the National Assembly of the People's Government, as well as the commitment to the full resolution of the problems we are facing. We are looking at an extremely significant measure imposed on the people with regard to prices and fees, and this measure must be followed. When the time comes, other revisions must take place in the categories of prices and fees that even apply to the state itself. This is to stimulate greater efficiency and to [word indistinct] subsequent government decisions with regard to the [word indistinct] tax policy and other possible alternatives included in the arsenal of measures that this assembly approved. In a flexible, intelligent manner, with the timely information and due explanation to the people, this decisive process will be implemented. We will not go half way. Our workers and the labor unions currently involved in holding meetings to achieve efficiency will undoubtedly unite around this effort to achieve greater production at a lower cost and with the best use of the scarce resources we have. This can be achieved through debate that [word indistinct] encourages comprehension and the firm support these decisions demand, the top goal of which is to contribute to defend our nation's independence and the revolutionary fatherland of the poor, by the poor, and for the poor. It is once again time to act as masters of our own destiny.
