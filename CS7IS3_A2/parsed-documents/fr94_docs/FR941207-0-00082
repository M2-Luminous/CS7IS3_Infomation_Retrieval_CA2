FR941207-0-00082 FR941207-0-00015 For purposes of this clause claimants may file claims jointly or as a single claim. Such filing shall include such information as the Copyright Royalty Tribunal may require. A joint claim shall include a concise statement of the authorization for the filing of the joint claim. A performing rights society shall not be required to obtain from its members or affiliates separate authorizations, apart from their standard agreements, for purposes of this filing and fee distribution. 37 CFR 302.7(a) (1993). To the Copyright Office's knowledge, the Tribunal never adopted or prescribed any additional requirements for the filing of joint claims, nor was there any guidance on what information should be included in a claim. Section 309 of the Tribunal's rules, governing the filing of claims to satellite carrier royalties, was even more concise with respect to the requirements for filing joint claims, stating simply that ``[c]laimants may file jointly or as a single claim,'' and providing the same exemption for performing rights societies regarding authorizations. 37 CFR 309.2 (1993). Our NPRM proposed significant revisions to the Tribunal's rules regarding the filing of both cable and satellite carrier royalty claims. 59 FR 2556, 2557 (1994). The purpose of the proposed revision was to ``implement a procedural system similar to that adopted by the Tribunal for the filing of digital audio claims.'' Id. at 2556. Claimants were expressly authorized to file joint claims, and would be required to file ``a concise statement of the authorization for the filing of the joint claim.'' Id. at 2566 (cable), 2567 (satellite). Performing rights societies would continue to enjoy an exemption from obtaining separate authorizations from each of their members for filing a joint claim. For claimants initially filing an individual claim and later negotiating a joint claim with other claimants, the proposed rules required that either the joint or individual claimant notify the Copyright Office of the change within 14 days of making the agreement to enter into a joint claim. Id. Finally, the proposed rules required joint claimants to ``make available to the Copyright Office, other claimants, and, where applicable, a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, a list of all individual claimants covered by the joint claim.'' Id. No mention was made as to whether each joint claimant was required to identify at least one secondary transmission of its works, beyond the general language of §§253.3(a)(4) (cable) and 257.3(a)(4) (satellite) establishing the basis for a claim: ``A general statement of the nature of the claimant's copyrighted works and identification of at least one secondary transmission *␣*␣* establishing a basis for the claim.'' Id. The Office's proposed changes to the requirements for filing cable and satellite carrier royalty claims elicited little comment. Only PBS asked for clarification of the requirement for identifying a secondary transmission for a joint claim; it asked what it took to satisfy the requirement_a statement that merely identified at least one secondary transmission for at least one of the claimants included within the joint claim, or a statement identifying at least one secondary transmission for each claimant to the joint claim. See 59 FR 23979 (1994) (comments of PBS at 2). In discussing PBS' comment in the Interim Regulations, we acknowledged that the NPRM ``muddie[d] the waters'' for the filing of cable and satellite carrier claims, and the Interim Regulations deleted the proposed requirement for joint claimants providing a list identifying each claimant to the joint claim. Id. In so doing, we stated our belief that the former Tribunal's regulations required that a joint claim identify at least one secondary transmission for each joint claimant, and found support for such requirement in the Copyright Act: We are troubled, however, by changing what had been a longstanding requirement at the Tribunal for obliging all claimants to identify at least one secondary transmission of their copyrighted works. While such requirement does undoubtedly add to the time and expense burdens of joint claimants such as PBS, it is not without purpose. The law states plainly that cable compulsory license royalties are only to be distributed to ``copyright owners who claim that their works were the subject of secondary transmissions by cable systems during the relevant semiannual period.'' 17 U.S.C. 111(d)(3). To support such a claim, each claimant may reasonably be asked to identify at least one secondary transmission of his or her work, thus permitting the Copyright Office to screen the claims and dismiss any claimants who are clearly not eligible for royalty fees. The requirement will also help to reduce time spent by a CARP determining which claimants have a valid claim: if only one secondary transmission is identified for one of the joint claimants, then it could not readily be determined if the other claimants were even eligible for cable royalties. In an effort to end this confusion we are deleting subsection (e) with its requirement that joint claimants submit a list identifying all the claimants. Instead, we are amending subsection (a)(4) to require that each claimant to a joint claim, other than a joint claim filed by a performing rights society on behalf of its members or affiliates, must identify at least one secondary transmission of his or her works. 59 FR 23979 (1994). A number of commentators protested the Office's decision. PBS/NPR, the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball (Baseball), RIAA, NAB and Program Suppliers submitted comments devoted solely to the filing requirements for joint claims, with Program Suppliers asking that reconsideration of the joint claims interim regulations be severed from the instant proceeding for immediate disposition. See Program Suppliers, comments at 5. The commentators offered essentially four arguments against the Office's decision: (1) to require each joint claimant to identify a secondary transmission containing its work serves no valid purpose; (2) it creates undue expense; (3) the Copyright Office is erroneous in believing that the Copyright Royalty Tribunal required each joint claimant to identify a secondary transmission; and (4) it is unfair and inappropriate to afford performing rights societies an exemption and not others. First, PBS/NPR argued that ``no substantive purpose is served by the requirement for separate identifications of secondary transmissions as to each party included within the joint claim; this is simply a jurisdictional prerequisite that will not determine the distribution of royalties.'' PBS/NPR, comments at 2. Program Suppliers concurred with this view and criticized the Office's expressed concern that individual program information is needed to assist it and the CARPs to identify claims that should be dismissed: [T]he Office's suggestion that such information is needed so it could screen hundreds of yearly filings to determine eligibility, seems a particularly inefficient use of its resources. *␣*␣* Furthermore, it is unclear what action, if any, the Office could take regarding eligibility problems related to an individual claimant within a joint claim. Even if the Office finds that one claimant is ineligible to receive royalties, we would assume that the joint claim would still remain a valid claim. Whether and to what extent the share awarded to the joint claimants should be reduced by the ineligibility of one member of the group are questions for a panel based on the record evidence. Indeed, such questions are incapable of answers at the filing stage. Program Suppliers, comments at 3&hyph;4 (footnote omitted). Program Suppliers and Baseball recommended that the Office should refrain from any examination or ``screening'' of claims as a regular practice, and leave such activities and eligibility issues to the claimants to raise through motions either to the Librarian or the CARPs. Program Suppliers, comments at 4; Baseball, comments at 7. Second, RIAA asserted that the requirement for each joint claimant to identify a secondary transmission is unduly expensive and burdensome. Organizations like RIAA, that represent many claimants, would be forced to contact all of their members and track down a secondary transmission for each one. The problem is compounded by the time lag between most secondary transmissions and the time period for filings of claims. RIAA, comments at 2&hyph;3. PBS submits that it devotes roughly 300 hours annually to the task of identifying secondary transmissions for its member stations. PBS/NPR, comments at 2. These commentators submitted that elimination of the identification requirement for all joint claimants would dramatically reduce their expense and workload. Third, all of the commentators argued that the Copyright Office erred in believing that the Copyright Royalty Tribunal required each joint claimant to identify a secondary transmission. Apparently, while a reading of the CRT's rules indicated there may be such a requirement, see footnote 15, 59 FR 23979 (1994), in actual practice the Tribunal allowed joint claimants to submit only one secondary transmission of a copyrighted work belonging to one of the joint claimants as establishing a basis for a claim for all of the joint claimants. Baseball and RIAA submitted several examples of such filings. Baseball, comments at appendix; RIAA, comments at appendix. They asserted that the CRT interpreted its rules to apply the requirement of identification of at least one secondary transmission to apply equally to individual claims as well as joint claims, meaning that identification of a least one secondary transmission of one joint claimant was satisfactory to establish a basis for the entire joint claim. PBS/NPR, comments at 4&hyph;5. They therefore submitted that the Copyright Office erroneously interpreted CRT practice and should alter its regulations to conform with CRT precedent.
