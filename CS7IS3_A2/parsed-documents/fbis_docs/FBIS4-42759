ARD and ZDF canceled the program, which is rich in tradition, after Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Chairman Helmut Kohl had declined the invitation and the chairmen of the two smaller coalition parties, Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany -- FDP) and Theo Waigel (Christian Social Union -- CSU), had followed the chancellor's example. In response, Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Federal Manager Guenther Verheugen talked of the "arrogance and complacency of a chancellor who has been in office for too long" and disregards the voters' need for information in an "absolutist way." The Greens talked of an "affront to democratic media policy." Greens spokeswoman Anne Nilges said that Kohl prefers to talk only "with partisans" in front of the camera. ARD and ZDF had invited the chairmen of the CDU, SPD, FDP, CSU, Greens, and the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. Both the Chancellor's Office and the FDP substantiated their refusal by the large number of participants, to whom two moderators would be added; in the bare half hour that is available, "less than three minutes" remain for everyone. Useful things cannot be said there. However, ZDF chief editor Klaus Bresser said that the television stations had been prepared to extend the program to 45 minutes, as the news agency Reuter added. However, Kohl had offered CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze as a substitute to the television stations. ARD and ZDF, on their part, declined this.
