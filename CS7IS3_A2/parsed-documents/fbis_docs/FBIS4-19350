It is part of the action program for increased growth and employment. The opposition claimed that the law does not deserve this name because it does not create any new jobs, in spite of 4 million unemployed. It accused the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union and the Free Democratic Party of Germany of dismantling the social system and of neglecting the interests of the unemployed and of the employees. Labor Minister Norbert Bluem (CDU) rejected the attacks, stressing that the Federal Government has built the social system in the past 10 years because it contributed to the creation of 3 million new jobs. Whereas the Federal Employment Office spent 9.1 billion German marks [DM] for active labor market policy in 1982, this sum has increased to DM54 billion today. The law provides for the following measures: - Basically, the Federal Employment Office promotes the transition from unemployment to self-employment during a period of 26 months in the form of a transitional allowance. - The assessment basis for employment within the job creation scheme is limited to 80 percent of the payment for unpromoted work to make it possible to include more jobless in the scheme. - Private employment agencies will be permitted throughout Germany. The permission for private agencies will be granted by the Federal Employment Office. The permission cannot be denied if reliability, the required qualification, an orderly financial situation, and suitable premises are given. The fees must be paid by the employers. - The Employment Promotion Act, which also allows limited contracts, will be extended until 31 December 2000. - The conversion of payments instead of wages into wage cost subsidies according to Section 249-H of the Employment Promotion Act, which have so far only been applicable in eastern Germany, will be extended to west German regions that are particularly hard hit by structural crises. - Persons who switch from full-time jobs to part-time jobs will receive payments for full employment for three years if they lose their jobs. - Recipients of unemployment assistance can be forced for a maximum period of three months to work as seasonal workers in agriculture and forestry as well as in the processing of fruits and vegetables. If they work at least six hours per day, they will receive a seasonal worker subsidy of DM25 daily in additional to their wages. - Entrepreneurs who employ illegal workers will be excluded from public orders for a limited period. - Workers in training schemes will receive payment for short-time work in the event of a loss of working hours.
