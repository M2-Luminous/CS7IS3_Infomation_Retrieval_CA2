FBIS4-29282 "dreas116_h_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-116 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 SOUTHEAST ASIA Brunei, Malaysia & Singapore UK Clarification Sought on Action UK Clarification Sought on Action BK1506133394 Kuala Lumpur BERITA HARIAN in Malay 9 Jun 94 p 2 BK1506133394 Kuala Lumpur BERITA HARIAN Malay BFN [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Wednesday -- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will seek a clarification from the British Foreign Office over British Trade Minister Richard Needham's remarks that Britain may take retaliatory action against Malaysia over the freezing of new government contracts for British companies. Acting Foreign Minister Datuk Abu Hassan Omar said the cabinet will discuss the remarks only after obtaining the clarification from the British Government. "At this point, the government has no plan to issue any statement and will wait until the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seeks the British clarification, including on the authenticity of the source of this news report," he said during a news conference here today. The REUTERS report carried by several newspapers here today quoted Needham as saying that British Prime Minister John Major will be under pressure to retaliate if Malaysia continues the sanctions. "The longer they leave it, the more likelihood there is of retaliation by the British side. The longer it goes on, the more voices will be raised against it," REUTERS quoted Needham as saying. Malaysia froze the awarding of new government contracts to British companies after the British media slandered government leaders, including Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed. The British leaders have ever since been divided over the matter, although not a few of them have blamed their media for it. Needham left for home yesterday after concluding his second visit in two weeks to the country. Needham, who led a delegation of private British investors and companies, met several national leaders during the visit. Commenting on Needham's statement that the sanction may be lifted within six weeks, Abu Hassan said the government has not issued any decision. "We do not reject private British companies, especially those involved in technology transfer. However, they must respect the government's stance," he said. Commenting on Britain's readiness to help Malaysia counter pressure on the generalized system of preferences [GSP] by increasing trade with the European Union, Abu Hassan said the government welcomed any proposals that could increase the country's trade. "However, this should not be used as a reason for Malaysia to lift sanctions against Britain. The two issues are entirely different," he said.
