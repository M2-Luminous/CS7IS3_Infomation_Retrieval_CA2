FR941213-2-00020 FR941213-2-00012 Financial Assistance Award: University of Central Florida AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2) it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on the acceptance of an unsolicited proposal meeting the criteria of 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) under Grant Number DE-FG01&hyph;95DP00102 to the University of Central Florida. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated amount of $619,883 by the Department of Energy for experimental investigation on the interaction of high intensity ultrashort laser pulses with dense plasmas. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(f) that the unsolicited application for financial assistance submitted by University of Central Florida, is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and the results of these studies have potential payoff to both direct and indirect_drive internal fusion. The proposed project is technically sound and attractive. It describes research that would produce laser_plasma interaction data in a regime of great interest and current applicability to the Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Program. The Secretary's recent declassification of much of the ICF research adds significantly to the feasibility of funding for this program. The program has never issued and has no plans to issue a competitive solicitation.
