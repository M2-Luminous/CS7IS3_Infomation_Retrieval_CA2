ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: On November 12, 1993, the Commonwealth of Kentucky through the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet (Cabinet) submitted a maintenance plan and a request to redesignate the Kentucky portion of the Ashland-Huntington nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment for ozone (O 3 ). The Kentucky portion of the moderate O 3 nonattainment area includes Boyd County and a portion of Greenup County. On November 12, 1992, West Virginia requested to redesignate their portion of the Ashland-Huntington nonattainment area and action is being taken by Region 3 in a separate notice. Under the Clean Air Act, designations can be changed if sufficient data are available to warrant such changes. In this action, EPA is proposing to approve the Commonwealth of Kentucky's submittal because it will meet the maintenance plan and redesignation requirements. The approved maintenance plan will become a federally enforceable part of Kentucky's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the moderate nonattainment area. In this action, EPA ia also proposing to approve the Commonwealth of Kentucky's 1990 baseline emissions inventory because it meets EPA's requirements regarding the approval on baseline emission inventories.
