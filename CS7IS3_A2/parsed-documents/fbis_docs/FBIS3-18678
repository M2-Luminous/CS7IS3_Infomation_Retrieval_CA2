Her death has touched the whole nation. At 1545 today, this great Greek woman died at Memorial Hospital in New York. What an irony for this great Greek woman to die away from the country she loved. Exactly one month ago, she left Greece for some scheduled medical exams, saying: I am dressed in our blue and white national colors to give me courage, to come back again. Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said the following upon learning of Merkouri's death: Greece today mourns the death of Melina. She was a courageous fighter, great performer, and a wonderful person. Greece today mourns the death of the woman who, with her art and struggles, identified her name with Greece itself. All Greeks, who loved her and formed a particular relationship with her, are in mourning. It is a relationship that will outlast today's tragic moment. As prime minister, chairman of the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement], and a close friend, I bid farewell to Melina Merkouri with real sorrow. My wife and I express our sincere condolences to her partner Jules Dassin and to her family.
