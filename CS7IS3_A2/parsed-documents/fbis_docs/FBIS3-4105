With the general urban plan as guidance and through unremitting efforts, the reply calls for building Beijing into a famous city of history and culture and a modern international metropolis with a flourishing economy, social stability, various public utilities and services, infrastructure, and an ecological environment of the highest world level. The official written reply of the State Council stresses that Beijing is the capital of our great socialist motherland and is the political and cultural center of the whole country. It is necessary to give prominence to the characteristics of the capital, give play to its strong points, energetically readjust the structure of production and the layout of land use, promote the development of high and new technology and tertiary industry, and endeavor to bring about unity in economic results, and social and environmental benefits. The State Council reaffirmed: Beijing should not develop heavy industry any more, especially not industries which consume a lot of power and water, take up a lot of land, involve much transportation, lead to serious pollution, or cause a lot of troubles for the people. It is necessary to control the population and the scale of land use. By 2010, the registered population of Beijing Municipality should be limited to around 12.5 million (the number of those in the urban area should be limited to around 6.5 million). The key to control of the population in the urban area lies in controlling the increase in the number of people moving in. It is necessary to earnestly protect and improve the ecological environment of the capital. It is necessary to build and perfect the urban greening system, to promptly and strictly protect and implement plans for green areas which separate groups of urban areas, to ensure sufficient green spaces in urban areas, and to form a rational urban framework and development pattern. It is necessary to continue to grasp firmly work to prevent atmospheric, water, and noise pollution and pollution caused by industrial waste and garbage. It is necessary to strictly control the development of polluting industries in urban areas, especially in water sources and the windward side of the city. Regarding existing polluting projects in the urban area, it is necessary to make readjustments and gradually move them away. It is necessary to resolutely meet the requirements set in the plan concerning layout structure, density, stringent controls, and so not to go beyond the limits set. Beijing is a famous ancient capital and is also a city noted for its history and culture. Its urban planning, construction, and development must be able to protect the history, culture, traditions, and the entire pattern of the ancient capital, and to give expression to the organic integration of the national traditions, local features, and the spirit of the times. It is necessary to make great efforts to raise the level of planning and design and to create a good image for the capital of our great motherland. It is necessary to speed up modernization of the urban infrastructure. The State Planning Commission will take the lead in holding joint discussion with departments and localities concerned as soon as possible to work out construction plans for major projects to lead water from the south to the north; to pipe natural gas from Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia to Beijing; to build the Beijing-Tianjin Canal; and to work out steps for implementing these plans. It is necessary to step up implementation of the strategy for the development of transportation in Beijing, to make great efforts to develop underground railways, light railways, and other mass transit public facilities, to further improve the expressway system, to construct modern transportation facilities, and to form as soon as possible a modern, comprehensive transportation network.
