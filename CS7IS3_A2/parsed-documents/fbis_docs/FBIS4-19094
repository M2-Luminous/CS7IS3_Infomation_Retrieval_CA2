Mr Sutherland said assertions that some of the world's poorest countries would lose from the accords were based on "a misstatement of the facts." He was speaking on the eve of a four day meeting of ministers from more than 120 countries which will end with a formal Uruguay Round signing on Friday. "The least developed countries are not losers but winners," he said. Above all, they would gain from strong multilateral rules and disputes settlement. For small and economically weaker countries, these rules were the only protection from the "law of the jungle" where "might is right." Mr Sutherland said ratification of the Uruguay Round was still the subject of debate in some countries and legislative approval by the leading trading powers must be completed in time for the round to take effect by next January. However, the round would not mean an end to international trade policy disputes. Japan is expected to call at this week's meeting for unilateral trade weapons to be placed on the agenda of the World Trade Organisation, planned to replace GATT. Tokyo fears that the new international trade rules will not curb the growing use of antidumping actions and U.S. threats of unilateral trade sanctions. The GATT secretariat, in an analysis published this morning, estimates that market opening for agricultural and industrial goods negotiated in the Uruguay Round could add $235 billion (160.9 billion pounds) a year to world income by 2002. This compares with estimates from the World Bank, the OECD and others of $212-$274 billion. These estimates do not include expected gains from liberalisation of services trade or the boost to business confidence and investment from improved trade rules. According to GATT, industrial tariffs in developed countries will fall from an average 6.3 per cent to 3.9 per cent. Some 43 per cent of their imports by value will enter duty free, against 20 per cent before the round began. Virtually all their industrial tariffs will be "bound," giving exporters security that they will not be raised again. Developing countries have agreed to bind tariff lines covering 59 per cent of the value of their imports, compared with 14 per cent before the round began. The GATT analysis notes that the least developed countries will receive significantly lower tariff cuts on their exports than others -- 25 per cent, compared with 37-38 per cent. However, if textiles and clothing, and fish and fish products, are removed from the calculation tariff concessions to the poorest countries average 59 per cent compared with 44 per cent for industrialised nations. In addition, abolition of quota restrictions under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement after 10 years could in effect more than double the 22 per cent average tariff reduction in the textiles and clothing sector, GATT points out.
