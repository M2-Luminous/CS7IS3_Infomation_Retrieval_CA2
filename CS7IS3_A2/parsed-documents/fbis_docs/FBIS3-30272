Commenting for Radio Jagodina [in Serbia] on the latest threats of military intervention and proposals to lift the arms embargo for the Muslim side only, Karadzic said that the Bosnian Serbs have done everything for a peaceful solution but they were still exposed to relentless threats. In reality, Srebrenica has never been a problem because we have allowed the Dutch battalion to replace the Canadian unit. However, the international community needs to aggravate the situation due to its obligations to the Islamic states. France wants to humiliate the NATO alliance and cause its downfall and so forth, Karadzic said. Karadzic said once again that the opening of Tuzla airport was out of the question because this would mean that the Muslims would receive large amounts of weapons, which they were getting anyway. It is absurd to discuss the lifting of the embargo on weapons for the Muslims when they have been receiving them from the Americans and Islamic states for a long time. The Muslims are well armed and, according to their own claims, they have 200,000 soldiers. We think that they have even more, Karadzic said. He also spoke of the discrepancy between Europe and the United States in respect of the ways for solving the Bosnian crisis and about the increasing number of claims by certain states that negotiations were no longer necessary as the Muslims were scoring victories on the battlefield. The Serbs could be interested in this option. If we are talking about a status quo, the Serbs will keep 70 percent of the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina or possibly go down to 64 percent to which we have the right in the name of peace. If the Muslims opt for war, all percentages will be out of the question, Karadzic said. Karadzic said that the option chosen by the Muslims and their allies was already clear, adding that this would perhaps finally be revealed as early as the next round of Geneva negotiations scheduled for 10 February.
