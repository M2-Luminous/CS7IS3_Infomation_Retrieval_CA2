The ex-Zhirinovtsi, who earlier voiced their intentions to join far liberal "Union of December 12" faction, this time declared that they would contribute to the realisation of the idea to set up the nation-wide patriotic "Derzhava" movement proclaimed recently by former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy. Rutskoy's camp seems to be not happy with such allies. Chairman of Rutskoy's Russian Social-Democratic People's Party [RSDPP] Vasiliy Lipitskiy told TASS today that the statement of Zhirinovskiy's defectors "is in no way in line with the interests and objectives of the RSDPP". He said that they have made "a false step" by using the name "Derzhava" for their own purposes. "I really doubt whether the deputies who have not yet displayed any solid principles would be able to represent interests of any public movement", Lipitskiy said. According to the State Duma's regulations, a new parliamentary group needs to enlist at least 35 MPs to be officially registered.
