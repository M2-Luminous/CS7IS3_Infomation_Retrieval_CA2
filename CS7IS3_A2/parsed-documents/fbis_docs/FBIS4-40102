The statement says, among other things: For the past three years the greatest tragedy has been unfolding before the eyes of millions of people in our country. With the adoption of the Declaration on the Sovereignty of Russia and the election of B. Yeltsin as president, a disastrous course of so-called "reforms" designed to take society back to a wild and barbaric capitalism has been inflicted on the peoples of a great country. While promising to extricate Russia rapidly from the economic crisis, the president and his government have plunged it into an even deeper, all-embracing crisis. The decline in production in the country has passed the 50-percent mark and its most important sectors are on the verge of self-destruction. The retooling of enterprises has virtually come to a standstill. Agriculture, precision machine building, and the textile and light industries are near to total collapse. Basic science and other forms of scientific research are being wound down. The president's attempts to create by his edicts the semblance of a campaign against the economy's rapid collapse are merely aggravating it. In the past three years there has been a sharp stratification of society and the guarantees of citizens' rights to work, free education and medical help, security in old age, and a youth full of confidence in the future have been destroyed. Inflation and the uncontrolled rise in prices, unemployment and intellectual bankruptcy, and bloody interethnic conflicts and crime exceeding all bounds have become the daily accompaniments to millions of people's lives. The process of the nation's degeneration has begun. In these conditions, the statement goes on to say, any state leader with even a modicum of self-respect would be obliged to quit the political stage and recognize the failure of his course and the unprofessionalism and erroneousness of his decisions. However, we do not see even the slightest desire to change a course which has brought grief and suffering to many millions of people. Bearing this is mind, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and its faction in the State Duma urge all truly patriotic and democratic forces to unite in the legitimate struggle for a radical change of Russian state policy, the departure of the ruling regime from the political arena, the abolition of the institution of the presidency, and the creation of a government that enjoys the people's trust. Moscow, 10 June 1994.
