ACTION: Final rule, request for comments. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class E airspace areas at the Dubuque Regional Airport, Iowa; Sioux City, Sioux Gateway Airport, Iowa; Waterloo Municipal Airport, Iowa; Fort Leavenworth, Sherman Army Air Field, Kansas; Fort Riley, Marshall Army Air Field, Kansas; Hutchinson Municipal Airport, Kansas; Manhattan Municipal Airport, Kansas; Olathe, Johnson County Executive Airport, Kansas; Olathe, Johnson County Industrial Airport, Kansas; Salina Municipal Airport, Kansas; Topeka, Forbes Field, Kansas; and Topeka, Philip Billard Airport, Kansas. Presently, these areas are designated as Class D airspace when the associated control tower is in operation.

The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rule (IFR) operations when these control towers are closed.
