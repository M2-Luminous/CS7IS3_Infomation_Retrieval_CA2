Mr. Rabin pointed that according to the Oslo Declaration of Principles, a quadripartite committee consisting of Israel, the PLO, Egypt, and Jordan will be set up to discuss the question of these refugees. The prime minister affirmed that Israel is in no way committed to the figures cited in this context or to return the refugees. He went on to say that the issue of the War of Independence refugees will be discussed in the negotiations on the permanent solution, while Israel, for its part, will raise the question of the Jewish refugees from the Arab countries. Referring to the Knesset members [MK] holed up in a synagogue in Jericho, Mr. Rabin described their actions a political manifestation under false religious pretenses. He pointed out that the MK's presence at the site necessitates the deployment of soldiers to watch over them. He said it is shameful that MK's should count on the fact that no order will be issued to forcibly evacuate them because of their parliamentary immunity. Nevertheless, Mr. Rabin noted, such wanton behavior may make it necessary to take the appropriate steps. In the meantime, until a decision is made, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will guard them. Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that the commander of the Central Command decided to allow MK's Hanan Porat and Dov Shilansky, along with a group of worshipers, to stay in the synagogue in Jericho until the end of the Sabbath, tomorrow evening. On Sunday and Monday, they will only be allowed to stay on the site during the daytime. The MK's promised that their supporters will leave the premises in the evening. The MK's said that in view of the prime minister's denunciation, they regard this decision as a kind of achievement that speaks for itself.
