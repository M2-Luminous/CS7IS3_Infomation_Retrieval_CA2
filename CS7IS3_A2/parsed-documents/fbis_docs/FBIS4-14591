Andrey Kozyrev expressed this view after a meeting with the Polish Seim Marshal (speaker of the lower house of parliament IF [INTERFAX]) Jozef Oleksy. As Kozyrev said, "a paradoxical friendship is evolving between Russia and Poland. The paradox lies in the fact that we have good relations resting on a sound legal basis, good contacts at the level of presidents, prime ministers, and foreign ministers, but then there are some odd press statements, especially in the Polish press. We also have extremists, who make irresponsible statements from time to time, but they never make them officially," Kozyrev remarked. In his opinion, Moscow and Warsaw "need to strengthen the legal base of their common interests and remove all faults in bilateral ties."
