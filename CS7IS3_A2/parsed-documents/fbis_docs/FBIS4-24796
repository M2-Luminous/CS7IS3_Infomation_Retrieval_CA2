The 20,000-word white paper states that Chinese women had enjoyed equal treatment with men in employment and payment. Moreover, all employed women were provided with comprehensive protective measures. Since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, the population of employed women has risen constantly. So far, employed females accounted for some 44 percent of the total number of employees, higher than the world rate of 34.5 percent. The white paper says that in 1992, employed females made up 72.33 percent of all women over 15. In the countryside, women laborers made up half the rural labor force. The number of urban working women increased from 600,000 in 1949 to 56 million, while their share of the country's total working population went up from 7.5 percent to 38 percent. The white paper also lists Chinese women's areas of employment. It says that among the 12 branches of the national economy, nine employed over 1 million women, ranging from industry, agriculture, building, transport and communications, commerce, public health, education, party and government organs to social organizations. The white paper notes that the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women was basically in place. However, due to current differences in cultural and professional competence as well as occupational composition, income gaps still existed. According to a survey conducted in 1990, the average monthly incomes for male and female workers in urban areas were 193.15 yuan and 149.60 yuan respectively, with women receiving only 77.4 percent of the pay given to men. In rural areas, the average annual incomes for men and women were 1,518 yuan and 1,235 yuan respectively, with women getting 81.4 percent of the earnings of men. In other aspects, the white paper says that the Chinese Government had provided comprehensive protective measures for employed women. A survey showed that 85.3 percent of child-bearing female workers and staff members in urban areas enjoy a three-month paid maternity leave. The Chinese Government also stipulated that female workers during their pregnant and lactation period have their work load and work time reduced. Most state-owned enterprises where women predominate had established gynecological clinics, rest rooms for pregnant women, breast-feeding rooms, nurseries and kindergartens. As the economic status of Chinese women improves, the white paper says, they are playing an increasing significant role in the economic sphere. It says that rural women in China were an important driving force in invigorating and promoting the rural economy. Females accounted for more than half of all workers in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries and water conservancy. Of the 14 million self-employed rural individuals engaged in commerce and service trades, women accounted for about one-third. About 50-60 percent of the total rural output value was generated by women. The white paper says that in the cities, women had also made important contributions to urban economic reform and development. From 1982 to 1990, the growth rate in the number of females employed in the following sectors, namely finance, culture and education, radio and television, public health, sports and recreation, social welfare, commercial concerns, catering, supply and storage, and government and social institutions, exceeded that of males by 21 to 78 percentage points. In 1993, females accounted for 36.8 percent of those with professional and technical titles in enterprises and institutions throughout the country.
