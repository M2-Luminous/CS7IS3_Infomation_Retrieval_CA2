Thousands of Kigali residents have been trying to make their way out of the capital to safety. The small UN force has been unable to broker a cease-fire between the two sides and have found it difficult to carry out their humanitarian work. There have been increasing calls for the Security Council to rethink its policy on Rwanda and commit more peacekeepers. Today, the UN commissioner for human rights, Jose Ayala Lasso, arrived in Kigali and then set off for the RPF headquarters in Buyumba, 65 km away, to meet the RPF leader Paul Kagame. Our correspondent, Mark Doyle, accompanied him. He is now back in Kigali, and on the line, Robin White asked him how easy it was to get to Buyumba: [Begin recording] [Doyle] It is only easy to travel up and down if you are with the United Nations, essentially. The rebels control most of the road from a point about 5 miles north of Kigali. In between that point and Kigali itself I was told that there are some government forces. Yes, you can go up and down if you are with the United Nations. The United Nations' neutrality is still basically respected, and along the way I can see that most of the countryside was fairly empty. In fact, most of the population are in displaced persons camps. [passage omitted] [White] Paul Kagame, what are his military intentions? Did you ask him if he is trying to take Kigali now? [Doyle] Yes, if you ask him now, if you say: How long will it take? he obviously doesn't tell you, but he always seems, he is a rather urbane man, and he always seems very calm and even perhaps serene, he, sort of, says that we are going to take Kigali and then we are going to pursue our other military objectives. Obviously, he doesn't say exactly what they are, but clearly one of the main ones is to stop the massacres of civilians. [White] What did the United Nations want from him? [Doyle] The United Nations have asked if he would accept an increased force. Later on today, the UN Security Council in New York is intending to vote on whether to increase the force. In fact, Mister General Kagame said he accepted the idea of the force to give humanitarian aid, but he thought it should only be 2,500 and he insisted it shouldn't be an intervention force, it shouldn't, in any way get in the way of his military activities, in other words.
