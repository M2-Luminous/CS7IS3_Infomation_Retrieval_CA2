At this meeting, Provincial Deputy Party Secretary and Governor Xiao Yang stressed that the success of the Three Gorges project will depend on whether the 1 million residents in the reservoir area can be transferred out. Sichuan firmly supports the Three Gorges project and therefore must make this transfer successful. Xiao Yang pointed out: We must properly relocate these residents so that they will work and live in contentment. In this respect, we must resolutely implement the policy of exploitative transfer so that the transfer of the residents will merge with economic and social development. Vice Governor Gan Yuping systematically explained the basic situation in eastern Sichuan, its conditions for reclamation, and the policy for joint development. The meeting listened to the opinions proposed by the committee on joint economic development in the Three Gorges area. Sun Tongchuan, member of the provincial party committee's Standing Committee and secretary of the Chongqing City CPC Committee, attended the meeting and made a speech. Mayors and commissioners from eight cities and prefectures in eastern Sichuan, including Chongqing City, Wanxian City, Nantong City, and Fuling Prefecture also attended the meeting.
