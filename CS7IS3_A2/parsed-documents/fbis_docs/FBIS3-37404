The ship was built at the Kiev "Leninska Kuznya" plant. After the completion of all the running and state tests, it was added to the Ukrainian Fleet. The ship is more that 70 meters long and more than 10 meters wide; its speed is more than 50 knots. Captain Third Rank Viktor Zaremba was appointed as the ship's captain. The ceremony was attended by Ukraine's Minister of Defense, Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy; commander of Ukraine's Naval Forces Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, and leaders of Sevastopol, Lutsk, and Volyn Oblast state administrations. Metropolitan of Lutsk and of Volyn Oblast Ioann (the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Kiev Patriarchate) consecrated the ship and blessed the sailors. Near the ladder of the ship, Vitaliy Radetskyy gave a news conference. He confirmed that Sevastopol will be the main base and the headquarters of Ukraine's Naval Forces. Having given a high assessment to Ukraine's signing of the NATO Partnership for Peace program in Brussels, V. Radetskyy said that "Even now, Ukraine's armed forces have everything necessary to be an equal partner of NATO." According to him, the Ukrainian Army may conduct joint exercises with armies of other states and "the future presence of Ukraine's Naval Forces in the Mediterranean Sea is not ruled out," as is stipulated in the documents signed in Brussels. In connection with Crimean president Yu. Meshkov's statements on the demilitarization of the Crimea at the expense of the Black Sea Fleet, Ukraine's army general pointed out that, in his opinion, this problem must be resolved in two stages. An inventory of the Black Sea Fleet, as of 1991, must be carried out, and its units and formations must be reduced to an optimally needed quantity. In general, "these questions may only be resolved by Ukraine's president and the Supreme Council."
