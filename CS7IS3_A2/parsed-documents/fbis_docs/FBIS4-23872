With three experienced presidents already trying to mediate in the conflict it was not advisable to bring in a newcomer, he said. It had not been possible for him to mediate in the situation because of the large number of bilateral meetings in which he had participated while in Tunisia for the Organisation of African Unity's summit. However, he would like to hear what the various Rwandan parties had to say. Mr Mandela said the cabinet had decided to provide humanitarian aid to Rwanda through medical assistance and funds. South Africa had been asked to supply 50 armoured personnel carriers with drivers to the United Nations for use in Rwanda "but this will have to be investigated", the president said. Several churches in South Africa had raised supplies for Rwanda. Referring to Angola, President Mandela adopted a similar stance to that on Rwanda, saying "as a newcomer I cannot take over initiatives started by others". President Joachim Chissano of Mozambique had already assisted Angola. Mr Mandela said he had met Mr Chissano, Angola's President Eduardo dos Santos and President Mabuto Sese Seko of Zaire on Wednesday. "It seems there is a realisation that they (Angola) should form a government of national unity," he said. Intervention in Lesotho was also being investigated by a task force appointed to investigate the situation in that country. "We are discussing the matter and co-ordinating with the secretary- general of the UN, the secretary-general of the Commonwealth and the OAU," Mr Mandela said. "As soon as our investigations are completed we will announce the decision," he said.
