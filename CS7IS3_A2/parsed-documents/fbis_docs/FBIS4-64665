Living like a commuter between his splendid Como and Domaso homes, he observes political developments with an academic's eye. [Da Rold] What is all this disappointment about, Professor Miglio? [Miglio] My friend Bossi is not being forceful enough in demanding reforms. He is wavering. The Northern League's raison d'etre was basically that of demanding federal reform. Otherwise, the League has no justification for existence, and this may lead to decline, which is what [Prime Minister-designate] Berlusconi is hoping for. [Da Rold] There seems to be no leadership problem within the League. [Miglio] I am not saying anything of the sort. The problem lies in the fact that there are few men in the League who have the stature to govern a country. There is not a very wide spectrum. There are no personalities. All this negotiating to obtain the Interior Ministry for Roberto Maroni is not very convincing either. Above all, Bossi is not coming up with a strategy for the necessary political growth, and at the same time he is facing fierce competition from Berlusconi among his voters. In fact, the League is an attack and protest structure, rather than one for governing. [Da Rold] However, you too, professor, were not opposed to taking part in the government. [Miglio] Except that we should have played in two different fields at once. We should have launched a great campaign for a constituent government. In such a situation, I agreed with a double negotiating table, including both a constituent assembly and the government. Such a separate table worked well at the time of the 1946 constituent assembly. As regards reform, the League would have had the opportunity to establish some form of cooperation with the Left, with the opposition. Now it is essentially folding back on the basic need to govern. [Da Rold] It sounds like a rather crucial step. [Miglio] If we do not change the rules of the game, if we do not establish a federal Constitution, within two or three years everything will revert to the previous situation. It is not enough, it is pointless to change the men alone. I believe that the new government is being formed around major economic interests. This amounts to restoring the First Republic. [Da Rold] On what do you base this pessimistic analysis? [Miglio] In the first place, a formidable group of economic tycoons is being reconstituted. This group will gain the ascendancy as economic recovery gets under way, as soon as Berlusconi has formed his new government. There are men waiting for opportunities to invest and speculate. This will be the driving force behind recovery, which will last six months or a year perhaps. Second, it will be mainly the bourgeoisie linked to the great economic and financial interests who will benefit from recovery. The other bourgeoisie, that of small and medium businessmen, will still have to bear the tax burden of the services to be paid. In the end, there will be a clash, as Piero Ostellino has lucidly written. Only as far as the final scenario is concerned do I disagree with Ostellino: If big business wins, there will be an authoritarian government; if small business wins, we will finally have a federal republic and democracy. [Da Rold] A clash? [Miglio] A revolutionary stage, which will not be morbid in nature like the one we witnessed over the last few years. [Da Rold] Do you believe that Berlusconi is linked to the great economic tycoons? Do you not agree that the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] may be able to reconcile the interests of the two sections of the bourgeoisie? [Miglio] I think that it is impossible. Not because I wish Berlusconi to fail, as some people believe, nor because I myself believe that the Knight has personally chosen those tycoons. Only, Berlusconi is objectively a prisoner. In order to govern, he will have to, on the one hand, concede something to the south; and, on the other, he will come up against men like [Mediobanca President] Enrico Cuccia, who have ready answers: We must concentrate this country's wealth, we cannot place our trust in the small and medium businesses' international vitality. When I listen to this kind of reasoning, I feel very disheartened. [Da Rold] Is there no way a revolutionary upheaval can be avoided? [Miglio] Only by establishing a federal Constitution. When Bossi said "federalism within 90 days," I answered "I am ready." But now we are getting lost in the petty details of government. Bossi is wavering, and he is no longer asking for a major change. Bossi's lieutenants are ready to give up a major change in favor of taking part in the government. As regards Berlusconi, he ought to perform an act of courage... [Da Rold] You do not seem to trust that he is capable of such an act of courage. [Miglio] How can he be? I have already suggested that Berlusconi is a prisoner of the game. In addition, there is his movement, abounding in former Christian democrats, who do not want a liberal democratic party and still believe in going along with the current. They want a new version of the First Republic. [Da Rold] What would be needed, then? [Miglio] A sweeping force. In short: either revolution or a nasty death -- among other things, in a Europe which would no longer be federal, but in which the national states would be reconstituted.
