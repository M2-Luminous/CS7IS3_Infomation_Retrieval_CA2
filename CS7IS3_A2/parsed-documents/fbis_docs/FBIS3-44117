The campaign to establish the exact circumstances in which the ministers died has taken off since the referendum on multiparty democracy last year. The government says it was a simple car accident, but last week the issue was in the headlines again when a retired policeman confessed that he had been involved. Today, the opposition MALAWI DEMOCRAT newspaper also jumped onto the band wagon, saying it has talked to a former political prisoner who saw the four men just hours before they disappeared. On the line to Lilongwe, Robin White asked the paper's editor Charles Simango how far they were getting with their campaign to establish a commission of inquiry. [Begin recording] [Simango] We think we are making progress. The information is there -- most of it -- but the problem now is to get documented evidence, but the people who were actually involved are speaking up now. Most of them have been retired, of course, some top officials who actually gave the orders, about two, they have died. One of them died about five years ago, that was one of the top police officials. [White] And he is dead? [Simango] Yes, he is dead. [White] And what you want to happen next? [Simango] Well, the business can be done at the moment [words indistinct] just to see this commission of inquiry put into place. I think after it has come into place, I think, you know, evidence can start rolling out, and after that people will know the truth. People still believe, we believe as journalists as well, that it wasn't an ordinary accident, so what matters is knowing the truth, but as long as there isn't that commission of inquiry, everything we are hearing is not official. [White] Now, the latest thing that you printed in your newspaper is the story of a former detainee who claimed that he saw these four dead ministers in detention the night before. [Simango] Yes, Machipisa Munthali last week testified to this newspaper that he was given clothes belonging to the late Dick Matenje. The guard who gave him the clothes told him that the three ministers and one member of Parliament had been detained overnight at Mikuyo prison, and at that time they had been released. So, the late Dick Matenje had left these clothes behind, which the guard decided to give Machipisa Munthali to use, since he has been in prison for quite a long time, he has served 29 years. So, Machipisa had no choice, he used the clothes for about two years although they were oversized. [White] So, he wore the clothes of one of the dead people? [Simango] Yes. [White] How far is your newspaper using all this just to try and embarrass the government? [Simango] Well, if it was just trying to embarrass the goverment, I think this could be the least that we could go for, there are worse things. [White] How do you mean? [Simango] Well, this is just one of the incidents. It so happens that the people who died here were top government officials, you know, three cabinet ministers and one member of parliament. Well, that is bad enough, but people have disappeared, we know of people with no names, hundreds of them, they have just disappeared. We have letters, we receive letters here, others newspapers too, that so and so disappeared in 1972, so and so disappeared here, and up to this time we still find people that have been found, say, in rivers; you know, bundled into sack. You find a dead body in a river up to this point. [White] But to what extent are you acting? Like a newspaper, investigating or to what extent? Are you acting as an organ for the opposition? [Simango] I think the line there is very clear. We don't politicize this, we don't. [end recording]
