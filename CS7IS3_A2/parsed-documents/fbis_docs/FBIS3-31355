By this act the Greek side has violated a conclusion of the EC council of ministers reached at the Edinburgh summit on 12 December 1992, according to which our country must be provided with regular oil supplies. Such unilateral and unacceptable measures taken by the Greek Government are particularly worrying since they are also in contravention of the UN Security Council resolution in which both Macedonia and Greece are called on to overcome differences through UN-mediated negotiations and thus contribute to the strengthening of peace and security in the region. The Republic of Macedonia has always pursued a peace-loving policy regarding all developments on the territory of former Yugoslavia, has avoided war and managed to build a democratic society and a free market economy and regulate interethnic relations on the basis of dialogue and tolerance. With regard to the dispute with Greece, Macedonia has shown the maximum flexibility and readiness to display goodwill in the resolution of open issues. This Macedonian policy also applies to the rest of the world. Macedonia has managed to preserve peace and security on its territory and by this has become a factor of peace and stability in the region. Therefore, it is surprising that at the time when the international community is investing enormous efforts for the peaceful and negotiated resolution of the most complex problems, including halting the war in Bosnia, the Republic of Greece, a member of the United Nations, NATO, and the European Council, and the current president of the European Union, should be taking such measures against our independent and peace-loving country; these measures violate international law. By this the Greek Government wishes to exert economic, political, and other kinds of pressure on our country, taking advantage of the fact that Macedonia is a land-locked country. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia wishes to stress that this inflicts huge damage on the permanent interests of both countries and nations, and also on future mutual relations and cooperation for which the Greek side bears responsibility. Despite this, Macedonia firmly abides by its resolve to build good relations with all its neighbors, including its southern neighbor, and is ready to continue the Greek-Macedonian dialogue. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia will collect evidence of all possible consequences caused by the Greek blockade -- which was not caused by the Macedonian side -- and in this connection it will take the necessary measures and activities in the international arena.
