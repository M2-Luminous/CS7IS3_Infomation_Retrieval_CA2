The Miami press, with the backing of important international news agencies, report an insuperable Cuban political crisis. What a simple [ingenua] coincidence to invent such a scandal just days before the fourth Ibero-American summit; reports of illegal departures and naval piracy all aimed at mocking the Cuban-U.S. international immigration laws. Undoubtedly, these are excellent arguments that groups of anti-Cubans living abroad and on the extreme right will use to unleash a campaign of orgiastic accusations against Cuba, its people's revolution and its leader, and to create a parallel show to [word indistinct] the Cuban people from the impact of the agreements, dialogues, and integration that will take place among the region's presidents. I will not mince words: No economic crisis can be sorted out without creating political and social problems, but the difference between the truth and their statement of an insuperable Cuban political crisis is so great that only the most supine, ill-intentioned ignorance, together with a desire to molest, could repeat such information, as some news agencies have. Furthermore, even a dimwit can clearly see that, one way or another, these agencies have received instructions, especially the Spanish-speaking television stations, to ignore everything, or almost everything, about the Cartagena de Indias summit. To do this, they report -- as one of those stations did last night -- that Colombia is only interested in its soccer team's performance in the World Cup and in the Cauca tragedy. In the same way, there's an almost funereal silence about the OAS Assembly in Brazil, where Cuba's reintegration into the hemispheric organization has been strongly supported by many. It is the same silence that surrounds the activities that dozens of Cuban and U.S. organizations have been carrying out to participate in a demonstration against the blockade on Cuba. The obvious needs no refutation, but consumers should at least receive a modest explanation that saves them from being clients of such a deplorable enterprise. Perhaps it would be proper to warn them using Jose Marti's words: In politics, the most important thing is what is not seen.
