In a statement made tonight after meeting President Glavkos Kliridhis, Feissel added that other points must be further clarified. He said he was satisfied that the procedure is progressing well. Feissel added: But, if the two sides do not go all the way, what has been achieved so far essentially means nothing. Feissel said that with the conclusion of this week's talks, which focused on the UN notes, the positions of the two sides were determined to a large degree. He said that these positions will form the basis of next week's talks. He also said that he is convinced that if both sides work toward this goal, an agreement on the CBM's can be reached this month. Asked what has been the benefit of the talks so far, Feissel said that the form and ways to implement the CBM's on the legal regime of UN control of Famagusta and the benefit to the two sides from the opening of the fenced-off area and Nicosia Airport has been clarified. He added that Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, is arriving at a very good time for the talks and aims to help the negotiating procedure. Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the Greek Cypriot side does not yet have a complete picture of the Turkish Cypriot positions. He said the Greek Cypriot side presented its positions on Feissel's notes this week. He added that the United Nations aims to bring the two sides closer to an agreement and stressed that the Greek Cypriot side does not reject Feissel's notes on the headlines of the talks agenda. The spokesman concluded that a new round of talks, which will be more intense than the talks held so far, will be held next week with Clark's participation.
