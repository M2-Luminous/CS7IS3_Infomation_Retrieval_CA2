Russia's intention to seek compromise, which came as a result of a meeting in Moscow between Russian Government representatives, U.S. President Bill Clinton, and the Latvian delegation led by Andreyev, was announced in Washington by U.S. Administration officials. Under the new plan, the radar station in Skrunda will operate for another four years and will then be dismantled within 18 months. At present, however, Russia's position adopted during the previous round is still valid at the current Latvian-Russian intergovernment negotiations, whereby the operation of the Skrunda radar will be extended for five years. Officially Russia has not as yet advised Latvia about a change of position. According to Andreyev, it is still not clear how this issue will be decided. The Latvian delegation's mandate may be changed only after this issue has been studied by the leadership, for example, the Saeima's Interfactional Council. The minister said that to prevent an indefinite delay in its resolution, this question should not be discussed at a plenary Saeima session.
