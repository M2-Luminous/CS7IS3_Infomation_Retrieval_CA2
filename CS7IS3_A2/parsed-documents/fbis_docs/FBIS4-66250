This will be the social and economic situation in China during 1994. For the 1.2 billion Chinese people who expect a great deal from the reform program and wish to lead a comfortable life at an earlier date, the year of 1994 is full of hope as well as contradiction. This is the view expressed by the chief economist of the State Statistics Bureau, Comrade Pan Xiaohua when he was interviewed by our reporter. The contents of the reform program, announced at the end of 1993 and gradually put into practice from the beginning of this year, were quite rich. They involved banking, finance and taxation, planning, investment system, economic affairs and trade, pricing, marketing, social security, housing system, enterprise management and other spheres. The current task of reform will touch upon many areas in breadth and depth. It will be difficult to carry out the reform with the adequate momentum. Qiu Xiaohua believed that this year is a crucial year in which the reform program should be promoted in an overall manner and major breakthroughs be made. This year's reform differs from the single-item reform project. It is an overall reform program aimed at storing heavily fortified points, he added. If we fail to foresee some problems on time, such problems may cause relatively big shocks in society and create negative effects on this year's economy. If we are able to timely discuss and deal with these problems, and smoothly carry out the reform program, our national economy should witness a rapid growth rate of approximately 10 percent. Since China entered the year of rapid economic growth in 1992, it has maintained a high-speed growth rate of approximately 13 percent for two years running. This trend is rarely seen in the world history of economic development. It is similar to the speed attained by Japan and Korea during their economic leap-forward. Right now, except for some individual Latin American nations or Kuwait who is devoted in rebuilding the nation because of the Gulf War, most the nations in the world register an economic growth rate below 5 percent. Therefore, China's strong momentum in economic development during the past two years has aroused world attention. China will definitely be able to keep this kind of momentum for a period of time to come. Qiu Xiaohua pointed out, China's economy went through three stages in 1993 -- the stage of accelerated development during the first half of the year, the declining stage during the third quarter and the rebounding stage during the fourth quarter. According to an estimate, even if China's economy rebounds at the beginning of 1994, it should not be excessively high, and even if it declines during that period, neither would be drastic. Following the relaxation of the macro-regulation and control, the economy will gradually pick up speed in developing itself. However, there will be some fluctuations. It is possible that this year we may achieve a high economic growth along with a high rate of price increases, if we take into consideration the after-effect of last year's rate of price increases (rate of retail price increases approximately 13 percent) and the potential pressure from the cost-push inflation. The speed of economic growth in 1994 may be slightly lower than that of the last year, and the commodity price maintained at last year's level. If measures for exercising the macro-control are excessively harsh, they may affect the smooth implementation of a series of reform programs. Therefore, under the circumstances in which our economy is rapidly growing, and complicated changes in economic relations are taking place, how to control inflation, prevent the commodity price from rising too sharply and achieve the goal of quickening the tempo in carrying out reform is an issue that the leadership at all levels should closely watch, study and learn how to deal with. In answering questions from our reporter about the factors, both favorable and unfavorable to the healthy development of the economic situation in China this year, Qiu Xiaohua pointed out that there are mainly four favorable factors: 1) China is a large nation with a population of 1.2 billion. It provides a huge domestic market to help our economy grow rapidly. Therefore, from an overall point of view, there exists no question of insufficient effective demand. 2) The imbalance in China's industrial structure and in its regional development helps create many more new realms of growth. It is important to eliminate the structural imbalance and help strengthen the weak links in order to support the rapidly developing economy. The backward areas must strive to change their outlook and catch up with the rest of the country. This constitutes another factor in promoting the economic growth of the entire nation. 3) With the new system replacing the old, the old system will soon disappear, and the new system will grow up. This procedure is conducive to emancipating and developing the productive forces. This is a long-term factor, not a short-term one. 4) Opening up to the outside world is a basic state policy. Opening up means to join the world market and participate in international market competition. This itself provides China with a favorable condition to promote its own economic development on an even broader scale. There are two unfavorable factors: 1) Pressure from the inflation. After the macro-control was strengthened in 1993, the commodity price was still quite high, although the rate of price increases started to level off. This was the third year in which prices had sharply increased. It would surely affect this year, and it cannot be eliminated within a short period. 2) Risks in carrying out reform. This year is a year in which we would quicken our tempo in promoting the reform program. Reform is a factor in supporting quick economic growth. At the same time, there is also the issue of cost and risk in carrying out reform. This issue is mainly manifested in the following aspects: On the one hand, the new round of reform differs in nature from the previous round of reform of expanding authority and transferring profits. The previous round of reform had the nature of "giving some benefits to others." All sectors may see immediate benefits in the course of carrying out such reform. However, the new round of reform is mainly a macro-economic reform aimed at blazing a new trail by means of the system. Within a short period of time, this round of reform would tend to increase the burdens of all sectors. In order to protect their vested interests, various sectors will hesitate to carry out such reform wholeheartedly. According to a survey conducted by us recently, various sectors are taking counter-measures to keep the losses of their vested benefits to the minimum. Therefore, we must fully realize the difficulties in carrying out this current round of reform and the side effects that we might feel. On the other hand, the new round of reform will be carried out at a time when the government functions have not yet been completely changed, and the government has not yet standardized all its actions taken. If the government fails to carry out its operations and supervise all the departments under its administration in a proper way, some problems left by the old system may crop up once again. This is because efforts are being made to strengthen the role of the government at a time when the government performs its functions irrationally and lacks a good regular system. As a result, things that the government should not control are being controlled, while those that the government should strictly control are not controlled. As a result, the inherent vitality in economic life is destroyed by the government. Under the conditions of market economy, it is necessary to strengthen the macro-control. To exercise the macro-control is an important topic in developing the economy and carrying out reform. However, if the principal body which exercises the macro-control performs its functions irrationally, it may create many negatives effects. This is something which merits our attention.
