In a joint declaration issued in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, they asserted that the implementation of the free trade agreement between Canada, the United States, and Mexico opens the possibility of a tighter relationship between the North, Central, and South American and Caribbean countries. They also noted that the regional integration programs' achievements of the past four years give a new dynamic to the processes that link the economies of our region. A similar dynamic has generated a series of bilateral agreements between the Latin American countries, among which is that signed by the governments of Chile and Colombia in late 1993. The declaration later states that the Chilean and Colombian Governments have expressed their resolute political will to make every possible effort to use this opportunity to materialize the desire for Latin American integration and that it spread to the rest of the hemisphere. In the Chilean and Colombian economy ministers' opinion, free access to the markets will promote competition and, hence, the efficient development of their respective economies. Finally, the two ministers urged the ECLA [Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean] to decidedly support the integration efforts with its technical and analytical expertise.
