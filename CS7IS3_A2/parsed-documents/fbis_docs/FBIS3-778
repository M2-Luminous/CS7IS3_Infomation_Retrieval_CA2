Pienaar] [Text] Durban March 13 SAPA -- The Executive Council of the Conservative Party [CP] in Natal on Sunday [13 March] pledged its support to Freedom Front [FF] leader Gen Constand Viljoen in order to contest the April election. The council's decision follows the resignation last week of CP Natal leader Carl Werth, who also pledged his support to Gen Viljoen's Party. In a statement the council said it had decided at a meeting on Sunday to support the FF. The council is one of the CP's highest policy making bodies in Natal. "Of the ten members of the Executive Council, only one had decided against contesting the election," the statement said. Seven of the members supporting Gen Viljoen are: CP Natal Deputy Chairman Duncan du Bois; Gunther Gathmann, Magriet Torlage, Braam Joubert, Gordon MacGregor, CP Natal Chief Information Officer Roger Whiteley and Neels Fourie. Mr du Bois told SAPA on Sunday night that while the council members have not yet resigned officially from the CP, their membership would lapse. He said the CP has "undoubtedly but regrettably" been given a blow by the council's decision. The CP preoccupation with establishing a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] and nothing else had precipitated the defection as such a volkstaat had limited appeal in Natal, Mr du Bois said. "The fact that the CP of late has seen fit to follow the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front, AVF] direction of a volkstaat and nothing else did not give us a choice." He was reluctant to state that the CP in Natal had become disillusioned with the party's national leadership, only saying the AVF "had distorted the policy of the CP as laid down in the party's constitution of 1991." He added: "We have not deviated from CP policy." Mr du Bois said he was confident that most CP supporters in Natal would follow the council's lead and vote for the Freedom Front. "Generally, as far as Natalians are concerned, we wanted to vote for an anti-National Party, anti-African National Congress front. The Freedom Front affords them the vehicle to do just that." He admitted that "there may be a few disenchanted people going to stick with the Volksfront".
