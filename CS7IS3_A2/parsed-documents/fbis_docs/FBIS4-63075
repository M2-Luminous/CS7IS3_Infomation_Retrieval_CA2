Belarus will be able to preserve its independence only through economic union with Russia. This staunch position was declared by Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich during a visit to Borisov, where he met with residents and the leaders of local enterprises. Speaking to an audience at the Town Center of Culture, Vyachaslaw Kebich assured that, despite various talks on the current government faults, he has a program for pulling the state out of the crisis. In particular, the government will considerably cut down its financial support to unprofitable enterprises. It was recommended that banks stop allotting credits to such entities. The "Law on Bankruptcy" will be applied. The government is going to launch a wide-scale campaign to set up share holding enterprises along with foreign investors. To stop the decrease in the standard of living, the Cabinet of Ministers specified an inventory of goods which will be produced in the Republic in required amounts, irrespective of all economic difficulties. Citing the opinions of foreign experts, Vyachaslaw Kebich said: "If the government manages to realize its plans, Belarusian industry will increase its production as early as 1995." In the opinion of the head of state, similar results could be expected in the agricultural sector. The government will support the financial situation of the agricultural sector by lifting certain taxes. The Cabinet of Ministers plans to lift taxes on real estate, water, subsidiary production, and health care, as well as certain environmental taxes. The government declared its readiness to finance the development of the agrarian social sector. As to the question of if the Cabinet of Ministers supports a collective form of economy, Vyachaslaw Kebich answered that, in his opinion, kolkhozes have not yet used all their reserves and opportunities. "Our position is not to destroy what has not become obsolete." In his talk with Borisov residents, Vyachaslaw Kebich made assurances that the situation in the republican economy would change for the better in the immediate future. The prime minister links this hope with the signing of the monetary merger agreement with Russia. This subject was discussed at his meeting with leaders of "Ekran" Association enterprises, which are currently undergoing conversion. They produce first-class navigational equipment for aircraft and ships. "I strongly support a new confederative union," said Vyachaslaw Kebich. As for economic union with Russia, the prime minister believes that Ukraine -- after holding its presidential elections -- will also support this idea. The Asian republics [of the former USSR] would like to become members, as well. In the opinion of the head of government, a Russian ruble can become legal tender in Belarus in as little as one or two months.
