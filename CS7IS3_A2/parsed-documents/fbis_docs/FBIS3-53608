During the meeting, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani pointed to regional issues, as well as falling world oil prices, as among the most basic issues that warrant cooperation among all Muslim countries, especially Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Iranian president also stressed the need for greater unity and cooperation between Islamic countries. The meeting between the Saudi minister and the Iranian president has attracted the attention of many political observers. Though Iran-Saudi Arabian ties have undergone several ups and downs during recent years, the trend of events of recent months reveal that the two countries' officials, in view of the significance of Iran-Saudi unity and the need for expanding bilateral cooperation, have opened a new phase of bilateral ties with the intention of reinforcing unity among Islamic countries and overcoming the problems of the Muslim world. Iran-Saudi ties basically have wide dimensions, since they are the major oil-producing countries among OPEC members. In connection with oil production, analysts believe cooperation between Iran and Saudi Arabia, with the largest oil and gas reserves in the world, can play a significant role in stabilizing oil prices; so much so that economic experts say the two countries can have a great impact on checking the falling price of oil, stabilizing it on the world market. Besides, the two countries' membership in the Organization of Islamic Conference, the OIC, further reveals the significance of bilateral relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia. This is so because, if the two countries reach a ground for bilateral understanding, their key and effective role in improving the situation of the Muslim ummah [community] will become undeniable. Therefore, under the present conditions, when bloody fighting in some Islamic countries has created a difficult situation, the (?power) of Muslim ummah coordination among the OIC member states, especially Iran and Saudi Arabia, can be of special significance in following up the problems of Muslim nations. It is worth noting that during the meeting, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani welcomed the deepening of ties in the areas of mutual interest, stressing the need for the exchange of economic and political delegations between the two countries to bring the viewpoints of Iran and Saudi Arabia closer. The president said he would send a special envoy to Saudi Arabia soon to hold talks on issues of mutual interest and to present a message to King Fahd in response to the one sent by the Saudi king.
