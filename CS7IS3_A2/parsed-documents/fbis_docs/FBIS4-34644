Jose Miguel Insulza, Chilean deputy minister of foreign relations, reported today that there has been no progress in the talks. The Chilean diplomat said "we have no news, good or bad. The same eight people are still there." He added that the "guests" would be staying indefinitely. He recalled that the Cuban Government has stated that those entering consulates or embassies will not be allowed a visa to leave the country. Meanwhile, the refugees have reaffirmed that they do not plan to leave the Chilean consular building. "The Chilean Government is flexible. It is ready to negotiate with Cuban authorities, to reach certain guarantees with the government and to find a peaceful resolution of the situation," announced Deputy Minister Insulza. He added that the Chilean consulate in Havana is ready to study the requests for emigration to Chile; each of its "guests" may file, provided the Cuban Government allows them to leave. Chile decided to receive the Cuban refugees for "humanitarian reasons." All of the refugees are under 30 years of age, including a woman and a 12 year-old boy. Last month, groups of Cubans entered the Belgian and German embassies in Havana. Chile and Cuba have not shared full diplomatic relations since the 11 September 1973 coup d'etat. Consular relations were reestablished in 1991.
