FBIS4-14538 "drsov063_t_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-063 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 BALTIC STATES Estonia Oil Tank at Base Said Leaking; Access Denied Oil Tank at Base Said Leaking; Access Denied WS3103181394 Tallinn BNS in English 1700 GMT 31 Mar 94 WS3103181394 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Tallinn, Mar 31, BNS -- Up to eight tons of oil have leaked into a nearby ditch from an oil tank in a former Soviet military base on the Viimsi peninsula outside Tallinn. The ditch, measuring about 15 by 3 meters, is covered by a 10-centimeter layer of oil, a spokesman at the Estonian Ministry of Environment said. Work to neutralize the pollution must be started at once, because the leakage both directly threatens the soil, as well as creates the possibility of a later pollution of the underground waters, the spokesman said. Russian military at the base, however, have refused to allow local environment officials examine the site, because the base has not been turned over to Estonia yet. Officials from the local Viimsi commune government, as well as the Harjumaa county authorities have received an answer from the military that access to the territory of the base can be granted only by the leadership of Russia's Baltic Sea Fleet in Kaliningrad. According to information obtained by the Estonian ministry, the fuel tanks at the base are no longer in military use, but have been leased by Petro-N Ltd., a shareholding company closely connected with the company N-Terminaal. Russian military have said they will themselves take care of the results of the leakage. "But it remains unclear how much time this will take and whether also the polluted soil will be removed," the ministry says.
