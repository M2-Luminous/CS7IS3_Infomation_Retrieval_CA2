In an interview with INTERFAX, he said the scheme, as well as the fundamental documents of the North Atlantic alliance, stressed the need to maintain the territorial integrity and security of its member states. A senior source in the Azerbaijani president's staff told INTERFAX the country's participation in the Partnership for Peace does not mean that the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) has exhausted its potential for resolving the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. He said Azerbaijan's commitments under the NATO scheme do not contradict its commitments under the CIS Collective Security Treaty. The source said Azerbaijan is ready to take part in international collective security systems that can preserve its territorial integrity and independence and ensure its security. Another top member of the presidential staff, Eldar Namazov, said Azerbaijan's membership in the Partnership for Peace would get NATO involved in efforts to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. "In effect this means more opportunities for a political settlement of the conflict," he said.
