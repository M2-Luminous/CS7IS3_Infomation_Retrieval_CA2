What can they expect from the forthcoming summit? [Woerner] Two things that lead in this direction: First, a declaration of principle that we are willing to accept new members in an evolutionary process, without giving a specific deadline or criteria for that; second, a very specific offer -- Partnership for Peace, which is close political and military cooperation agreed on between the respective state and NATO. [Van Kampen] In particular the Poles say: This is not enough for us. We want a specific date so as to have our security interests safeguarded. [Woerner] I do not think that such a decision will be made at the summit. For that we still need some time. However, one can see this offer of Partnership for Peace as a first step for some of these states on the path toward membership. [Van Kampen] But is there still time for that after the election success of right-wing extremist Zhirinovskiy in Russia? [Woerner] I think there is still time. There is no question that, of course, Russia's behavior will influence the decisions of this alliance in the future and, to a certain extent, also the speed with which this process will take place. [Van Kampen] Is there not too much consideration for Russia's interests? Does this not practically mean that Russia has a veto right? [Woerner] Quite the contrary. We do not give anyone a veto right -- not the Russians, either. However, it is clear that we do not make this decision in the abstract sense but in a very specific security situation and in view of two big historical changes -- first, building a new security architecture for all of Europe, together with the Russians and not against the Russians. This is an important international goal, which is also in the interest of the East Europeans. Second, anchoring the East Europeans -- at least those that belong to the West -- firmly in the structures of the West. [Van Kampen] Are you afraid that a speedy expansion of NATO toward the east might weaken the alliance? [Woerner] If this were done precipitately, and if one were to take in too many new members all at once, this would indeed be a consequence. However, no one wants this. This will be a gradual process so that the Alliance's ability to make decisions is not endangered. [Van Kampen] Well, there are voices that the enemy image from the East has vanished -- let us be honest and, perhaps, dissolve NATO entirely. [Woerner] I can only say that NATO is now more popular than ever. We have a number of states that want to join NATO, because NATO is the one decisive factor of stability that currently exists in the world. In a time of increasing instability one does not dissolve the only stable element. On the contrary, NATO is gaining additional weight. [Van Kampen] What will NATO look like in the year 2000? Which role will it play? [Woerner] I think that it will then, hopefully, be the anchor of stability of a comprehensive Euro-Atlantic security system. I think that it will deal even more intensively than hitherto with crisis settlement. Of course, it will continue to fulfill one task: ensuring the safety of its member states and this means safeguarding peace.
