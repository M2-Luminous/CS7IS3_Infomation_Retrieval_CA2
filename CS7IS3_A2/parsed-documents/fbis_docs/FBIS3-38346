He first set out the priorities of Greece's Council Presidency, in conformity with the programs already analyzed by EUROPE and stressing the importance of an in-depth debate in all member states on the guidelines of the White Paper by the European Commission. It is then that, answering questions from MEPs [member of European Parliament], he took the aforementioned stances. Here is what he had to say, according to the report put out by Parliament: (1) Convergence criteria. Asked by Mr. Fourcans (France) about a possible revision, Mr. Simitis said that there was no revision procedure going on, but these criteria are being discussed and "some have already said that they were possibly excessive and that they aimed at a goal which would have as consequence limiting economic activity (...). The Community institutions must follow the debate, hear the criticisms and in their actions include the results of the discussion" so as to be able, should it prove necessary, to revise their position; (2) Industrial policy. According to Mr. Simitis, such a policy is "necessary as we cannot simply count on the market mechanisms. The role of the Community is not simply to be an observer, it has to intervene and set out the guidelines." Over restructuring the steel industry, he confirmed that the private sector would meet the Commission in February and should then announce commitments to closures.
