Discussion during the telephone contact dealt with the situation in the Yemeni arena. Shaykh Zayid reiterated the UAE's pressing desire for a cease-fire, pointing out that it is regrettable that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih still insists on pursuing the fighting in spite of the recurrent sincere calls his highness has addressed to his excellency since the very first moment of the war of brothers. His highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan further said during the telephone contact: I have repeatedly appealed to the Yemeni president. I have exerted all possible effort to immediately stop firing. We have said we are ready to pursue mediation efforts in Yemen with every means we have to sincerely and loyally reconcile the brothers so Yemen remains stable and so differences among them will be submitted to the fraternal Yemeni people whom will decide on them and have their final say, instead of this recourse to arms. The Yemeni people are a free people like all others, and their fate does not belong to anyone. He added: The Yemeni people know where their real interest lies and their happiness and stability are the objectives that all should seek. From his part, the Yemeni vice president called on the head of state in the telephone contact to pursue with his well-known wisdom his persistent efforts with his brother Arab leaders to stop the raging battles and the bloody war and to resort to fraternal dialogue to reach a political solution to the crisis out of concern for the safety of Yemeni citizens and to safeguard national unity. The Yemeni vice chairman added: Why this shedding of blood and the fighting among the sons of the one people for one or two persons? Has the aggression against the south come from an enemy of the Yemeni people? It is inconceivable that a dialogue be held between the two parties while the fighting continues. No side can be attacked and remain idle and accept the imposition of a solution on it. The language of force and the military method in settling differences is rejected and portends dire consequences. The homeland's interest should be given priority over any other interest.
