King Norodom Sihanouk's Visit to Pyongyang" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today carries an editorial warmly welcoming His Majesty [H.M.] King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia due here today for an official goodwill visit to Korea at the invitation of President Kim Il-song of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. His visit will mark another important milestone in developing Korea-Cambodia friendship to a new, higher stage, the editorial says, and goes on: He began visiting Pyongyang from 1960s. And this visit continues in the 90s through the 70s and the 80s. His current visit reflects his deepest respect for the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and fully demonstrates the close friendly and cooperation relations established between the Korean and Cambodian peoples. It is also another expression of solidarity with the Korean people, who are defending and developing socialism, while smashing the anti-socialist, anti-DPRK moves of the imperialists and the international reactionaries. The many positive changes which have taken place in the political developments of Cambodia in recent years are unthinkable apart from the experienced leadership and patriotic spirit of H.M. King Norodom Sihanouk, an outstanding patriot produced by the Khmer nation. He is still making energetic efforts to build the Kingdom of Cambodia, sovereign, independent, peaceful, permanently neutral and non-aligned. The editorial continues: The Korean people are rejoiced as over their own over the achievements made by the H.M. King Norodom Sihanouk, the royal government and the people in the efforts to achieve the stability of the country and the reconciliation and unity of the nation and build an independent and prospering new Cambodia and express full support and firm solidarity for their just cause. To constantly consolidate and develop Korea-Cambodia friendship is the unanimous desire of the two peoples. The Korean people are pleased to have such true-hearted friends as the Cambodian people and make strenuous efforts to strengthen and develop the friendly and cooperation relations with them.
