SACOB welcomed the reduction in the standard corporate tax rate, the removal of certain import surcharges and the maintaining of the value added tax (VAT) rate, saying these would encourage economic growth. "Given the extraordinary increase in expenditure directly linked to the transition, the Minister (of Finance Mr Derek Keys) has been bold in dealing with the matter directly." SACOB said the appointment of a commission of inquiry into taxation avoided immediate tax decisions and prolonged uncertainty about a future tax regime. "It is to be regretted that the overall effect of the tax changes has been to increase the burden on individuals at a time when personal savings are still at a low level and the effect of budget creep on individuals has not been addressed."
