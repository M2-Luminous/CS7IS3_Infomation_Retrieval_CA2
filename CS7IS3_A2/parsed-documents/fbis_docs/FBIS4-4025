Speaking at a news conference, Li said he had "comprehensive and in-depth" exchange of views with leaders of the four countries -- Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan -- on bilateral, regional and international issues. "We reached agreement on a wide range of issues and found many common points," Li said. "As far as I know," he said, "the four basic principles and six- point proposition I stated for developing relations, including economic cooperation, with the Central Asian nations, have won good response from leaders and people of all circles in the four countries." "We all hope to remain good neighbors and friends forever," he added. In particular, Li noted, the signing of the Sino-Kazakhstan border agreement defined the boundary in a legal form, saying he expected the boundary to be one of "lasting peace and friendship." He also said that the visit has achieved substantial results in the economic field, for the top trade officials and entrepreneurs traveling with him came into wide contact and signed a range of agreements, contracts or letters of intent with local business circles. In this respect, he said the agreement reached between communications departments of China and Kazakhstan on developing international railway transportation is "a specially important achievement." Before long, he added, "We will invite relevant countries, including Russia, Kyrghyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, to further discuss the issue to ensure smooth traffic and make full use of the new silk road." The Chinese premier, referring to the Sino-Kazakhstan border trade issue, said that the selling of shoddy or even fake products by some Chinese businessmen, mostly private, run against the Chinese Government's policy in this regard. "We are ready to work with the Government of Kazakhstan to draw up relevant measures so as to reduce the negative effect," he said, adding that large corporations of the two countries should form the "main channel" of bilateral trade. Asked to elaborate on talks with President Nursultan Nazarbayev, Li again voiced appreciation for Kazakhstan Government's position on adhering to the "One China" policy with regard to the Taiwan and Tibet issues, on not allowing elements of "East Turkstan" to undertake activities against China here and on opposing national separatism in general. Also, he said, "We support and appreciate President Nazarbayev's efforts to safeguard peace and security in Asia." The Chinese premier also stated China's position on nuclear test ban and talked about Sino-Russian relations. Li arrived here Monday [25 April] on the last leg of the 10-day Central Asia tour, which is to end Thursday.
