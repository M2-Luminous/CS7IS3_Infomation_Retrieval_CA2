As Clinton decided last year, China will only keep the trade privilege if it makes clear progress in respecting human rights. Secretary of State Christopher will come to Beijing on Friday [11 March] to point that out. If the U.S. President deprived the PRC of most-favored-nation status, this would badly hurt the Chinese economy. More than one-third of China's exports goes to the United States. The U.S. market is so important for the Chinese that it has recently been possible to wrest significant trade policy concessions from them. On the issue of human rights, however, only a few concessions have been made. The latest arrests of prominent dissidents and the new religious laws shortly before Christopher's visit and the session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva have the affect of a provocation. Beijing has rejected reproaches from Western governments and accusations from human rights organizations. It rejects a combination of trade and human rights questions as interference in its internal affairs. The Chinese Government refers to cultural differences and says that other standards have to be applied in a developing country than in industrial states. At the same time, it uses the attraction of the big Chinese market to canvass for the most-favored-nation status. If China is deprived of most-favored-nation status, the U.S. economy will be hit more than that of China, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji recently claimed in Japan. The most important demands of the U.S. President are: freedom to leave the country and prevention of the export of goods produced in prisons; access to political prisoners and information on them; permitting foreign radio and television programs in China; respect for Tibet's cultural and religious heritage. For the communist leadership it is a matter of national "image" that one must not give in to U.S. pressure and tolerate interference. Opinions on the extent of minor concessions regarding human rights are divided. This conclusion can be drawn from the present to-and-fro regarding arrests, releases, statements, and denials. While party leaders who are prepared for reforms are in favor of releasing selected dissidents and other gestures of goodwill, the conservatives take action against dissidents. However, the behavior of the government can also be explained by domestic policy pressure. China is facing a change in leadership. Judging from the latest pictures, old Deng Xiaoping is no longer able to determine policies. One believes that his days are numbered. In the critical transition period, differences of opinion within the party are hushed up according to the old-communist pattern to present a picture of unity to the outside. At the same time, it is intended to prevent opposition right from the start. In the party leadership, which fears every political movement in China, however small it may be, there is a general nervousness that goes beyond parliamentary groups. The three arrested dissidents had planned to send a petition to the National People's Congress in which they advocated, above all, workers' rights. When they were arrested, signatures for the petition were collected. So far, it has not become known whether the arrests are only connected with the petition or whether the three men whose arrests were confirmed by the Chinese Government are also accused of other things. The petition does not make any revolutionary demands. The activists are saying that they are not doing anything that violates Chinese laws. However, the party leadership points out that in 1989 the protests also started with open letters and a petition at the time of the convention of the National People's Congress. One month later, the students were demonstrating in the streets of Beijing. It is unlikely that a political movement might currently meet with such a response. However, the party does not want to take any risk. Then considerations regarding international repercussions of oppression recede into the background. Moreover, the Chinese Government doubts the U.S. determination to really push through their conditions. China knows that there is a strong economic lobby in the United States that advocates the prolongation of most-favored-nation status. The U.S. Government also gives different signals. While the human rights commissioner discussed political oppression in Beijing last week, an envoy of the U.S. Department of Commerce tried at the same time to procure Chinese orders valued at billions [currency not specified] for the U.S. economy.
