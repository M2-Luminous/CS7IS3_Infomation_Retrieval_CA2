The newspaper also issued apologies to Havana, the prelate, and its readership. [see item PA1803032994 in 22 March Terrorism Report] After comparing and determining the credibility and authenticity of its source that prompted reports on an alleged trip to Cuba by Bishop Nel Beltran and a guerrilla summit being held on the island, EL TIEMPO decided to retract the report and apologize to the bishop and the Cuban Government. The two-page apology published in Section 1 of the newspaper says, ``it was the victim of an ill-intentioned machination, the intellectual origins and objectives of which have yet to be determined.'' The newspaper was referring to evidence alleging that a Colombian guerrilla summit took place in Cuba in January and in which Beltran participated. Reports on the alleged summit were published several days running, beginning on 10 March. With respect to the summit, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff also said he possessed ``irrefutable evidence,'' which EL TIEMPO itself indicated ``contributed to the disinformation.'' The newspaper acknowledges the falsity of the reports, ``despite the apparent accuracy of the information handed over by the initial source, confirmation by a reliable second source, and a state security agency's intelligence report that had been disclosed by a high-ranking government official.'' EL TIEMPO also claims it relied on ``an endorsement from the Prosecutor General's Office.'' It adds: ``By not contacting Bishop Nel Beltran, regardless of how difficult it may have been, Chief Editor Francisco Santos authorized the publication of the report without first subjecting it to essential screening to determine its accuracy.'' The apology also indicates that ``the aggressiveness in what is known in journalistic circles as `fast breaking news' prompted this newspaper, its chief editor, and, in particular, its Legal Editor Edgar Torres to make erroneous decisions that ultimately led to the publication of false reports and subsequent recurrent reports on the same issue, which today we proceed to rectify.'' The Santa Fe de Bogota paper adds: ``This, however, does not excuse the mistake, because by way of professional and sincere screening, as well as by meeting with those individuals mentioned in the report, we would have unmasked the source and avoided publishing misleading reports.'' The Cuban Government, its embassy in Santa Fe de Bogota, and some of the highest-ranking Colombian authorities had repeatedly denied the disclosures. Nevertheless, in light of certain evidence gathered by the Prosecutor General's Office, the Colombian Government decided to request an explanation from the Cuban Government. Sources hostile to Cuba tried to take advantage of the election campaign in Colombia and even suggested breaking off diplomatic relations with Cuba, which were fully restored in October. In explaining the incident, EL TIEMPO claims its source was a person who had been a former guerrilla member, an associate of Pablo Escobar (the slain chief of the Medellin drug cartel), and had served as an informant for state intelligence services. It adds that this source has now admitted he manipulated the newspaper, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Colombian Government. EL TIEMPO notes that as a result of the incident, the legal editor has presented his letter of resignation and the newspaper's Board of Directors is reviewing possible disciplinary measures. Meanwhile, the chief editor also presented his resignation, and EL TIEMPO says that in due time it will disclose its decision on the matter. In summarizing its correction, which it describes as significant and unusual, EL TIEMPO points out that ``the big question now is who manipulated the former guerrilla, and who is the person or persons who masterminded this -- the real intellectual mastermind behind this manipulation of information?''
