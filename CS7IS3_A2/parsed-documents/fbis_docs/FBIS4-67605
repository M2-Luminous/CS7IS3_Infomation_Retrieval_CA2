Q: How does the cancer incidence in Bulgaria compare to European rates? A: Bulgaria ranks in the medium range of cancer incidence, according to figures released by the Epidemiology Unit of the National Oncology Centre, which are also reported to the World Health Organization. Q: Where does cancer stand among the major causes of early death and disability? A: It ranks second after heart disease. Q: Is cancer incidence in Bulgaria on the increase? A: There is an upward trend worldwide and Bulgaria is no exception. I will quote again figures provided by our (epidemiology) unit. In 1985, 20,881 developed cancer, bringing the total number of cancer patients to 132,374. The 1990 figures are 22,021 and 153,651, respectively. In 1992, 22,956 Bulgarians developed cancer, bringing the total to 139,243. Q: Which types of cancer are the most widespread in Bulgaria? A: According to statistics, lung cancer ranks first, followed by breast, stomach, rectal and colon cancer. Men are mostly affected by lung cancer. Other widespread types of cancer in men are stomach, rectal, prostatic and colon cancer. Women suffer most often from breast cancer, as well as from cervical and ovarian cancer. Q: Is cancer diagnosed early in Bulgaria? A: Comparing Bulgaria to the developed countries, there is a lot to be desired in this respect. It is alarming that in recent years we have witnessed a retreat. In 1990, 52.99 percent of patients were diagnosed early. In 1992 their proportion was 48.58 percent. Q: Is cancer screening done now? A: There used to be two mass screening programmes for a long time. Fluorography, that is, screening for growths in the chest and mainly in the lungs, is no longer done as the method was rejected. Starting from 1956, all sexually active women were invited to be screened for cervical cancer. In 1971 the smear (Pap) test was introduced. Over 1.5 million women used to be tested every year, as a result of which many were treated for conditions that might otherwise have developed into cancer, or cancer was diagnosed early and treatment was much easier and more effective. It is a pity that screening has not been done since 1990.
