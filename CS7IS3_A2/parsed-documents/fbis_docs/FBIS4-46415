From time to time they hear the sounds of bombs or of Israeli reconnaissance planes, which usually precede air raids. This is when they rush to shelters and safe rooms. [passage omitted] It has been learned that Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri and Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah have held a telephone conversation in which the need for containing the situation and depriving Israel of any pretexts to perpetrate new acts of aggression was stressed. It was also learned that similar contacts were held between Syrian officials and the Hizballah leadership. But, according to fundamentalist sources, the resistance will continue its operations and a response to the raid near Ba'labakk last week must be expected. The sources said the visit to Lebanon by Iranian envoy Kazem Khonsari and his meetings with Lebanese officials and with resistance leaders came as support for the resistance, not to ask it to calm the situation and refrain from reacting, as the Lebanese papers reported today.
