FR940128-2-00093 FR940128-2-00059 [Docket No. CP91&hyph;2778&hyph;001] Valero Transmission, L.P.; Petition to Amend January 24, 1994. Take notice that on January 11, 1994, Valero Transmission, L.P. (Valero), P.O. Box 500, San Antonio, Texas 78215, filed an application in Docket No. CP91&hyph;2778&hyph;001, pursuant to Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), 15 U.S.C. 717b, part 153 of the Commission's Regulations, Executive Order Nos. 10485 and 12038, and the Secretary of Energy's Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;112. Valero seeks to amend its Presidential Permit and prior authorizations granted in Docket No. CP91&hyph;2778&hyph;000 1 to permit the use of its existing facilities at the United States-Mexico Border for the importation, as well as exportation of natural gas. Valero's request is more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 1‚ê£ Valero states that the facilities are currently being used to export natural gas to Mexico. Valero states that the opening-up of these facilities to a two-way gas trade will provide needed flexibility to respond to changing market conditions. Valero indicates that its border facilities will be available on an ``open-access'' basis to any shipper/supplier with authorization from the Department of Energy (DOE) to import or export natural gas from or to Mexico. Finally, Valero states that the switch to two-way gas trade will not require the construction of any additional facilities. Therefore, there will be no adverse environmental impact associated with the approval of its application. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition to amend should on or before February 7, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 384.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1796 Filed 1&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
