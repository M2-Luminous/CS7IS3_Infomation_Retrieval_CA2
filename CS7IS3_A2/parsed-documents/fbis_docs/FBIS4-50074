Economic experts point out that if this treatment is withdrawn, it goes without saying that both China and the United States will suffer losses. However, those who will really suffer most will be the Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign investors who have set up production bases on the mainland. That is why these experts predict that if the United States genuinely has its eyes on a development strategy in the Asia region, it will certainly not revoke China's MFN status rashly. Dr. Chen Wen-hung, director of the China Business Center at the Hong Kong Polytechnic, told this reporter that the trade dispute between China and the United States is, in the final analysis, a trade balance issue. However, the principal beneficiary is not China, but foreign investors who open factories on the mainland and export their products to the United States using the mainland's export quotas. Most of them are manufacturers from Hong Kong and Taiwan. According to the press, the net export value of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other foreign-invested enterprises increased substantially by 45 percent in 1993, which accounted for nearly 28 percent of the country's total export value. It is anticipated that this proportion will rise to 40 percent this year. Chen Wen-hung pointed out that China's export growth last year was basically achieved by relying on foreign-invested enterprises. Hence, he believes that if China loses its MFN status, Hong Kong and Taiwan investors will suffer most. According to a World Bank estimate, if the United States revokes MFN status for China, the volume of Chinese manufactured goods exported to the United States will fall by 25 to 50 percent. These are mostly goods produced in mainland China by Hong Kong and Taiwan manufacturers. A report from the Hong Kong Trade Department shows that, under these circumstances, China's re-export volume to the United States through Hong Kong will fall by 33 to 46 percent, and Hong Kong profits amounting to $2.4 to $3.4 billion will be lost. As a result, Hong Kong's economic growth rate, which has previously been estimated at 5 percent, will be reduced by 2.2 percentage points to 3 percent. According to an analysis of Tang Ying-yen, vice chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, calculated on a per-capita basis, Hong Kong will sustain the heaviest blow. As regards Taiwan, according to Taiwan customs statistics, the proportion of re-export trade between both sides of the strait in terms of Taiwan's total foreign trade has risen by 2 percent annually in recent years. Li Chien, managing director of the Hong Kong Taipei Trade Center, said that most of re-export goods were industrial raw materials, components, accessories, and so on, a considerable proportion of which are re-exported to foreign countries after being processed in mainland China. Among the 100 largest enterprise groups in Taiwan, nearly 60 of have invested or plan to invest in the mainland. In view of the extremely serious impact on Hong Kong and Taiwan because of the issue of China's MFN status, relevant experts believe that in consideration of political and economic factors, the United States, which has shifted its strategic focus to Asia, will certainly not revoke China's MFN status rashly.
