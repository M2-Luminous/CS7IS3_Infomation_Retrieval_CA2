In an interview with ITAR-TASS Ustinov expressed concern over the notorious ultimatum made by NATO countries, saying that the use of force against Bosnian Serbs cannot bring military operations in former Yugoslavia to an end. "There is a threat that air-strikes on Serbian positions around Sarajevo might be followed by intervention of NATO troops into Bosnia," Ustinov said. Ustinov believes that in order to prevent the conflict from being raised to a higher level of confrontation all peace-keeping forces should be withdrawn from Bosnia and Herzegovina and "former Yugoslavia should be given a chance to resolve its problems itself." According to Ustinov, the Duma Committee for Issues of Geopolitics is scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss the Balkan crisis.
