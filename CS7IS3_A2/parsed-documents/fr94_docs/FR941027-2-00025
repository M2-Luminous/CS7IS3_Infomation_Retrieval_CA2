FR941027-2-00025 FR941027-2-00013 (1) (Draft) Environmental Assessment for Sludge Stabilization at the Plutonium Finishing Plant, Hanford Site, Richland, Washington, DOE/EA&hyph;0978, draft dated September 1994. This draft environmental assessment evaluates a proposed interim action at the PFP to heat-stabilize, and then store, chemically-reactive, plutonium-bearing sludge from certain unshielded gloveboxes, to allay immediate safety concerns. A draft Environmental Assessment was sent to the affected States and Indian Nations for review on September 20, 1994. (2) Final Environmental Impact Statement for Disposal of Hanford Defense High-Level Transuranic and Tank Wastes, Hanford Site, Richland, Washington, DOE/EIS&hyph;0113, December 1987. U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, D.C. This EIS analyzed the impacts of disposal of Hanford defense wastes. (3) Final Environmental Statement for Waste Management Operations, Hanford Reservation, Richland, Washington, ERDA&hyph;1538, 1975. U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration, Washington, D.C. This EIS analyzed the environmental impacts of Hanford Site waste management operations. (4) Hanford Remedial Action-Environmental Impact Statement (HRA&hyph;EIS). The HRA&hyph;EIS will assess the potential environmental consequences of alternatives for conducting a remedial action program at the Hanford Site for inactive hazardous, low-level radioactive, transuranic, and mixed-waste sites. DOE published a NOI to prepare the HRA&hyph;EIS on August 21, 1992 (47 FR 37959&hyph;37964). (5) Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for Environmental Restoration and Waste Management (EM&hyph;PEIS). The EM&hyph;PEIS will address waste management alternatives for existing and proposed actions and DOE complex-wide issues associated with long-term waste management policies and practices. In this Programmatic EIS, the Department is evaluating the Hanford Site as an alternative site for managing DOE wastes. An Implementation Plan for this Programmatic EIS was issued in January 1994. The final Programmatic EIS is scheduled to be issued in October 1995. (6) DOE Nuclear Weapons Complex Reconfiguration Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement. On July 23, 1993, the Department published a revised Notice of Intent (56 FR 39528) to prepare a Programmatic EIS for reconfiguration of its nuclear weapons complex due to nuclear weapons stockpile reductions. The Department currently is considering how the scope of this Programmatic EIS should be revised further to reflect more recent budget and stockpile reduction decisions. (7) Tank Waste Remediation System Environmental Impact Statement (TWRS&hyph;EIS) and Safe Interim Storage (SIS) Environmental Impact Statement. The NOI for these two EISs was published on January 27, 1994. Scoping meetings for the EISs were held simultaneously in five public meetings. The SIS Draft EIS was issued in July 1994. The TWRS&hyph;EIS is in early stages of preparation. (8) Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for Long Term Storage and Disposition of Weapons-Usable Fissile Material. The NOI for this PEIS was published on June 21, 1994. This PEIS will evaluate alternatives for long-term storage of all weapons-usable fissile materials and the disposition of surplus weapons-usable fissile materials declared surplus to national defense needs by the President. Public scoping workshops were held during August, September and October 1994. Issued in Washington, D.C., on this 21st day of October, 1994. Peter N. Brush, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Environment, Safety and Health. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26668 Filed 10&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
