The mini exodus of mostly white South Africans began at the weekend and resort hotels are still full. "We will return only when the peace situation has improved," said Ms Marie Potgieter of Louis Trichardt, in the northern Transvaal. Ms Potgieter, who had set up a tent in Harare's Coronation Park camp site said: "Life is more important than the franchise." At the weekend, usually vacant campsites north of Beit Bridge sprung up into small towns, with scores of large caravans and multi- coloured tents. "We're bursting at the seams and it's mostly South Africans who want to get away from the tension," said Ms Noreena Ellwell, manager of Goodwood Hotels, which owns hotels on the main road to the northern border and at Kariba. Zimbabwean homes are also filling up as South African relatives and friends arrive. "I've got five families with me. At three meals a day, they're eating me out of house and home, and I've got them until well after the election," a white Harare butchery manageress said. The South African trade mission to Zimbabwe has made arrangements for residents to vote in Harare and Bulawayo. A curio dealer in Masvingo said a group of South Africans had parked their vehicles in a circle at the Mutirikwi National Park. "There are a circle of tents inside the ring of vehicles and a large fire in the middle. It's so strange, they've gone into laager, using fancy caravans instead of covered wagons. And to think 14 years ago it was the Rhodesians going in the other direction when (President Robert) Mugabe came to power."
