UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Kris Janowski told reporters of several cases of rape and murder since January. He said that despite reports that some of the attacks were carried out by "uniformed" men, none of the cases had ever been followed up by the authorities. "Everybody's wearing pretty much the same kind of uniform. We understand that they are either part of some sort of militia or Serb military or whoever," he said of the perpetrators. He said the authorities told the UNHCR "all the time" that they had nothing to do with the attacks which were allegedly being done by criminals. "But none of these cases has ever been followed and no one has ever been punished so we assume that this is all done with the knowledge and at least the silent consent of the authorities. Otherwise they would do something to stop it." Janowski said "at least five persons have been murdered since the beginning of January in Banja Luka" but he did not give details. He added that there were "countless cases of people being beaten up and intimidated, the Moslem neighborhood raided by uniformed gangs... trying to give them the message to get out" and that this had "been going on for quite a while." He cited the case of 200 Moslems who had fled the village of Bronzani Majdan, not far from Banja Luka, and asked the UNHCR to get them out of the country. [passage omitted] "We are trying to monitor the situation but it is very difficult," Janowski said.
