At its headquarters in Montevideo, the organization is hosting meetings of tobacco industry workers from Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries and Chile. They want a master agreement on labor relations. The universities and media of these countries also are approaching each other. There are possibilities for concerted action by and consolidation of Mercosur and the Andean Pact. Antunes said that negotiations also have their crises. He did not rule out the possibility that subregional groups may in the future have a preferential relation with the United States and countries outside the region. The LAIA Council of Ministers has decided to draw up a program of action seeking to coordinate the Andean Group, Mercosur, and the various bilateral and multilateral agreements. The idea is to make those agreements lead to a Latin American common market. In this regard, the proposal for the creation of a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA), which was raised by Brazil and has been endorsed by Mercosur countries, is a major contribution, Antunes said. In August, LAIA will have to make suggestions for this higher integration phase that its members are looking for. To this end, it will need a set of commercial regulations with antidumping, origin, and customs rules. "That is the initial step," Antunes said. The organization also is working to define rules for transportation and for new subjects like the sale of services, intellectual property, and capital movements. Mexico itself, which usually has criticized LAIA, believes the organization is modernizing, as Mexico's main NAFTA negotiator, Herminio Blanco, admitted a few days ago in London during a seminar on relations between the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and Latin America, Brazilian diplomatic sources said. The protocol that interprets Article 44 and the program of action have meant a qualitative step forward for LAIA, Antunes said. LAIA, he said, is on its way to becoming a regional GATT. The organization will create a labor council, promote a second meeting on consumer rights, and continue its business talks, encouraging major entrepreneurs of signatory countries to invest in smaller countries in order to export to their own countries. Antunes' conclusion is that the expansion of commerce produces the need for integration and instruments for regulating commerce, like fair competition rules. Mexico itself, which requested a solution for its problem within LAIA -- because it is also a NAFTA member -- is negotiating bilateral and regional free trade agreements with several countries, expecting its profits to surpass the compensation it will have to offer. Greece and South Africa have asked to be accepted as observers to LAIA. China is in the final stage of the process of being accepted as an observer, while Romania already has been granted the status of observer. Antunes said LAIA is trying to negotiate the status of observers in exchange for cooperation agreements with the observer countries, thus guaranteeing the future possibility of signing trade accords with LAIA members.
