FR940328-1-00046 FR940328-1-00021 48 CFR Parts 47 and 52 [FAR Case 88&hyph;56] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Commercial Bills of Lading Under Cost-Reimbursement Contracts Audit by the General Services Administration AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DoD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC) and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (DARC) are considering a proposed rule which amends the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) by adding a new clause entitled, ``Submission of Commercial Transportation Bills to the General Services Administration for Audit'', and a clause prescription. The amendment clarifies procedures governing submission of documentation, payment, and audit of Commercial Bills of Lading (CBL's) under cost-reimbursement contracts. The rule implements the requirements of GSA's Federal Property Management Regulation's (FPMR's) ``Submission of paid freight bills/invoices, commercial bills of lading, passenger coupons, and supporting documentation covering transportation services by contracts under a cost-reimbursement contract.'' This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before May 27, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR Case 88&hyph;56 in all correspondence related to this issue. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Linda Klein at 202&hyph;501&hyph;3775 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC, 20405, 202&hyph;501&hyph;0692. Please cite FAR case 88&hyph;56. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background A proposed rule to add FAR 47.104&hyph;4(c) and a clause at 52.247&hyph;67, initiated by the DARC and subsequently approved by the DARC and the CAAC, was published in the Federal Register with a request for comments (see 53 FR 45742, November 10, 1988). A correction to the proposed rule was published at 54 FR 18558, May 1, 1989. Six responses with substantive comments were received and, as a result, the rule has been revised as follows_ (a) The clause has been renumbered and retitled; (b) Passenger coupons have been added to the submission requirements to parallel the FPMR regulation; (c) The address shown in the clause has been updated; and (d) With GSA's approval, a $50 minimum on the submission of cost reimbursable contractors' freight shipment bills has been added. This $50 minimum does not apply to bills and invoices for any other transportation services. As a result of amending the rule to include a $50 minimum and the requirement to submit passenger coupons, the councils determined that the proposed rule should be republished with a request for further comment. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because the vast majority of contracts held by these entities are not subject to Pub. L. 87&hyph;653 or civilian agency defective pricing rules. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite FAR case 88&hyph;56 in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule is proposed to implement the requirements of GSA's FPMR 101&hyph;41.807&hyph;4, which was published as a final rule on August 14, 1991. Therefore, GSA is considered the agency with primary responsibility for this requirement. A decision was made to issue this FAR requirement under GSA's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance number 3090&hyph;0242, Documentation and Payment of Transportation Bills.
