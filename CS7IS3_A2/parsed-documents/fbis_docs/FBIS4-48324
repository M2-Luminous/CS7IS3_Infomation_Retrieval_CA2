The station has been closed after a prohibition on further transmissions by the Supreme Court. Rev. Mossie van den Berg, chairman of the Executive Committee, had recommended that the station should wait on a final decision from the Independent Broadcasting Authority regarding the issue of a license to the station. According to the station's spokesperson, Commandant Piet le Roux, Rev. van der Berg this morning addressed supporters, and Mr. Manie Maritz, a prominent right-winger, asked to express his views. He asked that a new Executive Committee be elected. A fight broke out. According to Commandant le Roux, the conflict began when Rev. van der Berg instructed that the station be closed down. The opposing faction is now threatening to resume transmissions next week.
