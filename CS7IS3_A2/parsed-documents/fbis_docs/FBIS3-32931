EL DIA said the Guatemalan Government and Army think security in the area should be maintained by the two armies, a purpose for which the Guatemalan Armed Forces have "offered their help." The Mexican newspaper described the Guatemalan military's offer as "unacceptable meddling" and recalled that the Mexican Army rejected the offer because it was a local problem that the Mexicans themselves would solve. Following the offer of assistance, a joint U.S.-Guatemalan military contingent conducted operations under the guise of social projects on the border with Mexico, CERIGUA reported. EL DIA commented that such operations obscure matters and that "at the very least, it can be said that the Guatemalan Government's position is openly unfriendly, a stance that should not be surprising in view of historical realities," CERIGUA concluded. Army spokesperson Edith Vargas de Marroquin rejected EL DIA's charges that the Guatemalan Army had offered assistance to fight the Zapatists. She added that the Mexican Government and Army are capable of solving their sad, delicate problem and have requested no help from the Guatemalan Armed Forces.
