In an interview with DIE WOCHE magazine made available Wednesday [16 February], Butrus-Ghali said: "If NATO gives me a mandate, I can deal with it straight away, as I already have a UN mandate." However, he said that "who exactly gives the green light for air strikes" was not yet fixed. The magazine said that the bulk of the interview was conducted last week in Brussels, but it confirmed details with Butrus-Ghali on Monday and Tuesday -- which was when the Security Council met on the air strikes question. The secretary general said the UN welcomed NATO's February 9 decision to mount airstrikes against Serb artillery if it were not withdrawn to 20 kilometres from Sarajevo city centre or put under UN control within 10 days. According to Butrus-Ghali, the UN had helped bring about the decision. "We confronted NATO with its responsibilities and contributed to its new decisive attitude," he said. In the interview, the secretary general was asked if air strikes could fail to take place because of Russian opposition. He replied that some Security Council members such as Russia had their own interpretation of certain resolutions, seeing a distinction between air support and air strikes. For the moment, he added, the Russian Federation shared the aims of the United States, the European Community, and the UN and was playing an active role in the Geneva talks between the warring parties of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Asked if a lifting of the arms embargo might be more effective than the threat of air strikes, he said any such decision would be for the Security Council to take and so far it had rejected this. Asked his own position on the question, Butrus-Ghali said he would follow the decision of the Council. "I believe the Security Council must assume the responsibility for such an undertaking," he said. He said the UN had not yet established responsibility for the shell which exploded in a Sarajevo market on February 6, killing 68 people and wounding nearly 200, and prompting the NATO air strikes decision. Asked who he believed was mainly responsibility for the continuation of the war in Bosnia, the secretary general blamed not only the warring parties but also UN member states which failed to respond to appeals to send more troops. He primarily blamed the warring parties "but also the international community which is not making the necessary efforts to find a solution."
