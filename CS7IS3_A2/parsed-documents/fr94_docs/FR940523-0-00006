Straus, Senior Immigration Examiner, Adjudications Division, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW., room 7122, Washington, DC 20536, telephone (202) 514&hyph;5014. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background As part of the Immigration Act of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;649, November 29, 1990, Congress created the Employment Creation immigrant visa category under section 203(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act). Section 203(b)(5) of the Act sets aside immigrant visas for aliens seeking to enter the United States for the purpose of engaging in a new commercial enterprise. To qualify under this immigrant visa category, the alien must invest $1,000,000 (or $500,000 in certain targeted areas) and create at least ten full-time jobs. On November 29, 1991, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) issued a final regulation on implementing the provisions of section 203(b)(5) of the Act. Under section 121 of the Immigration Act of 1990 (section 216A of the Act), Congress determined that aliens admitted to the United States under the Employment Creation category as alien entrepreneurs and their spouses and children should be admitted as conditional permanent residents as a means to deter immigration-related entrepreneurship fraud. Section 216A of the Act provides for a two-year conditional resident status for alien entrepreneurs and their spouses and unmarried children. It also provides for termination of status if the Service determines that the qualifying commercial enterprise was improper and sets forth the criteria and procedures for the alien entrepeneur to remove conditional resident status.
