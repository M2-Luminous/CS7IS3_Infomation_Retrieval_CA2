FR940610-2-00035 FR940610-2-00030 [Docket No. CP93&hyph;618&hyph;001] Pacific Gas Transmission Co.; Amendment June 6, 1994. Take notice that on May 31, 1994, Pacific Gas Transmission Company (PGT), 160 Spear Street, San Francisco, California 94105&hyph;1570, filed in Docket No. CP93&hyph;618&hyph;001 an amendment to its application filed on August 5, 1993. The amendment was filed pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA). PGT now seeks a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity authority it to build and operate only two extensions of its mainline facilities and to provide transportation service over those extensions. All other requests in the August 5, 1993, filing have been withdrawn and some of the terms of the service on the extensions have been changed. The two mainline extensions would serve customers in Oregon, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. PGT seeks authorization to construct and operate two pipeline extensions or laterals, along with new metering facilities on the extensions. The first one is the Medford Extension which will begin near PGT's Station 14 at Bonanza, Oregon and interconnect with the facilities of WP Natural Gas (an operating division of The Washington Water Power Company) (WP Natural), at Klamath Falls, Keno and Medford, Oregon. The Medford Extension will be about 86 miles long and will be made of 12-inch pipe. The cost of the Medford Extension is estimated to be $37.9 million in ``as-spent dollars''. PGT proposes to transport 16,400 MMBtu per day on an annual basis and 15,000 MMBTu per day on a winter-only basis for WP Natural over the Medford Extension. The second pipeline extension is the Coyote Springs Extension which will begin at milepost No. 304 on PGT'S mainline (south of Stanfield, Oregon), and connect to Portland General Electric Company's (Portland General) proposed electric generation facility near Boardman, Oregon. The Coyote Springs Extension will be about 18 miles long and will be made of 12-inch pipe. The cost of the Coyote Springs Extension is estimated to be $8.1 million in ``as-spent dollars''. PGT proposes to transport 41,000 MMBtu per day on an annual basis for Portland General over the Coyote Springs Extension. PGT states that WP Natural and Portland General will be responsible for arranging for gas supply and any other related authorizations. PGT will receive gas requested by these shippers at various receipt points, primarily the International Boundary with Canada, and will deliver gas on their behalf at various delivery points also nominated by these shippers. PGT proposes to provide service to WP Natural and Portland General under its existing Part 284 Blanket Certificate. The transportation will be under the terms and conditions of PGT's FTS&hyph;1 rate schedule. PGT will charge WP Natural and Portland General its applicable part 284 rate for the mainline haul and proposes to add surcharges for deliveries on the Medford and Coyote Springs Extensions. Illustrative rates for the proposed Medford and Coyote Springs Extension surcharges are shown in Exhibit P of PGT's amendment. PGT has included an Applicant Prepared Environmental Assessment showing its view of the environmental impacts and mitigation measures for its construction of the Medford and Coyote Springs Extensions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said amendment should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with §§385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before June 27, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14109 Filed 6&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
