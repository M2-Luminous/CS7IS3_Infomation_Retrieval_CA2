FBIS4-36396 "drnes111dd_94010" FBIS-NES-94-111 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Discriminatory Housing Policy in Jerusalem Reported Discriminatory Housing Policy in Jerusalem Reported NC0806132594 Jerusalem AL-QUDS in Arabic 7 Jun 94 pp 1, 18 NC0806132594 Jerusalem AL-QUDS Arabic BFN [Report from Jerusalem] [Text] A report by the Palestinian Information Center on Human Rights, affiliated with the Arab Studies Association, yesterday published statistics on the planning policy and the demolition of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem, as part of the extensive popular plan the center is launching against the demolition policy pursued by the Jerusalem Municipality. The report estimates the number of Palestinian families who lack proper housing in East Jerusalem and who have been forced to live in shelters and tents, or in homes occupied by one or two other families, at 21,000. According to the report, this is the direct result of the authority's policy of demolishing homes and expropriating lands and its discriminatory housing policy that restrict landowners' use of their lands. The center provided documented facts revealing that over 210 Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem have been demolished by the Israeli authorities for reasons related to construction licenses since 1986. The report revealed that 50 Palestinian homes are being demolished in East Jerusalem every year. Of the total area of the city of East Jerusalem, which is 73,000 donums, 29,000 donums have been, or are waiting to be, expropriated soon to build Jewish settlements. Palestinians are allowed to build on 10,000 donums, while 35,000 donums are being left without planning, the report says. According to the report, Palestinians have been licensed to build on 14 percent of East Jerusalem lands, on which Palestinians have already built homes. Buildings in Palestinian neighborhoods cannot exceed two stories, while those in Jewish suburbs rise as high as eight stories. The report notes that Palestinian citizens in Jerusalem pay 26 percent of the cost of services provided by the municipality, although they received only 5 percent of these services. The property taxes ranged from 14 to 39.2 new shekels per square meter in 1994. Illustrating the policy of discrimination against citizens, the report pointed out that the Israeli Government provided subsidized homes for 70,000 Jewish families in the settlements of East Jerusalem alone, against 555 for Palestinian families. The structural plan for Jerusalem reserves over half the area of East Jerusalem for Jewish settlements and institutions. The report cites a sampling study by Dr. Bernard Sabila [name as transliterated], political science lecturer at Bethlehem University, that provided the following estimates of Palestinians who emigrated with their families since 1967: - 16,917 have emigrated to other countries since 1967; - 12,080 moved outside the limits of the municipality; - 12,500 reside in north Jerusalem; and - 7,630 were abroad prior to 1967 and accordingly never obtained Jerusalem identity cards.
