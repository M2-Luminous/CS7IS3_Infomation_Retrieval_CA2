In reply to a deputy's question, Longuet said that "Defense Minister Francois Leotard himself will present the extent" of the scaleback, "which will in no way affect the activities of the Marignane and Courneuve companies." "The export success and civil potential of the helicopter--since it has transport potential--will make it possible to support the project," in Longuet's opinion. The minister described the program as an "absolute duty," "both for its military users, the army and navy, and for Eurocopter company." Minister Longuet pointed out that the program was costing France 4.7 billion French francs [Fr]. French orders for 220 helicopters (160 for the army, 60 for the navy) would probably run up a bill of nearly Fr50 billion. The French market represents 40 percent of Eurocopter's future workload. The NH90 helicopter is being developed in partnership with Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy. The development contract was signed in 1992. The 1995-2000 military appropriations bill, which was recently submitted to the French head of state, favors equipment under manufacture at the expense of programs under study or development (prototype construction stage), such as the NH90.
