Inspections Fees as specified in appropriate fee categories in this section. 1 Types of fees_ Separate charges, as shown in the schedule, will be assessed for preapplication consultations and reviews and applications for new licenses and approvals, issuance of new licenses and approvals, amendments and renewals to existing licenses and approvals, safety evaluations of sealed sources and devices, and inspections. The following guidelines apply to these charges: (a) Application fees_ Applications for new materials licenses and approvals; applications to reinstate expired, terminated or inactive licenses and approvals except those subject to fees assessed at full cost; and applications filed by Agreement State licensees to register under the general license provisions of 10 CFR 150.20, must be accompanied by the prescribed application fee for each category, except that: (1) applications for licenses covering more than one fee category of special nuclear material or source material must be accompanied by the prescribed application fee for the highest fee category; and (2) applications for licenses under Category 1E must be accompanied by an application fee of $125,000. (b) License/approval/review fees_ Fees for applications for new licenses and approvals and for preapplication consultations and reviews subject to full cost fees (fee Categories 1A, 1B, 1E, 2A, 4A, 5B, 10A, 11, 12, 13A, and 14) are due upon notification by the Commission in accordance with §170.12 (b), (e), and (f). (c) Renewal/reapproval fees_ Applications for renewal of licenses and approvals must be accompanied by the prescribed renewal fee for each category, except that fees for applications for renewal of licenses and approvals subject to full cost fees (fee Categories 1A, 1B, 1E, 2A, 4A, 5B, 10A, 11, 12, 13A, and 14) are due upon notification by the Commission in accordance with §170.12(d). (d) Amendment/Revision Fees_ (1) Applications for amendments to licenses and approvals and revisions to reciprocity initial applications, except those subject to fees assessed at full costs, must be accompanied by the prescribed amendment/revision fee for each license/revision affected. An application for an amendment to a license or approval classified in more than one fee category must be accompanied by the prescribed amendment fee for the category affected by the amendment unless the amendment is applicable to two or more fee categories in which case the amendment fee for the highest fee category would apply. For those licenses and approvals subject to full costs (fee Categories 1A, 1B, 1E, 2A, 4A, 5B, 10A, 11, 12, 13A, and 14), amendment fees are due upon notification by the Commission in accordance with §170.12(c). (2) An application for amendment to a materials license or approval that would place the license or approval in a higher fee category or add a new fee category must be accompanied by the prescribed application fee for the new category. (3) An application for amendment to a license or approval that would reduce the scope of a licensee's program to a lower fee category must be accompanied by the prescribed amendment fee for the lower fee category. (4) Applications to terminate licenses authorizing small materials programs, when no dismantling or decontamination procedure is required, are not subject to fees. (e) Inspection fees _Although a single inspection fee is shown in the regulation, separate charges will be assessed for each routine and nonroutine inspection performed, including inspections conducted by the NRC of Agreement State licensees who conduct activities in non-Agreement States under the reciprocity provisions of 10 CFR 150.20. Inspections resulting from investigations conducted by the Office of Investigations and nonroutine inspections that result from third-party allegations are not subject to fees. If a licensee holds more than one materials license at a single location, a fee equal to the highest fee category covered by the licenses will be assessed if the inspections are conducted at the same time unless the inspection fees are based on the full cost to conduct the inspection. The fees assessed at full cost will be determined based on the professional staff time required to conduct the inspection multiplied by the rate established under §170.20 plus any applicable contractual support services costs incurred. Licenses covering more than one category will be charged a fee equal to the highest fee category covered by the license. Inspection fees are due upon notification by the Commission in accordance with §170.12(g). See Footnote 5 for other inspection notes. 2Fees will not be charged for orders issued by the Commission pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202 or for amendments resulting specifically from the requirements of these types of Commission orders. However, fees will be charged for approvals issued under a specific exemption provision of the Commission's regulations under Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (e.g., 10 CFR 30.11, 40.14, 70.14, 73.5, and any other sections now or hereafter in effect) regardless of whether the approval is in the form of a license amendment, letter of approval, safety evaluation report, or other form. In addition to the fee shown, an applicant may be assessed an additional fee for sealed source and device evaluations as shown in Categories 9A through 9D. 3Full cost fees will be determined based on the professional staff time and appropriate contractual support services expended. For those applications currently on file and for which fees are determined based on the full cost expended for the review, the professional staff hours expended for the review of the application up to the effective date of this rule will be determined at the professional rates established for the final rules that became effective on June 20, 1984, January 30, 1989, July 2, 1990, August 9, 1991, August 24, 1992, and August 19, 1993 rules, as appropriate. For applications currently on file for which review costs have reached an applicable fee ceiling established by the June 20, 1984, and July 2, 1990, rules, but are still pending completion of the review, the cost incurred after any applicable ceiling was reached through January 29, 1989, will not be billed to the applicant. Any professional staff-hours expended above those ceilings on or after January 30, 1989, will be assessed at the applicable rates established by §170.20, as appropriate, except for topical reports whose costs exceed $50,000. Costs which exceed $50,000 for each topical report, amendment, revision, or supplement to a topical report completed or under review from January 30, 1989, through August 8, 1991, will not be billed to the applicant. Any professional hours expended on or after August 9, 1991, will be assessed at the applicable rate established in §170.20. The minimum total review cost is twice the hourly rate shown in §170.20. 4Licensees paying fees under Categories 1A, 1B, and 1E are not subject to fees under Categories 1C and 1D for sealed sources authorized in the same license except in those instances in which an application deals only with the sealed sources authorized by the license. Applicants for new licenses or renewal of existing licenses that cover both byproduct material and special nuclear material in sealed sources for use in gauging devices will pay the appropriate application or renewal fee for fee Category 1C only. 5For a license authorizing shielded radiographic installations or manufacturing installations at more than one address, a separate fee will be assessed for inspection of each location, except that if the multiple installations are inspected during a single visit, a single inspection fee will be assessed. 6Fees will not be assessed for requests/reports submitted to the NRC: 1. In response to a Generic Letter or NRC Bulletin that does not result in an amendment to the license, does not result in the review of an alternate method or reanalysis to meet the requirements of the Generic Letter or does not involve an unreviewed safety issue; 2. In response to an NRC request (at the Associate Office Director level or above) to resolve an identified safety, safeguards, or environmental issue, or to assist NRC in developing a rule, regulatory guide, policy statement, generic letter, or bulletin; or 3. As a means of exchanging information between industry organizations and the NRC for the purpose of supporting generic regulatory improvements or efforts.
