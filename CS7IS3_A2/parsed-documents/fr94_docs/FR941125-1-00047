FR941125-1-00047 FR941125-1-00010 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AC04 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Notice of 6-Month Extension and Reopening of the Public Comment Period on the Proposed Rule to List Coccoloba Rugosa as a Threatened Species AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice of 6-month extension and reopening of comment period on proposed rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) extends for not more than 6 months the time to make a decision on its proposal to list the Coccoloba rugosa (ortegón). On September 24, 1993, the Service proposed to determine threatened status for Coccoloba rugosa under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The Act requires the Service to make final determination on such proposals within 12 months, but provides for a 6-month extension if there is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to that determination. The Service finds that there is substantial disagreement concerning the sufficiency of the available population data and, therefore, extends the deadline with respect to the decision to list Coccoloba rugosa . DATES: The deadline for final action on the proposal is now March 24, 1995. The public comment period is reopened until January 24, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments and materials should be sent to the Field Supervisor, Caribbean Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Box 491, Boquerón, Puerto Rico 00622. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Susan R. Silander at the Caribbean Field Office (see ADDRESSES section) (809/851&hyph;7297). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Although there are no records available concerning when Coccoloba rugosa was first discovered, it is known that it was widely cultivated in European botanical gardens during the nineteenth century (Proctor, pers. comm.). The species was named in 1815 and described in 1829 by the French botanist René Louiche Desfontaines from a cultivated specimen at the Botanical Garden of Paris (Little et al. 1974). This plant was reported from St. Thomas more than a century ago, but it is a doubtful record (Proctor, pers. comm.). Coccoloba rugosa is a small evergreen tree 9 meters (30 feet) tall with a diameter of approximately 12.5 centimeters (5 inches). The bark is brown or gray and fissured, with faint rings at the nodes. The green twigs are stout, slightly flattened with longitudinal ridges. The alternate stalkless leaves are 22&hyph;60 centimeters (9&hyph;24 inches) wide, very thick, brittle, and hairless. The leaf surface is rugose, with veins deeply sunken on the upper side and prominent beneath. At the base of each leaf is a large sheath (ocrea) measuring 4&hyph;6 centimeters (1.5&hyph;2.5 inches) long. Inflorescences are terminal, 30&hyph;75 centimeters (1&hyph;2.5 feet) long with numerous small crimson-colored flowers. Male and female flowers are borne on different trees (dioecious). The red ovoid fruits are about 1 centimeter (.4 inch) long with one brown, pointed, 3-angled seed that is .5 centimeter (.2 inch) long. When the proposed rule was published (September 24, 1993; 58 FR 49960), the most recent available information indicated that Coccoloba rugosa was known from fewer than 1000 individuals at 14 sites in the subtropical moist forests of northern and eastern Puerto Rico. A population known from the west of the San José lagoon was destroyed some years ago (Little et al. 1974). The remaining populations are variously threatened by urban, industrial and tourist development, forest management practices, and the expansion of existing military installations.
