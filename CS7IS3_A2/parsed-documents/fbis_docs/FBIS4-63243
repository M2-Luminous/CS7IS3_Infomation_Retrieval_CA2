Speaking in an interview with Interfax-Ukraine Thursday the minister, who is in Simferopol, also said that it was impossible to predict the influence of external forces on the Crimean leadership. Yemets linked the activities of Russian politicians in Crimea with the fact that "certain Moscow groupings want to control the privatization process in Crimea." Yemets said that threats to the constitution and the territorial integrity of Ukraine "will also cause us to react firmly." "No-one will solve Crimea's problem by political adventurism," he said. Yemets stressed that if Ukrainian property or Ukrainian citizens in Crimea were threatened by any kind of force, then "force will be answered by force."
