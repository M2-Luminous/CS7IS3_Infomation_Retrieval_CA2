After the first democratic elections in South Africa, it is not a matter of if, but when and how South Africa will sever ties with its trading partner Taiwan and establish diplomatic relations with China, Greg Mills said. The article said South Africa's ties with Taiwan began in 1977 when Pretoria sought new allies and trading partners in the wake of the Soweto uprisings and the United Nations arms embargo. The article said: `In the throes of its own deepening isolation, Taiwan, on the other hand, saw the opportunity as providing a further anti-communist ally as well as an expansion of trade.' `South Africa's trade with China grew by 170 percent between 1992-93, and it is expected to double again this year. Also the People's Republic of China is alleged to have been one of the major gold buyers in recent times with about 25 percent of the world's total (population),' the article added. `Simply put, given the political and economic realities of the situation, South Africa does not have any options.' The article further stated dual recognition was a non-starter. `The need to make alternative arrangements with Taiwan should not delay a decision on the central political issue. Any unnecessary delays or crude attempts to devise unique solutions will only temporarily avoid the inevitable and anger Beijing,' Greg Mills said.
