Imset: "...and Turkey Is Mobilized Against Terrorism"] [Text] Determined to end the Kurdish separatist campaign in southeastern Turkey with military measures by next summer at the latest, Ankara last week revealed a major decision taken under pressure from the Office of the Chief of Staff. Following hundreds of protest calls to newspapers from relatives of soldiers who had already heard the news, officials were forced to announce that Turkey had frozen all Army discharges for periods ranging from three to five months. But, if expectations are correct, the decision is to be followed now with a brand new measure that will increase compulsory military service for all future conscript s-- resulting in a step backward on a political promise that had been made to the Turkish nation by now President Suleyman Demirel, with the aim of being elected to power. The move was clearly implemented in accordance with demands voiced by the Turkish military and was intended to give the country's military commanders a free hand in fulfilling their pledge to break the backbone of terrorism by spring at the latest. Even Prime Minister Tansu Ciller had to go on record saying that the development was not designed by her coalition government but was the result of a demand that had originated from the Office of the Chief of Staff. The words she used to describe what had happened somewhat shed light on the behind-the-scenes events. According to her, the Cabinet decision had been adopted as a result of "an absolute demand" presented to the government by both the National Security Council (MGK) and security forces. Her remarks also revealed who has the final say on major national issues in Turkey. According to sources close to the government, following last month's MGK meeting, the "decision" was drafted and delivered to each Cabinet minister, one by one, to be signed. By Dec. 20, all of the signatures had been obtained and the decision was passed. With absolutely no legal right to protest, criticize or even express any views at all on this extension, tens of thousands of Turkish soldiers were told by their superior officers that their eagerly anticipated discharges were not to come. Instead, they would have to wait for at least three more months and "defend" their country. From the moment the measure was drafted at the chief of staff's office and relayed to regional and unit commanders and then to soldiers, not a single word of the extension had been leaked to the press, despite Turkey's record of leakages on all issues. The head of the government, Ciller, knew how much such a freeze would hurt her politically as it would every other Cabinet minister. Yet, Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan was comfortably touring Tunisia at the time and Turkey's senior commanders were clearly preferring to place the responsibility for the decision on the politicians. It was so sensitive an issue that, according to Parliament's National Defense Commission Chairman Baki Tug, even he had to wait to hear the news from the newspapers after the horn was finally blown. When the decision had been relayed to Turkey's 500,000 plus soldiers, they phoned their families to notify them of the extension. Once the families were informed, as if in chorus, they phoned the press which finally brought the news out. Military officials, who often search for opportunities to comment on national issues and, in private, criticize "the politicians" for interfering in their affairs, were no more willing than the politicians to announce this decision. Cabinet members contacted by the TURKISH PROBE were telling the press to get their confirmation of the new measure from the Office of the Chief of Staff. Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry claimed that they had not been informed of such a development and only the prime minister's office could comment. As for military officials, pressed too much by the press, all they did was to tell journalists that the report was true, but added that Defense Minister Golhan "wanted to make the announcement himself" and that they should not be quoted on their confirmation of the decision. Clearly, no one wanted to take immediate responsibility for -- and thus face the immediate consequences of -- this decision. It was too controversial a subject to go public with, at least as the one responsible for the measure. The Verdict Although the official jargon on the recent freeze on discharges is jumbled and somewhat difficult to understand for the foreigner, what it basically means is that all conscripts, including regular compulsory soldiers and noncommissioned officers, will be serving in the military longer than they had originally planned. But because Turkish law prevents criticism of this decision, no one can openly protest it. Thus, all Turks -- those who at very young ages had planned their futures based on the former discharge period; those with businesses to return to; those who have families to support; those who have scheduled their whole lives: employment, marriages, business trips and debt repayments -- must wait. Even soldiers with only 20 days to go -- those who have exhausted their handmade calendars marking off each day of the past 14 months -- will have to add at least 100 days more to new calenders. And, in the meantime, the press is banned from reporting the resulting frustration or even writing what could be construed as protests, for this too is a crime. In other words, despite the careful way the news was broken to the Turkish public, there is nothing much to fear. For protest, if there are any, can only be worded by those who have little to loose and even in the media, by those who have now gotten accustomed to being closed down or seized on court orders. Thus, even though there has been a serious shock among soldiers and their families, the recent decision -- or verdict -- was passed without a problem. It appears that had the prime minister been kind enough to consult with her aides before giving in to the "absolute demand," she could have at least prevented a reaction from within her own party. But she did not, and was consequently met with a strong response. Addressing her party's General Executive Board meeting a day after the extension decision was publicized, Ciller faced her first problem; not from the legally silenced Turkish public, but from her own executives who clearly enjoyed the immunity of being part of a ruling party. And, they were tough on her. Not because of their concern for what such a decision could hold for the future on Turkey as a nation, but for what it could hold for them, politically. The reaction demonstrated, to an extent, how ignorant of national issues the True Path Party (DYP) had become and how little it cared for such domestic topics. Indeed, the strongest reaction Ciller did get was from her own party. The reasons for this reaction were perhaps best expressed both in a question posed by Tug and in a remark made by DYP Deputy Tevfik Diker: Tug, chairman of Parliament's Defense Commission, asked Ciller, "Why was such an important decision hidden from us?" while Diker, a member of the same commission, said openly that the Cabinet decision would lose votes for the party. "We have already lost the families of soldiers who will be discharged three months late. The elections are ahead of us and most of the families with children serving in the Southeast are concerned. This will reflect negatively on the elections," was how Diker put it. At about the same time, private ATV television anchor man and SABAH chief columnist Guneri Civaoglu asked the government why such a decision had been adopted in haste and what legitimized such an extension, as there was neither a war nor a mobilization. Perhaps unknown to him, there was a mobilization being conducted in Turkey even before the decision was released. In fact, the main aim of the extensions was to ensure that this mobilization would be of use. For, months ago, Turkey's Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan Gures had sworn that the military would wipe out the terrorists by next spring but there seemed to be no way of doing this without changing some of the principles of the new Turkish system. As Gures does not have too much time to make such changes -- for he himself will be retiring next August -- whatever happens must happen before then. The Reasons This also explains many other developments in recent days, especially the reasons behind Gures' most recent furor over criticism toward the Army and his now-traditional argument that the risks Turkey faces in the region are far greater than they were during the Cold War era. At last, after the collapse of the concept of New World Order, the "New World Disorder" had surfaced which required that Turkey's military be constantly prepared. According to Turkish military officials, the main reason behind the freeze of military discharges was the increased draft evasion throughout Turkey which had seriously hindered recruitment efforts. This was best expressed by Gen. Hursit Tolon, secretary general of the Office of the Chief of Staff, who said in a written statement that the Turkish Army was 110,000 soldiers short. When seen in light of Ciller's announcement that Turkey had 554,000 soldiers, this put the current shortage at about one-fifth of the Armed Forces' total strength. According to Golhan, who made an announcement on draft evasion last month, there were approximately 250,000 draft dodgers in Turkey and most of them were from the terror-ridden southeast region. Thus, Tolon argued, the decision to freeze military discharges was made because the peacetime staff apparently did not meet the requirements of the Armed Forces. Both he and Ciller explained to Turkey that Demirel's decision -- made when he was elected to office as prime minister -- to decrease the military service period from 18 to 15 months, had created some serious problems. Meanwhile, expectations for new recruits had not been met following the Cold War and "uncertainties, instability and threats" had increased. This called for a revision of the previous decrease. According to one senior officer, reducing the term of military service was a mistake in the first place since it was nothing more than fulfilling an electoral promise. "Fifteen months of compulsory service" was a slogan frequently used by the DYP and Gen. Gures agreed to make the necessary arrangements, but only in order not create problems for the new administration. However the burden of the decision had become too great. The Southeast What was evident, though, was that the impetus for adopting the Dec. 20 decision did not come in the form of a perception of a global threat, but was a result of escalating events in the southeast region. Statistics from 1993 indicated that, despite official statements, there was a 100 percent increase in the number of armed activities in that region and Kurdish separatism had claimed a twofold increase in lives that year compared to 1992. As Tolon put it, Turkey was seeking now to keep trained personnel at hand in the combat zone, especially before the military launches its massive crackdown. In the words of Interior Minister Nahit Mentese, winter operations against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) are to continue with full steam in the coming days. And in the spring and summer, the "final blow" is to be delivered. As Golhan has put it, "We need trained soldiers for several months. We have ordered a freeze on the discharge of trained soldiers in view of the continuing domestic threat and the upcoming operations to be carried out in southeast Anatolia during the winter and spring." Thus, there is no doubt that the main reason behind the freeze is neither "the increased threat from Greece," as some papers have reported, nor the developments in the former Soviet republics. Perhaps these have had some influence on the decision, but the extension appears primarily as a result of domestic issues. Several issues ago, TURKISH PROBE had informed its readers that a countdown had begun for the southeast region and that by March 1994, there would be an immense operation in this trouble spot of Turkey. It now appears as though the operation is currently underway and may gain momentum in the coming weeks. March, though, is still the most crucial month. Not only because it is the month of "uprisings" for the PKK, but also because all developments during that month are to affect the whole of Turkish democracy, most probably to be reflected in military appointments, promotions and retirements in August. During the debate over military service, one "leak" to the press was of interest to the outside observer, although the military later denied its authenticity. According to several reports in large circulation newspapers, along with the extension of military service, "all resignations and retirements from the Armed Forces" had also been frozen. This is indeed not true -- for the time being. But cynics say there may be a reason behind such a "leak." Perhaps it was aimed at putting the possibility into the heads of millions of Turks only to prepare everyone for such a development. To be more open, if in March the final clash begins and things get out of hand, if the PKK cannot be crushed by the spring and if speculation on the real intentions of the current Turkish command structure do take place, Gen. Dogan Gures and others waiting their turn to retire, may not have to this in August. Gures' term in office had already been extended by a special decree for an additional year, although his retirement had come up in 1993. After the extension though, the Constitutional Court ruled against the government's authority to make such decisions. But, because no application had been made against Gures' extension in the legally required time, he remained in his position. But there has been no legal -- or constitutional -- extension for him this year. The only way his stay, and those of his close aides, could be extended would be if heavy increase in violence to the point of civil war occurred. In that case, all retirement and resignations from the Armed Forces could be legally halted. As for what is happening in the Southeast, a brief summary of how the recent decision will affect the country is as follows: At least 40,000 soldiers who would have been discharged in the southeast region next March will remain on duty. In other words, the decision is designed to increase the manpower of the Turkish Armed Forces at an accelerated rate, with new conscripts to be added to those not being discharged. Turkey, which under normal peacetime conditions should have some 90,000 to 95,000 troops (or nine divisions) in the region, currently has about 160,000 there. If these were discharged, some 40,000 trained soldiers would have left the service. To replace them, 40,000 new recruits would have to go through main training for four months and then be sent to the region where they would be starting from zero. For many commanders, at a time as crucial as this, such a move could be disastrous. According to one officer who asked not to be identified, the most difficult thing for Turkey was to train commando soldiers which were a vital part of Turkey's campaign against the guerrillas. "Now there is time and the conditions are present to place more trained personnel in the region," he explained. Another military officer disclosed that a decision had already been made, in secrecy, to send a majority of Turkey's fresh conscripts to the Southeast. The transfers have already begun. On Wednesday, there were reports that two Turkish naval soldiers were killed in Sirnak. The reports said that they were first transferred to Iskenderun from Izmir and then sent to Sirnak. This fits in with reports reaching the Turkish capital that there has been intensified military preparation throughout the region and that new armored personnel carriers, tanks, attack helicopters, armored vehicles and warplanes had been deployed. Reports also disclosed that gendarmerie depots are so full that newly deployed equipment, including Russian-made BTR-80 armored vehicles, are now being stocked at depots of the Land Forces Command. According to a senior general interviewed by the TDN [Turkish Daily News] last week, "trained units from everywhere around Turkey, even from Istanbul, are being sent there." And, despite Ciller's own announcement that the extension of military service is a one-time-only decision, senior sources at the Chief of Staff's Office say that they are working on a completely new system whereby compulsory service periods will be extended up to 18 months. Currently, military service is 15 months for private and 12 months for noncommissioned officers. What all of this means is that Turkey is on its way to a full mobilization to counter separatist activities and that many new developments should be expected in the near future. These may include the declaration of a state of emergency throughout the country, the declaration of martial law and even the constitutional declaration of the existence of "civil war" conditions. Whatever happens, it is evident that in one way or another, as long as terrorism remains on Turkey's agenda, it will be the military that runs the country and makes the final decisions on national affairs....
