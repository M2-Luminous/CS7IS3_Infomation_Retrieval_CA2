Chiang on Friday [24 June] issued a stern warning on the impact Taiwan's GATT membership may have on the local automakers, calling for them to merge to cope with the anticipated hard times. "Only by merger can local automakers reach the economies of scale, and there is no other alternative," Chiang said in a meeting with the senior executives of local car companies. There are 11 carmakers in Taiwan vying for a slice of the tiny market, but sales of foreign imports have continued to make steady gains as tariffs have decreased. Imported cars took 33 percent of the local market share in 1993, up from 24 percent in 1991 and 30 percent from 1992, while overall car sales decreased 3.2 percent to 401,270 in 1993. Chiang said sooner or later, Taiwan must fully open its car market in line with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. "That would make the present difficult times even harder," he warned. Yet the response to Chiang's proposal from automakers was cool despite the fact that some of them have been operating in the red. One executive who participated in the meeting simply replied that "the time is not yet ripe" when he was asked to comment on Chiang's merger suggestion.
