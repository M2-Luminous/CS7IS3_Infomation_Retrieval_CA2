FR940906-0-00030 FR940906-0-00017 The Kootenai River population of white sturgeon is one of 18 landlocked populations of white sturgeon known to occur in western North America. The Kootenai River originates in Kootenay National Park in British Columbia, Canada. The river flows south into Montana, turns northwest into Idaho, and north through the Kootenai Valley back into British Columbia, where it flows through Kootenay Lake and eventually joins the Columbia River at Castlegar, British Columbia. Historically, little was known regarding the status and life history of the white sturgeon population in the Kootenai River basin prior to studies initiated during the late 1970's by the British Columbia Ministry of Environment and Parks (Andrusak 1980), Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) (Partridge 1983), and Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (MDFWP) (Graham 1981). The Kootenai River population of white sturgeon is restricted to approximately 270 river km (168 river mi) in the Kootenai River basin. This reach extends from Kootenai Falls, Montana, located 50 river km (31 river mi) below Libby Dam, downstream through Kootenay Lake to Cora Linn Dam at the outflow from Kootenay Lake, British Columbia, Canada. Historically, Kootenai Falls represented an impassible natural barrier to the upstream migration of the white sturgeon. A natural barrier at Bonnington Falls downstream of Kootenay Lake has isolated the Kootenai River white sturgeon from other white sturgeon populations in the Columbia River basin since the last glacial age (approximately 10,000 years) (Apperson and Anders 1991). Genetic analysis indicates that the Kootenai River sturgeon is a unique stock and constitutes a distinct interbreeding population (Setter and Brannon 1990). The average heterozygosity (or measure of the quantity of genetic variation) determined for the Kootenai River population at 0.54 compared to an average heterozygosity of 0.74 for white sturgeon in the Columbia River (Setter and Brannon 1990). Based on these comparisons, Setter and Brannon (1990) concluded ``*␣*␣* we find adequate evidence to distinguish these fish as a separate population based on differences in allele frequencies, the genetic distance calculation and the overall quantity of variation displayed.'' In general, individual white sturgeon in the Kootenai River are broadly distributed, migrating freely between the Kootenai River and the deep, oligotrophic Kootenay Lake (Andrusak 1980). However, the species is not commonly found upstream of Bonners Ferry, Idaho to Montana (Apperson and Anders 1991). In 1980, Graham (1981) estimated that only one to five adult white sturgeon resided in Montana, found in the river reach immediately downstream of Kootenai Falls. Although white sturgeon use the main channel of the Kootenai River upstream to Kootenai Falls, few individuals have been reported from tributaries to the Kootenai River in Idaho and Montana. Based on tagging studies, Kootenai River white sturgeon are relatively sedentary during the summer and inhabit the deepest holes of the Kootenai River and Kootenay Lake (Apperson and Anders 1990). Kootenai River locations used by white sturgeon were generally sites over 20 feet (ft) (6 meters (m)) deep with column velocities less than 0.77 ft per second (fps) (less than 0.24 m per second (mps)) and water temperature of 57 to 68 ○ F (14 to 20 ○ C) (PSMFC 1992), while depths utilized in Kootenay Lake ranged from 30 to over 300 ft (10 to 100.5 m) (Apperson and Anders 1991). Compared with other waters containing white sturgeon, the Kootenai River is a relatively cool river with summer high temperatures of 68 to 72 ○ F (20 to 22 ○ C). White sturgeon in the Kootenai River are considered opportunistic feeders. Partridge (1983) found white sturgeon more than 28 inches (in) (80 centimeters (cm)) in length feeding on a variety of prey items, including chironomids, clams, snails, aquatic insects, and fish. Andrusak (British Columbia Environment, Parks and Lands, pers. comm., 1993) noted that kokanee salmon ( Oncorhynchus nerka ) in Kootenay Lake, prior to a dramatic population crash beginning in the mid 1970's, were once considered an important prey item for adult white sturgeon. Historically (pre-Libby Dam construction and operation), habitat for white sturgeon spawning was considered available in an approximate 96 river km (60 river mi) stretch of the Kootenai River from Shorty's Island in Idaho (river km 223, river mi 145) upstream to Kootenai Falls in Montana (river km 327, river mi 203) (Apperson, Idaho Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm., 1993). Monitoring of mature white sturgeon tagged with ultrasonic and radio transmitters in 1990 through 1993 has documented long distance movements upriver during the spring to suspected staging areas located from Shorty's Island (river km 230, river mi 143) to Bonners Ferry (river km 245, river mi 153), and the suspected spawning reach upstream of Bonners Ferry. For example, Apperson (1992) reported that six reproductively mature white sturgeon (three males and three females) tagged with ultrasonic transmitters were located weekly from April through July 1991 to monitor spawning related movements. By May, all six fish had moved upriver 16 to 114 river km (10 to 71 river mi) between Shorty's Island and immediately downstream of Bonners Ferry. They remained congregated in this area through July. These fish exhibited movements similar to other sturgeon tagged and monitored in 1990. During May through July, white sturgeon fitted with transmitters occupied locations with water velocities that ranged from 0.3 to 0.6 mps (1 to 2 fps) in 1990, and 0.4 to 0.8 mps (1.3 to 2.5 fps) in 1991. Based on a comparison of population estimates made in 1982 and 1990, Kootenai River white sturgeon declined from an estimated 1,194 fish (range of 907 to 1,503) (Partridge 1983) to approximately 880 fish (range of 638 to 1,211) (Apperson and Anders 1991). The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) (1993), commenting on the proposed rule, believes that the population has further declined in 1993 to an estimated 785 individuals (range 569 to 1,080) based on recent estimates of annual mortality and no natural recruitment since 1990. The population is reproductively mature, with few of the remaining white sturgeon younger than 20 years old (Apperson 1992). The Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) estimates that 7 percent of the female, and 30 percent of the male white sturgeon in the Kootenai River are reproductive each year (Apperson 1992). Based on a 1:1 sex ratio, this translated into 22 to 42 females and 96 to 182 males available to spawn in 1990. The actual number of available spawners is dependent upon size at maturity and spawning frequency. It is not certain at what age reproductive senescence occurs in white sturgeon, although most sturgeon species reproduce in the age brackets of 10 to 20 years for males and 15 to 25 years for females (Doroshov 1993). There has been an almost complete lack of recruitment of juveniles into the population since 1974, soon after Libby Dam began operation (Partridge 1983, Apperson and Anders 1991). The youngest white sturgeon found in recent studies include a single specimen from the 1977 (Apperson and Anders 1991) year class and three specimens from a year class between 1976 and 1978 (BPA 1993). Additionally, no white sturgeon less than 51 cm (20 in) total length were collected in surveys conducted between 1977 and 1982 on the Kootenai River (PSMFC 1992).
