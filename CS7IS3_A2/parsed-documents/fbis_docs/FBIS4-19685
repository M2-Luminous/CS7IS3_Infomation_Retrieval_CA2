The issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] and the aggravation of our relations with Albania have dragged Greece into the European and international arbitration of the litigious Balkan countries. This is the harsh reality. Our country's Balkan policy has drifted along filled with contradictions and without a strategy or long-term goals. It failed in its goal and missed its opportunities to play a beneficial role in the Balkan developments and the economic and democratic reconstruction of the Balkan countries. This was revealed and indirectly admitted by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou in his address at PASOK's [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] Third Congress. Papandreou said: "No contradiction can hide the fact that the Greeks have begun to find their natural role in the Balkans. Half of the foreign investments in Bulgaria now are Greek. In Albania, Greek companies have set up 54 joint companies, making us second after Italy. In Romania, there are 700 joint Greek-Romanian companies." Private initiative revealed Greece's natural role in the Balkans. The state, various Greek administrations, and political leadership have not yet realized what Greece's natural role in the Balkans is. They have not been able to deal with the histrionic and offensive loose tongues of our neighbors by countering with daring economic and political openings to the Balkan countries. In his letter to Papandreou, U.S. President Bill Clinton accepts the Greek plans for the establishment of joint Greek-U.S. companies in the Balkans. This economic cooperation will be at the center of their talks during the meeting they will have this week in Washington. But how will these plans proceed? How will the natural role in the Balkans of Greece and the Greek people be able to come to the fore now that Greece is involved in the Balkan crisis? The Greek Government should overcome this contradiction with a daring revision of Greece's Balkan policy. This is the only way for Greece's role in the Balkans to dominate and contribute to the peace and development of the Balkans, and this would be beneficial to our national aims too.
