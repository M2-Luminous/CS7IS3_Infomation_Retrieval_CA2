The majority of journalists give the most pessimistic forecasts, while newspapers are full of rhetoric questions to Viktor Chernomyrdin. Today, a group of correspondents managed to ask the prime minister these questions personally before he left for Orel. Viktor Stepanovich, what is your view of the fact that virtually all the media are predicting that the new government you have formed will fail? [Chernomyrdin] Well, of course I am surprised by this. It seems to be part of your nature or something. We have not even started, but we are being buried before we are born. My view of this attitude is skeptical. Once again I am simply astonished. This talk is not inspiring, it is not about how work should be done or what should be done but, instead, it is a call to destroy everything outright. I do not accept this. It is not a very constructive start if someone believes that it is a start. We are starting the new year of 1994, which is quite difficult and complex. We will discuss the initial difficulties in Orel now, I believe. We are getting ready for a major meeting of the Council of Ministers attended by all the regional leaders, which is a very serious thing. For the first time in our country, a presidential message is being prepared -- we are preparing the economic part and I am preparing all the other areas. So I do not see here...[sentence incomplete as received] [Chernyshova] Viktor Stepanovich, in connection with this, do you have differences with the president or do you fully share each other's positions or programs as before? [Chernomyrdin] This is the second question. This has been especially noticeable in the media of late, which, openly or by hints, imply that we have some kind of differences on many things, from candidates [for posts], to other matters. This is not the case! We did not and do not have any differences, and I believe that we will not have them. I am not shifting my problems onto the president, this is not my style, I have never done that and will never do. But I must say that, as always, the president was aware of the principal guidelines, as he should be. Regarding fundamental approaches, we agree them, we discuss, examine, and determine all of them a good deal -- this was and is the case and, I think, will be for as long as we work together. [Chernyshova] Did you see the president today? [Chernomyrdin] I did, I met him today. Incidentally, today, that is, yesterday, as a matter of fact, we completed the budget for the first quarter and today I showed it to the president, and we discussed all the approaches to the budget for the first quarter once again. [Chernyshova] Viktor Stepanovich, everybody is trying to guess the program you are going to use, in addition to the monetarist program. There have been many assumptions. [Chernomyrdin, laughing] This, too, is from the realm of improvization, to say that Chernomyrdin is giving up monetarist approaches as of the New Year. I have not retreated in anything. Our policy is truly tough. Incidentally, in no way will this tough policy be slackened and nobody should count on this. But today we should produce, today we should say that there has been enough of spreading things around, today we should gather things together. We have completely neglected agreements between the government and trade unions, producers in relation to fixing prices for production equipment, or fixing wages for a certain period. This is very important. This is not a monetarist approach. There are many methods and ways today that should promote improvement. Interestingly, about debts, this is very interesting too, we will pay them back, we will pay them back. First of all, we should repay what we have taken. Strange people, indeed! We eat, we have taken bread and butter, but when it comes to repaying the debts an argument starts suddenly as to whether we should repay them or not. They must be repaid! What the government has taken for state orders, for federal needs from farmers, agrarians, must be repaid. And not only this, but all this should be done in a sensible way, within reasonable limits. This mechanism, this correlation should be maintained but within reasonable limits, since both things are bad, we are blamed for both things. Injections and subsidies lead to an explosion. This will not happen. At the same time, we cannot refrain from giving, for we will bring everything to a halt, something even worse, and an even greater outburst will follow. The program adopted on 6 August was adopted by the government under the president's leadership, it was approved. It was adopted at a Council of Ministers meeting with a large number of participants and attended by all regional leaders. It was developed collectively. Nobody changed it, and Gaydar's arrival in September did not signify any alteration to this program at all. He accepted it because he agreed with it. What Russia's Choice offered in its election campaign was the precisely the government's program. So what are we talking about? Gaydar did not add anything, we all worked as one, I can say it straight, and he cannot deny this. So why this panic? What has happened? Why is everybody going mad? Do not worry, we did not retreat and we will not. We did not indulge and we will not. Everything will be calculated and geared only toward the plan and the programs that have been determined. Will there be alterations? Naturally, there will be, it is impossible otherwise. Thank God, we do not have such [programs] today that can be adopted for five years and that is that. We have had enough of five-year plans! [Chernyshova] Viktor Stepanovich, here is my last question. Stanislav Shushkevich told me in an interview that he expected to see you in Belarus late this month. Have your plans changed? [Chernomyrdin] They have, but only in the sense that there is not enough time, and we have not done everything yet in order to sign documents with Belarus. This visit will take place by all means. We are preparing for it, and the ballyhoo that has been raised partly in Belarus around our relations, between Russia and Belarus, is absolutely out of place. It is harmful, in my view. Some people wish to divide us even further but this will not happen. We will do everything possible, both with Belarus, Kazakhstan, and others. A document on creating an economic union has been signed. We are not retreating from anything! What kind of people are we? Why is it that every possibility is being used to accuse us of doing one thing while forgetting another? Nothing has been done at the expense of Russia or the Russians ever, the same way as we do not reckon to live at the expense of the Belarusians, Kazakhs, Ukrainians. This was never the case, it is not, and will not be! I care least of all today about the political coloring. I care about practical deeds and results today, the way we live and are going to live. Therefore, I will listen to people, I will consult with them, and I will accept proposals from anyone who wishes to do good for Russia and Russians. And I would like to say again: Some people just cannot help croaking -- everything will now be squandered, trouble is coming! No way! We will not get far with complaining and whining! [Chernyshova] Thank you. [Chernomyrdin] Thank you.
