SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA received an application from Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., 6-9, Hiranomachi 2-Chome Chou-ku, Osaka 541, Japan to register the pesticide product RYH-86NA (EPA File Symbol 63898&hyph;R), containing the active ingredient 4,5 dichloro-1,2-dithiol-3-one at 48.20 percent, an active ingredient not included in any previously registered product. However, since the notice of receipt of application to register this product did not publish in the Federal Register , as required by section 3(c)(4) of FIFRA, as amended, interested parties may submit written comments within 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. ~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The application was approved on August 11, 1994, as RYH-86NA for formulation into end-use products only (EPA Registration Number 63898&hyph;1). ~~The Agency has considered all required data on risks associated with the proposed use of 4,5 dichloro-1,2-dithiol-3-one, and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from use. Specifically, the Agency has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health safety determinations which show that use of 4,5 dichloro-1,2-dithiol-3-one when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects to the environment. More detailed information on this registration is contained in an EPA Pesticide Fact Sheet on 4,5 dichloro-1,2-dithiol-3-one.
