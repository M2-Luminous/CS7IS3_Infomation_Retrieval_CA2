In the space of three weeks he has met with his party's executive board and with the federal, state, and municipal delegations of PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] legislators, received mayors in his office, gone to Rio de Janeiro to talk to Mayor Cesar Maia, and launched a furious series of attacks against some of his principal adversaries. On Wednesday 2 March, Quercia will participate in the first big public event of his campaign, a party thrown in Sao Paulo by the Paulista Association of Cities. The former governor says he has been encouraged by all these gatherings. His strategy at the moment probably is to build up some important grass-roots support in the various states. Except at the meetings he sponsors, however, all Quercia is collecting are problems. Within the PMDB, the former governor faces opposition from the national leadership, which is dreaming of creating a National Salvation Front--uniting the PMDB, the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], and part of the PFL [Liberal Front Party]--and watching the maneuvers leading to the launching of a presidential candidacy by current Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho. Meanwhile, in the courts, Quercia will have to testify and probably attend the proceedings concerning the legality of an importation of equipment from Israel that occurred during his administration, but which might also hurt Fleury. "For now, the status of his candidacy is still complicated," a quercista delegate admitted. When he decided to run, Quercia knew he would have trouble winning the support of some factions of his party, like the Rio Grande do Sul group headed by Senator Pedro Simon, the leader of the Itamar government, and by former Social Security Minister Antonio Britto. It was also inevitable that this exposure as a candidate would swell the wave of accusations aimed at tying Quercia to charges of corruption and unexplained wealth. In his favor he has a history of four victorious campaigns that, like this one, also started at pretty close to zero. A rundown of the recent exciting days for the PMDB shows that although Quercia gained ground with his aggressive style, the constraints on his candidacy also grew. Led by Deputy Mauro Miranda (Goias), two dozen PMDB legislators from six states met in the Chamber on 23 February to propose an anti-Quercia front. "If Quercia is the candidate, it will be practically impossible to unite the party," argued the party's leader in the Chamber, Tarcisio Delgado (Minas Gerais). That same day, Fleury was parading around Brasilia with the air of a candidate. In the morning, he met with President Itamar Franco, accompanied by the administration's leader in the Chamber, Luiz Carlos Santos, the governor's leading campaign strategist. In the afternoon, he lunched with Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB, Amapa) and greeted party legislators and leaders at the Hotel Naoum. In the evening, he met with deputies from several states at the offices of the PMDB leadership in the Chamber. "Most of the PMDB would very much like to see Governor Fleury's name on the list of the ones around which the party will have to make a decision," Britto announced. "Between Quercia and Fleury, I'm for Fleury," Simon advised. Suspicious of the sudden interest in his candidacy displayed by old internal enemies, Fleury reacted cautiously. "I am not going to be the instrument of a party breakup," he promised. Deputies from the Sao Paulo PMDB do not rule out the possibility that behind the virtual support for the candidacy of the present governor is an attempt to isolate Quercia and force him to withdraw from the race, which would favor either an alliance with the PSDB or the emergence of a Britto candidacy. For all these reasons, although he is not ruling out a run for Planalto Palace, Fleury is still cautious in his statements. "I am not announcing a candidacy. I think it is important to work for party unity," he said. On the same day when he met in Brasilia with members of the party who oppose Quercia, Fleury telephoned the former governor to schedule a meeting. He wanted to tell Quercia that he did not plan to join any group that would exclude him from the negotiation. Quercia claimed that his schedule was full and postponed the meeting. Irritated by the indecisiveness of his political godson, Quercia toughened his rhetoric against the governor. "Fleury's base in Sao Paulo supports me. If he announces his candidacy, he will be betraying both his electorate and me." Fleury reacted. "No one who wants my support should make a statement like that." The feud between the two is just part of the rhetorical duel promoted by the various PMDB groups and by the party's adversaries (see box). With his sharp candidate's tongue, Quercia has revived the "If you hit, you'll get hit" [bateu, levou] style of Collor's former spokesman, Claudio Humberto Rosa e Silva. Quercia's main targets, since he announced his candidacy, have been PT [Workers Party] President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, tucanos Mario Covas, candidate for the governorship of Sao Paulo and Ciro Gomes, governor of Ceara, and fellow peemedebistas Pedro Simon and Antonio Britto. "The PSDB has this watered-down campaign. I'm going to start up the quercista bulldozer and roll right over all of them," Quercia promised. "He's talking about bulldozers because he is the candidate of the construction contractors," responded Covas, repeating a pronouncement by PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] Senator Esperidiao Amin (Santa Catarina). The shouting match has been loud enough to worry Governor Fleury. "We need to stop these assaults among leaders," he argued. "Internal disputes are healthy when they do not create splits." There is speculation in the Sao Paulo PMDB that the launching of Quercia's candidacy was due to the need to nip in the bud a move by the top leadership to forge an alliance, for the first round of the elections, with the PSDB. "If they were to reach this agreement for the presidential race, they would also abandon Quercia in his effort to become governor of Sao Paulo and would back Mario Covas instead," said Deputy Roberto Rollemberg, president of the Sao Paulo PMDB. Rollemberg said that "by announcing for the presidency, Quercia torpedoed the accord." There is still talk about setting up that National Salvation Front, although the chances of an agreement during the first round are remote. A month ago, in a conversation with Rio Governor Leonel Brizola (PDT), PMDB President Luiz Henrique suggested a pact under which the PMDB, PSDB, and PDT could unite around whichever name ranks highest in the polls in May, when the conventions must indicate their candidates for president. Witnessed by two pedetistas and two peemedebistas, the conversation went even further. "My name is on the list, but it is not an obstacle to anything," said Brizola, according to what one of the witnesses told ISTOE. "I am tired of falling on my sword." After Carnival ended, the PFL wing that is headed by party President Jorge Bornhausen also came onto the dance floor. Brizola, Luiz Henrique, Bornhausen, and Tasso Jereissati, of the PMDB, now have 60 days to agree on this mutual plan that would result in a single candidate, a left-of-center anti-Lula. Formation of the National Salvation Front would seem to be the only alternative to the increasingly unlikely candidacy of Deputy Antonio Britto. On Sunday the 6th, he will take part in the PMDB pre-convention that will nominate the candidate for the governorship of Rio Grande do Sul. He is running against Deputy Mendes Ribeiro and should garner 80 percent of the votes of those in attendance. Britto entered the state campaign in earnest in this past month. Two weeks ago in Vacaria, for example, he outlined his timetable to the party's municipal leadership. "I know there are a lot of people here who would vote for me for president," the former minister said. "I really will need your votes for president--but not in 1994. Now I want your votes for the governorship of Rio Grande do Sul," he said. Britto claims he wants to govern his state and not run for president until later. But not everyone in the PMDB is convinced of this. Not only is he criticized by his party, but Quercia still has problems in court. On Monday the 28th, Governor Fleury will have a golden opportunity to either add to his predecessor's problems or lend him a helping hand. At 1600 in Brasilia, Fleury will testify in the case that is looking into an allegedly improper purchase of equipment from Israel. The testimony will be given in the chambers of Judge Costa Leite in the Superior Court of Justice (STJ) in Brasilia, at a closed-door hearing witnessed only by a federal prosecutor. Quercia is supposed to testify on Friday the 4th. If the inquiry ends in March, Costa Leite can still present the case against the former governor at the Special Court in April. This panel of 21 members of the STJ would judge Quercia. "At any rate, the case will go to trial," a court staffer said. "All that remains to be done is for Judge Costa Leite to conclude the case." In the event he is convicted, Quercia would lose the right to run for any public office in this year's elections. If acquitted, he would have an extra trump card to use in the attempt to discredit the charges against him, but it would not prevent his opponents from exploiting the issue. [Box p 26] "If You Hit, You'll Get Hit" Here are some quotes from the rhetorical contest between Quercia and his opponents: "If he announces his candidacy, he will be betraying both his electorate and me."
