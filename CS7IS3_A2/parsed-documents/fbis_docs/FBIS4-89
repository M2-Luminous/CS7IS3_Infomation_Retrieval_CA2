My sincere apologies for having kept you so long. Part of the delay was caused by the fact that meetings in which I was involved took somewhat longer than expected, and, secondly, I then felt it correct to communicate the announcement which I am going to make to Chief Minister Buthelezi as well as Mr. Mandela and we had some trouble in tracing one of them before I could have the telephone discussion which I have just had. I will read, firstly in English and then in Afrikaans, a very short statement, and thereafter I will, off the cuff, add a number of remarks. After being briefed by the intelligence establishment and security advisers I am of the opinion that circumstances have arisen within the province of Natal, including the self-governing area of KwaZulu, situated in the province of Natal, which seriously threaten the safety of the public and the maintenance of public order, and that the ordinary law of the land is inadequate to enable the government to ensure the safety of the public and to maintain public order. I have, therefore, decided to declare, in terms of the Public Safety Act of 1953, a state of emergency in the area mentioned. There are, however, certain aspects regarding the emergency regulation that have to be negotiated with the Transitional Executive Council and the Sub-Council of Law and Order, Safety and Stability, in terms of the act governing those institutions. As soon as the regulations are finalized the necessary proclamations will be published in the gazette. The state of emergency shall come into operation as soon as the said proclamations are published. I have reason to believe that that will still be today, unless some unforeseen hitches occur. [passage omitted on de Klerk repeating announcement in Afrikaans] Now ladies and gentlemen, a lot of perceptions have already been created with regard to the decision which I have this morning only taken. Until 0930 this morning there was not a decision by me, and it is only me, as head of government and head of state who can declare a state of emergency. There was no decision to do so. We were looking at all options. Our looking at this possibility was not initiated by any outside source, any other party or any other institution. More than a week ago, some of you who were present at the press conference will recall that I was asked, specifically: Are we considering it. And I already then emphasized that, yes, we were looking at all options on a continuous basis and that one of the options would be a state of emergency, that we would like to avoid that if at all possible, but that we would be continuing to look at all options in the light of the serious situation in KwaZulu-Natal. We were, therefore, involved in a process and the first perception that I would like to deal with is the perception that I am now doing this because I was asked or ordered or requested to do so by anybody or by any institution. The decision is not at the behest of any party. It is not at the behest of the TEC [Transitional Executive Council]. It is my decision based on the advise and the analysis of the government intelligence services and advisers in the security field and it is taken within the framework of the law. The second perception that I would like to deal with, which I have seen strongly reflected this morning in the newspapers, it is to a certain extent reflected in some statements, inter alia, of the DP [Democratic Party], is that this is now a first step aimed at actions against the kwaZulu government or aimed at the destabilization of the kwaZulu government. This decision has nothing to do with any such goal. I am on record, and I want to repeat it again, that the kwaZulu government has been lawfully elected and that in terms of other legislation I will only make inroads on their authority in terms of that legislation if, firstly, there is maladministration and I have no evidence of anything like that. Secondly, if that government does not cooperate in making free and fair elections possible, and they have given and they are giving their full cooperation, so this is not aimed at the kwaZulu government. It is not aimed at the position of the chief minister. It is not aimed to have any effect on the position of the king. In fact, it will help to protect the kwaZulu government against any threats, against any efforts from whatever source, to destabilize their position as a lawfully elected constitutional authority. Simultaneously, it is not aimed at any other party or particular institution. The state of emergency will be managed and implemented even-handed. It is aimed at stabilization of the whole area, which specifically includes the maintenance and the restoration of law and order, which specifically includes the protection of life and property of all the people. Actions in terms of the state of emergency will be taken against anybody, irrespective of which party it belongs to, irrespective of which party it supports, anybody involved in any actions which constitute a threat to the security of that area, of the people living in that area, which constitutes threats of violence or involvement in violence, or the instigation of violence -- those are the aims. We do not have a political aim with this in any way, whatsoever. It will also be aimed at ensuring that the election will take place. Political action will, therefore, in terms of the regulations, be permitted but in such a manner that it will not lead to conflict. The question might arise: Is free... [pauses] a free and fair election compatible with the state of emergency, and the answer is yes, because free political activity will be allowed. Meetings as a right can be held. Notice will, however, be required in terms of the draft regulation which I have seen, notice so that the security forces can take the necessary precautions to effectively protect that meeting and ensure that it takes place. The state of emergency, I would like to add, is also being declared in interaction with the TEC, in terms of the legal prescriptions in that regard. It will also enable the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] to be free to continue democratic and peaceful opposition to the election, to hold their meetings and to do their political thing to ensure that they have the opportunity to convince people in terms of their policy and their policy goals, not to come and vote. I would like, therefore, to underline, even-handed, not aimed at any party -- aimed at stabilization, aimed at safeguarding of all interests, aimed at ensuring that the election will take place -- the search for political solutions to the underlying problems must continue. It is crucially important that my scheduled meeting with the king, the chief minister, and Mr. Mandela should continue, and I sincerely hope that none of the parties involved will use this decision which has no political basis, to stand away from that meeting. It is fundamentally necessary in the interests of all the people of this country, and specifically, of all the people in kwaZulu-Natal, that that meeting should take place. I want to reiterate, my commitment to the constitutional accommodation of the position of the king of the Zulus. That is what we must solve. It is one of the underlying problems, and I am positive that dignified and full recognition should be given to the traditional position of the king of the Zulus with regard to his nation. Included in the search for political solutions lies the necessity to address in the negotiations and at this forthcoming meeting, the problem of Zulu self-determination and of self-determination in general. I continue to remain committed to participation of all major parties in the constitutional process, and it must be promoted, and there is no connection between this decision and the necessity for continued discussions and negotiations aimed at reaching the accommodation of those who are deeply concerned in a meaningful manner, reaching agreements which can be implemented also after the election, so as to ensure long term peace and stability to all people. I believe that this decision actually creates the opportunity for solutions to be found for the underlying problems, and will hopefully bring about the type of atmosphere which will be conducive for free and fair elections as well as the type of atmosphere which is needed for political leaders to, through negotiation, solve outstanding problems. [Unidentified moderator] We have a link-up with Cape Town. We'll take some questions from Pretoria, then we'll cross to Cape Town. Linda van Tilburg? [SABC correspondent van Tilburg] Mr. de Klerk, could we ask you: What was Dr. Buthelezi's reaction when you informed him about this and did he in any way indicate that it could jeopardize (?the process)? [De Klerk] I do not plan to in any way, whatsoever, to try and relate what they said to me. I felt it was necessary that I inform them and no doubt, having been informed they will react and I leave it to them to formulate their reactions. [Moderator] Enoch Sithole? [Sithole] Mr. President, what is the position with the kwaZulu Police, obviously they should be expected to apply the state of emergency regulations? Did you get from Chief Buthelezi an indication that he is going to get them to observe those regulations, and if they don't, what is your next move? [De Klerk] The management on the ground of a state of emergency is a matter which will be in the hands of the security forces, the South African Police. The South African Defense Force will play a strong role, particularly in specific parts. There will be deployment on an incremental basis from day to day now of fairly large numbers of South African Defense Force members and the arrangements of interaction with the kwaZulu Police is best left in the hands of those who will be in charge of the South African Defense Force side, and, where applicable, the South African Police. I did not discuss this particular aspect in detail or in any way really with the chief minister. We had a short discussion, but can I say it really goes without saying that cooperation will be sought and I'm sure will be achieved, because surely the goal of the kwaZulu Police is also to maintain law and order and to ensure stability and to protect the life and property of people. [Announcer] You have been listening to the state president, Mr. F. W. de Klerk, speaking at a special news conference at the Union Buildings in Pretoria.
