Galperin, Institute of Engineering Physics imeni A.F. Ioffe, St.Peterburg; 01;05;09] [Abstract] Noise in SQUIDS built with high-T[.sub]c[/] superconductors and operating at radio frequencies is analyzed, of specific concern here being the effect of flicker fluctuations of the critical current in the nonlinear Josephson junction on the 1/f noise in such a SQUID and the dependence of its spectral density on the mode of SQUID operation. The interferometer is inductively coupled to a LC oscillator-pump tank circuit with a shunting resistance R. The analysis is based on four equations: 1) one for the magnetic flux in the interferometer, which consists of a signal flux and an ``external'' flux; 2) one for the Josephson current, which consists of a fluctuation component and a supercurrent in addition to the (h/2eR)_P_ current (h- Planck's constant, e- electron mass, R- oscillator resistance, _P_- total magnetic flux normalized to a flux quantum, displacement current negligible at low frequencies; 3-4 oscillator equations for the voltage across it and the total current in it respectively. Inasmuch as the inductance of a SQUID is usually very low, its static _P_(_P_[.sub]ext[/]) interferometer diagram is calculated on the basis of the threshold model (K.K. Likharev; Introduction to Dynamics of Josephson Junctions, Izd. Nauka 1985), which includes a hysteresis loop consisting of linear segments, whereupon the performance of such a SQUId is analyzed again for noise, this time taking into account that hysteresis.
