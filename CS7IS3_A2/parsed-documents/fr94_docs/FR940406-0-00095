ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document contains EPA's final rule implementing the control of vehicle refueling emissions through the use of vehicle-based systems. It applies to light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. The rule applies to all fuels used by a vehicle, and includes special provisions for vehicles/fuels judged to be inherently low in refueling emissions. For light-duty vehicles, the requirements begin in the 1998 model year, and phase in over three model years. In the 1998 model year, 40 percent of each manufacturer's light-duty vehicles must meet the requirements. This increases to 80 percent in the 1999 model year and rises to 100 percent in model years 2000 and later. A special provision for phase-in is also included for small volume manufacturers of light-duty vehicles. This requirement also applies to light-duty trucks. For light-duty trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 0&hyph;6000 lbs, the requirement begins in model year 2001 and phases-in over three model years at the same rate as applied to light-duty vehicles. For light-duty trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 6001&hyph;8500 lbs, the requirement commences in model year 2004 and phases-in over three model years at the same rate as light-duty vehicles. The rule does not apply to heavy-duty vehicles. This rule also establishes certification requirements covering test procedures for integrated and non-integrated control system designs, a refueling emission standard of 0.20 g/gallon and other related certification requirements and provisions. Finally, the rule contains enforcement provisions related to liability, Selective Enforcement Auditing and nonconformance penalties. EFFECTIVE DATES: This final rule is effective on May 6, 1994. The new information collection requirements contained in 40 CFR parts 86 and 88 applying to 1998 and later model year vehicles have not been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and are not effective until OMB has approved them. EPA will publish a technical amendment in the Federal Register once the information collection requirements are approved. ADDRESSES: Materials relevant to this final rule are contained in Public Docket No. A&hyph;87&hyph;11, located in the Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC, 20460 and is available for public review in room M&hyph;1500. Relevant materials may also be found in Public Docket No. A&hyph;84&hyph;07, established in support of EPA's assessment of air pollution regulatory strategies for the gasoline marketing industry. The dockets may be inspected from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday, except for government holidays. Under 40 CFR part 2, a reasonable fee may be charged by EPA for copying docket materials.
