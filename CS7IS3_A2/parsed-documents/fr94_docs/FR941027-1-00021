FR941027-1-00021 FR941027-1-00008 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 228 [FRL&hyph;5098&hyph;1] Ocean Dumping; Proposed Site Designation AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA today proposes to designate an Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site (ODMDS) in the Atlantic Ocean offshore Miami, Florida, as an EPA-approved ocean dumping site for the disposal of suitable dredged material. This proposed action is necessary to provide an acceptable ocean disposal site for consideration as an option for dredged material disposal projects in the greater Miami, Florida vicinity. This proposed site designation is for an indefinite period of time, but the site is subject to continuing monitoring to insure that unacceptable adverse environmental impacts do not occur. DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments to: Wesley B. Crum, Chief, Coastal Programs Section, Water Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IV, 345 Courtland Street NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365. The file supporting this proposed designation is available for public inspection at the following locations: EPA Public Information Reference Unit (PIRU), Room 2904 (rear), 401 M Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. EPA/Region IV, 345 Courtland Street NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365. Department of the Army, Jacksonville District Corps of Engineers, 400 West Bay Street, P.O. Box 4970, Jacksonville, FL 32232&hyph;0019. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Christopher J. McArthur, 404/347&hyph;3555 ext. 2056. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background Section 102(c) of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) of 1972, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 1401 et seq., gives the Administrator of EPA the authority to designate sites where ocean disposal may be permitted. On October 1, 1986, the Administrator delegated the authority to designate ocean disposal sites to the Regional Administrator of the Region in which the sites are located. This proposed designation of a site offshore Miami, Florida, which is within Region IV, is being made pursuant to that authority. The EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations promulgated under MPRSA (40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter H, Section 228.4) state that ocean dumping sites will be designated by promulgation in this Part 228. A list of ``Approved Interim and Final Ocean Dumping Sites'' was published on January 11, 1977 (42 FR 2461 [January 11, 1977]). The list established the existing Miami (``Miami Beach'') site as an interim site. The site is now listed in 40 CFR 228.12(a)(3). Interested persons may participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting written comments within 45 days of the date of this publication to the address given above.
