According to official reports, nearly 100 Turkish citizens received instruction in religious schools in Qom thus far. All of them have returned to Turkey. The General Directorate of Police has drawn up a report on Iran's reactionary activities against Turkey and submitted it to high-ranking officials in Ankara a few days ago. CUMHURIYET has acquired that report. It said that Iran has maintained its effort to spread the Islamic revolution to Turkey since 1983 and noted that Tehran's activities pose a threat to Turkey's unity and security. Stressing that Iran's diplomatic missions and establishments have an important role in that country's activities, the report said that the activities aimed at spreading Iran's revolution are organized within the structure of Iran's embassy, consulates general, and consulates and the Iranian officials significantly benefit from their diplomatic immunity to promote them. The report listed the diplomatic missions' activities as follows: a. Transfer and distribution of propaganda from Iran. b. Organization of meetings to enlighten Turkish citizens on the Islamic Revolution. c. Organization of the activities of Iranian students who study in Turkey. d. Organization of the legal or illegal travel of Turkish citizens who sympathize with Iran's views to Tehran to receive religious training. e. Establishment and surveillance of the opponents of the Iranian regime in Turkey and the individuals and groups that carry out activities against the Turkish Government. f. Activities aimed at gathering information on Turkey. The report stressed that the Iranian cultural centers spearhead the establishments involved in intensive propaganda activities and noted that the speakers in the meetings, seminars, and panel discussions that are held in those centers address both the Iranian and the Turkish citizens. The report also drew attention to the question of headdress in the universities and said that the Iranian missions exploit that problem and use it as propaganda material in order to influence the students. Furthermore, it said that the Iranian students have a significant role in Iran's propaganda activities, which defend the view that secularism is a state of heresy and criticize the principles and reforms of Kemal Ataturk, founder of Turkey. The report stressed that several Iranian students are responsible for distributing leaflets and documents, controlling the situation and behavior of Iranian students in Turkey, selecting Turkish students to be sent to Iran, establishing contacts with extremist religious groups, and broadening the propaganda on Iran's revolution and Shia practices. The report asserted that publications play an important role in the Iranian missions' propaganda activities and noted that Iranian magazines, newspapers, brochures, booklets, and cassette tapes are dispatched to Turkey in diplomatic pouches. It stressed: "Meanwhile, the Iranian cultural centers distribute or mail their publications, including the books they publish on religious festivals and other important days, to the Turkish citizens free of charge." The report said that the Iranian officials have also focused attention on the Sunni sect in Turkey. It noted the following: "It is common knowledge that the Iranian officials are making an intensive effort to weaken the concept of Islam in the Sunni people and establish non-Shia marginal groups among the followers of the Sunni sect who will be influenced by the Shia concept of Islam and will agree that Shia is the true sect in Islam. In fact, they have had many books, magazines, and other printed material published by the printing houses they support to realize their objectives." Regarding the religious training given to the Turkish citizens in Iran, the report said: "It is common knowledge that our citizens are included among the students from the Islamic countries who attend the religious training programs in Qom for four or five years, that these programs are based on the Shia concept of Islam, that the foreign participants in the religious programs are paid 60-70 Iranian tumans [1 tuman equals 10 rials] in the form of material aid, that Iran meets all their housing and training expenses, and that those who complete their training are used for propaganda purposes in their own countries. It is also common knowledge that religious training has been given to nearly 100 Turkish citizens thus far. All of them have returned to Turkey."
