President Lissouba left the Congolese capital aboard a special plane chartered by Marshal Mobutu, at whose initiative this meeting is taking place, these sources point out. This meeting, of only a few hours, is expected to be devoted to relations between the two countries, which have recently experienced a "little bit of tension" following maltreatment of some Zairean nationals in the Congolese capital. President Lissouba, whose departure was not officially announced, is expected back in his country later this afternoon.
