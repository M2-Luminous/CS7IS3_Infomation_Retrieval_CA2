Ranariddh, speaking to Japanese reporters ahead of a visit to Tokyo next week to attend an international meeting on aid to Cambodia, said he undertook two secret missions to Bangkok "to try to have a dialogue. But now finish," the Royalist Party leader said. Saying economic reconstruction is now Cambodia's top priority, Ranariddh downplayed the threat posed by the Khmer Rouge group. He said the government's offer to allow the Khmer Rouge to take part in the government will be withdrawn if the faction continues its resistance. "If they continue to be unreasonable, my people will continue the way they continue today," he said. Ranariddh spoke as Cambodian Army commanders reportedly announced plans to recapture the northern Khmer Rouge base of Anlong Veng within 10 days. Khmer Rouge guerrillas took it back at the end of last month. [passage omitted] Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen will be attending the second meeting of the International Committee on Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC) set for March 10 to 11 in Tokyo. He said Cambodia needs additional aid to help clear unexploded mines, estimated to number as many as 10 million throughout the country.
