The fourth direct elections to the European Parliament take place in the middle of June. Two weeks later, Germany assumes its six-month presidency of the European Union [EU], which will reach its climax with a December summit in Essen, after which France will assume this role. Finally, the European Commission's mandate expires at the end of the year. This was sufficient reason for Rudolf Scharping, the SPD's [Social Democratic Party of Germany] candidate for chancellor, to follow up his Washington visit with a visit to Brussels and acquaint himself with the problems of the EU and NATO, as he did in talks with Delors, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, and members of the European Parliament, and during a weekend visit to Paris. The concept that he revealed to journalists contains no major features. However, it lays great emphasis on continuity in the basic paths of foreign and European policy, in accordance with Federal Republic tradition. Scharping sounds just like Chancellor Kohl when, on the eve of the European Parliament elections, he calls for an expansion of its powers. "The Strasbourg chamber of deputies must play a greater role in the preparations for the 1996 government conference as envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty on the subject of further reforms, and must emerge from this conference in stronger shape," he said. He described the encouragement of European integration and relationships with France as one of the basic principles of German foreign policy. "Problems such as a lack of economic reforms, unemployment, and the security of citizens can be better solved together," he said. NATO is described as a practical element of European security, which is unimaginable without a substantial U.S. presence in Europe. Russia's particular role must be taken into consideration without accepting any kind of hegemony. The SDP candidate was not ashamed to express his open respect for the European political commitment of his adversary Helmut Kohl. On the other hand, Scharping creates problems for himself with his remarks about other adversaries. He complained that the German policy on interest rates has offloaded problems onto Germany's neighbors. The white paper produced by the Commission for Growth, Employment, and Competition has been brushed aside too many times, he says. He accuses the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Socialist Union] of having nationalistic tendencies, and criticizes the occasional assertive appearances of Foreign Minister Kinkel on the European scene. But Scharping is very careful when speaking out on one of the most important issues of the coming years, the expansion of the EU to include Central and East European countries and the financial consequences of this. If the occasion so requires, he uses a tone different from the frequently euphoric expressions of German Christian Democrats. Scharping talks of "variable steps" in the spheres of politics, culture, and the economy. There is no question of handing over money. The fears of southern EU members must be taken seriously. The European Agreement signed between the EU and the countries of southern and East Europe must be extended, according to Scharping. These countries need a European perspective, but no one knows how their economies will develop, and that is why no firm date for their EU membership can be fixed. As far as this last point is concerned, Scharping is more realistic than the CDU/CSU, because during weekend election meetings, CSU politicians once again called for increased reimbursements from the EU budget to Bonn, and for an eastward EU expansion at the same time. This provides no answer to the question of who would finance the drastic costs of regional development policy and the necessary adaption of agrarian policy following the EU's expansion.
