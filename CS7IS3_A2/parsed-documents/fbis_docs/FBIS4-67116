Referring to the subjects discussed at the conference, Vasile Troneci, head of the National Interpol Bureau, told us: "Since 1984, Interpol has facilitated the rapid transmission of information on cases of international terrorism among member countries. Right now, Interpol is paying particular attention to money laundering operations, organized crime, and trafficking in stolen cars, which have assumed great proportions in Central and Eastern Europe. We noted that, with each passing year, Romanian citizens are committing increasingly more crimes abroad. Last year, 38 Romanians were arrested for drug trafficking and five for arms trafficking. Some 980 Romanian citizens committed crimes abroad in 1991; their number grew to almost 1,500 in 1992 and 2,435 in 1993. Last year, we issued international warrants through Interpol for 87 people, of whom only 12 were caught and brought home." Vasile Troneci said in conclusion: "On a proposal from Germany, a Regional International Police Organization of the 12 EU countries, called EUROPE, was set up some three to four years ago. This body is paying special attention to drug trafficking and terrorism cases and is in constant touch with Interpol."
