Personal weapons such as knives, pistols, guns, or automatic rifles given to officers, noncommissioned officers, and civilians employed by the army will be deposited in the armories of bases, units, or the relevant institutions by 15 January 1994." [The second facsimile passage carries the signature "Defense Minister Safet Zhulali"] Mass Disarmament of the Albanian Army This, then, is the order of Defense Minister Safet Zhulali issued on 8 January this year, to be carried out by 15 January. One would perhaps envy the "haste" of such an order if it were to arm rather than to disarm officers, noncommissioned officers, and civilians employed by the army. Now all officers, except for those not covered by Zhulali's order to "lose weight," will be without their personal weapons, whether knives, pistols, guns, or automatic rifles. According to the above-mentioned order, this is in order to regulate the administration of personal weapons and to prevent unusual events (!)... The reasoning behind the disarmament of officers described in the order lies open to many doubts. First, we do not think the regular administration of personal weapons means their removal. I think that there are plenty of other measures that might enforce discipline in this area. In this specific case, the word "regulate" has assumed an absolute meaning, excluding all other forms of "regulation." Second, even though there have been cases in which unusual events have taken place, those involving officers seem to us to have been minimal and insignificant compared with those today involving individuals carrying weapons whether with or without licences. Such an explanation holds good least of all for officers, who are among the people most trusted by those who turn their eyes to every citizens whenever the words "enemy" or "war" are uttered. For reasons of this kind, there has been a great deal of speculation about the disarmament of these servicemen, as many servicemen affected by the order have recently told us. This speculation includes a possible drastic reduction in the staff of military units, starting from the ministry itself, with the aim of preventing any incident caused by jittery servicemen who do not properly understand the reform in the army. Others explain the order with reference to the new generals' "fear" of the "old soldiers" (!). Others ironically explain that Albania has now run out of enemies, etc., etc.... Only the officers, noncommissioned officers, radio operators, and drivers attached to the main army chiefs are excluded from this order, and have the right to carry weapons. Now the officers' weapons have been taken away. In short, a person can now seize an officer's cap at whim and run off with it, and the officre will pursue him on foot?! Before seizing the cap, you must only put your trust in the officer's running ability or the Lord Almightly. How far can one trifle with our respected officers today? At a time when such a thing is happening, something which to our minds is entirely unacceptable, the fact is that a "mafia" that principally uses weapons to achieve its dark aims is ever more clearly emerging. These mafiosi will now be further emboldened. One weapon less in the hands of officers means one more for criminals, because from now on the latter will now be able to step out in front of the finest officer, say "Hands up," search him, and rob him, taking even his briefcase of documents, and finally ordering the officer to stand "to attention" until the armed criminal has quietly departed toward an "unknown destination".
