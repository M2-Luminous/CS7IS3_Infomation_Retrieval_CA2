FR940318-0-00095 FR940318-0-00018 Summary of Maine's SIP Revision The Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) made amendments to its regulations and statute which incorporate the PSD NO 2 increments and related requirements. On June 13, 1990, the Maine Board of Environmental Protection (BEP) adopted the NO 2 increments and related revisions to its regulations. The State amended Chapter 100 ``Definitions Regulation,'' Chapter 110 ``Ambient Air Quality Standards,'' Chapter 113 ``Growth Offset Regulation,'' and Chapter 115 ``Emission License Regulations.'' The State also amended its New Source Review (NSR) SIP narrative. In addition, the State deleted Chapter 108 (its former Emission Licensing Regulation) which is no longer applicable in the State of Maine. Chapter 115 now supersedes Chapter 108. This deletion is not part of this rulemaking because Maine requested that EPA withdraw Chapter 108 from the SIP and EPA took action in a previous final rulemaking document. EPA is approving an associated minor change to Chapter 115(l)(B) which deletes the grandfathering provisions for licensing. The Maine DEP now requires all sources to comply with Chapter 115. Finally, the State amended its definition of ``fuel burning equipment'' to clarify that equipment which combusts fuel to produce heat and power (i.e., steam for heating, process use, and/or electrical generation) is covered under the definition. The definition would not apply to equipment that combusts fuel for the purpose of drying material by direct contact with the combustion gases. This equipment would be covered by the general process source particulate matter emissions regulation. The revisions establish the ambient air increments and require applicants for PSD permits to assess increment consumption in class I and class II areas. The Maine DEP did not submit the class III increment and there are no class III areas in Maine. In the future, if Maine redesignates an area to class III, it has committed to submitting the class III increment for EPA approval. In addition, the Maine DEP committed to developing a NO x emissions inventory, tracking increment consumption periodically, determining increment consumption between February 8, 1988 and July 14, 1990, and correcting any NO 2 increment violations it may discover in the future. On April 14, 1990, the Maine State Legislature adopted the NO 2 increments in its statute, which became effective in the State of Maine on July 14, 1990. The Maine Board of Environmental Protection adopted these amendments to the regulations and they became effective in the State of Maine on July 10, 1990. On July 16, 1990, September 5, 1990, and November 2, 1990 the Maine DEP submitted these revisions as a SIP revision to EPA. EPA has evaluated these revisions and found they are equivalent to, or in some instances, more stringent than, the requirements in 40 CFR ยง51.166. Maine's NO 2 increment program and EPA's evaluation are detailed in a memorandum dated September 13, 1990 entitled ``Technical Support Document_Maine Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Nitrogen Dioxide (NO 2 ) Increment Regulations.'' Copies of this memorandum are available, upon request, from the EPA Regional Office listed in the ADDRESSES section of this document. EPA has reviewed this SIP revision for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. This SIP revision addresses the NO 2 increments and related requirements. These NO 2 increment requirements were promulgated by EPA prior to November 15, 1990. These requirements are still mandated under the Act; therefore, EPA is approving them in this action. Maine is required to adopt other new source review revisions, however, in accordance with the deadlines imposed in the Clean Air Act. 1 EPA's approval of the NO 2 increments in no way relieves Maine of the obligation to submit further revisions to its SIP to meet the Act's new requirements according to the schedule contained in the Act. Maine will be submitting these revisions to EPA as a separate package. 1 For example, Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required Maine to submit nonattainment area NSR revisions for ozone by November 15, 1992. EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective May 17, 1994 unless, by April 18, 1994, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on May 17, 1994.
