In addition to delegation members being who they are -- Erdal Inonu and other members such as Mr. Ismet Sezgin -- the fact that meetings will be held with Yitzhak Rabin warrants looking forward to important results from this visit. Undoubtedly the positive developments in Turkish-Israeli relations are favorable to both countries. The most important factor that effects relations developing like this is that Israel is no longer the greatest element of instability and obstacle to peace in the region. [passage omitted] Unfortunately, Israel no longer being a risk factor was not sufficient to create a favorable and auspicious atmosphere in the region, not where the future or Turkey's relations with regional countries is concerned. Because, this time new threat centers and points of conflict have emerged, and others will be added in the future. Countries under radical Arab administrations are posing a big threat for Turkey in the region. These countries try to export their ideologies at each opportunity and spend great funds toward this end. Inevitably Iran, though not an Arab country, is included in this category. On the other hand, we cannot ignore our southern neighbor Syria's perpetual initiatives directed at creating instability in our country. [passage omitted] For this reason, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's proposal [as published] envisaging Turkish-Israeli-Egyptian cooperation and forming a common front against terrorism gains a more important dimension. It has to be pointed out immediately that Rabin's proposal has to be carefully discussed, closely scrutinized, and meticulously implemented. The reason being that fundamentalist and ethnic terrorism is threatening the regimes of all these three countries. For years now, it has been Arab countries, wanting to export their structure and expecting support from ethnic terrorism, which have been a source of danger and terrorism for Turkey and not Israel, which was once considered a threat. In this situation, it is meaningless to bury our head in sand and be foolishly deceived by the intentional propaganda of the supporters of religious laws. It is not Zionist ideology that threatens Turkey but rather Arab ideology. The situation being as it is, the reasons for considering Rabin's proposal seriously are obvious.
