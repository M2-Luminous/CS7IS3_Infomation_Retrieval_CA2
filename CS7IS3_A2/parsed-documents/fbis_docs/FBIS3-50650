On that occasion, Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras launched a call for a national debate, the only means of achieving the union necessary for the rebirth of our homeland. Gen. Cedras would like this national debate to be an occasion for the nation to ask itself about itself, about its future, and to look for solutions to the structural problems that hinder social evolution and the development of republican institutions. The commander in chief of the Haitian Army explained that to achieve this union, we must, just as the fathers of our independence did, all decide to unite under one banner. Gen. Cedras explained that Haitians must complete their dream of liberty, equality, justice, and fraternity as projected by our ancestors. With regard to the current crisis, Gen. Cedras asserted that the months of suffering have taught us to know ourselves and to evaluate the men and women of this country. They have taught us in a very difficult way what meaningless weight [words indistinct] our lives as men and women, and our future as a people, before the incomprehensible special interests of a few.
