FBIS4-65065 "drweu092__a94006" FBIS-WEU-94-092-A Daily Report 12 May 1994 ANNEX Inter-European Affairs WEU Associate Partnership Outlined WEU Associate Partnership Outlined BR1105085794 London REUTER Textline Database in English 10 May 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR1105085794 London REUTER Textline Database English BFN [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "WEU Admits Nine East European Countries as `Associate Partners'"] [Excerpt] The principal decision of the WEU [Western European Union] Council (Foreign and Defence Ministers) meeting on 9 May in Luxembourg with Jacques Poos [deputy prime minister and foreign minister] chairing the proceedings was to grant "associate partner" status to nine East European countries which have or will have association agreements with the European Union. The Western European Union will therefore soon comprise four "circles": (a) full members, namely, at this point, all the European Union countries with the exception of Ireland and Denmark. Greece is the 10th member, but has participated up to now solely as an active observer as its Act of Accession has not been ratified yet by all the other Member States (Germany has meanwhile ratified the Act); (b) observers, namely Ireland (a neutral member of the European Union) and Denmark (a European Union member which up to now has not wanted to join the WEU because of its reluctance about a European security and defence policy, although some political forces in this country are said to support entry). This status could be chosen by Austria, Finland, and Sweden once they become members of the European Union; (c) associate members, i.e. NATO members: Norway (which will become a full member of the WEU once it has become a member of the European Union), Turkey (which tried unsuccessfully to become a full WEU member several years ago) and Iceland; (d) associate partners, i.e. Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia (the three Baltic states are given different treatment than that given the other ex-USSR countries, as the Russian occupation of these countries has never been recognized). In the afternoon, the Ministers met with their counterparts from the nine associate partner countries. In their final press release, the Ministers also underscored their determination to develop dialogue with the Mediterranean countries and contacts with Russia and Ukraine. Asked about Russia's attitude to the associate partner status given to East European countries, [German Foreign Minister] Mr. Kinkel told the press that, after first being "rather critical" for fear that this could be a "substitute for closer ties with NATO," Moscow is now showing "comprehension" regarding the initiative. During lunch (separate from the Defence Ministers), the Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Bosnia and, welcoming the prospect of the start-up of the European Union's administration of Mostar, discussed the contribution the WEU could make by providing a police force for this city (Mr. Kinkel told the press such a force could be operational very quickly). The decisive criterion for attributing this new status is the type of relationship the countries concerned maintain with the European Union, with which they must have an association agreement. This explains why the WEU cannot agree for now to grant this status to the states of the former USSR, even if the Western European Union wishes to step up its bilateral contacts with them. In contrast, the WEU will have a multilateral relationship with its new "partners," another difference from the Partnership for Peace offered by NATO. Moreover, while the Partnership places greater emphasis on military cooperation, the WEU associate status is essentially political in nature. This associate partner status will be formally attributed to the nine countries only once the ratification of Greek entry as the 10th full member of the WEU has been completed (there is some delay in Germany and France, which is why Greece temporarily has observer status), which will also make it possible to formalize the associate member status of Norway, Turkey and Iceland. Formally, given the criteria which have been fixed for the East European countries, it will also be necessary to await ratification of the association agreements between the European Union and the Baltic states. However, the associate partners could begin exercising their new status in the coming weeks by participating in every other meeting of the WEU Permanent Council: The Council could thus meet with 15 members one week (the 10 full members plus the three associate members and the two observers, Ireland and Denmark) and the following week with 24 members. Associate members participate in all the Council meetings but do not benefit from the automatic assistance clause of Article V of the Treaty and cannot block consensus between full members: These two conditions will also be applied to the associate partners. The associate partners will also establish a simple "liaison" with the WEU Planning Unit, while officers of the two associate members (Turkey and Norway, but not Iceland, which has no army) will now be allowed to participate in the work of the Unit. Neutral countries such as Austria, Finland and Sweden could in time be given observer status if they are interested, but the WEU obviously does not wish to intervene in their domestic debate on this subject. In Luxembourg, the Ministers also decided to develop contacts with Egypt, which has called for closer ties with the WEU. The WEU already has theoretically multilateral relations with the Maghreb countries (Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Mauritania, but not with Libya), but in practice they are bilateral. [passage omitted]
