The presidential party will land at Tan Son Nhat International Airport at 1815. He will be met at the a?rport by Phan Chanh Truk, people's committee vice chairman, and Vu Hac Bong, foreign affairs director. A dinner honoring the president will be hosted by Truong Tan Sang, chairman of Ho Chi Minh's People's Committee. During the president's first night in Vietnam, he was a guest at a dinner hosted by Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh. It was on this occasion that he proposed the demilitarization of the Spratly Islands. The president said that the tension in the Spratly Islands will be eliminated if the six countries claiming the islands agree to pull out their respective forces there. [Begin Ramos recording in English] I therefore propose that all the claimant states and other Southeast Asian nations jointly study matters related to the possible demilitarization of the area; a freeze on all destabilizing activities; marine research and environmental protection; joint development ventures; confidence-building measures among the elements in the area; and, similar cooperative undertakings for the benefit of all. [end recording] In a news conference at Hanoi, the president emphasized the importance of his visit to Vietnam. [Begin Ramos recording in progress, in English]...with the vigorous economies of Southeast Asia. I regard this trip to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam as one of the most significant I have made. With Vietnam and the other Southeast Asian states, the Philippines has a shared destiny. There is no alternative to peace and economic cooperation among us in this region that we all inhabit. [end recording] Meanwhile, the president had the chance to visit the Mausoleum of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam's revolutionary leader. The president also visited the assembly plant of Vietnam Motors Corporation [VMC]. Here is a report from David Jude Sta. Ana: [Begin recording in English] [Sta. Ana] President Ramos paid tribute to Vietnam's past -- offering a wreath at the mausoleum of the late Ho Chi Minh -- considered as the founding father of the unified Vietnam. He is fondly remembered as Uncle Ho. Ho Chi Minh led the struggle for liberation from France and the United States. Ironically, however, Ho Chi Minh died before his dream of a unified Vietnam was realized in 1975. Today, also, the president paid tribute to the future economic cooperation between Manila and Hanoi. In his visit to the Vietnam Motors Corporation assembly plant, Mr. Ramos urged Filipino businessmen to forge more joint venture deals with the Vietnamese and other Asian industries. Formed in 1992, the VMC is a partnership between Filipinos and Vietnamese with the help of Japanese and Korean car manufacturers. Manila-based Columbian Motors Corporation owns 70 percent of the firm, while Vietnam's Transportation Ministry owns the rest. [Ramos] There are some among our countrymen who think, and I say, they think very wrongly, that when Filipino financiers, managers, and experts export their services and their technical expertise abroad that the Philippines loses. That is not correct. Jobs are also being created for our countrymen because they must run the shops, they must operate the factories that produce spare parts, components, and set assemblies for this factory in Vietnam. [Sta. Ana] Last year alone, $7 million worth of Philippine-made components were used by the VMC. The plant is run by 11 Filipino supervisors, and VMC General Manager Butch Roa said they plan to enter into more joint venture deals with other car firms, and business has been good. [Roa] Government is very...the government is very pragmatic. If they have a decision which is not suitable to your requirements and you appeal to them, they listen. They listen and they adopt. [Sta. Ana] This plant which currently employs 300 will expand operations later this year, assembling the BMW 5 series which will be sold to foreign nationals here in Vietnam, which is a growing market.
