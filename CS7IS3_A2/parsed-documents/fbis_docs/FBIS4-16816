The United States and the other Western countries, using the mandate of the UN peacemaking forces, have effectively entered the civil war on the Muslim side. The events of the past few days show that the danger of the internationalization and creeping proliferation of the military conflict in the Balkans is increasing constantly. [passage omitted] The only way out of the Bosnian confrontation is peace talks, to which the Bosnian Serb leaders have long been urging the Muslims and their U.S. and NATO protectors. The NATO order to bomb the Serbian positions was given immediately after a telephone conversation between U.S. Secretary of State Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev, who then immediately flew to Belgrade where he held talks that night with Serbian President Milosevic. It does not seem, however, that even after that any fundamentally new emphasis appeared in Russian diplomacy's bipartite and ambiguous stance, which effectively encouraged the air attacks. Russia is continuing to refrain from using its right of veto to halt the aggression against the Serbs and achieve the lifting of what are essentially genocidal economic sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia. The appeal to urgently convene an extraordinary session of the Security Council has been left in midair. [passage omitted] After the "slap in the face for Russia's prestige" (to use Sergey Shakhray's well-known emotional verdict), Moscow is apparently still ready to turn the other cheek for further encouragement for the United States and NATO in the same vein!..
