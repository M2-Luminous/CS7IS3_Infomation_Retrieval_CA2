Robaina explained the goals of the summit, Cuba's position, and his visit to Qatar before departing: [Begin Robaina recording] The goals are not far from the aspirations Cuba has always defended regarding the NAM. Since Cuba became a member, it has always called for strengthening the Movement and its authority in representing the poor of the Earth and those who do not have enough resources to allow their peoples to live the way they deserve and to attain a voice and authority that can be heard in the international arena. These main goals that unite us are to strengthen the NAM and to turn the NAM into a strong force at the United Nations and other international forums and discussions. I believe in turning the NAM into a truly integrated force, not only in terms of North-South cooperation but also in terms of South-North cooperation. Why not South-South cooperation? All these things are part of the very broad agenda which we will discuss in Cairo. I will visit Qatar at the invitation of that country's foreign minister, who, as you know, visited Cuba a few months ago. The main goal of this trip is to open our diplomatic mission in Qatar.
