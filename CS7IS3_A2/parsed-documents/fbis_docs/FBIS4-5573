FBIS4-5573 "dreas070_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 South Korea Former Opposition Leader Favors DPRK Dialogue Former Opposition Leader Favors DPRK Dialogue SK0804024594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0204 GMT 8 Apr 94 SK0804024594 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 8 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung, chairman of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, declaring that North Korea's nuclear program must be stopped at any cost, said Friday that a "package solution" and use of "the China card" are the only way. "A military confrontation against reckless provocation by the North Korean hard-liners has to be avoided," Kim said in a prepared text for his lecture at Pusan University. The package solution Kim was referring to has also been proposed by North Korea. It aims at resolving the nuclear dispute through an overall package deal with the United States calling for, among other things, normalization of relations between Washington and Pyongyang. South Korea and the United States should not resume their joint military exercise "Team Spirit" as it would impede dialogue, Kim said. Seoul will have to reconsider deploying Patriot missiles or purchasing other new military weapons, said the former leader of the opposition Democratic Party. "Nuclear proliferation has to be stopped not only in North Korea but also in other countries," Kim said, adding that the United States, Russia, France, Britain and China must show their commitment to making the world free of nuclear weapons. It isn't very persuasive for these big powers to oppose the possession of relatively cheap but hugely destructive nuclear bombs by smaller countries while they have their own nuclear weapons, Kim argued. South and North Korea, the United States, Russia, Japan and China must undertake a serious study of security in Northeast Asia, including the matter of keeping the region nuclear free, Kim said. Such a study would provide a means to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue as well as help maintain peace and stability in Northeast Asia, he added.
