Austria will now decide on what further steps are to be taken. This was stated by Waldheim in an interview with DIE PRESSE following the U.S. Justice Department publication of the report that was the basis of the Watch List decision in 1987. It accuses Waldheim of a "significant role" in participating in or supporting Nazi activities. "The file contains accusations that have been known for years, have long been refuted, and have been examined thoroughly by three investigating committees; I have never been accused of any personally culpable behavior," Waldheim said. Waldheim cites a few examples: The accusation that he participated in the transport of imprisoned civilians to concentration camps was refuted already in 1988 in the course of the investigations of the Historians' Commission: "This was the famous Plenca document, by which DER SPIEGEL was taken in and which then turned out to be forged." Concerning the accusation that Waldheim was involved in the mistreatment and execution of imprisoned soldiers, "the investigation by the British Defense Ministry clearly noted that I was not involved." One cannot speak at all of any attempts to cover up his past after his activities in the Balkans became known. Waldheim has "repeatedly and categorically rejected" accusations in U.S. newspapers that the Soviets knew about his past and that, therefore, he, Waldheim, was a target for blackmail as UN secretary general. Yesterday Waldheim issued a statement; he also anticipates that a clarifying statement will be issued by the Foreign Ministry. The publication of the paper, which had been kept under lock and key for seven years -- "it was not published because it does not contain any proof" -- has started some movement; he will now examine the possibilities of taking action against the Watch List decision. Waldheim does not rule out the prospect that the decision could be reversed. For Foreign Minister Mock so far "only the slanderous concoction by Mr. Sher is known" (author of the paper), now all the papers have to be examined. On Monday [14 March] the Foreign Ministry expressly welcomed the publication of the report. Several international investigations have shown that the "known accusations" against Waldheim, which it contains, "lack any foundation."
