SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 1, 1993, the Office of Administration and Resources Management instituted new mail codes for EPA headquarters offices. This notice is amending the PCB regulations at 40 CFR part 761 to replace references to old mail codes with the appropriate new codes. These references occur at 761.19, 761.185, 761.187, and 761.205. In addition, reference is also made to obsolete room numbers at 761.185, 761.187 and 761.205. These room numbers are being eliminated from those sections. References to room numbers are not being updated, as they are unnecessary for the delivery of mail, and further, they are likely to be changed again in the future.
