FBIS4-12891 "drnes072_o_94007" FBIS-NES-94-072 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 SYRIA Arabs Said Shocked by U.S. `Submission' to Israel Arabs Said Shocked by U.S. `Submission' to Israel JN1404092494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 14 Apr 94 JN1404092494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Press review] [Text] Under the headline "Who Is To Blame For The Disappointment?" the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: Any careful examination of the peace process since its inception makes it clear that the peace process is virtually stalemated. This gives rise to questions on who is to blame for this disappointment over a process on which great hopes were pinned, and for which enormous and matchless international efforts were mobilized. The paper replies, saying that the Israeli rulers are to blame for the current stalemate in the peace talks. For the Israeli rulers have always been opposed to the peace process since its inception. They have always sought to render it void of any meaningful content during all stages of the negotiations. The paper also holds the United States, the major cosponsor of the peace process, responsible for this stalemate in the talks, particularly since the United States has undertaken to perform the role of full partner. The paper adds that this partner has failed to use its influence and means of persuasion with the Israeli rulers. Neither has it defended the terms of reference agreed upon for the peace process. The paper disapproves of the U.S. position that the solution should not be imposed on the negotiators, as if adherence to international legitimacy and its resolutions and the terms of reference agreed on for the peace process were tantamount to an imposition of a solution. The paper notes that the party that is not complying with international legitimacy is the one that seeks to impose its views, conditions, and wishes on all parties, including the international community. The paper asserts that peace cannot be achieved in cellars, nor can it be achieved by noncompliance with international legitimacy and its resolutions. The peace process cannot make headway away from the agreed terms of reference. The paper believes that those who are conspiring against the peace process by dragging one another to alleged agreements cannot inspire trust and promote confidence in their good intentions. These parties cannot respect their undertakings, pledges, and deadlines, which they daily describe as not sacred. For the only thing that is sacred to them is the perpetuation of the occupation and the usurpation of rights. The paper adds: Given all this, Israel is to blame for the disappointment over the peace process, the disappointment that could destroy and kill the current opportunity for peace. For, the Arabs, headed by Syria, have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to just and comprehensive peace. The paper concludes by saying: The tactics of maneuvering aimed to exhaust adversaries are doomed to failure, for there is no room for accepting Israeli dictates once the other sides are exhausted; that is, on the basis of consecrating the premise of negotiating from a position of superiority and arrogance. This game is exposed, and will always remain unacceptable. Under the headline "Who Is To Blame?" the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: Israel has managed to dilute all the momentum created during the various phases of the peace process, particularly after Syria submitted its well-known working paper to the Israeli negotiators, and made it clear, through diplomatic channels, in the bilateral talks, and via all possible media and political means, that its practical concept of peace is based on the principle of trading land for peace. A subscription by Israel to this concept must result in complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, including the occupied Golan Heights and southern Lebanon, and also in a recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Arab people. AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: The entire world community has welcomed the outcome of the Geneva summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton, and deemed it a breakthrough toward the achievement of just and comprehensive in the region. But, since then, Israel has done its utmost, using all possible means of pressure, misrepresentation of facts, and blackmail on the U.S. scene, to neutralize the outcome of the Geneva summit so as to preclude the attainment by the United States of a broad-minded and proper understanding of the regional conflict. This endeavor on Israel's part was also meant to enable Israel to set loose from the United States' commitment to activate its role as an honest partner in the peace talks. This is because Israel does not want to comply with international legitimacy, and to meet the requirements of peace. The paper says: Regrettably, the Israeli efforts on the U.S. scene have borne fruit. They have managed to portray the U.S. Administration in a way that is different from what it was in the immediate aftermath of the Geneva summit. For, truths have begun to disappear, leaving room for Israeli deception and Israeli propaganda to manage the U.S. foreign policy with regard to the Middle East and peace efforts. Perhaps, this is the most serious impasse that has faced the peace process. The paper adds: The Arabs, who have demonstrated their good faith toward the cause of just and comprehensive peace, counted on a vigorous and active U.S. role to ensure compliance with the terms of reference agreed on for the peace process and the Madrid conference per the U.S. commitments President Clinton reiterated in Geneva. But, for now, the Arabs are shocked by the U.S. submission to the Israeli argument in contravention of all pledges and commitments. AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: Unless the U.S. position is freed of the Israeli attempts at containment, and unless Washington acts in line with its international commitments and responsibilities, all efforts will end in failure. For current indications do not auger well for the future if Israel fails to withdraw its troops from the Arab territories, and if just and comprehensive peace remains elusive.
