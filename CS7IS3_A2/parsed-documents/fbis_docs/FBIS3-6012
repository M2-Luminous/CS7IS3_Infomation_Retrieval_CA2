The agreement reached between Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) and Motorola Inc. last week called for the Japanese firm to build 159 new base stations for the U.S. competitor by the fall of next year. Shirai said IDO is expected to implement the agreement without fail. He added, however, that it would be wrong to construe that the government has guaranteed the numerical target accepted by IDO. The government will do whatever it can to see to it that the agreement is carried out smoothly. Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito also told reporters the Japanese Government will watch implementation of the agreement within its power. If there is any difference between Japan and the U.S. in the interpretation of the agreement, it is because the U.S. Government apparently misunderstood the accord, he said. He said the government is in no position to intervene in private-sector affairs though it will keep a watch on the implementation of the accord.
