IF: Six months since last October's tragic events, what do you think are the main lessons that Russian politicians ought to have drawn? YELTSIN: Going back to those days makes me both bitter and sad. But this has to be done to prevent such tragedy from being repeated. I think that to any Russian politician, this must become a supreme goal and the main demand to himself and his associates regardless of political leanings. What is needed most is an internal ban on violence, extremism, the fuelling of vile emotions and social unrest. The only way of achieving political goals is through the ballot box. Mutiny or uprising must be outlawed. This is the first lesson to be learnt from the October tragedy. I can now say that it is being learnt by all of us, albeit with difficulty. One indication is the preparation of a civil peace pact with more parties and groups willing to join it by the day. One other lesson from those dark days is a vital necessity to beef up the state. What happened at the time was largely due to inadmissible connivance at extremism and political promiscuity which must be banished in a healthy state. No one must be allowed to attack government offices or siege a TV center or form armed units. It is the state's duty to protect civilians and ensuring security is its main function. Unfortunately, the government had managed to bring an end to the rioting only in the last stage. If not, what rivers of blood would have flown throughout Moscow and Russia? We now have a minimum of what it takes to consolidate the state. First of all, this is a new constitution approved in last December's nationwide referendum. The constitution put an end to the long- running power struggle by offering civilized ways of resolving controversial issues, leading the country out of the deadlock of confrontation and laying down the basis for cooperation by all sensible forces of Russia. The mood of searches for consensus now prevails and my task is to turn it into reality. IF: With next presidential elections about two years away, what is your main priority in the run up to the vote? Will be seeking re-election? YELTSIN: I have already answered that question in part. But to follow up, it is most important to try to avert new upheavals and prevent the past tragedy from being repeated. Six months on, there are indications that the country has shifted to a different option -- that of understanding and cooperation with confrontational attitudes receding into the backyard of body politics. My own task is to help this in every way but above all, to arrange stable relations between the government, legislature and judiciary. There emerges a new climate of cooperation with the Federation Council and State Duma. Though there are some hitches, there is also a drive for seeking compromise and banishing ultimatums. Dialogue is evolving. I will do my best to beef up this newly- emerging creative mood so that the parliament works through its term of office and the next election comes into its own stead in conditions of internal stability and higher standards of political culture. The accompanying task is to try to consolidate the unity of Russia and our Federation as a whole. There is a good deal of doom and gloom about its possible breakdown, but this will not happen. We managed to stop it from plunging into chaos at the most complicated moment. The process is now under way of evening up federal relations, though with pain and friction sometimes because of regional specifics. But it is under control both by the center and the regions. We must make a serious advance at home in the next two years. And also within the CIS. I do not want to speak at length about our plans here, this is a big and entirely different theme altogether. But I think our states will move closer to each other in the next two years. And of course, there is a third important priority, that is the country's economy. All of us are learning hard. Looking two or three years back, it can be said with a fair amount of certainty that we have learnt a few things. By now, we have managed to recover only a tiny part of the experience it took Russia centuries to gain and which was later destroyed. Recovery is under way and its pace will increase in parallel. In this sense, the next two years will be crucial. I hope that many of the ills of our economy will have gone and all of us will feel much relieved. As for the second part of your question, I think it has been raised much too early. IF: Opinions vary about the concept, formula and timing of Russia's entry of the NATO-sponsored Partnership for Peace [PFP] program. What is the president's viewpoint on this? YELTSIN: We have our own concept of European cooperation. Its key elements -- the CSCE as a priority regional political forum and the Council of North Atlantic Cooperation as a leading mechanism of military-political partnership -- will coordinate the activity of other structures including NATO's. Russia backed up the NATO plan from the very start. On the formula and timing of Russian membership of the Partnership plan, I have instructed the defence ministry and other government structures to look into the main parameters of Russia's political and military cooperation within the framework of the Partnership. It stands to reason that in its scope and dimension, Russia's partnership with NATO must be entirely different from that of other countries. The question is one of signing a special agreement with NATO as befits Russia's place and role in Europe and internationally and its military might and the status of a nuclear power. Overall, we are not in a rush. We have held a series of consultations with CIS states and other countries are close to sign an outline document.
