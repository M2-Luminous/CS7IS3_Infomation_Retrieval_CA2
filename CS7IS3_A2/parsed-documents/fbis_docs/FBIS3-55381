On Saturday 8 January he flies from Washington to Brussels. There the head of the U.S. Administration will attend the NATO Council winter session and meet with the leaders of the European Union. On 11 January the U.S. President is to meet with the leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia in Prague. From 12 through 15 January Bill Clinton makes his first official visit to Russia, and then to Belarus. Then he goes to Geneva, to meet with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. Such a busy program for the U.S. President's European tour would appear to be intended to demonstrate an active U.S. foreign policy and Washington's leadership following the end of the Cold War. At the same time Clinton intends to "pay his respects" to Europe, whose problems, obviously, were pushed into the background by domestic political concerns during the first year of his presidency. Brussels is intended to be the main area of U.S. foreign policy efforts during the visit. There Clinton will try not only to "revive NATO" but also to persuade his bloc allies to accept the U.S. vision of the future development of the situation in Europe and, indeed, in the world as a whole. An important part of this vision is the "Partnership for Peace" doctrine, proclaimed a few weeks ago. The purpose of this doctrine is to steer the desire of a number of East European states to become full members of NATO as soon as possible in the direction the U.S. wants. While voicing support for these aspirations, the United States and most of its bloc partners are in fact not particularly enthusiastic about them. The point is that, having lost their main potential enemy in the shape of the USSR, Washington and NATO are concerned about preserving the former "combat character and spirit" of this organization -- which the "dilution of NATO" by former members of the Warsaw Pact would not help at all. Moreover, there are fears in NATO that new members would bring to the bloc the chronic disputes and problems of Europe, which have come to the surface in the most obvious fashion in the course of the Yugoslav crisis and the endless war in Bosnia. Finally, Washington and the other NATO capitals obviously do not want to "tease the Russian bear" needlessly. Indeed, the bloc's acceptance of Moscow's former allies might in fact be interpreted as a step intended to establish a new "cordon sanitaire" around it. The "partnership for peace" is devised in such a way that "no new lines are pursued in Europe," U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Stephen Oxman said. It was no accident that, at a recent Washington news conference, senior administration spokesmen tried to demonstrate when pressed by East European journalists that it is not in their countries' interests to be trying too overtly to isolate Russia and that the "success of the Russian reforms" is an absolutely essential condition of the success of the process of reforms in their own countries. But the calls for the bloc's doors to be flung open as soon as possible to new members -- former enemies -- are not diminishing. They have grown particularly loud, THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR notes, since the recent elections in Russia, which most local observers see as a defeat for the "Yeltsin reformers" and a victory for "nationalist, procommunist forces." And the Russian president's proposal on jointly guaranteeing with NATO the security of the East European countries appears to have aroused more suspicion than support. The other day Polish President Lech Walesa even said that the West runs the risk of bringing about the revival of the Soviet bloc and the return of communist regimes in East Europe unless it takes bold steps to incorporate a number of former Warsaw Pact allies into NATO. It would be a "tragedy," the Polish president said, if the 10 January meeting of state and government heads in Brussels did not adopt a precise schedule for the admission of East European countries to the bloc. In this situation the need for NATO to devise a common response to the East European governments' aspirations is particularly urgent. And to all appearances, the U.S. President is prepared to pull out all the stops to persuade his bloc allies to accept the U.S. way of solving this problem -- Washington's "Partnership for Peace" doctrine. But the problem is that this doctrine has not yet been fully formulated in an integrated and clear form. Its general provisions could be described in a nutshell as follows: It offers the East European countries and the new independent states, as the former Soviet republics, including Russia, are sometimes called here, not simultaneous and proud entry but a stage-by-stage and somewhat humiliating process of "creeping" into NATO. First the door will be opened just enough to let in those that are "furthest advanced along the path of reforms." Then, others can be admitted to the select band of NATO members as they reach "democratic adulthood." No exceptions or allowances will be made for anyone -- they will all have to go through a long and and as yet vague process of adaptation. At the first stage the NATO countries will have to obligingly agree to participate in joint maneuvers as "aspiring" members. This could be followed by closer cooperation in the security sphere. And only then, some observers believe, would it be possible to start talks on the particular form of NATO membership. At any stage those wishing to be admitted to the closed Atlantic club could face "elimination" if its original participants arrive at the conclusion that one of the new faces is not sufficiently "dedicated to democracy" or is delaying market reforms. According to THE WASHINGTON POST, the U.S. State Department has already started an "intense diplomatic campaign to persuade skeptical East European governments to accept the evolutionary plans for NATO expansion, rather than seek immediate membership..." The main targets of the State Department's "attack" are Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, which are knocking at the bloc's door. If these countries will not be persuaded by the United States and resolutely reject the "partnership" they are being offered, it could undermine the U.S. enterprise at the 10 January NATO summit, even if the bloc allies themselves approve it. Anxious local observers and even some "senior administration representatives," who traditionally wish to remain anonymous, are currently warning of this. On the eve of Clinton's visit Madeleine Albright, U.S. representative to the United Nations, and John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are going to see the East Europeans in order to prepare them properly to take on board the U.S. plan. According to Anthony Lake, adviser to the president for national security affairs, the purpose of their trip will be to dispel fears that the Washington "partnership" is intended to delay the entry of new members into NATO, just to please the Russian opposition. In fact, Lake tried to show, it will lead in a evolutionary way to the "expansion of NATO," but not at the expense of a revival of an East-West split in Europe... So Bill Clnton's European tour, which begins very soon, does not promise to be easy. In a changing world U.S. claims to leadership need to be constantly confirmed by specific actions or new ideas capable of captivating allies and partners. The new administration does not have too many of these in its foreign policy baggage at the moment.
