SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and have been assigned OMB control number 2577&hyph;0140. I. Purpose and Substantive Description (a) Authority This program is authorized by section 520 of the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) (approved November 28, 1990, Pub. L. 101&hyph;625), as amended by section 126 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCDA 1992) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992). (b) Allocation Amounts Section 126(a) of HCDA (1992) provides that five percent of any amount made available in any fiscal year for the Drug Elimination Program shall be available for Youth Sports Program grants. The Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act 1993, (approved October 28, 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;124), (94 App. Act) appropriated $265 million for the Drug Elimination Program in FY 1994. This appropriation results in $13,250,000 as the amount set aside for the Youth Sports Program. Of this amount, $125,000 is being used to fund the FY 1993 application of the Greenville Housing Authority, which was not funded in FY 1993 because of a computational error, leaving $13,125,000 as the available amount under this NOFA. Program funds are to be used for sports, cultural, educational, recreational, or other activities designed to appeal to youth as alternatives to the drug environment in public or Indian housing developments. Because of the limited amount of funding appropriated for this program, and to ensure that the program is implemented on a broad, nationwide basis, each applicant may submit only one application. The maximum annual Youth Sports grant amount per applicant is $125,000. As more fully explained below, applicants must supplement grant funds with an amount of funds from non-Federal sources equal to or greater than 50 percent of the amount provided by the grant.
