As a result, the demands by creditors have almost doubled to about 30 billion German marks [DM]. This was announced by the Federal Statistical Office in Wiesbaden on Friday [25 February]. In western Germany alone the number of bankruptcies rose by 30.5 percent to 12,821. Most bankruptcies were registered in the service sector, with 3,574 (plus 27.5 percent). Trade was also heavily hit, where 3,161 companies (plus 28.7 percent) threw in the towel. The highest increase in company bankruptcies occurred in the processing industry, with a plus of 38.4 percent, reaching 2,528 cases.
