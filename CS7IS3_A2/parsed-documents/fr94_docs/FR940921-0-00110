(2) Unleaded gasoline and engine lubricants representative of commercial fuels and engine lubricants which will be generally available through retail outlets shall be used in service accumulation. (3) The octane rating of the gasoline used shall be no higher than 4.0 Research octane numbers above the minimum recommended by the manufacturer. (4) The Reid Vapor Pressure of the gasoline used shall be characteristic of commercial gasoline fuel during the season in which the service accumulation takes place. (b) Methanol fuel. (1) Methanol fuel used for exhaust and evaporative emission testing and in service accumulation of methanol-fueled motorcycles shall be representative of commercially available methanol fuel and shall consist of at least 50 percent methanol by volume. (2) Manufacturers shall recommend the methanol fuel to be used for testing and service accumulation in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (3) The Administrator shall determine the methanol fuel to be used for testing and service accumulation. (4) Other methanol fuels may be used for testing and service accumulation provided: (i) They are commercially available; and (ii) Information, acceptable to the Administrator, is provided to show that only the designated fuel would be used in customer service; and (iii) Use of a fuel listed under paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section would have a detrimental effect on emissions or durability; and
