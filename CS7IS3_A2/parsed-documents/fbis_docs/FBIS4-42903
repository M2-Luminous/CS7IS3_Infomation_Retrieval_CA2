Wooing the electorate notoriously leaves no holds barred, and political opponents come in for their share of the mud which is slung. So, when politicians of differing hues lay into each other without pulling any punches, their behavior should not be examined too closely. Not all their expressions, descriptions, and modes of addressing each other should be taken too literally. Provided their comments are relevant, fair, and remain within the bounds of decency, there is no cause for complaint. Unfortunately, though, the man is often played, rather than the ball. Personalities are dragged into the gutter. Untruths, half-truths, and sweeping statements are the currency. Utter cock-and-bull stories and deceit are used to portray the opposite camp in a bad light, while putting a halo round one's own head. Anyone descending to these depths and hitting below the belt to gain attention not only abuses the rules of the game; he also shows himself lacking the very qualities required to engage in politics on behalf of the people. This is the opposite of politics understood primarily as serving mankind. The first stage of serving mankind is having respect for people, and consideration. Anyone indifferent to the personal dignity of others should not enter politics. The 1994 election campaign now approaching its end cannot, thank God, be said to have degenerated into mudslinging. There have in the past been primaries when attempts were made to overcome political opponents not through factual arguments, but rather through insult, character assassination, and the like. In this respect, there seems to have been an improvement in this country's political life, which is to be definitely welcomed. For the past five years, the Christian Social Party and the Socialists have governed the country together, as they previously did between 1984 and 1989. This was a coalition which at first glance was certainly not forged by love. The governmental alliance between the CSV [Christian Social People's Party] and the LSAP [Socialist Workers' Party of Luxembourg] was more of a marriage of convenience, based on the voters' verdict. The arithmetical balance of power between the coalition partners was decided by the voters. The two major parties committed themselves to a joint governmental program, which guaranteed our country's economic, social, and financial progress, while placing a new emphasis on social policy. The CSV and LSAP have now been sharing power for ten years. They have achieved much, and managed to implement a great deal. Luxembourg's prosperity has perceptibly increased. We Luxembourgers are now better off than ever, as is confirmed by all available international statistics. Other countries envy us for this. There is therefore a whiff of pettiness and meanness of spirit when a party such as the LSAP now seeks to take all the credit for the social achievements, the prosperity created, the protection of jobs, and the continued economic diversification during this period. But this is what it is doing when its leading candidate brazenly claims the CSV is planning a "massive authoritarian policy," and has ordered a "total halt on welfare." The conservatives, he claims, would not shrink from "interfering with the minimum wage, protection against wrongful dismissal, and working hours." This move by the Socialists to distance themselves is schizophrenic. Are they so naive as to assume the voters are unaware which party is responsible for the major welfare legislation over the past 10 years? The reform of protection against wrongful dismissal, early retirement legislation, increase in minimum wages, tax reductions for low and medium wage earners, the substantial increase in housing assistance, improvements in family benefits, and the raising of students' grants, are without exception the work of CSV ministers. Why should these ministers do the exact opposite, after the election on 12 June 1994, of what they did after the 1984 and 1989 elections? The Socialists, taking stock of the 1984-1994 period, proudly offer such figures as the 83 percent increase in the welfare budget between 1988 and 1994, to 54.7 billion Luxembourg francs [LF], or the average 63.4 percent rise in pensions between December 1985 and December 1992, only 17.7 percent of which resulted from indexing. But all this is not just to the credit of the Socialists, as they would have the voters believe. Are these improvements not largely down to the budgetary policies of the finance and budget minister [Jean-Claude Juncker], who as is well-known belongs to the CSV? The socialists also look back to 1990, claiming that the then average income of a Luxembourg family, after taking account of inflation, was 34 percent higher than in 1985, and that since 1990 a great deal more has been done, including tax reform which for example raised tax thresholds from 29,400 francs per month (for a married couple with one child) to 59,700 francs in 1994. When the Socialists say this, they are again trying to persuade the voters that they should take the credit for it. But the voters know very well that the tax reform so trumpeted by the Socialists was the work of CSV Minister Jean-Claude Juncker. We could go on listing further examples where the LSAP claims "There are no comparable achievements anywhere in the European Union." They are mainly the work of CSV ministers in the coalition government. Despite this, however, the LSAP's leading candidate proclaims to the country that the CSV's antagonism to social welfare must be resisted, and the LSAP must be the barrier against the CSV's attacks on the welfare state. It's enough to make you laugh!
