On the Confiscation of Property and Income Acquired Through Illegal Means] [Text] I, Fidel Castro Ruz, President of the Council of State of the Republic of Cuba HEREBY PROCLAIM: That the Council of State has approved the following: WHEREAS: The National Assembly of People's Power, in its session of May 1 and 2, 1994, being the first special session of the fourth legislature, responding to the demands of the majority of our people, agreed to recommend that the Council of State with all due speed adopt effective and deterrent measures against those who acquire property illegally, accumulating wealth and material goods which, far from being the fruit of their honest labor, are the result of theft, speculation, diversion of resources belonging to state entities or other official bodies, engaging in shady dealings, black market activities and other forms of accumulating wealth which damage the most vital interests of our society; WHEREAS: The above mentioned activities tend to foster all types of criminal activities, with resulting damage to the domestic economy and the country's social stability, and are particularly damaging in the situation resulting from special period in peacetime, since their demoralizing effect is incompatible with the determination to stand firm and the selfless sacrifice of our people, faced with the historic challenge of saving the country and the Revolution; WHEREAS: The Constitution of the Republic in Article 60 states that confiscation of property is only to be applied as a punishment by the authorities in those cases and according to proceedings established by law, and whereas Article 61 of the Constitution allows for the retroactive application of non-penal laws when it is thus established in those laws for reasons of social interest or because it is useful for public purposes; THEREFORE: The Council of State, exercising the powers that have been invested in it by clause c) of Article 90 of the Constitution of the Republic, approves the following. Decree-Law 149 On the Confiscation of Property and Income Acquired by Illegal Means Article 1. -- The confiscation of and subsequent appropriation by the Cuban state are hereby authorized, with no right of indemnity, of property and income acquired by persons who either directly or through third parties increase their property illegally and in a manner disproportionate to their legitimate income.

File the case dossier and render the precautionary measures null and void, ordering the restitution of the goods and income to the proper parties or legitimate owners; 3. Present the case before the minister of finance and prices with the intent to confiscate; or 4. Initiate criminal proceedings, independent of the act of confiscation, if the results of the investigations lead to the belief that a crime has been committed.
