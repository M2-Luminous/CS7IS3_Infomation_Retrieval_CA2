FR940902-2-00126 FR940902-2-00053 The trustee will be an independent entity, and therefore will be unrelated to the trust sponsor, the servicer or underwriter or placement agent. The Applicants represent that the trustee will be a substantial financial institution or trust company experienced in trust activities. The trustee receives a fee for its services, which will be paid by the servicer, sponsor or out of trust assets. The method of compensating the trustee will be specified in the pooling and servicing agreement and disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum relating to the offering of the certificates. 10. The servicer of a trust administers the receivables on behalf of the certificateholders. The servicer's functions typically involve, among other things, notifying borrowers of amounts due on receivables, maintaining records of payments received on receivables and instituting foreclosure or similar proceedings in the event of default. In cases where a pool of receivables has been purchased from a number of different originators and deposited in a trust, it is common for the receivables to be ``subserviced'' by their respective originators and for a single entity to ``master service'' the pool of receivables on behalf of the owners of the related series of certificates. Where this arrangement is adopted, a receivable continues to be serviced from the perspective of the borrower by the local subservicer, while the investor's perspective is that the entire pool of receivables is serviced by a single, central master servicer who collects payments from the local subservicers and passes them through to certificateholders. In some cases, the originator and servicer of receivables to be included in a trust and the sponsor of the trust (though they themselves may be related) will be unrelated to the underwriter or the placement agent. In other cases, however, GECMSI may originate or service receivables included in a trust, or may sponsor a trust for which Capital Markets will be the underwriter or placement agent. Certificate Price, Pass-Through Rate and Fees 11. Where the sponsor of a trust is not the originator of receivables included in a trust, the sponsor generally purchases the receivables in the secondary market, either directly from the originator or from another secondary market participant. The price the sponsor pays for a receivable is determined by competitive market forces, taking into account payment terms, interest rate, quality, and forecasts as to future interest rates. As compensation for the receivables transferred to the trust, the sponsor receives certificates representing the entire beneficial interest in the trust, or the cash proceeds of the sale of such certificates. If the sponsor receives certificates from the trust, the sponsor sells all or a portion of these certificates for cash to investors or securities underwriters. In some transactions, the sponsor or an affiliate may retain a portion of the certificates for its own account. In addition, in some transactions the originator may sell receivables to a trust for cash. At the time of the sale, the trustee would sell certificates to the public or to underwriters and use the cash proceeds of the sale to pay the originator for receivables sold to the trust. The transfer of the receivables to the trust by the sponsor, the sale of certificates to investors, and the receipt of the cash proceeds by the sponsor generally take place simultaneously. 12. The price of the certificates, both in the initial offering and in the secondary market, is affected by market forces, including investor demand, the pass-through interest rate on the certificates in relation to the rate payable on investments of similar types and quality, expectations as to the effect on yield resulting from prepayment of underlying receivables, and expectations as to the likelihood of timely payment. The pass-through rate for certificates is equal to the interest rate on receivables included in the trust minus a specified servicing fee. 12 This rate is generally determined by the same market forces that determine the price of a certificate. The price of a certificate and its pass-through, or coupon, rate together determine the yield to investors. If an investor purchases a certificate at less than par, that discount augments the stated pass-through rate; conversely, a certificate purchased at a premium yields less than the stated coupon. 12 The pass-through rate on certificates representing interests in trusts holding leases is determined by breaking down lease payments into ``principal'' and ``interest'' components based on an implicit interest rate. 13. As compensation for performing its servicing duties, the servicer (who may also be the sponsor, and receive fees for acting in that capacity) will retain the difference between payments received on the receivables in the trust and payments payable (at the pass-through rate) to certificateholders, except that in some cases a portion of the payments on receivables may be paid to a third party, such as a fee paid to a provider of credit support or deposited into a reserve fund. The servicer may receive additional compensation by having the use of the amounts paid on the receivables between the time they are received by the servicer and the time they are due to the trust (which time is set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement). The servicer will be required to pay the administrative expenses of servicing the trust, including, in some cases, the trustee's fee, out of its servicing compensation. The servicer is also compensated to the extent it may provide credit enhancement to the trust or otherwise arrange to obtain credit support from another party. This ``credit support fee'' may be aggregated with other servicing fees, and is either paid out of the interest income received on the receivables in excess of the pass-through rate or paid in a lump sum at the time the trust is established.
