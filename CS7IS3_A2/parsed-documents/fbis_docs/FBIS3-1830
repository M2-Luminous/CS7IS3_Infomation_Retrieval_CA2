The meeting discussed and studied the relationship between the administrative and legislative organs of the Hong Kong SAR, the method of forming the first government -- including the method and timing of the election of the administrative commissioner and how to form the administrative council and its functions -- and the establishment of a consultative committee and its functions after 1997. After the meeting, the group's leaders Liang Zhenying and Xiao Weiyun gave briefings to reporters. Xiao Weiyun said: The administrative organ shall be the leading component of Hong Kong's future political system. The Basic Law provides explicit stipulations that the administrative and legislative organs should check and balance while coordinating with each other. Only by keeping the administrative organ as the leading component will the government operate efficiently, society remain stable, the economy prosper, and living standards be improved. This is the principle we will adhere to at all times. If anyone, by playing small or big tricks, tries to change the system which upholds the administrative organ's leading position before 1997, such changes will certainly be rescinded after 1 July 1997 because they are not in line with the interests of the people in Hong Kong and are not conducive to its long-term stability and prosperity. Responding to a reporter's question on how China could "start a new stove," Xiao Weiyun said, Patten's "constitutional reform package" [zheng gai fang an -- 2398 2395 2455 2714] violates the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Hong Kong Basic Law, and the agreements reached between China and Britain. Now Britain, doggedly going its own way, has submitted the package for adoption by the British Hong Kong Legislative Council. This means that the door to Sino-British negotiations has been shut by Britain's disruption. Needless to say, the Chinese Government will "start a new stove" according to the provisions of the Basic Law. To this end, the preliminary working committee will step up efforts and do solid work to ensure a smooth transition of power and the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.
