Solutions to this problem must not be sought "solely on the basis of the documents signed in Massandra," the minister said. "The protocol signed in Massandra is only a protocol of intentions. It gives some opportunities for maneuver and search for the ways to resolve this problem, but there are also other agreements which should be taken into account during the talks," Ukraine's foreign minister said. Under the Yalta Accords reached in 1992 between Presidents Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia, the Black Sea Fleet was to serve as the basis for building Russia's Navy and Ukraine's Naval Forces. In the meantime, the Fleet was to be run by the two presidents. On June 17, 1993, in Moscow, Yeltsin and Kravchuk signed another agreement, under which the Black Sea Fleet was to be divided between Russia and Ukraine equally. On September 3, 1993, in the town of Massandra in Crimea, the two presidents signed an agreement under which Ukraine yielded its part of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia to cover its debt for the Russian fuel received by Ukrainian consumers earlier. The concrete mechanisms of compensation for the ships to be transferred to Russia and for the use of naval bases located in Crimea were to be devised during further talks. However talks on this issue became stalemated. Therefore Zlenko's latest statement actually signifies Ukraine's departure from the Massandra agreements on transferring Ukraine's part of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia. When asked by Interfax-Ukraine about the international aspect of the possible referendum on independence for Crimea, Zlenko said he hopes that "the people of Crimea will have enough restraint and common sense to refrain from developing an issue fraught with aggravating relations between Crimea and other nations." "We must not allow an explosive situation to emerge," Zlenko said. "Russia is not interested in aggravating relations and using the Crimean card either," he pointed out.
