According to Malval, the only thing the coupist general can offer Haiti is a succession of puppet governments lacking legal or constitutional foundations. "Cedras represents Duvalierism (in reference to the dictator Jean Claude Duvalier). He is a good timer and a visionless epicurean," Malval said on Radio Metropole. He said Cedras is presently "cornered," adding that the Haitian military does not understand the crisis in the country goes beyond a domestic problem and is viewed by the Clinton administration as a U.S. foreign policy problem. He added Clinton will soon make his policy known to the coupist military. "Their power rests on rusty bayonets," Malval said. He said the "de facto" government has not taken anything from Aristide because "we never intended to control the state apparatus." Malval remarked, "It cannot be said they have taken from us something we never had." Concerning his change of views regarding support of the total embargo imposed against Haiti, Malval said in September 1993 everyone in Haiti and the international community believed in Cedras' good faith. He added the events that subsequently unfolded proved "the general has no word." The Haitian prime minister said, "Any negotiation with someone who does not respect his own word is useless. The only solution is to be firm." He added Cedras "had in his hands all of the cards for himself and the country to overcome the crisis, but he, unfortunately, confused his ghosts with reality." Malval concluded that Haiti is experiencing the most serious crisis in its history since its independence in 1804.
