[Kebir] The situation in Algeria today is really tragic because, as everyone knows, the Algerian people had elected their representatives and chosen their political program with complete freedom, the people agreed on their chosen representatives and moved toward forming a government to their liking after three years of paralysis, but regrettably a group of army commanders, generals, took an unsound course and repressed the people. [passage omitted] [Al-Darwish] What about the contacts made by the government with the FIS leaders? [Kebir] The contacts made with the FIS leaders here and there, such as the contact we heard was made with Shaykh Abbasi Madani and other shaykhs, were, we have been informed, conditional. As if one would say I choose the people I want to talk to and on my own terms, and if they accept my terms and agree to do a number of things then I would hold a dialogue, etcetera. This attitude, of course, shows the regime's lack of seriousness. It also shows that the aim of bringing the parties together is to gain some credibility, strike at the people's resistance, and portray the newborn body that will succeed the Higher State Council as an acceptable one born out of reconciliation, and so on. The result of these unserious contacts is certainly rejection because the FIS leadership, whether at home or abroad, cannot accept such a thing and would not lend credibility to those people just because they held contacts and made attempts which clearly have the objective of maintaining the same domineering power. [Al-Darwish] It has recently been reported that the FIS leaders have selected four of them to meet with the Dialogue Committee, hear its offers, and convey the FIS' views. Can you confirm or deny these reports? [Kebir] As far as we are concerned these reports are not true and have not been confirmed. I believe that you have read Shaykh Ali Balhadj's message to the Dialogue Committee. [Al-Darwish] But that was an old message which he wrote last November when he was in Tizi Ouzou prison. [Kebir] That is true but it covered matters of principle. One cannot play games with such issues as the national dialogue or change his mind so easily. At any rate, so long as we hear nothing on that from our own sources, the report is untrue until the opposite is proven. What I can confirm is that the FIS leaders would never forfeit the Algerian people's rights. [Al-Darwish] Is there any possibility of the FIS participating in the national conference directly or indirectly when it convenes tomorrow (Tuesday 25 Jan)? [Kebir] I believe the FIS is not concerned with the conference in any way. I believe that such a dialogue on the regime's terms is a waste of time. [passage omitted] [Al-Darwish] Even if the dialogue is not as serious as you would like it to be, it has actually materialized on the ground and in the minds of the politicians. Most parties demand it as the only way out of the crisis, not to mention that many within the regime have adopted the idea. But you, and you personally in particular, have set extremely difficult conditions for dialogue with the regime. Do you believe that such intransigence will help end the Algerian crisis? [Kebir] As far as I am concerned, the conditions were logical and were required legally and reasonably. It is not just a question of of the extraordinary courts set up illegally and unconstitionally nor a question of the creation of unconstitutional bodies. It has gone beyond that to mass murder without trial. For instance, over the past weeks in eastern Algeria, prisoners were taken handcuffed out of prison in trucks to a jungle near the town of el-Kelaa and, with people looking on, they were killed. This incident is known even to the national press. Such actions and their timing reflect the real views and ideas of the authorities. I cannot sit around the same table with those who kill the people. I say it frankly, they must be brought to justice with all the guarantees of justice. [Al-Darwish] But that means that you are not setting coniditions but rejecting dialogue altogether. With whom is the dialogue to be held? With those currently in authority, naturally. If you are requesting dismissal and trial as a precondition, it means that you completely reject the principle of dialogue with the authorities? [Kebir] No, that is not the case. We are not saying that everyone in authority has committed such criminal acts. Those who did commit and order these acts are known. They are a group of generals not exceeding a handful. They are the ones who should be brought to justice. [Al-Darwish] You are talking as if you assume that there is an authority in Algeria other than the military authority and that it can bring the military command to trial. You know that everyone sees the current conflict in Algeria as a conflict between two powers: the Army and the FIS. When we talk about a dialogue to resolve Algeria's current crisis resulting from that conflict, we are in fact talking about a dialogue between the FIS and Army leaders. [Kebir] I say that the Army should get rid of some criminal commanders and choose for itself some good men. [Al-Darwish] Permit me to say once more that what you are saying means that you actually reject dialogue with the current authorities. [Kebir] We reject dialogue with those who committed crimes against the people. [Al-Darwish] So, according to you, the resolution of Algeria's current dangerous situation depends on the outcome of the armed confrontation? [Kebir] The armed confrontation is not an end in itself. It has come to rid the country of the injustice that has occurred. [Al-Darwish] But do you believe that the armed clash with the regime launched by the Islamic armed movement or other Islamic organizations can really bring the regime down? [Kebir] I do not believe that military action can quickly and decisively settle the issue in favor of one side or the other, but resistance against injustice will unltimately lead to change within the existing ruling authority itself. [passage omitted] [Al-Darwish] There are clear differences in the tones, arguments, and positions of the members of the Executive Committee abroad. I remind you, for instance, of the difference between your statement and Sahraoui's statement on the assassination of foreigners in Algeria. [Kebir] When I talk I do so as FIS official spokesman and as the official in charge of the Executive Committee abroad. When others speak they give their own views and analysis. There is nothing wrong with having differences of opinion in one way or another within the context of general FIS policy. [Al-Darwish] Did you form the Executive Committee abroad on your own initiative, the five of you, or on the basis of a decision by the FIS leadership at home? [Kebir] It was a decision by the FIS, all of it. [Al-Darwish] Are you really in contact with a legitimate organized leadership at home, one that meets and decides everything? [Kebir] Certainly, there is coordination between the FIS leaderships at home and abroad. That coordination may increase or decrease according to circumstances but it is always there. [passage omitted] [Al-Darwish] At various stages since its foundation, the FIS has assumed that the Algerian Army would not contribute to the confrontation with it and that it would be divided within itself if it did join in that confrontation, but the Algerian Army is still noticeably the regime's only cohesive institution. [Kebir] I believe that the forces used by the regime now do not really represent the Algerian Army in its popular dimension as we know it. They use specially brainwashed forces. I believe that some time is required before we can see the real results. If the Army continues to be used widely and extensively, we will see the results later on. There have been some results already. How many Army personnel have deserted and joined the mujahidin? [Al-Darwish] Do you have a numerical estimate of the Army deserters? [Kebir] It is difficult to give estimates but it is now widespread in all sectors of the country. [passage omitted] [Al-Darwish] Many observers do not understand your silent appeasement of the "Armed Islamic Groups" which have been fiercely attacking you and the FIS in their statements. [Kebir] Regarding the statements issued by some criticizing the FIS, its program, or its men, it is impossible to verify or authenticate them because they are not signed by a known person. Who issues these statements? Who is he and what does he represent? So the possibility remains that the security authorities might be behind them. What we know is that the official leaderships of these groups inside Algeria do not adopt such positions. [passage omitted] [Al-Darwish] The Western media insists that the FIS has links with some Islamic states or receives various aid from them. The names of Iran, Sudan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan were mentioned. What aid and facilities does the FIS get from these states? [Kebir] That claim is unfounded. We have said so frequently. It is as if those making such claims want to cast doubt on the Algerian people's support for the FIS. By God, I believe that a cause upheld by the people does not need aid from other states. [passage omitted] [Al-Darwish] If the FIS' historical leaders, who are in prison, agreed on a dialogue with the regime, do you believe that they would be able to impose the idea of a dialogue and its possible consequences on the armed movements and on the FIS' current secret leadership structures? [Kebir] What is certain is that the historical leadership of the FIS consisting of Shaykh Abbasi Madani and Shaykh Ali Balhadj is the real leadership of the FIS and is considered so by all of the FIS's groups and frameworks. The positions they take, therefore, are respected but that leadership knows that the sacrifices it made were made in rejection of injustice. I therefore believe that its position would be in line with the aspirations of the Algerian people. [Al-Darwish] In other words, it would not accept the dialogue idea? [Kebir] It cannot possibly accept a dialogue that would mean forfeiting the Algerian people's rights and overlooking the blood that has been spilled [Al-Darwish] What do you think of the appointment of Abdelaziz Boutaflika as head of state? [Kebir] Has he been appointed? [Al-Darwish] It has been reported that he is on his way to being appointed. [Kebir] As I have already said, the country's crisis was caused in particular by a group of generals. When the necessary conditions securing the Algerian people and their rights prevail, then we will be able to express an opinion. [Al-Darwish] What is your personal opinion of and position regarding Boutaflika? [Kebir] The problem in Algeria is now more than just a problem of individuals. Furthermore, what would the appointment of one individual mean if based on unsound foundations?
