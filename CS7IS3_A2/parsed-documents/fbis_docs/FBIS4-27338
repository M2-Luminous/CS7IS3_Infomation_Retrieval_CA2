Along with globalization of the auto industry, China has been added to Japan, the United States, and Europe for the production bases of the company, making it a quadripolar system, but with the effect of the high yen, a phenomenon of deindustrialization at home is beginning with a move of facilities from the Takami plant in Nagaoka city to a U.S. plant. For this reason, the company has a policy of aggressively promoting restructuring with the opening up of new market sectors as the pillar. China is promoting a policy to cultivate the auto industry, the "Three Large and Three Small Projects," and the U.S. Big Three and Japanese automakers are accelerating their China strategy with an eye to the future. Nippon Seiki also began providing technology to the Beijing Auto Instrument and Meter Plant of the Beijing Auto Industry Federated Corporation Group in 1992, and is proposing instrument production technology for the "Cherokee" jeep which the Beijing group is producing in a joint venture with Chrysler of the United States, but their China strategy will be moving greatly forward with this direct expansion. At the same time, domestic deindustrialization countermeasures are also surfacing as a issue, which will progress further in the future. The company is building production bases in the United States and Europe in response to the overseas expansion by automakers who are their clients, and the overseas production ratio is beginning to expand due to the advance of the high yen. In the past, expansion of local production meant increasing capability, but a drop in domestic competitiveness was behind the decision to move the production line of the Takami plant to a U.S. plant in December 1993. For this reason, the company is promoting business diversification, and its policy is to boost fields other than the instrument business to occupy 50 percent of total sales. It is thinking of proceeding with a focus on electrical equipment for general living such as liquid crystals and remote controls, and on special machinery such as food packaging, and it can be said that such restructuring holds the future of the company.
