The university was closed by the authorities on 12 March following violent clashes at the university between students and members of secret cults on the campus, leaving several dozen students seriously wounded. "We thought foreign students would be exempt, but to our great surprise we were led out of the campus by the security forces," Albert Aboudem Atemkeng (Gambia), stated the secretary general of the Association of Foreign Students at the University of Lagos. Among the students are Liberians, Egyptians, Mauritanians, Indians, Palestinians, Ghanaians, Gambians, Cameroonians, Sudanese, Ugandans, Nigerois, Zambians, Kenyans, Beninese, Pakistanis, Tanzanians, South Africans, and Equatorial Guineans. Last night, they were all forced to sleep in front of the offices of the UN High Commission for Refugees [UNHCR], a French language student reported. A UNHCR source told AFP that the humanitarian organization may probably not be able to help the students since its mission is limited to refugees. Most of these students now in the streets have modest incomes and cannot meet the demands of such an unexpected situation with their own resources, Joseph Chefu (Cameroon), a law student stated. He expressed the view that the university must grant them some favor as is done by universities for foreign students throughout the world. This is the second time foreign students at the University of Lagos were expelled at the same time as the nationals following the closure of the university. The first time was in May 1992 during student demonstrations against the government.
