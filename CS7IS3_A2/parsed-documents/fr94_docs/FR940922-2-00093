FR940922-2-00093 FR940922-2-00061 As the DOJ recognizes in its Competitive Impact Statement, the benefit of this requirement is that it: Will enable the principal competitors of MCI and NewCo to monitor whether either of these companies is receiving discriminatory treatment in their favor from BT, and provide them with evidence that could be used to make a complaint to any governmental authorities in the United States or the United Kingdom. This provision provides substantial protection to Competitors such as ACC because it ensures the availability of evidence relevant to enforcement proceedings under the consent decree. Moreover, such evidence would be significant in complaint and licensing proceedings before the Federal Communications Commission, which has enforcement and oversight authority over the U.S. common carrier Defendants. Similarly, such evidence would be relevant to oversight proceedings in the U.K. before Oftel and other supervisory agencies. II. Necessary Clarification and Modifications of the Transparency Requirement Competitors should not have to rely on the DOJ to provide them, in timely fashion, with copies of information required to be furnished under the transparency provisions. Rather, the information should be provided promptly and simultaneously to both the DOJ and Competitors. Without such information, Competitors cannot provide a monitoring function contemplated by the Competitive Impact Statement as a check on potential anticompetitive activity. Particularly in light of the unusually short term of the proposed decree, any slight incremental burden on the Defendants by providing additional copies of the required information to the small number of identified Competitors is more than justified by the greater protection of the public afforded by facilitating Competitors' monitoring activities, and by relieving the Plaintiff DOJ from the burden of handling the distribution function. (The DOJ could, however, be required to modify the class of Competitors entitled to receive the information from time to time as additional potential class members request inclusion in it, and to notify the Defendants accordingly.) Similarly, ACC is also concerned that Section II.A. of the Proposal Final Judgment permits, without either public notice or comment or Court approval, the waiver of ``such disclosure *␣*␣* by plaintiff through written notice to defendants and the Court.'' The only explanation offered by the DOJ for this waiver provision is that the ``transparency requirements may be affected by changes in regulation or other circumstances. 3 '' 3 Id. In ACC's view, providing the DOJ unfettered discretion to waive this critical provision of the decree without Court approval or public notice or comment would defeat the purpose of the Tunney Act. As Judge Harold Greene recognized in United States v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 552 F. Supp. 131, 148 (D.D.C. (1982), aff'd sub nom. Maryland v. United States, 460 U.S. 1001 (1983), Congress enacted the Tunney Act because ``prior practice, which gave the Department almost total control of the consent decree process,'' failed to ``fully promote the goals of the antitrust laws and foster public confidence in their fair enforcement.'' Judge Greene went on to observe that: The legislative history shows that Congress was particularly concerned that the ``excessive secrecy'' of the consent decree process deprived the public of the opportunity to scrutinize and comment upon proposed decrees, thereby undermining confidence in the legal system. In addition, the legislators found that consent decrees often failed to provide appropriate relief, either because of miscalculations by the Justice Department or because of the ``great influence and economic power'' wielded by antitrust violators. The history, indeed, contains references to a number of antitrust settlements deemed ``blatantly inequitable and improper'' on these bases. Id. (footnote omitted). Judge Greene also quoted the following statement of Senator Tunney, the bill's chief sponsor: Regardless of the ability and negotiating skill of the Government's attorneys, they are neither omniscient nor infallible. The increasing expertise of so-called public interest advocates and for that matter the more immediate concern of a defendant's competitors, employees, or antitrust victims may well serve to provide additional data, analysis, or alternatives which would improve the outcome. Id. at 148 n. 70. As Judge Greene and Senator Tunney recognized, ``mandating an opportunity for public comment'' ( id. at 148&hyph;49), including comment from the defendants' competitors, can play a major role in ensuring that a consent decree fully promotes the goals of the antitrust laws. 4 Moreover, as Judge Greene went on to observe: ``It is clear that Congress wanted the courts to act as an independent check upon the terms of decrees negotiated by the Department of Justice.'' Id. at 149. 4 See also United States v. Airline Tariff Pub. Co., 1993&hyph;2 Trade Cas. ¶70,409 (D.D.C. 1993). The blanket waiver authority conferred on the DOJ by the proposed Final Judgment, however, is not limited by any standards or guidelines and is totally at odds with this reasoning. Through its unfettered discretion to waive a critical requirement of the decree, absent judicial approval or the comment of the public or Defendants' competitors, the DOJ could, either unwittingly or intentionally, vitiate the decree. No adequate explanation has been offered why, if modification of the decree becomes necessary because of changed circumstances, the modification could not be submitted for public comment and Court approval in accordance with the Tunney Act, as is usually done. 5 Such a requirement could avert the clearly undesirable possibility of the DOJ's inadvertently, because of its lack of the intimate knowledge of the industry possessed by Defendants' competitors, authorizing the Defendants to engage in anticompetitive conduct. Thus, at a minimum, the DOJ should be required, prior to waiving any Section II.A. requiring, to provide notice and an opportunity to comment to the Competitors to whom information is to be provided pursuant to Section IV.E. 5 E.g., United States v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., supra; United States v. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n., 1981&hyph;2 Trade Cas. ¶64,370 (C.D. Cal. 1981). In sum, ACC believes that the transparency provisions are critical to the efficacy of the proposed decree. In order to ensure their implementation in an effective manner, however, they should be clarified or modified to ensure automatic and timely disclosure also to Competitors of the information required to be furnished to the DOJ, and to ensure that they cannot be waived unilaterally by the DOJ without judicial approval following notice to and an opportunity for comment by the Competitors. ␣␣␣Very truly yours, Helen E.
