Mr Clarke's outburst is only the latest of a series of highly public clashes between the Socialist M Delors and Mr Clarke. Late last year they quarrelled over the cost to Britain of implementing the EC's clean water directive as well as over M Delors's masterplan to jump-start the European economy with job-creating infrastructural investments funded by large-scale borrowing. Yesterday, finance ministers were holding a regular meeting in Brussels at which they discussed a German proposal to set up a "deregulation taskforce", an advisory group of businessmen which would advise the EC on cutting back on red tape. Britain strongly supports the idea. "We are lagging in making any real progress on removing the burden of excessive regulation of competitive industries," Mr Clarke explained. But at the meeting, M Delors protested strongly, arguing that this sort of outside advice risked undermining the authority of the Commission and proposing instead limited consultation between businesses and individual units of the Commission. Mr Clarke said: "Mr Delors has given a perfect illustration of how a bureaucracy will not reform its own procedures. He is impervious to the suggestion." He said that M Delors's proposals "would produce progress at the pace of a tortoise . . . I think it is a pity that the outgoing president has reacted so strongly in favour of the status quo. It is no good leaving these reforms to the Commission." Mr Clarke also condemned M Delors for discussing the follow-up to his White Paper (the master-plan he produced last December) only with foreign ministers and not with finance ministers. This has long been a sore point with Mr Clarke, who feels that those who control the purse-strings are insufficiently consulted as M Delors spins his grandiose schemes. Earlier, Mr Clarke had lashed out at M Delors's number two, Commission vice-president Henning Christophersen. Last week Mr Christophersen produced estimates showing that Britain's growth rate, the highest in Europe this year, will fall back next year to one of the lowest. Mr Clarke said: "The figures are plainly wrong. The Commission has made a mistake. They are only forecasts, and forecasts are often wrong." Later, he returned to the subject: "I think they are wrong. The IMF thinks they are wrong, and most independent forecasters think they are wrong." But he was forced to concede that the difference between Mr Christophersen's estimate and Treasury figures was only 0.2 percent, well within the accepted margin of error.
