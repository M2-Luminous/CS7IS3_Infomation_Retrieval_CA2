In an interview with CTK today, Filkus said that the Moravcik government had already promised when it assumed power to continue economic reform despite the great political risk involved. Filkus commented that while it was not possible for all economic problems to be immediately resolved, the government would handle individual cases. According to Filkus, the repeated shelving by the Slovak Government of the proposal to improve the insolvency of companies is one of the reasons for the current depth of the problem. "If we want to help insolvent companies we have to come with a bag of money, and that we don't have," he said. But despite this, Filkus expects economic renewal through an influx of foreign capital and privatization.
