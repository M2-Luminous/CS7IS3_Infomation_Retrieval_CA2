Secretary General of Government Victor Rebolledo read a communique drafted during a two-hour meeting with President Eduardo Frei and other political ministers. The government believes it would be a "highly critical political and moral problem" if Gen. Stange returns to the Carabineros high command. In Rebolledo's opinion, it is "useless" to continue arguing about legal aspects of Gen. Stange's situation. The official communique disclosed today reiterates the validity of Frei's arguments on 5 April when he requested Stange's resignation after Judge Milton Juica asked that he be tried on charges of "omission of military duties." [passage omitted] There are reports that Stange, the day after returning to work on 17 May, will travel to northern Chile for a month to avoid having to attend the opening of Congress sessions on 21 May. Gen. Stange was questioned twice this week by Martial Court Judge Alfredo Pfeiffer on "omission of military duties." Cesar Mendoza also has appeared in court on the same charges.
