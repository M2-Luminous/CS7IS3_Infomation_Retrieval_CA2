FR940831-2-00007 FR940831-2-00004 Environmental Impact Statement Helicopter Landings in Wilderness, Tongass National Forest, AK AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: The proposed action is to designate 41 helicopter landing areas in wilderness on the Tongass National Forest. Presently, the use of helicopters by the general public for access to wilderness is prohibited on the Tongass National Forest by regulation (36 CFR 261.10). The designation of helicopter landing areas is based on uses which were established at the time of the designation of the wilderness which is allowed by the Wilderness Act (Pub. L. 88&hyph;577) under 36 CFR 293.6(d). The 41 landing areas identified in the Forest Service proposed action are located in seven of the 19 designated wildernesses on the Tongass National Forest. The wildernesses where landing areas are proposed and the number of landing areas proposed are Endicott River (1), Kootznoowoo (Admiralty Island National Monument) (6), Misty Fiords National Monument (25), South Etolin (1), South Prince of Wales (1), Strikine-LeConte (4), and Tracy Arm-Fords Terror (3). The proposed action would allow up to 50 helicopter landings per year on some landing areas. Implementation of the proposed action likely would require special use permits for helicopter landings to address management concerns including monitoring. EFFECTIVE DATE: Written comments concerning the proposed action to approve helicopter landing areas in Tongass National Forest wilderness should be received within 45 days of the date of publication of this Notice in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Send written comments to Bill Tremblay, Team Leader, USDA Forest Service, P.O. Box 309, Petersburg, AK 99833. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 0 Questions concerning the proposed action and environmental impact statement should be directed to Bill Tremblay, Team Leader, USDA Forest Service, P.O. Box 309, Petersburg, AK 99833, phone: (907) 772&hyph;3841. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of the project is to provide continued general public helicopter access for ``traditional'' activities while managing Tongass National Forest wilderness to provide high quality wilderness opportunities. In this context, traditional activities include hiking, camping, photography, fishing, and other wilderness-oriented forms of recreation. Access for activities authorized under legal authorities other than Section 4(d)(1) of the Wilderness Act (such as outfitting/guiding, mineral exploration, maintaining communication sites, agency administrative use) is not included in this project. The Regional Forester, Phil Janik, must decide whether to allow continued helicopter landings for access by the general public in areas that were used prior to wilderness designation. If helicopter landing areas are approved, the Regional Forester will decide which areas will be designated and what restrictions, if any, will be established. A scoping letter was sent in 1992 to persons on a Tongass National Forest mailing list. Requests for comments were published in newspapers throughout southeast Alaska. Public meetings were held in Juneau, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Sitka, and Wrangell, Alaska the fall of 1992. Additional comments will be solicited through mailings, public notices, and this Federal Register Notice. Additional public scoping meetings are not planned. Alternatives will include the proposed action, a no action alternative, and other action alternatives. All action alternatives would authorize some helicopter landings in wilderness for general public access. Proposed land areas may or may not include areas already accessed by other motorized methods as provided for in Section 1110(a) of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), Public Law 96&hyph;487. The following preliminary issues have been identified:
