The present state of the Angolan industry is truly gloomy and worrisome because of an almost total paralyzation of productive activity during 1993, reducing production levels to less than 30 percent. This situation, created by the destruction of infrastructure, lack of raw materials, and the obsolete state of equipment, caused major imbalances in the present economy, which is characterized by an ever increasing inflation. The occupation of some industrial areas by the warmongering National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], such as Huambo, the second biggest industrial province in the country, influenced to a large extent the low level of production registered during 1993, particularly in the fields of food, beverages, and confection. In financial terms, the industrial sector received $35.4 million for operational programs on a quarterly basis, but the Angolan industrial sector needs $700 million for its rehabilitation. Of the $35.4 million, more than $8 million were used to obtain raw materials, mainly wheat and corn flour, yeast, and wheat grain. The remaining amount was given to companies that had raw materials but needed other essentials to produce commodities. Importing raw materials served as a foundation for the Angolan Industrial Association to hold trade fairs to exhibit products produced in the country. Strategies and priorities to reorganize and develop Angolan entrepreneurship and privatizations were defined in 1993, although the process has been moving slowly. Measures liberalizing prices and giving management autonomy where possible, were also implemented. Thus, work is under way to transform state units into commercial elements. There are still some difficulties. These include the fact that an adequate economic atmosphere does not exist, the need for a consolidated and experienced entrepreneurship, as well as shortage of equipment, financial resources, technology, and management. In the very short-term, the fundamental objective is to be able to increase the utilization of available resources in the fields of industry, capital, and labor, thus guaranteeing minimum levels of efficiency. Accordingly, the government's strategy in 1994 should be to make use of good points and eliminate weak points. Good points are an abundance of natural resources, excellent conditions to obtain energy at low prices, the geopolitical situation, and the agricultural, livestock, and fishery [word indistinct]. Weak points would be the war situation, the destroyed industrial sector, excessive bureaucracy and restrictions to free initiative, the shortage of modern and trained national entrepreneurs to carry out productive activities, and restrictions to foreign investment, among other things. The prevalence of restrictions and limitations, viewed as weak points, must have evidently affected the rate of the utilization of productive capacity, which was less than 30 percent during 1993. The manufaturing industry was one of the sectors with serious reductions. Thus, its production, after suffering a 75 percent decline from 1975 to 1976, experienced an increase from 1977 to 1983, and once again a decline from 1985 to 1994. Employment in the manufacturing industry decreased from 200,000 in 1970's to less than 70,000 in 1993. To reduce the high rate of unemployment, the government must define some strategic parameters to formulate a re-industrialization plan. Hence, there is a need to draw up a program with general and specific actions, such as guaranteeing a minimum production program for viable food industries. There is also a need to encourage production in heavy industry, which is currently experiencing a small injection of fresh money to advance forward and to adopt measures aimed at improving the efficiency of the enterprise sector and developing Angolan entrepreneurship and privatization. In the mining sector, the 1993 production results were below the planned levels because the vast and rich diamond-producing areas were paralyzed, following their occupation by UNITA warmongering forces led by Dr. Jonas Malheiro. In view of this situation, the production by the Angola National Diamond Enterprise [Endiama] totalled 20,000 monthly [words indistinct], 50 percent of normal activity at Lucapa and Zage, presently known as Andrada. During the first six months of this year [as heard], Endiama saw its production reduced $300 million, because the Cuango diamond area in Lunda Norte Province was paralyzed. Illegal diamond trafficking reached alarming proportions, to the value of $500 million, forcing the government to adopt urgent measures to halt it. These measures included restricting people's movement in areas with the most diamond activity. What is more, proposals by foreign investors to exploit other minerals, such as granite, marble, and lime, particularly in southern Angola, cannot be realized because of the war imposed on us by UNITA's warmongering wing, led by Dr. Jonas Savimbi.
