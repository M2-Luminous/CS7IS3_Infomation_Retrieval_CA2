The seven companies had a decrease in income and decrease in profits across the board, but with thorough cost reduction, they have begun to produce rationalization results on the highest level of the past and except for Toyoda Machine Works which has a high percentage of machine tools, secured a profit. This term, however, with the prolonged slump in the auto market and parts purchase pressure from overseas, the various companies of the group are being pressed for further rationalization. Compared to other groups such as Nissan Motor, Toyota has a little more experience in rationalization, but competition upon which their survival hangs is beginning within an operating environment that is nothing but grim. The effect of rationalization especially contributed to the increase in profit factor in the March 1994 settlement of accounts. With the 9 billion yen of Aisin Seiki heading the list, the 8 billion yen of Toyoda Automatic Loom Works and the 6.8 billion yen of Toyota Body stand out. All have recorded the highest level of the past. The ordinary profits for the three companies were respectively 10.5 billion yen, 14.5 billion yen, and 3.5 billion yen, but without the rationalization effects, they would have fallen to a deficit or just barely a profit. The other four companies also produced the highest rationalization effects of the past. At Aisin, which tweaked out 9 billion yen, the company-wide cost reduction actions which began in November 1991 have reached their peak. They have reviewed the quality and cost of their own company's products such as clutches and brakes, and developed production method assistance actions for suppliers and thoroughly developed activities with globalization, etc. as the pillar seeking markets. As a result, they have realized 2.5 billion yen by successive decreases in production processes, 2.4 billion yen by purchasing and other reforms, and 2.2 billion yen by cost reductions. Toyota Body, which invested close to 50 billion yen in Inabe-cho, Mie Prefecture, and completed the Inabe plant in December 1993, made a thorough review of production processes in the plant construction. Except for the buildings, prospects are that they can cover the majority of the depreciation costs by rationalization. In 1995 when the new plant is in full operation, a rationalization effect of 1.2 billion yen will be produced. Not just the Toyota group, but the various parts and assembly companies affiliated with automakers such as Nissan and Mazda have been earnest in cost reduction actions. There is no big difference in the target levels for cost reduction, but as opposed to voices heard from groups other than Toyota which say, "It is fine if we attain half the target value ordered by the parent company," they are desperate at the Toyota group, saying, "If we do not decrease costs more than the level requested by Toyota, no profit of our own will be produced." In addition to Toyota itself giving detailed guidance to the various companies of the group on rationalization measures, there has been an atmosphere of fear within the group of being dropped and they have been thorough to the extent of "not providing tea during conferences and even using the back of paper." This consciousness is generating the large amount of the rationalization effect for the Toyota group. Toyota is further demanding that the various companies in the group reduce costs 15 percent in a three-year period starting in 1994. For this reason, the various companies will continue to proceed with rationalization such as a review of production processes and product development even in the March 1995 quarter. The amounts are estimated to be less than the previous term across the board, such as 8.5 billion yen for Aisin and 5.3 billion yen for Toyoda Automatic Loom Works. That is because "there are few new products this year incorporating rationalization effects from the development and design stage" (Toyoda Automatic Loom Works), and the effect of cost-reduction actions within existing product groups is gradually lessening. Moreover, even with rationalization, once there is a high yen, an exchange loss is generated due to the high yen, such as the 6.5 billion yen in the March 1994 quarter for Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, and the surrounding environment is grim such that a rationalization effect is canceled. Cheap import passenger cars have appeared, and imports of parts by automakers will increase further in the future. While prices are dropping and quantities are decreasing, auto parts manufacturers are plunging into an era when it is too much to handle by rationalization alone.
