FR941216-2-00074 FR941216-2-00043 All discharges must comply with the following permit requirements: (a) If analytical tests of Part I.A.3 reveal excessive benzene and naphthalene concentrations indicative of contamination from petroleum fuels, and the discharge will occur for thirty (30) days or less, the permittee shall comply only with the applicable effluent limitations and monitoring requirements in Part I.A.1 or I.A.2 for benzene, pH, and/or naphthalene and total lead. The commencement of the Part V biomonitoring program and Part I.B.3 EPA method 624 and 625 (one time analysis) is not required for this short-term activity. One (1) grab sample shall be analyzed per seven (7) days during the discharge period, and the total volume discharged shall be recorded. For discharges contaminated by petroleum fuels that last for less than a week, daily monitoring will be required for the applicable parameters. Upon receipt of written EPA notification of coverage that the NOI request is complete, these short-term discharges may commence. Discharge Monitoring Reports shall be submitted to EPA within thirty (30) days after termination of the discharge. (b) If contamination from sources other than petroleum contamination does exist, as indicated by the results of the analytical tests required by Part I. A.3 above, the discharge is not covered by this general permit. The operator shall apply for an individual NPDES permit at least one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the date a discharge to waters of the United States is expected. No discharge is permissible without an effective NPDES permit. (c) If analytical tests reveal no contamination exists from petroleum fuels or sources other than petroleum contamination as a result of the required analytical screening tests required in Part I. A.3, the permittee can commence discharge immediately and is covered by this permit without having to submit an NOI request for coverage to EPA, Region IV. A short summary of the proposed activity and copy of these analytical tests shall be sent to the same address specified in Part III.A one (1) week after discharge begins. These analytical tests shall be kept on site during discharge and made available to EPA, if requested. Additionally, no Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) forms are required to be submitted to EPA, Region IV. B. Other Requirements 1. Any more frequent effluent discharge monitoring required by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) for the parameters limited in this permit, or different parameters, shall be reported to the Permit Issuing Authority in accordance with the requirements of Part III of this permit. 2. Effluent limitations for combining contaminated groundwater pumped to above-ground storage tanks with contaminated groundwater from the site's recovery wells: The permittee shall notify FDEP of any intent to combine contaminated groundwater pumped to above-ground storage tanks with contaminated groundwater from the recovery well. Approval of this combined effluent discharge by FDEP will constitute approval to apply for coverage under this permit. 3. Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this permit or startup of discharge the permittee shall also submit the results of the following analyses. These analyses shall be performed on a representative sample of the groundwater effluent discharge, taken after final treatment. Required analyses (one time only): a. EPA Method 625_Acid and base/neutral extractable organics b. EPA Method 624_Purgeable Organics If such analyses required in Part B.3 above reveal toxic pollutants other than those regulated in Part I.A. or subsequent Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) tests reveal an LC 50 of 100% or less in a test of 96 hours duration or less, coverage under this general permit will be reviewed for termination by EPA Region IV Enforcement Section. 4. If the pH is monitored continuously, the pH values shall not deviate outside the required range more than 1% of the time in any calendar month; and no individual excursion shall exceed 60 minutes. An ``excursion'' is an unintentional and temporary incident in which the pH value of discharge wastewater exceeds the range set forth in this permit. C. Test Procedures 1. In performing the analysis for the dissolved constituents in the surface water and groundwater, the permittee shall use the guidelines recommended and described in FAC Sections 62&hyph;770.600(8)[a-d] of the Petroleum Contamination Cleanup Criteria (PCCC), amended February 20, 1990, or the most current edition.
