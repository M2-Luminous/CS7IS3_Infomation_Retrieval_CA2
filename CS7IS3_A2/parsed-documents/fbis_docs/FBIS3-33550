The legislators' patience was put to a severe test by the Army commander who the legislators say had given his word to attend this session. Senator Bernard Sansaricq has condemned the general's attitude. The president of the second Senate office could not contain his reprobation and anger. He had hoped for the formation of a new government as a solution to the political crisis. Edner Jean filed a report on the day in the Senate: [Begin recording] [Dupiton in Creole] The general did not give a date when he commented on the complexity of the case to me. I understood and did not ask him for a date. He told me only that he was considering the situation and that at the appropriate time, he would come because he understands. [end recording] [Jean in French] This report on the meeting planned with the Army commander in chief had the effect of putting a damper on the enthusiasm of the senators of GARD, Action Group for the Recovery and Defense of National Sovereignty, who finally revealed on 23 February the contents of the well-announced surprise -- formation of a new government to manage state matters. The convening of General Cedras was most likely planned as a catalyst to begin the process of definitely excluding President Aristide. However, the absence of the general came to disturb the plan already implemented by those senators, an affront for which Bernard Sansaricq will not forgive General Cedras. It is a serious insult. The Army commander in chief must give an account to the nation, asserted Sansaricq. Senator Sansaricq is willing to go to Army Headquarters to demand the resignation of Gen. Cedras. [passage omitted] This statement had the effect of shocking the Senate of the Republic, led for some time by just one political current, that of GARD. Most of the members of this body for the first time clearly dissociated themselves from the stance of their president. [passage omitted] Finally, Sen. Belizaire intervened at the podium, asking for the withdrawal from the agenda of the point concerning the attendance of Gen. Cedras, which would be postponed indefinitely. This does not detract from the determination of those senators to form a new government in the country. [end recording]
