According to ITAR-TASS, on the eve of the new year, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev expressed dissatisfaction with the directorate's activity at a meeting with journalists. In his opinion, under new conditions many personnel officers in generals' positions are still doing everything in an old-fashioned way, trying to work less with the soldiers and looking after higher command personnel better. At the same time the head of the military department was not uncomplimentary about the lower echelons of the army personnel department, which work with sergeants and other ranks. The reform will not affect the interests of this category of officer.
