Namboodiripad, said today that the opposition to India's signing of the GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] was likely to develop into a major political crisis for the Narasimha Rao Government, which is in a minority in the Rajya Sabha, report PTI and UNI. The GATT would cause amendments to several existing laws in India, and with the Congress(I) in a minority in Rajya Sabha there was no guarantee that the ruling party would emerge a victor in its legislative efforts in the Upper House, Mr Namboodiripad said. He was inaugurating a series of seminars, programmed by the Thiruvananthapuram Press Club. The opening seminar was on "GATT and Kerala." Mr Namboodiripad said apart from the fact that all the non-Congress(I) Opposition parties were against India signing the GATT, even within the Congress(I), leaders like Mr Arjun Singh were of the view that the Congress(I) should have attempted to evolve a consensus on the question of signing of the GATT. By signing the GATT which jeopardized the country's economic sovereignty, the Narasimha Rao Government had in one stroke jettisoned the positive aspects of the Nehruvian policies being pursued by the country, Mr Namboodiripad said. The signing of GATT had aggravated the negative aspects of these policies which the Communist Party had been opposing since the second Five-Year Plan, he said. The foreign investment in India was now more in the share market than in setting up new industries, he pointed out. Mr Namboodiripad added that even industrialists had expressed apprehension about the policies pursued by the Narasimha Rao Government. He said the Left parties had planned to launch in August a civil disobedience movement in which some 10 lakh people were expected to participate. The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] is chalking out a programme of action to mobilize public opinion against the GATT, the party spokesman, Mr K.L. Sharma, said here today. He said the BJP plans to have Jan Adalats, where the GATT issue would be taken up and its implications to the Nation's economic sovereignty would be publicized. The party workers would also court arrest, Mr Sharma told reporters. He said the programme to oppose the GATT outside Parliament would be drawn up by a three-member committee set up by the party. Mr Sharma reiterated the party's demand that the Government should hold a referendum on the issue instead of merely taking it up for discussion in Parliament. He said the GATT was one issue on which all the Opposition parties had a similar stand, but felt that the initiative for joint action should come from other political parties as well.
