FR940428-2-00106 FR940428-2-00052 Previously Published Notices of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The following notices were previously published as separate individual notices. The notice content was the same as above. They were published as individual notices either because time did not allow the Commission to wait for this biweekly notice or because the action involved exigent circumstances. They are repeated here because the biweekly notice lists all amendments issued or proposed to be issued involving no significant hazards consideration. For details, see the individual notice in the Federal Register on the day and page cited. This notice does not extend the notice period of the original notice.

Power Authority of the State of New York, Docket No. 50&hyph;286, Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3, Westchester County, New York Date of Amendment Request: March 24, 1994. Description of Amendment Request: The proposed amendment would revise section 6.0 (Administrative Controls). Specifically, the plant staff requirement (specified in Technical Specification (TS) 6.2.2.i) would be revised to temporarily allow the operations manager to have held a senior reactor operator (SRO) license at a pressurized water reactor (PWR) other than Indian Point 3. The TS currently requires the operations manager to have or have held an SRO license at Indian Point 3 only. This proposed change is needed to allow management changes at the facility in an effort to improve overall performance. The proposed changes would be in effect for a period ending 3 years after restart from the 1993/1994 Performance Improvement Outage. Date of Publication of Individual Notice in Federal Register : April 1, 1994 (59 FR 15464). Expiration Date of Individual Notice: May 3, 1994.

Capra Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments. The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for A Hearing in connection with these actions was published in the Federal Register as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applications for amendment, (2) the amendment, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document rooms for the particular facilities involved.
