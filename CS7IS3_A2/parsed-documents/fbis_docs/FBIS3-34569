His majesty reviewed the results of his recent visit to the United States, Austria, and Croatia. His majesty also reviewed the results of his recent visit to Syria. The discussion during the cabinet session also dealt with a number of domestic issues. His majesty talked about the importance of maintaining the people's water, food, and medicine supplies, as well as meeting their basic needs. The king noted that we are facing a phase of challenges, adding that the Jordanian people should be well prepared to face this phase. Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali briefed his majesty on the mechanism through which the best services are being rendered to people in all fields of life. King Husayn told journalists at the end of the cabinet session that every effort is being made to provide the best possible services to the Jordanian citizens, noting that we all always work to underscore the need to care for them. [Begin recording] [Husayn] This was an opportunity to brief the brothers on a part of what took place. Naturally, the prime minister was abreast of all that took place during my absence. Again, I underscored my absolute confidence in, and my gratitude and appreciation for, the prime minister and this government for the services they are providing to the homeland under these delicate circumstances and with our great hopes for the future. Naturally, we reviewed many projects and many studies in general, and some in detail. [Dhiyab] Your Majesty, in your capacity as the sponsor of Yemeni reconciliation, what are the most recent developments? [Husayn] We hope our brothers in Yemen will succeed in ending what they are dealing with in this phase. We also hope that we will have the honor of hosting their meeting in Amman to save Yemen now and open the road for a prosperous future, God willing. We have given our utmost, and we will be very happy to see an opportunity to resolve and tackle the existing problems within the Arab community. We responded throughout this to the desire of the two parties of our brothers in Yemen. We always appreciate the confidence they have placed in us. We ask God to grant us success in assuming our duty toward them. [Reporter] Your Majesty, how do you view the future of the peace process in light of the recent developments and in light of your recent efforts represented in your visit to the United States and to Damascus? And what are the results of the last round of the Arab-Israeli peace talks? [Husayn] I believe that as things go on, we monitor what is happening within our utmost capabilities. Our basic stand is to support the Palestinian brothers with regard to their rights on their national soil. I cannot say that the present coordination is at it should be. With regard to Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon coordination is normal. Praise be to God, the situation is good, reassuring, and promising. The recent meetings achieved some progress. With regard to Jordan, we concentrate on the agenda and on its topics. As with regard to the whole world, everybody hopes that this march, which has passed the point of no return, will continue until we reach a just and comprehensive solution that will be accepted by the coming generations. [Reporter] Sir, what are the most prominent topics you discussed during your visit to sisterly Syria? [Husayn] First, I had a duty to fulfill toward a big and dear brother who was hard hit by a mournful event, which hit me and hit us all, as a result of his loss of his son, whom I also considered as my son. So, I had to pay this visit immediately after my return. We also reviewed the peace process, bilateral cooperation, all issues in the region, the contacts we made in the world both on the part of his excellency the president and on my part. I emerged very satisfied with the results of this visit. [Reporter] Your Majesty, with regard to martyr Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah and the Lebanese Government's arrest of the criminals who carried out this operation. What are the measures to be taken by the Jordanian Government regarding this? [Husayn] We are following the issue with great concern and determination to reach what is required regarding such a hideous crime. We appreciate the efforts that the brothers in Lebanon have exerted and are exerting to reveal all the objectives and dimensions of this crime. I cannot say more than this at this point.
