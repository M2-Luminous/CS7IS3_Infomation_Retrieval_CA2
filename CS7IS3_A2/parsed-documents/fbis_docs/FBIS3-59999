In the first 11 months of this year, 1,458 people died as a result of drug consumption. That is a 22-percent drop compared to the same period of the previous year when 1,870 drug victims died. This was told to DIE WELT by the parliamentary state secretary in the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Eduard Lintner (CSU) [Christian Social Union], the Federal Government's representative in charge of drugs. The number of first-time users has also dropped--by about 10 percent from 11,892 to 10,724. The largest decline was in heroin consumption--down 21 percent. By constrast, the authorities registered an enormous increase in first-time users of cocaine--up 26 percent. Lintner called this development ``extremely worrisome.'' The effect of cocaine is often underestimated. It leads to a strong psychological dependency, to exaggerated sensations and even to extreme overconfidence. In addition, cocaine consumption also causes physical impairments--from sleep disturbances to paralysis and cardiac arrest. Cocaine addicts are very difficult to identify, said Lintner as an explanation for the difficulties in coping with the problem. Cocaine is primarily consumed by older people already well-established professionally. They are no longer to be found only in the upper classes, but increasingly also in the middle-income groups. They are ``not easily accessible'' to offers of therapy. Besides that, admits Lintner, so far there is no specific therapy for cocaine addicts, and especially no substitute such as methadone for heroin addicts. Lintner rejected the demand that the state dispense drugs under medical supervision: ``This practice would mean continuation of the addiction. That cannot be the intent.'' The goal must be to enable addicts to live a life without drugs.
