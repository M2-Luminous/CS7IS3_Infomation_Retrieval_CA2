In the course of shifting to civilian production, U.S. arms industry changed in two ways. First, it made a policy change; second, it made technical changes. In February 1993, shortly after President Clinton took office, he announced a new technology program in California. The program included the adoption of some major actions to shift federal institutions which originally concentrated on weaponry and energy research to the development of civilian commercial technologies, such as information, biological, superconductor, and environmental protection technologies. Public opinion in the United States held that industrial policy might "give rise to a major change in the balanced relationship between civilian research and development and military research and development." In March 1993, the Clinton administration announced a five-year plan for shifting the arms industry to civilian production between 1993 and 1997. The key points of this plan are as follows: Investing $20 billion in five years to support the cooperation of various research organs of the government and industrial circles (including the arms industry) in developing technologies serving both military and civilian purposes; promoting commercialization of military technology to promote economic growth and also protect the foundation of the national defense industry; giving vocational retraining to people who lose their jobs in the arms industry, and helping communities which suffer losses due to the closedown of industrial arms enterprises. For this purpose, the government planned to allocate $5.2 billion for job placement for personnel, and $4.7 billion to develop projects serving both military and civilian purposes. In addition, last year, the United States scrapped the extremely costly "Star Wars" program which had been carried out for 10 years, suspended construction of the super-class super collider, and reduced the scale of the "Liberty" space station. This indicated that the Clinton administration laid greater stress on the civilian arena when arranging the key points of scientific research and technological development and the movement of budgetary funds. The gigantic arms industry in the United States was the outcome of the arms race in the period of the Cold War. Most advanced technologies in the United States were first developed and applied in the military field before they were applied to civilian projects. However, in the new circumstances, although military strength remains of great importance for the United States, the existence of a gigantic industrial arms system was obviously no longer suited to the new situation. In order to increase its strength as the dominant power in international affairs, the United States needed the backing of great economic strength. Thus, it was quite natural that its national defense industry was shifted to serve civilian purposes. As far as the change in production was concerned, in the words of people in the circles of the U.S. arms industry, they were going to set up "more flexible production lines." They held that the change in production did not merely mean the production of new products; instead "the inflexible production lines and hard tools should be replaced with soft tools, flexible machines, and fast-reacting work teams." Thus, more than one product could be manufactured with the same equipment. That is to say, the main orientation in the shift of production in the arms industry was to develop technologies that served both military and civilian purposes. Contractors who previously only received orders from the Pentagon were encouraged to develop technologies that could be applied to civilian production and would also be able to serve national defense purposes. The "double-purpose" orientation was fully stressed in the Clinton administration's five-year plan. The technology reinvestment part of the five-year plan included eight specific projects, and six of them were directly related to the "double-purpose" pattern. For example, the "key technological cooperation plan for national defense and civilian purposes," the "commercial-military integrated cooperation plan," and the "plan for promoting the dual-purpose technologies," all served the purpose of developing technologies which had commercial value and also had the prospect of being applied to the military field. In the course of shifting military industry and technology to civilian production, American scientists and technologists were aware that special attention had to be paid to structural change in basic research; otherwise, the momentum of development would not last long. In addition, in the course of structural change, a large number of structural layoffs may happen. This is a major problem concerning jobs for 1 million civilian staffers and 1 million military personnel, and must be properly solved.
