FR940616-0-00073 FR940616-0-00009 24. We have decided to rely upon the latest Arbitron market data to determine a television station's market ranking for purposes of assessing regulatory fees. These rankings may be found in the Television and Cable Factbook published by Warren Publishing. Changes in market rankings may affect regulatory fee amounts for the following fiscal year. 25. Television Construction Permits. For FY 1994, persons holding a construction permit for a new VHF television station, in any size market, are subject to a $4,000 annual regulatory fee per outstanding permit. UHF construction permits for stations in any size market will be assessed a $3,200 annual regulatory fee. Upon issuance of an operating license to cover the construction permit, this construction permit fee is no longer applicable. Instead, licensees will pay a regulatory fee amount based upon the licensed station's market ranking, as described above. d. Low Power TV, TV Translator, and TV Booster Stations 26. Under Part 74 of the Commission's Rules, low power UHF and VHF TV stations operate with a transmitter power output limited to 0.01kw for a UHF facility and, generally, 1kw for a VHF facility, and may retransmit the programs and signals of a full-power TV broadcast station, originate programming, and/or operate as a subscription service. TV translator stations are authorized to retransmit the programs and signals of TV broadcast stations without significantly altering the characteristic of the original signal other than its frequency and amplitude, for the purpose of providing TV reception to the general public. 27. TV booster stations are operated by the licensee of a full service TV broadcast station to retransmit the programs and signals of the licensee's station by amplifying and reradiating such signals, without significantly altering the characteristics of the original signal other than its amplitude. For FY 1994, licensees of these secondary television broadcast stations will be assessed a $135 annual regulatory fee per license. e. Broadcast Auxiliary Stations 28. Licensees of remote pickup stations, aural broadcast auxiliary stations, television broadcast auxiliary stations, and low power auxiliary stations, authorized under Part 74 of the Commission's Rules, will be assessed a $25 per license annual regulatory fee for FY 1994. These auxiliary stations are associated with a particular television or radio broadcast station. Hence, those licensees will be required to pay the required regulatory fees for each auxiliary license they hold. Individual users under 47 CFR subpart D, F and H will similarly have to pay the required regulatory fee for each auxiliary license they hold. f. International (HF) Broadcast Stations International broadcast stations are licensed to operate on frequencies in the 5,950 khz to 26,100 khz band to provide service to the general public in foreign countries. For FY 1994, each international broadcast licensee will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $200 per license. 3. Cable Services Bureau a. Cable Antenna Relay Service 30. Cable television antenna relay service (``CARS'') stations are used to transmit television and related audio signals, signals of AM and FM broadcast stations and cablecasting from the point of reception to a terminal point from where the signals are distributed to the public by cable television systems. See 47 C.F.R. Part 78. For FY 1994, each CARS licensee will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $220 per license. b. Cable Television Systems 31. For FY 1994, each cable television system, as that term is defined in section 76.5 of our rules, will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $.37 per subscriber. 4 4 The term ``subscriber'' is defined in ยง76.5 of the Commission's Rules. 47 CFR 76.5. 32. We will allow installment payments for these regulatory fees if the annual fee of a cable television system or a group of commonly owned systems aggregating their regulatory fees exceeds $18,500.
