Together with other members of the armenian delegation, he returned to Yerevan late at night on 17 May. Interviewed by ITAR-TASS at the Yerevan airport, the minister stressed that the meeting was on the whole normal. "Our desire to achieve peace in the region was echoed by the Russian side, which did everything it could as mediator to settle the Karabakh conflict," Sargsyan stated. "God knows that the Azeri decision to sign the offered document or not did not depend on us," he added. Touching on the Azeri delegation's stand at the Moscow meeting, the Armenian defence minister expressed the view that the Azeri side would not be able to refuse for long to sign the document and would finally quite soon. "The current refusal is a temporary obstacle," Sargsyan believes. "The peace-making process in the region will without doubt continue. There is no alternative to it," the Armenian defence minister stated.
