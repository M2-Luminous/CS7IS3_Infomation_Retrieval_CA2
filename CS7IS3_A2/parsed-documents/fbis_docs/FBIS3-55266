It is not ruled out that in connection with the forthcoming parliamentary elections in a few months' time the wave of terror in the republic could rise even higher -- some political adversaries could settle accounts with the aid of weapons.... Street hooliganism and thefts have become everyday occurrences in the life of Makhachkala and none of the city's inhabitants has felt safe. That is why the republic's leadership has deemed it necessary to take emergency measures to combat crime. From the first days of the New Year militia patrols have received the right to check the documents of all citizens and to search all vehicles. Those who have come to Makhachkala for no specific purpose can be expelled from the city within 24 hours. The special regime has been introduced for six months, and time will tell whether it is extended. According to Magomed Magomedov, the head of the city administration, and Gadzhimagomed Gadzhimagomedov, chief of the internal affairs main administration, the militia has embarked on the special regime program in a state of full combat readiness. Reinforced detachments of internal affairs main administration staffers are serving at stations, markets, hotels, and airports. They have already made a "haul": Several owners of unregistered weapons have been arrested. Understandably, the measures which have been adopted have been greeted with mixed feelings by the city's inhabitants: It is unpleasant for anyone to be subjected to total checks and to get involved in roundups, on the other hand nor could they tolerate the criminal anarchy. Indeed, the experience of the emergency situation in Moscow has shown that it is usually only the small "minnows" who get caught in the nets of such street checks, the big "sharks" are seldom caught without painstaking searching and investigation work. However that may be, it is not out of the question that the Makhachkala experiment will be a positive or negative example to other cities, where crime is also rampant. In January it will already be clear whether it has given a good account of itself.
