The support came at a meeting of a U.N. working group deliberating the reforms, including the question of expansion of Security Council permanent membership. It is believed to be the first time that Britain has cited Germany and Japan by name in supporting an expansion of permanent members beyond the current five -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the U.S. The sources said France also indicated support for Germany and Japan by saying permanent membership should be offered to countries that have considerable influence globally and a will to maintain international security. Aside from the five permanent members, representatives of some 10 other countries made statements on the question of restructuring the Security Council. The working group, which held its first meeting last month, is scheduled to submit an interim report on its deliberations to the General Assembly's regular session beginning in the third week of September.
