Evangelista] [Excerpts] Cashiered Army Col. Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan, leader of the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa (RAM) [Revolutionary Nationalist Alliance] said yesterday his group was "getting discouraged and losing confidence" with the way government peace negotiators are handling the peace talks with military rebels. He stressed, however, that RAM would not abandon its hope to reach a peace accord with the government, and that they will wait for another six months for the government to act concretely on the issue. [passage omitted] "We are beginning to be discouraged but we are not discarding the peace process. Even if they don't know what to do with the peace process, we are not going to give up," Honasan said. "Mukhang wala na namang plano ang pamahalaan ... mukhang nagbobolahan na naman. Gusto naming malaman kung ano talaga ang gusto nilang mangyari sa peace process," [It seems that the government has no plans ... looks like it is back to deception. We want to know what they really want to happen with the peace process] he added. [passage omitted] "One year na kaming nag-uusap ... pero ang narating lang namin procedures ... saan gagawin ... sino ang magho-host ng merienda. Tapos, napapagbintangan kami na kami pa raw ang nagpapabagal pero lahat naiprisinta na namin," [We have been talking for one year ... but what we have achieved are only procedures ... where to hold ... who will take charge of the snacks. Afterwhich, we are blamed for delaying the talks when we have already presented everything] he explained. He said they have already given five talking points with the government but it remained enacted upon. [sentence as published] His request for provision of bodyguards for protection, was approved in principle by President Ramos but this also remained unheeded. "MNLF [Moro National Liberation Front] Chairman Nur Misuari moves around in Mindanao with many armed bodyguards. Pero kami na nangunguna, kami pa ang hindi bigyan ng ganuong konsiderasyon," [But we who talked peace with the government ahead of the MNLF are not given such consideration] Honasan said. Asked by the STANDARD if they have a time frame within which they would seek other options concerning the peace talks, Honasan said: "Siguro ibig naming tingnan 'yung kalagitnaan ng taong ito para mabasa natin kung babagal ito at kung may pinanggagalingan ang katapatan nila." [I think we will just watch at the middle of this year to determine if the peace process slows down and if they are really sincere.] What options they would make in case the peace talks fail? He said: Kung hihinto? Hindi ... ayaw naming isipin 'yon. Kapag huminto ito ay mas grabe ang mangyayari." [If it stops? No ... we do not want to think about it. If this stops, the worse will happen.] RAM-YOU (Young Officers Union) leader Capt. Emil Ong said there are many issues that have to be discussed in the peace talks that are being ignored. Ong, who was with Honasan at UST, declined to give the exact number of RAM forces at present but said only 20 percent of the entire RAM forces had been mobilized during the December 1989 coup attempt. Honasan laments the fact that some of his men are still in jail despite a preliminary agreement reached last 20 December 1992 that all detained RAM men will be released from detention.
