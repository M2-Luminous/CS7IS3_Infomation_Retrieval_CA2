FR941125-2-00076 FR941125-2-00055 3. North Dakota will revise its regulations to incorporate the Federal design criteria relative to protection of ground-water (40 CFR 258.40 (a), (c), and (d)). 4. North Dakota will revise its regulations to incorporate the Federal ground-water monitoring requirements, including no-migration demonstrations, scheduling, and alternative schedules (40 CFR 258.50(b) through 258.50(d)); number, depth, and location of wells, and the use of multiunit ground-water systems (40 CFR 258.51 (a) and (b)); ground-water sampling analytical methods (40 CFR 258.53(b)); background and statistical procedures (40 CFR 258.53 (e) through (i)); detection monitoring (40 CFR 258.54); assessment monitoring (40 CFR 258.55); assessment of corrective measures (40 CFR 258.56); selection of remedy (40 CFR 258.57); and, implementation of the corrective action program (40 CFR 258.58). 5. North Dakota will revise its regulations to incorporate the Federal closure and post-closure care requirements, specifically final cover estimate (40 CFR 258.60(c)(2)); State notifications (40 CFR 258.60 (d) and (e)); post-closure contact (40 CFR 258.61(c)(2)); and State notifications (40 CFR 258.61 (d) and (e)). 6. North Dakota will revise its regulations to incorporate financial assurance requirements for closure, post-closure, and corrective action (40 CFR 258.71 through 258.73). On August 25, 1994, the State of North Dakota submitted an application for full program adequacy determination. EPA reviewed North Dakota's application and tentatively determined that all portion of the State's Subtitle D program will ensure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve a State/Tribe's MSWLF program, the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If a sufficient number of people express interest in participating in a hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice, the Region will hold a hearing on January 12, 1995 at the North Dakota Department of Health Environmental Training Center, 2639 East Main Avenue, Bismarck, North Dakota 58501 at 10:00 a.m. At a meeting planned for late December 1994, the North Dakota State Health Council is expected to approve changes concerning proposed amendments to the North Dakota Administrative Code, Article 33&hyph;20, Solid Waste Management and Land Protection rules. At another meeting planned for mid-April 1995, the North Dakota State Health Council is expected to approve changes concerning proposed amendments to the North Dakota Administrative Code, Article 33&hyph;16, Standards for Quality of Ground-water Rules. If the State takes the necessary actions to bring the ground-water protection (design), ground-water monitoring, and corrective action portions of their rules into full compliance with Federal Criteria, EPA is proposing full program approval for the State of North Dakota. If the State of North Dakota does not take the above actions, EPA will not approve their ground-water protection, ground-water monitoring, and corrective action requirements, and a partial program approval will be issued. North Dakota has not asserted jurisdiction over ``Indian Country'' in its application for adequacy determination. Accordingly, this approval does not extend to lands within ``Indian Country'' in North Dakota. Until EPA approves a State or Tribal MSWLF permitting program in North Dakota for any part of ``Indian Country,'' as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151, the requirements of 40 CFR part 258 will, after October 9, 1993, automatically apply to that area. Thereafter, the requirements of 40 CFR part 258 will apply to all owners/operators of MSWLFs located in any part of ``Indian Country'' that is not covered by an approved State or Tribal MSWLF permitting program. EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and during any public hearing held. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for North Dakota's program. EPA will make a final decision on whether or not to approve North Dakota's program and will give notice of it in the Federal Register . The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments. Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF Criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF Criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991). Compliance With Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this tentative approval will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This proposed notice, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. Authority: This notice is issued under the authority of sections 2002, 4005, and 4010 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended; 42 U.S.C. 6912, 6945, and 6949(a). Dated: November 14, 1994.
