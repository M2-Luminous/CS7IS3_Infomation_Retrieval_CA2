FBIS4-58396 "drnes086_n_94005" FBIS-NES-94-086 Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 LEBANON Hizballah: Christopher Seeks To `Divide' Arabs Hizballah: Christopher Seeks To `Divide' Arabs NC0305132394 Beirut AL-SAFIR in Arabic 30 Apr 94 p 3 NC0305132394 Beirut AL-SAFIR Arabic BFN [Text] Hizballah has stated that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the region is not designed to overcome the obstacles hindering the bilateral negotiations but to further divide the Arab ranks. It stressed that Washington is only pursuing its traditional policy of fragmenting and undermining the Arab position and enhancing the circumstances conducive to imposing a settlement according to Zionist conditions. Hizballah released a statement yesterday on Christopher's tour, saying: Christopher's tour comes at a time when there are expectations of a possible relaxation in the negotiating process after the complications caused by the massacres that the Zionists committed in the occupied territories, notably the massacre in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, which left more than 60 Palestinians dead and hundreds wounded and maimed. Those who are optimistic about Christopher's tour believe that U.S. diplomacy is again focusing on the conflict in the region, particularly in view of the approaching date for the signing of the limited administrative self-rule agreement between the Zionists and 'Arafat. The statement said: Washington may consider the signing of the agreement as an accomplishment that it has long waited for and that it may pave the way for further breakthroughs on the other negotiating tracks. It seems obvious, however, that Christopher is not coming to the region to help surmount the obstacles hampering the negotiations, as reported, but to focus on enhancing the policy of dividing the Arab stance. The U.S. secretary of state wants to put more pressure on the Gulf countries to abolish all boycotting of Israel and, consequently, to demand that they exert all possible efforts to pressure Syria to respond to the Zionist conditions for a settlement. Regarding Jordan, Christopher will use the lifting of the siege of Aqaba port not in return for Jordan's renewed participation in the negotiations, as certain people imagine, but for signing a bilateral agreement with the Zionist entity. The statement added: Regarding Lebanon, the U.S. conditions were set before Christopher's tour of the region. These conditions were declared by enemy Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin: "Halting and disarming the resistance, assimilating Lahd's militiamen, and initiating negotiations leading to security arrangements in south Lebanon." The U.S. ambassador in Beirut reasserted the same conditions during his recent meetings with Lebanese officials. The statement added: Regarding the Palestinian track, the Americans show their satisfaction with the approaching date for the signing of the self-rule agreement because it reflects Yasir 'Arafat's acceptance of the maximum Zionist conditions and minimum prerequisites for the limited self-rule. Hizballah noted that Washington, which claims to sponsor the peace process, is in fact pursuing its traditional policy of fragmenting and undermining the Arab position and promoting the circumstances conducive to imposing a settlement according to the Zionist conditions. We emphasize that Washington fully adopts this policy, otherwise where are the U.S. commitments that have been declared since the Madrid conference, which were reasserted at the Geneva summit? We believe that these commitments are only cosmetic to improve the image of the U.S. role and conceal its truth and hazards. The statement said: In the past we warned that the fragile Arab situation will not enable the Arabs to stand up to the U.S.-Zionist onslaught, which at one time seeks to take the Arabs unilaterally and at another to pressure the Arabs to normalize ties with Israel. This means that the Arab negotiating policy has never embodied its own interests or was able to cope with this stage of the confrontation. Hence the importance of the role that the resistance is playing in south Lebanon and the intifadah in the occupied Palestinian territories in confronting the policy of penetrating the Arab ranks, taking them unilaterally, or exhorting them to normalize ties with Israel, and in offsetting Arab defeats. The resistance in the south and the intifadah in the occupied territories are making progress to offset the astonishing concessions being made by the ilk of 'Arafat and certain Arab countries, particularly the Gulf countries.
