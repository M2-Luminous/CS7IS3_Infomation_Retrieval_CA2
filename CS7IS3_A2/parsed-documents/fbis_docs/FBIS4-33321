Questioned by numerous journalists at the Yellow Room of the Presidential Palace after signing the Chapultepec Declaration, Endara said he believes the invasion of Panama in December 1989 did not take place because of a right or a duty. "We did not ask for the invasion... it took place... historic situations, which will be up to analysts to study." According to the Panamanian president, between Haiti and Panama, there are distant but similar conditions, which he discussed with U.S. Vice President Al Gore during a recent dinner in Tegucigalpa. He noted that on that occasion Gore said Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide won his country's elections with 70 percent of the votes, a similar percentage with which he (Endara) won the 1989 elections from his opponent, Carlos Duque from the National Liberation Coalition. "I am not calling for an invasion of Haiti, but I do not exclude it either," the president said. When asked again if he would support an invasion, he said no, but that if the United States invades the island, he will not condemn it.
