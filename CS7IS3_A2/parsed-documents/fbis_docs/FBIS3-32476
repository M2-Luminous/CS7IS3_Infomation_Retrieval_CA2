The formal independence we still have is being taken away and even the term is outdated, he said. The president warned that all of this is neoliberalism, a conflict of interests among huge economic blocs because it is a policy that will be applied worldwide. Any country that wishes to industrialize still has, perhaps, the hope of acquiring industries that pollute the environment or require lots of cheap labor, he said. The head of state said it is unfair to make an ant compete and fight with an elephant, and he noted that developed nations have the monopoly on advanced technology, scientific research, and production automation. The Cuban president asked: The Third World asked for border openings and a lifting of tariffs, but what did it get? They want to buy everything in our countries, he warned. They want to be the owners of the principal industries, with which they would undermine our independence, not only in a real and objective manner but also in a formal manner. With the disappearance of the socialist bloc, the balance of forces in the world was lost, he said. Unipolar power is invading all fields, he said. They want us to see what interests them through the use of advertisements and commercials. They control newscasts through the use of multinational news programs, he said. They do not advertise Superbarrio (popular Mexican character present at the meeting) but Superman, he said. As for the application of neoliberal policies in the former USSR and East Europe, Fidel Castro said it has created a real disaster and people are starting to realize it was a real mistake to brutally apply IMF and World Bank recipes there. Social deterioration and increased unemployment have led to the rise of strong nationalist feelings and all kinds of reactions of the desperate people of the former USSR, according to the Cuban president, who said not everything was deficient in that economy. In another part of his speech and in response to a participant's proposal to demand the democratization of the United Nations and the Security Council, Fidel Castro said this UN organization should have at least two Latin American and two African members while India deserves its own seat because of its size and population. Perhaps it would be unrealistic to ask at this time for the disappearance of the veto but, in principle, we oppose the Security Council members' veto rights. As for the event ending today after four days of sessions, the top Cuban leader said he was impressed with the unity shown, especially with regard to neoliberalism, despite the wide range of political and social tendencies represented in the more than 1,000 participants present in the event.
