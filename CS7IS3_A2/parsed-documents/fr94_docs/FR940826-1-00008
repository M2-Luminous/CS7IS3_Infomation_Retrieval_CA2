FR940826-1-00008 FR940826-1-00001 The Friendship witness offered testimony that demonstrated that the add-back provision resulted in price enhancement of the Class II price above the intended 10-cent target differential. Additionally, this witness testified that when the Class II price is dramatically higher than the Class III&hyph;A price, the economic incentive exists for using nonfat dry milk (NFDM) in place of fresh fluid milk. According to this witness, while increasing the price of Class II milk may increase the blend price producers receive in the short term, the long-term effect will be to promote the use of NFDM for manufacturing Class II products. Even if the Class II price had not increased, said the Friendship witness, the decreasing value placed on butterfat has had the effect of increasing the cost of a hundredweight of Class II skim milk. Because the cost of milk is the single most significant factor affecting the price of most finished Class II products, especially cottage cheese, this absolute increase in cost is staggering and sales have declined, said the witness. According to the witness, any resulting decline in the use of milk for skim-based Class II products would yield a lower price to dairy farmers and would compound the continuing shift of milk value from the fat to skim component. While the Friendship witness applauded the advance pricing feature of Class II milk, he asserted that the add-back provision of current Class II pricing effectively obliterates any benefits of advance pricing, citing that prices have become volatile. This volatility has caused confusion in the marketplace because Class II prices too often move completely independent of the Class III and Class I price, according to this witness. The result of this confusion, said the witness, is manufacturers attempting to quote a price based upon a forecast, only to rescind because of a large movement in prices due to the add-back feature of current Class II milk pricing. This reality, said the witness, has implications at the consumer level because special featured prices on products that are offered to supermarket chains to promote sales must be guaranteed well in advance so that advertising and related promotional business can be planned. The witness sees the result of current pricing practices as lower Class II product sales and lower returns to dairy farmers. The Friendship witness testified that their proposal achieves the Department's intent that the Class II price be Class III plus ten cents. The witness said that adoption of any other proposal would deviate from this intent. Further, said the witness, supply and demand conditions, at least in Order 2, do not warrant any increase in the Class II price. Support for the 10-cent differential level for Class II milk was offered from Kraft General Foods (Kraft). The Kraft witness testified that current Class II pricing has not achieved the targeted Class II differential of ten cents above the Class III price. Rather, it has exceeded the intended differential, and the difference has been compounded in recent years. On a month-to-month basis, said Kraft, the advance Class II price formula has resulted in gross distortions between the Class II and Class III price in the amount of difference and the direction of price movements. The Kraft witness expressed disagreement with the MIF/IICA and NMPF proposal only from the view that the appropriate differential level should be ten cents and not thirty cents. The witness noted that current Class II pricing has resulted in an effective Class II differential level of almost thirty cents. This is not what should be adopted as the Class II differential because the effective thirty cents is a result of the failure of the formula used to compute the Class II price, he said. According to the Kraft witness, it is one thing to achieve enhancement of the minimum regulated price by mistake and quite another to do so by design. Like the Friendship witness, the Kraft witness drew heavily on previous decisions that reiterated that the appropriate Class II price be the Class III price plus ten cents. This witness was of the opinion that supply and demand conditions did not warrant any increase in the current target differential. Like the Friendship witness, the Kraft witness joined in the concern that if the Class II differential level is increased above the current intended 10-cent level, there would likely be increased substitution of NFDM for fluid milk in Class II products. Kraft also agreed with Friendship that the add-back provision should be eliminated. The witness from Galloway Company offered testimony in support of Proposal Two. Much of this witness's testimony supported testimony of the Friendship and Kraft witnesses and further elaborated on the concern for the substitution of NFDM for fluid milk in the manufacture of Class II products. Noting the wide price disparity between Class III&hyph;A and Class II, this witness said that processors will make their ingredient selection based on arbitrary and capricious pricing regulations if the Class II price is increased. Increasing the Class II price would not enhance producer revenue because of the ability to substitute lower-priced ingredients in the manufacture of Class II products.
