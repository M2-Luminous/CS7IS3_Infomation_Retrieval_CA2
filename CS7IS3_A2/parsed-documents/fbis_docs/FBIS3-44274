Government radio reported that the committee of deputies was set up following a meeting of representatives from the main opposition party, the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development [MCDDI] of Bernard Kolelas, and President Pascal Lissouba's party, and the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy, UPADES. The MCDDI activists are mostly from the Pool Region, around the capital, while those from UPADES are from the regions of Niari, Bouenza, and Lekoumou. The committee, which is headed by Simon Diassakoula, an MCDDI deputy, is charged with initiating peace efforts in the four regions and the capital, where their citizens are fighting in the southern district. Those regions were affected by acts of violence, mainly in June and July 1994 during the first round of the early legislative elections, which were challenged by the opposition. At least 30 people were reportedly killed during those events. In Brazzaville, about 115 deaths were reported in the fighting, which took place from mid-December 1993 to early January between the militias of the opposition and presidential camp.
