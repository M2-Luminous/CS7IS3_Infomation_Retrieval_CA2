Nikolay Kamov and Klara Marinova are the old-new BSP spokesmen. Ten persons were elected members of the BSP Executive Bureau. In addition to those 10 members, Zhan Videnov, chairman of the BSP Supreme Council, and Nora Ananieva, chairperson of the Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy [PSSD], are also members of the BSP Executive Bureau by virtue of the posts they hold. Thus the new Executive Bureau consists of 18 members. During the discussion of the membership of the Executive Bureau of the BSP Supreme Council, an objection was expressed regarding the fact that most of the candidates are people's representatives. The proposal to observe the principle of the regional representation was rejected. Several candidates withdrew their candidacy, others were rejected, and new candidates were nominated. The list proposed by Zhan Videnov was slightly amended. The new names on this list are Yanaki Stoilov, Violeta Ivanova from Pernik, and Miroslav Popov. Already at the beginning of the discussion Zhan Videnov stated that he had intended to propose Yanaki Stoilov, but was not able to meet him and talk to him. Zlatimir Orsov withdrew his candidacy for private reasons. Georgi Pirinski also withdrew his candidacy in a categorical manner and explained this by the fundamental differences in anything related to the party's economic policy. Ivelin Nikolov, chairman of the BSP Gabrovo City Organization, reported the wish of the BSP Gabrovo organization not to elect Krasimir Premyanov as a member of the Executive Bureau because of his work style. According to Nora Ananieva, certain changes in the PSSD leadership could be expected because several members are also members of the Executive Bureau and thus they would be too busy. The participants in the plenum of the BSP Supreme Council elected the BSP Supreme Council leading organs -- 15 commissions and their leaderships. The commission chairmen will propose their memberships. After a discussion by the Executive Bureau they will be approved by the Supreme Council at one of its next meetings. The BSP Supreme Council instructed the Executive Bureau to make the necessary changes in the BSP registration which spring from the decisions of the 41st BSP Congress, in accordance with Article 10 of the Political Parties Bill. The BSP Supreme Council instructed BSP Chairman Zhan Videnov to prepare a draft program for the Supreme Council's work during the second half of 1994, which will be discussed at the next Supreme Council plenum, at which the BSP structure, budget, and payroll will also be updated. After the plenum the new membership of the Executive Bureau met. On 14 June the Executive Bureau will issue its general assessment of the congress' work, spokesman Nikolay Kamov said. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Membership of the BSPSupreme Council Executive Bureau | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ex officio: Zhan Vasilev Videnov, Supreme Council chairman; Nora Krachunova | |Ananieva, PSSD chairman | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Elected | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Votes For |Votes Against | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Deputy chairmen | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Georgi Sedefchov Purvanov|90 |12 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Doncho Donchev Konakchiev|57 |45 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Krasimir Andreev Premyan-|55 |47 | |ov | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yanaki Boyanov Stoilov |85 |17 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Spokesmen | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nikolay Georgiev Kamov |94 |8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Klara Vulova Marinova |85 |17 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Members | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Anzhel Raymond Vagenshta-|95 |7 | |yn | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Anton Marinov Grigorov |94 |8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vladimir Vladimirov Tope-|55 |47 | |ncharov | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Violeta Vasileva Ivanona |68 |34 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kiril Stoyanov Zhelev |94 |8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lyubomir Panayotov Kolar-|83 |19 | |ov | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Miroslav Kostadinov Popov|62 |40 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nikola Petrov Koychev |97 |5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nikolay Kirilov Dobrev |86 |16 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yuriy Mitkov Borisov |82 |20 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
