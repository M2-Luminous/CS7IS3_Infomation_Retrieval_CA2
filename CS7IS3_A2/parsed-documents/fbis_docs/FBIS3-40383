Employment followed suit, with an eight percent decline. New layoffs should affect 10 percent of the personnel next year. "The year 1994 will be still more difficult than last year." While giving this warning, Amaury Halna du Fretay, president of the GIFAS Equipment Group, is aware that the two leading indicators of the future of his branch have stopped deteriorating. According to the new government, the defense equipment budget, the famous Title 5, was increased by 5.7 percent, to Fr103 billion. Although we could argue that this new budget conceals a Fr5.5-billion carryover of last year's unused appropriations and that, in substance, it is just barely stable in current francs, we must acknowledge that, from this point of view, France is treating her industry better than her neighbors treat theirs. For instance, the British defense equipment budget for the year 1993-1994 was cut by 3.7 percent, down to 9.9 billion pounds (Fr87 billion). As for Germany, its defense budget has already been cut by 21 percent since 1991, and will be cut by another 2.5 percent next year, dropping to 48.6 billion German marks [DM] (Fr168 billion). The German government decided to cut back the Eurofighter-2000 budget to DM520 million instead of the DM820 it had promised or the DM890 deemed necessary by German manufacturers participating in the program. The other indicator, that of the Airbus production rate, is now stable. The European consortium maintains its 1994 forecast at 12 units per month. Still, it would seem that this forecast includes future (and therefore hypothetical) orders from the Saudia airline. Although the two main indicators of the branch seem to have stopped their descent into the red, Amaury Halna du Fretay promised "more layoffs, more employment adjustment plans, and more companies filing for bankruptcy." This statement is paradoxical only at first sight. Actually, the aircraft industry is a long-cycle industry. Decisions made today will take several years to bear fruit. The government is fully aware of it: It submitted a higher Title-5 budget and practically at the same time it announced that the nuclear aircraft carrier and, later on, the Rafale program, would be delayed by six months as a result of the previous government's decision, made in early 1993, to stagger budget appropriations. In addition, our neighbors' defense budget cuts, far from causing French manufacturers to rejoice, raise concerns for all programs carried out with European cooperation. Faced with all these uncertainties, the French aircraft industry will therefore continue to shorten sails in 1994. This trend, which has prevailed for three years now, already brought about layoffs in excess of 20 percent at equipment manufacturers. According to the results of our survey involving nearly all French equipment manufacturers, it appears that overall sales for the branch dropped another nine percent in 1993, i.e. 11 percent in real terms if we take inflation into account. Employment followed suit, although it declined by only eight percent. The two indicators differ because manufacturers had recourse to partial unemployment and took measures to reduce working hours; these now account for nearly five percent of working hours. New layoffs are still to be feared. A survey of its members made by the GIFAS Equipment Group shows that layoffs should affect another 10 percent of the personnel next year. From Partial Unemployment to Reduced Working Hours Partial unemployment variously affects companies, depending on their position in the regional economy and on the level of knowhow that must absolutely be retained. In some cases, as at ECE [Electrical Equipment and Engineering Company] in Niort, partial unemployment this year amounted to the equivalent of eight work weeks, which made it possible to maintain employment at about 800 people, compared with 850 before the crisis began. A sign that workloads will remain low for a long time is that a new form of partial unemployment is becoming quite common: short-time work. The measure was adopted late in the year at Sextant Avionics, Lucas Air Equipment, and Thomson-CSF. In the first case, the agreement aims to avoid a third employment-adjustment plan involving over 600 jobs. At Lucas Air Equipment, 200 jobs were saved by a work-time reduction equivalent to 49 days of partial unemployment. At Thomson-CSF, 1,200 layoffs were postponed. These measures, however, are limited because, in the long run, they tend to demotivate employees, lower productivity, and lengthen cycles and lead times, as Jacques Barillot-Creuzet, president of the GIFAS Equipment Group committee on PMEs and PMIs [small to mid-size businesses and industries], explained in the interview he gave us. One employer even told us that some of his employees, who had problems after two years of reduced wages, asked him straight out to end partial unemployment, even if that meant layoffs. The financial situation of equipment manufacturers is not any brighter than their employment situation. During the traditional publication of the results of the branch, last May, Jean-Paul Bechat, then president of the Equipment Group, recalled that the 140 companies belonging to his branch were practically all operating in the red at the end of the previous year. Nothing occurred in 1993 to reverse this trend. Confusion is spreading among equipment manufacturers as they receive conflicting signals from the government, prime contractors, and the markets. Thus, when programs are staggered they must reassess their capacities. When market volume is reduced, competition gets stronger and forces them to try and increase productivity, which unavoidably leads to new layoffs. They are asked to reduce costs and at the same time they learn that they will also have to shorten lead times significantly, as required by Charles Bigot, the Arianespace CEO [chief executive officer] who wishes to reduce his production costs by 23 or even 30 percent, and to shorten his production cycles by one third before Ariane-5 is set into service. The Thorny Problem of Design and Engineering Financing This confusion turns to griping where new programs are concerned. In 1993, the first invitations to bid were issued for the equipment of the European helicopter NH-90. When French equipment manufacturers read the terms imposed for bidding, they were bitterly surprised to learn that they would have to finance at least 40 percent of their development costs. "A quite abnormal situation," Amaury Halna du Fretay protested, demanding that military programs be entirely financed by the State, as they are in the United States. In fact, how could equipment manufacturers make this additional effort when their series production is so depressed and when companies must bear the financial burden of the employment-adjustment plans they started in the past two years? Jean-Robert Martin, the Sextant Avionics CEO, is concerned by the flight forward that might result if equipment manufacturers, wishing to position themselves for the future at all costs, were soon to face financial difficulties. "Are we trying hard enough to reuse things that were already studied or invested in?," he asked, adding: "If we want to continue launching many programs with small production series, the solution may just be to retrofit existing equipment." The situation of aircraft equipment manufacturers is far from uniform throughout the branch. The eight major companies (Thomson-CSF, Sextant, Messier-Bugatti, Dassault Electronics, SAGEM-SAT [Company for General Applications of Electricity and Mechanics-Telecommunications Company], Hispano-Suiza, SFIM [Measuring Instruments Manufacturing Company], and Intertechnique), whose aerospace sales exceed Fr1 billion per year, saw their 1992 sales in the sector increase by 4.3 percent. However, we should not trust appearances: Their growth is essentially due to takeovers, and it reflects the first of the consolidations that continued in 1993. Mid-size equipment manufacturers (those with sales ranging from Fr100 million to Fr1 billion) regressed by more than 10 percent. As for the smaller ones (less than Fr100 million in sales), they saw their invoiced sales drop by a clear 18.8 percent. Marriage of Convenience Hurel-Dubois (Mixed Shipping Company) was the first one to engage in a large-scale operation; during the last days of 1992, it announced its alliance with the North-Irish Shorts company (Bombardier group). The consolidated sales of the nacelle and thrust-reverser activities of the two companies, which merged to form the GEIE [European economic interest group] International Nacelle Systems (INS), amount to some $180 million (over Fr1 billion). According to Jacques Marchand, the GEIE president, the main responsibilities of INS will be to market and sell nacelle systems as a single supplier, to coordinate the technical and industrial activities of the two parent companies, and to provide customer support. Relying on agreements signed before its creation, INS just achieved a first success, after one year of existence, when it signed an agreement with the Spanish company Gamesa, covering the design, development, and production of nacelles for the Allison GMA30007 engine that will equip the EMB145 aircraft of the Brazilian company Embraer. Estimated value of the contract: $170 million. Another important player in the nacelle field is Hispano-Suiza which created the Euronacelle company in September 1992, together with the Italian company Alenia; it announced its intention to form a partnership with the U.S. company Grumman for the specific purpose of working on the Eurofan nacelle. That, Raymond Poggi, the French company's CEO, indicated, should throw back into question Hispano-Suiza and Alenia's mode of cooperation, without for all that breaking off relations between the two companies. Landing gears were not spared by the wave of partnerships and restructuring. Last June, Messier-Bugatti and its British competitor Dowty (which recently joined the international group TI) announced their desire to create a European landing-gear pole. It was officially created on 2 December 1993 when SNECMA [National Company for Aircraft Engine Study and Manufacturing] and the TI group signed an agreement providing for the merger of the landing-gear activities of their respective subsidiaries, Messier-Bugatti and Dowty. If the creation of Messier-Dowty is approved by the shareholders of both companies and by national and community authorities, the new company will achieve close to Fr2.5 billion in sales and it will control 41 percent of the world landing-gear market. In the middle of the summer, observers were alerted when Sextant Avionics shares stopped being quoted on the stock exchange. Thomson-CSF and Aerospatiale, the two largest shareholders of the leading French avionics manufacturer, were preparing a large-scale operation. Thomson-CSF acquired a two-third controlling interest in Sextant, Aerospatiale retained a blocking minority interest of 33.4 percent, and both want an alliance between their subsidiary and the U.S. giant AlliedSignal. The joint venture is expected to be set up by the end of this year [1993]; it will join the civil avionics activities of AlliedSignal and Sextant, in the civil and in the military sector. It will boasts sales close to Fr8 billion. This rapprochement follows an implacable logic. To ensure the viability of its civil activities, Sextant must absolutely sell to U.S. aircraft manufacturers, but it cannot do so because of the Aerospatiale label it is stuck with. Bendix/King, the brand under which AlliedSignal markets its avionics, is increasingly edged out by its two U.S. competitors, Rockwell-Collins and Honeywell, which both operate in the more buoyant cockpit and tracking-system subsector. As the year ends, a great name among simulator manufacturers disappears. The English company Rediffusion, exhausted after several restructuring plans that saw its personnel shrink from 3,000 to 1,400, is throwing in the towel. Thomson-CSF, which already took over another English company (Link-Miles) in the same sector three years ago, offered to take over Rediffusion. If it can get the official authorizations required to do so, Thomson-CSF will be able to increase its sale of simulators to nearly Fr3 billion, becoming the second-ranking company worldwide after the Canadian CAE, with a simulator catalog covering the entire range of 100-seaters and larger aircraft of the western world. Alain Gomez, the Thomson-CSF CEO, keeps looking toward England where his sonar-manufacturing partner, Ferranti, is threatened with liquidation. GEC-Marconi, who wanted to take over the last activities still controlled by this former jewel of British high technology, gave up its plans when it met with the fierce resistance of Ferranti shareholders; the company is now totally bankrupt and was just placed in receivership. Thomson-CSF, which enjoys a preemption right in the Ferranti-Thomson Sonar Systems joint-venture, is also said to consider an alliance in this field with GEC-Marconi. This would result in the creation of a group with Fr4 billion in sales, which would become the leading sonar manufacturer, ahead of IBM. Mergers also multiplied in France. Early in February, MATRA [Mechanics, Aviation, and Traction Company] merged its 50-50 MS2I [Matra-SEP Imaging and Information Science] subsidiary, the champion of satellite-image processing, with Cap Sesa Defense, a subsidiary of the Cap Gemini Sogeti group specialized in information and command systems. The new company is called Matra Cap Systems (MCS); it boasts sales worth Fr900 million and expects to grow by five percent per year, buoyed by one of the last defense market that are still developing: that of defense and imagery data-processing systems. Market Shares Only Edmond Marchegay, the Intertechnique CEO, relies on the war chest he amassed already four years ago, when he sold his IN2 data-processing company. It already served to finance the takeover of ECE in 1990. In 1993, Intertechnique took over Ferma, a hyperdynamic small to mid-size voice-server manufacturer that lacked equity capital. But Edmond Marchegay will not stop there; he announced that he was considering taking over three more companies. However, as a sign that the capacity of the industrial base has really become too large compared with aeronautical markets, this time Edmond Marchegay wants to take over market shares only. In September, SODERN [Nuclear Research and Development Company], which belongs to the Philips group, also consolidated its activities by taking over one of its suppliers of aerospace optic systems, the Cerco company. According to its CEO, Henri Dugre, the objective is to maintain SODERN, which was hard hit by the slowdown of nuclear and space programs, at about its ideal size, with sales of Fr270 million. This is a prerequisite in order to preserve the future of this jewel of French high technology, which exports its satellite attitude sensors even to Japan. In last year's special issue on equipment, we noted that a takeover wave had shaken the United States: General Dynamics was taken over by Lockheed; the electronic activities of GE merged into Martin Marietta; LTV ended up belonging to Loral. This year, as can be seen, the shock wave reached Europe. All the same, you will note that, in adversity, large companies are the ones which actively consolidate their operations. Small companies seem to be on their guard and, as a manager told us, still hope to hold out until the crisis kills their weaker competitors. In this game, there will have to be losers, and it looks as if some players have not yet taken the full measure of the present crisis, which is here to stay. Interview With Mr. Jacques Barillot-Creuzet, President of the GIFAS PME-PMI Committee: "Some PMEs Lost 50 Percent of Their Sales" [Dupont] Is employment hit harder in PMEs and PMIs than at prime contractors? [Barillot-Creuzet] It is difficult to give statistics because the PME base is highly diversified. But many of our members lost 40 to 50 percent of their sales in the past two years. Jobs reflect that fact, even when companies try to preserve them and maintain knowhow through partial unemployment. But this leads to a demotivation of employees, lower productivity, and longer cycles and lead times. [Dupont] What efforts do you make, on export markets or through diversification, to make up for the decline of domestic markets? [Barillot-Creuzet] PMEs have limited self-financing capacities, which makes it difficult for them to diversify successfully. They are often blamed for not taking advantage of the prosperity of the late eighties to diversify. But you should recall that at the time they were under such pressure to shorten lead times and increase production rates that it was materially impossible for them to turn to other markets. PMEs have reduced chances on export markets because of the unavowed protectionism practiced by all countries. In addition, the compensation mechanisms included in the large contracts awarded to prime contractors sometimes force the latter to take back products that were developed by their French associates and entrust them to foreign companies. Therefore, it takes a lot of financial strength to obtain financing for all or part of development costs or to generate openings on export markets. [Dupont] What is your reaction to the present situation, where support for R&D occurs at the expense of series contracts? [Barillot-Creuzet] Only a very small part of R&D budgets goes to PMEs. Unfortunately, that is a French practice. The United States took advantage of their strong growth in the late eighties to grade their base of subcontractors and small equipment manufacturers according to whose knowhow was deemed critical. Here, it was the crisis that eliminated the weakest. We deplore the fact that there was no industrial logic behind all that. [Dupont] What do you think of state measures taken to limit layoffs at prime contractors? [Barillot-Creuzet] Clearly, these measures result in a transfer of our jobs to prime contractors, as the latter take back workloads. Actually, these measures just shift the problem to make it less conspicuous, but probably at the expense of our economic and eventually our social best interest. [Dupont] What about the increased frequency of filings for bankruptcies? [Barillot-Creuzet] Some companies now view filing for bankruptcy as a management method, with the sole objective of maintaining their workloads by cutting prices. This sometimes leads commercial courts, which are concerned about employment in their regions, to liquidate all the debts of these companies in order to encourage takeovers. That generates unfair competition, which may lead to economic, industrial and social imbalances.
