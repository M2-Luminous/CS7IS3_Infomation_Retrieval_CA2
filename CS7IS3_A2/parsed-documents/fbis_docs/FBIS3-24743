The Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] are teaching a lesson in northern Angola. Our correspondent reported today that violent clashes are continuing in Bengo Province. The battle is being fought near Nambuangongo, where Eduardo dos Santos' troops are paying dearly for the cowardly adventure of the Futungo de Belas man. In the past 24 hours, the enemy suffered 73 confirmed dead, leaving large quantities of Russian- and Brazilian-made war materiel near the commune of (Usu). Two KrAZ trucks carrying war materiel were captured yesterday on the (Caiengue)-(Usu) road. Troops assigned to the forward logistics position were completely neutralized. Also yesterday, an antitank missile was fired at and burned a Ural vehicle carrying mercenaries of unknown nationality. Our correspondent cites the FALA operational commander for the Bengo Military Region as saying that the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party's military adventure is doomed. He said the first clashes have proved FALA's combat superiority.
