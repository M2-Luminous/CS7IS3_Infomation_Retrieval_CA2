Solana spoke out against Greek Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos, about whom he went so far as to say that his remarks lack common sense. At a Congress [of Deputies] plenary session, Solana received the People's Party's qualified support for the firmness shown by the government in the negotiation to admit Norway to the Brussels club. He arrived home from Brussels at 0600, slept for just a few hours, and at 1400 held a press conference with Jose Manuel Durao Barroso -- his Portuguese counterpart. Perhaps it was the lack of sleep, but the fact is that Solana responded to the European partners' criticisms with unusual harshness. Pangalos is not in the habit of beating about the bush. At a press conference which he held after the abortive round of negotiations, he reviewed the concessions made by each delegation, and finally emphasized that only the Spanish delegation remained inflexible, for reasons which he could not understand. Solana stated that he was unaware of the remarks by the Greek [EU] Council of Ministers president, but he pointed out that he had heard him on many other occasions since he has been heading the EU. "His remarks," he commented, "do not always impress me. They sometimes lack common sense." Greece's stance has caused some disappointment in the Spanish delegation. It was known that Athens, currently holding the presidency, would not behave as the Mediterranean ally which it has been on many occasions. "However, we were not expecting that the presidency would put us against the ropes," a diplomat remarked. Greece's conduct is all the more incomprehensible inasmuch as Spain has been one of the four EU countries which have hitherto refused to take the step of establishing diplomatic relations with Macedonia -- Greece's northern neighbor. Athens refuses to recognize it until it obtains guarantees of its renunciation of its alleged territorial claims to northern Greece. Nevertheless, the Spanish foreign minister denied that Spain has refused to strengthen ties with Skopje -- Macedonia's capital -- in the hope of receiving favorable treatment from the Greek presidency. "Only yesterday, I told Pangalos," Solana stated: "Spain is not a country for bartering. This is not a case of logrolling. We did not refrain from doing so in the hope of some kind of gratitude." He also responded to the criticisms of Spain by Klaus Kinkel -- his German counterpart -- but did so much more cautiously. His statements asking him for greater flexibility seemed to him "reasonable in the framework of a negotiating process such as this." Isolation In Spanish and even in English, Solana reiterated once more the Spanish stance demanding of Norway greater access to its fishing grounds -- Oslo is offering only 3,700 tonnes of cod per year -- and refusing to accept that the blocking minority in the Council of Ministers should rise from 23 to 27 votes, as a result of which the Mediterranean countries would be left in a minority. He strove to prove that Spain is not alone. Although Pangalos praised the Portuguese concessions yesterday, Durao Barroso expressed his complete solidarity with Spain in its struggle to regain access to the Norwegian fishing grounds, which also interest Portugal. However, the Portuguese minister distanced himself from the Spanish approach in the institutional sphere. Colleagues of the minister acknowledged that not enough efforts were made to explain why a country such as Spain, anxious to deepen European building, upheld a stance which, if it succeeded, would hamper decisionmaking in the Council of Ministers. "The ideal thing would have been to carry out a major institutional reform," one of them lamented, "but France ultimately did not venture to give battle, and we could not do so, either, on our own." At the Congress plenary session in the afternoon, People's Party deputy Jose Maria Robles Fraga urged the government to hold its ground in the negotiation. "If you block," he stated, "do not do so in the darkness and solitude to which you have accustomed us. Do not give in, Mr. Minister; you are not alone in Brussels," because you have the support of public opinion and of the parliamentary forces. "If they tell you: `Not one more fish or one more vote,' you will have to tell them: `Or one more country.' I am very glad to know that the People's Party is behind the government," Solana replied.
