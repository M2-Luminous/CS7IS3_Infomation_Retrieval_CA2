This statement by Francois Leotard upon his arrival in Tel Aviv, where he will stay until this evening, summarizes the purpose of this visit, the first since 1948, by a French defense minister to Israel. This statement and wish were reiterated as Francois Leotard's leitmotif throughout the day yesterday. It was a particularly busy day with two major highlights: In the morning, the meeting with Prime Minister and Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, and in the afternoon, in the Oriental House in Jerusalem, a meeting which lasted nearly one hour with a Palestinian delegation led by Faysal al-Husayni, the PLO leader of the occupied territories. To Prime Minister Rabin, Mr. Leotard restated, one month after [Foreign Affairs Minister] Juppe's visit, France's willingness to restore normal relations with Israel. These relations should be at least as cordial as those France has with most countries, also in this region, and should include exchanges in the military sphere -- where prospects are still modest for the time being -- and in the industrial sphere, where things are likely to move much faster. To the Palestinian delegation, Francois Leotard said how deeply the French authorities had regretted the Hebron massacre. In his opinion, "the only alternative to violence is not a status quo, but negotiations." The defense minister again suggested to the Palestinians that France participate, through its gendarmerie, in the formation of a Palestinian police force. After these meetings, the minister had the impression that history is vacillating at this very moment. It is not impossible that the peace process be jeopardized again, with easily conceivable consequences for security in the entire region. This would be a victory of extremism; it would also be a drama for both Mr. Rabin's and Yasir 'Arafat's supporters. It was not the minister's ambition, as he himself declared, to "lecture anyone." It was his goal to help the two signatories of the Washington accord surmount their common plight. During a news conference, Francois Leotard thus summarized his thoughts: "France should be able to play a role in the restoration of peace, speaking from the heart as well as the head."
