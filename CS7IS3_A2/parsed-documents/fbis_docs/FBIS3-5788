On 8 March, AFP fabricated a deceptive report saying that the invading forces of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government had captured certain areas in the Pailin region. The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] spokesman totally rejects this false report, which is based on the darkest and most unscrupulous political motives. II. The Vietnamese communists and the Western alliance -- with France as the leading cat's paw -- are using the invading forces of their Vietnamese communist puppet lackeys and the two-headed government to attack the people and the NADK resistance in Pailin in order to allow the Vietnamese communists to swallow the Cambodian race completely and allow the alliance to incorporate Cambodia into its arena. AFP -- France's propaganda apparatus -- has stepped to the forefront by playing an active role in fabricating deceptive propaganda in its psychological war. The general public is aware that ever since the creation of the two-headed government, France has urged other countries to assist the Vietnamese communists and their puppets and become directly involved in establishing [as heard] the two-headed government, so as to employ the latter in attacking the Cambodian nation and people and the NADK resistance in the political, military, economic, and propaganda fields. France has carried out these actions with the dream of furthering its neocolonialism in Cambodia. III. The Vietnamese communists and the alliance have made all- out efforts to prod the Vietnamese communist invaders and the two-headed government in their military campaign against the people and the NADK resistance in Pailin in order to cover their most shameful and serious defeat on the Anlung Veng battlefield. So far, though, the invading forces are not even close to Pailin; much less having captured this or that area in the region. This is why their French masters have strived to invent this deceptive story -- to prevent their lackeys from being perceived as too inferior. IV. Based on past experience as well as recent experiences on the Anlung Veng battlefield, the invading forces of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government -- mercenaries that are inflaming the war in accordance with the strategy of the Vietnamese communists and the alliance to oppose the king, national reconciliation, peace, and the Cambodian nation and people -- can never prevail over the national forces, the people, or the NADK resistance. They will certainly be defeated, dispersed, and decimated. As for the foreign warmongers, they will be severely condemned by the Cambodian nation and people, no matter what. If France continues to collude with the Vietnamese communists to inflame the war, which is meant to do away with the Cambodian race, the Cambodian nation and people and the Cambodian national resistance forces will oppose and condemn it. On the other hand, if France joins the king and the Cambodian nation and people and does whatever it can to achieve national reconciliation, national unity, and peace in Cambodia in accordance with the king's five-point policy, the Cambodian nation and people and the Cambodian national resistance forces will support it. [Dated] 9 March 1994 [Signed] The NADK spokesman
