During his conversation with journalists Chernomyrdin pointed out that as of today Ukraine's debt to Russia for fuel and energy is about $1 Bn [Billion].

According to Chernomyrdin, other consumers of Russian natural gas suffer because of Ukraine's debt. Meanwhile, Chairman of Gazprom's board Rem Vyakhirev declared in his interview with Interfax that if Ukraine fails to fulfill the agreement signed on March 10 in Moscow then Russian deliveries for the republic's inner consumption will be entirely stopped.
