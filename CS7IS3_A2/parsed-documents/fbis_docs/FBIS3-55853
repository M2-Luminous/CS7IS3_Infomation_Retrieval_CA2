The country's current economic misfortunes are caused by the collapse of the former system rather than by the government's measures for transition to a market economy, the document says. Therefore, instead of slowing down the pace of reforms, Russia ought to accelerate the implementation of reforms with a view to reducing the period of slump in production and decline of the population's living standards. In this memorandum, perceived by local observers as a response to criticism of the two international financial organizations' policy toward Russia, the IMF and the World Bank have emphasized that, in order to reduce its budget deficit and curb inflation, Russia needs to introduce "tough budget restrictions" on the financing of state enterprises. It would also be worth the Russian leadership's while to step up its efforts in the sphere of privatization, extending it to the power industry and the military production sphere. Unemployment will rise as a result of the closure of inefficient enterprises. But this problem must be solved via the creation of a social security system and not by subsidizing food and energy prices for the country's entire population, the document says. Citing the fact that Russia is insufficiently active in implementing the measures to curb inflation and reduce the budget deficit, defined by it jointly with the IMF, the Fund's leadership will refrain from granting it the second half of the credit line from the system transformation fund, amounting to $1.5 billion.
