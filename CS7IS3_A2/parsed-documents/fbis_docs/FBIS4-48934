The giants, each to annually make at least 1 million low-priced quality cars with clean-burning engines, are to be competitive internationally. In an interview with BUSINESS WEEKLY, a senior official from the Ministry of Machinery Industry elaborated on the industry's long- range programme. This goal of consolidation is the core of the new policies that are to govern the country's auto industry for the next seven years, the official said. The policies are to be announced before long. By the year 2000, six to seven conglomerates are expected to be formed from the 13 existing auto groups. Each is expected to make 300,000 sedans a year. In the early decades of the next century, the conglomerates are to be further reshuffled into three or four larger ones. The official, who declined to be identified, said that the reorganization will take place in competitive conditions under a market economy, but that macroeconomic planning by the central government will be beefed up to ensure the industry develops in the direction set by the new policies. The industry, expected to grow into an economic pillar, will not repeat development formulas used in some Western nations where auto giants achieved dominance after nearly 100 years of intense competition among hundreds of carmakers. He said the 13 existing auto groups, whose size makes them ripe for further development, will be supported by the central government. He cited eight major carmakers in particular: the Changchun-based First Automotive Works; the Shiyan-based Dongfeng Group; the Nanjing Automotive Industry Corp; the China National Heavy-duty Truck Corp; and manufacturers in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Shenyang. The auto groups will be granted preference in financing, taxation and the issuing of securities. For the next two or three years, no new assembly projects will be allowed, but the official did not rule out the possibility that foreign investment in assembling cars will be permitted in later years. "We advocate different policies in different phases," he said. Moderate protection of the domestic market from assaults by floods of Western imports is necessary. Periods of protection by way of tariffs, import quotas and licenses and other means will be different for different vehicles, he said. The protection of the market for trucks needs to span three to five years but for sedans, 10 years, he said. Such protection, which is used by nearly every nation, is needed by China's fledgling auto industry, especially sedan manufacturers, who turned out 240,000 cars last year. However, he said the protection will be weakened gradually as the industry grows stronger. "So large a market as China's will be vulnerable to free imports of cars," he said. The government will pay great attention to improving vehicle safety, reducing auto pollution and raising fuel efficiency, the official said. However, he said the country will probably lag behind Western nations, where extremely stiff standards are to take effect around 1996. To reduce vehicle emissions and develop fuel-saving engines, China will beef up investment and draw up new laws and regulations. China has participated in international activities related to vehicle emissions and fuel consumption and expects co-operation with foreigners will continue. It expects to become integrated into the global auto market with a relatively independent, competitive industry in the early decades of the next century, the official said.
