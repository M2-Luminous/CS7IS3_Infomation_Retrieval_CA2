The success is quite different. Referenced to the money spent, the Japanese register more patents than the Americans and the Americans more than the Germans. Using another indicator of success, the Nobel prizes for natural sciences, America is without peer. Then comes Germany while Japan has none. However, most of the Nobel prizes for Germans were awarded for research done in foreign countries and in foreign laboratories. Apparently, the Germans are good scientists but Germany does not provide them with enough development potential. There is no international comparable data for the commercial success of R&D expenditures. However, there is no doubt that Germany would be an also-ran. The reason for the low German research productivity is apparently poor organization. The famous Japanese MITI brings the companies together around one table to discuss a joint project. If the companies are ready to use their own money together, the MITI makes available a relatively modest government grant in addition. In Germany and in the European Union, this is done differently. The government awards research and development contracts, some of which it finances completely--Jager 90, Transrapid, high-temperature reactor, space travel, fusion reactor, etc. If the contractor for a project that is fully financed by the government is a company and not a government research institute, the company has every reason to generate costs as high as possible because the contracts are usually awarded on a cost-plus basis. This means, the higher the costs, the higher the profit for the contractor. On the other hand, it makes virtually no difference to the company whether the development leads to a marketable product. The company is earning money on the research and need not recoup the costs of this research by way of sales. Transrapid is a beautiful example of the results of this. The government-financed high-tech means of transport has been traveling around in circles for years as fast as lightning on a track in Emsland that is 31.5 kilometers long. Under the stilts of this track, contented cows graze. Unfortunately, no one has yet seen fit to buy this miracle of German engineering prowess. Therefore, in a second step, the sales are also to be financed by the government. The government wants to build a track from Hamburg to Berlin for 5.6 billion marks. A consortium of private companies will take over operation, again subsidized in the form of tax reductions. Because it is just the nature of government investment projects that, at the end, they are twice as expensive as originally estimated; the taxpayers will, when all is said and done, be asked to pay a few hundred marks per household. For this a reference track, which interested parties from the world over can view, will be available in the year 2004. The test track in Emsland was apparently too short. You can just imagine how the story continues. In 2005, a Russian delegation appears. They want to use the Transrapid on the line from Moscow to St. Petersburg. However, the Russians have no money. Consequently, the federal government ensures an interest-free, non-repayable loan because otherwise the contract would go to the Japanese. Many such stories can be told. The Airbus received government financing but cannot be produced profitably without additional subsidies such as inexpensive loans and dollar exchange-rate guarantees. The Ariane is a reliable booster but a commercial flop. The Russians and even the Chinese are cheaper transporting payloads into space. The high-temperature reactor swallowed a large portion of the budget of the Federal Research Ministry for years. Not a single one has been sold and the only commercial reactor in Hamm-Uentrop has been shut down by the North Rhine-Westphalian Land government--even though it was completely operational. The fast breeder reactor was even more expensive and just as unsuccessful. Government support of microelectronics was a similar flop. Germany cannot defy Japan and the U.S.A. and cannot even keep up with South Korea anymore. Now, the government that has already paid for most of the research is also to subsidize production. You have not heard anything for two years about one of the most expensive projects, the fusion reactor. The government supported wind systems are, in the meantime, supplying a little power, but even then only because the electric power companies have been forced to purchase wind power at excessive prices. The goal of government research support is to provide innovative products that can be produced profitably in the high-salary country of Germany. The meaning is perverted if the production must also be subsidized. The only reasonable strategy is to support research only where industry also assumes some risk with its own funds and therefore has an interest in marketable products. Then, the government need not care about the selection of projects any more. There was such a program in the form of salary subsidies for research plans of medium-sized companies. The program was overturned. That program could have produced something marketable.
