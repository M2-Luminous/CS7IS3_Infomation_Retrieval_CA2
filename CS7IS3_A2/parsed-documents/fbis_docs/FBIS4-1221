Acting regional representative of the Department of Home Affairs in the Border, Mr Les Grieb, said the department's office in East London stayed open on Saturday and Sunday, issuing some 1,500 cards. By 9.30 AM Monday, the queue already stretched round two sides of a city block. Mr Grieb said most applicants would be from Mdantsane in the Ciskei. Normal office hours were 8 AM to 3 PM, but any queue that still existed at 3 PM would be dealt with, he said. His staff had been carrying on until seven or eight at night. "I would say they are coping, but we are under terrible pressure at the moment." Mobile teams of the department working in the East London/Mdantsane also issued about 1,000 cards over the weekend, and were back in the field on Monday. At a nearby home affairs office issuing ID documents, the queue was much smaller than the voting card line. Mr Grieb said that up to last week, the ID office had been issuing up to 1,000 documents a week. It seemed people had decided that if their ID's had not arrived by now, they would rather get a voter card.
