He graduated from the Serpukhov Aviation-Technical School and from the Air Force Engineering Academy imeni Mozhayskiy. He served in combat units, at the Baykonur Cosmodrome, and in the central administration of the Ministry of Defense. He was employed in the testing of strategic missiles, for which he earned the State Prize. He is a doctor of technical sciences, a professor, and an academician of the International Engineering Academy. Prior to his appointment as general director of the Voyentekh State Armament and Military Equipment Sales Company, he was first deputy chief for armament of the Russian Armed Forces. [Rudenko] Anatoliy Grigoryevich, when and why was the Voyentekh State Company formed, and who was its founder? [Funtikov] The idea of creating our company belongs to the leaders of the Armed Forces ministries, and chiefly defense minister, General of the Army Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev. In order to get money to build housing for servicemen from somewhere other than the budget, he proposed creating a special cost accounting foreign trade organization that would export combat equipment and armament at the disposal of the Ministry of Defense. This proposal was carefully examined by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and in mid-1992 a special government decree was published forming the Voyentekh State Armament and Military Equipment Sales Company. The Ministry of Defense, the Russian Federal Property Fund, the RF State Committee for the Management of State Property, the Committee for Social Support to Servicemen, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and the RF State Committee for Defense Industry acted as the company's founders. [Rudenko] How justified was creation of yet another foreign trade organization, since after all, the Oboroneksport VO, the Spetsvneshtekhnika GVK or, for example, the GUSK would have been fully capable of assuming the task of selling freed armament? They did have the experience and the corresponding structures for this, didn't they? [Funtikov] Yes, they did. But they naturally didn't want to get fully into the business of exporting used armament at a time when the warehouses of the defense enterprises were literally bursting with new products: It would have been a lot of trouble, and the work would not have been very profitable. Each item had to be fitted out, repaired, and painted. Because it was established by the Ministry of Defense, and works in the interests of the Army (97 percent of the proceeds from weapon sales go specifically to construction of housing for servicemen), and having support from powerful structures of the Ministry of Defense such as the GRAU [Main Missile and Artillery Directorate] and the Main Directorate of Armored Forces, from engineering and chemical troops, and from the main procurement directorates of the arms and services, the Voyentekh State Company was vitally interested in organizing the work of exporting freed armament. [Rudenko] Do you share the point of view of those who feel that the Ministry of Defense shouldn't involve itself in arms exports at all? [Funtikov] The Ministry of Defense is of course not a military trade organization. It has other tasks, and another purpose. But weapon exports are a special item. The reality is such that approximately a fourth to a fifth of the assortment of armament sought by foreign clients can be delivered efficiently only from the forces. This is not to mention the fact that comprehensive testing of combat equipment, specialist training and repair of weapons and combat equipment proceed practically 100 percent at the proving grounds, training centers and repair plants of the Ministry of Defense. The Main Directorate of International Military Cooperation of the General Staff of the RF Armed Forces could organize arms exports quite professionally, and well. And it must be said that it is exerting a great deal of effort to develop military-technical cooperation, to train foreign specialists and to render other services. Considering that a military department is not fully suited to purely commercial activity, our state company assumed this function. It is a state enterprise, fully answerable to currently effective legislation. Everyone here understands the interests of both military arms manufacturers and citizens well. We realize that the role our company plays will grow considering the inadequate financing of the Ministry of Defense. After all, selling freed combat equipment and weapons is a realistic way of obtaining nonbudgetary resources not only to solve social problems but also to reequip the Army. [Rudenko] How much "surplus" weaponry does the Army have today that could be offered for sale? [Funtikov] Our state company does not keep records on the amount of armament freed in the course of the Russian Army's reduction--that's a function of the General Staff, but there is no debate that there is a large amount of it. Forces are being withdrawn from countries of Eastern Europe and the Baltics, and units in internal districts are being disbanded. Moreover there is much combat equipment in warehouses and storage depots. Given the extreme deficit in the defense budget, the most reasonable thing would be to sell it, and use the proceeds to solve social problems, and develop and produce new models of armament. [Rudenko] But wanting to sell these weapons isn't enough. Someone has to want to by them. How do things stand in this area? We are offering used goods, after all. [Funtikov] Armament in the forces can be said to be used only on paper. It's actually new as a rule. When we train tank crews, for example, we use a few training vehicles, leaving the rest of the tanks in storage at depots and bases. Air defense weapons don't get much use, while infantry weapons get even less. In this case their price is naturally below that of new models, which is attractive to foreign customers. Far from all countries are able to allow themselves to purchase ultramodern weapons directly from the conveyers of defense enterprises. [Rudenko] By the way, how are prices of weapons supplied from the troops set? [Funtikov] The main criteria here are the newness of the model, the date of manufacture, remaining life, and actual technical condition of the articles. Consider for example a helicopter that has served half of its useful life. Its price would be approximately 60 percent of the cost of a new helicopter. Price policy is a delicate, flexible thing. There are also many other factors that have to be accounted for when appraising a particular item. But in any case, under no circumstances are we offering armament at dumping prices. [Rudenko] What models of armament enjoy the greatest demand today? [Funtikov] I would put infantry fighting vehicles at the top of the list. And not only the latest BMP-3, but even the BMP-2. Foreign customers are showing great interest in antitank weapons, T-72S and T-80U tanks, our helicopters--especially the Mi-8 and the Mi-24, all models and modifications of the Kalashnikov assault rifle, the Igla, Strela-10M, Tor, Tunguska, S-300PMU-1 and S-300V surface-to-air missile systems, and of course, MiG-29 and Su-27 airplanes, as well as ammunition of all types. As for naval equipment, small patrol boats are in demand. When it comes to potential customers, they can be found today in countries of Southeast Asia, the Near East and Africa. [Rudenko] It's no secret that there was too much red tape in our arms trade system. It sometimes took months to finalize a contract. Has anything changed recently in this aspect? [Funtikov] Not much, unfortunately. As before, it takes a lot of legwork to get approval of documents for the sale of weapons or combat equipment from the corresponding ministries and departments. As an example it took me a little less than 4 months to finalize a contract to sell a consignment of pistols to the Vietnamese Ministry of Internal Affairs. Such an approach doesn't of course promote development of military-technical cooperation. Many customers want the weapons delivered within a week or a month, they are prepared to pay immediately, and we need to consider their wishes. [Rudenko] What should be done in your opinion to retake lost positions in the arms market? And is such an objective even realistic for us in principle? [Funtikov] Of course it's realistic. The main argument in favor of this assertion can be found in the fabulous characteristics of our armament. The entire world recognizes that it is fully competitive, while many models simply have no analogues, being superior to foreign prototypes. The fact that we sell 16 times less armament than the USA today is explained in my opinion primarily by subjective and not objective causes. If we intend to occupy a truly worthy place in the arms market, we will need to direct the efforts of not only specialized exporters and defense enterprises but also all state structures toward this objective. Once I went to Kuwait for negotiations. And do you know who went there to officer a consignment of American weapons to the Kuwaiti Defense Ministry? A former president of the United States. It was Bush. That's the level we're dealing with. It must be said that we have recently been taking steps to maximally activate military and technical cooperation. Consider at least the government decree granting enterprises the right to enter the foreign market on their own. It will doubtlessly sweep our exports into the mainstream. The enterprises do have something to offer their foreign partners. An inspection of specialized exporters carried out recently by the Russian president's inspection administration revealed that billions of dollars' worth of weapons and combat equipment have accumulated in the warehouse of defense firms. [Rudenko] Wouldn't a mass invasion of the world market by enterprises mean the end of the state's monopoly on arms trade? [Funtikov] Of course not. In this case, you see, a monopoly is defined not as the existence of a single vendor but as strict regulation of arms trade--on the basis of the corresponding government decrees, through the licensing committee, and through restrictions on what can be traded. I do not support the idea that we should have a thousand specialized exporters, but large firms such as, for example, the Antey Concern, the Kurganmashzavod Joint-Stock Company, the OKB Sukhovo ANPK, MAPO [Moscow Aviation Production Association] and others should have access to the foreign market. We can only gain from this. By the way, while the right to export defense products is possessed by dozens of organizations in the USA and other Western countries, the state still maintains a monopoly on weapon sales. [Rudenko] What sort of relations are you developing with the Rosvooruzheniye State Company, recently formed out of three specialized exporters, and with the financial and industrial groups being formed out of large defense firms? [Funtikov] Are you asking whether we are entering the foreign market as competitors? I can say quite certainly, no. And there are simply no reasons for such competition to exist between our companies. We have different niches. In this case our niche is far more modest than that of Rosvooruzheniye. As far as the financial and industrial groups are concerned, I am convinced that they will play a most active role in the arms market in the immediate future. It is for this reason that our company is providing what support it can to their formation. I would like to say in conclusion that because of the sharp reduction of appropriations to defense, and consequently to armament, we should allocate part of the proceeds from exporting defense products to establishing a firm scientific and technical foundation upon which to design equipment of the future. These may perhaps not be full-scale developments, but we believe that the time will come when our state will have the possibility for satisfying the Army's demand for the latest weapons to the fullest.
