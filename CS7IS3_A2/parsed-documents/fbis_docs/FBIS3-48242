[Sastrowardoyo] We want not only economic growth, but also equal income distribution. Foreign investors are allowed to benefit from our business opportunities, but we must also defend national interests. Foreign investment should not be allowed to affect the business of local people, capture our domestic market, corner our businessmen, or make our businessmen lose business opportunities. I do not want that to happen. At least, we must be equal in giving and taking things. [Irawanto] How do you make that happen? [Sastrowardoyo] They are allowed to set up wholly owned foreign companies, but they must observe the requirements, namely, their capital must be more than U.S. $50 million, their company must be located in the approved industrial estate or in the 15 designated provinces such as Jambi or the eastern part of Indonesia, or they must export all their products overseas. It must be borne in mind that foreign investors need to fulfil one of the above requirements, and not necessarily all of them. For instance, they can still set up wholly-owned foreign companies if their capital is under U.S. $50 million, but their company must be located in one of the 15 designated provinces, and their products must be entirely for export. However, after 20 years, they must carry out a divestment program [two preceding words in English], which means that 51 percent of the company's equity must be sold to local businessmen. [Irawanto] Why? [Sastrowardoyo] Because we do not want passive observers and because we also want a piece of the economic cake. We do not want to become mere laborers who have given them land, water, and opportunities which they have grabbed. [Irawanto] Do you think the requirements are too hard for foreign investors? [Sastrowardoyo] No, because the 51-percent equity can still be split into smaller portions. For example, 31 percent for local partners, while the remaining 20 percent can be listed in the stock market. So the 49-percent owner can continue as the single majority [two preceding words in English] holder. Therefore, foreign investors do not have to worry about it. Do not forget that local partners include not only local businessmen, but also international financial institutions such as the IFC [International Finance Corporation], the IMF, and the ADB [Asian Development Bank] which the Indonesian Government is a shareholder. The idea is not to allow foreigners to completely dominate business opportunities in our country, while our people remain mere spectators. [Irawanto] But other countries do not have the divestment program. [Sastrowardoyo] We are competing not only with developing countries, but also with developed ones. We must be mentally ready and skillful in dealing with foreign investors. If foreign investors wholly own their companies and we only supply them with land, water, and manpower, this country will definitely become a nation of laborers. We will never become a nation of entrepreneurs [preceding word in English] and we will never have management experts. As for other investment areas, I think we have already adopted an open-minded approach. [passage omitted on the issues of land and bureaucracy] [Irawanto] Do you see the PRC as a threat to our investment drive? [Satrowardoyo] I believe the PRC is not a threat because political stability is still a big question there while its business regulations are inconsistent. Vietanm will probably pose a threat to us three years from now. At present, its infrastructure and regulations are not ready for investment, but if they can cope with these problems, that country will be more competitive. But for now, I see no serious threat. [Irawanto] What is Indonesia's position in attracting foreign investment? [Sastrowardoyo] We managed to get U.S. $10.3 billion in 1992, but do not forget that the figure represents overall investment, while pure foreign investment stood at about one fourth of this amount. As of 11 December 1993, we managed to attract U.S. $7.4 billion only. It is true that there is a drop in investment in 1993. [Irawanto] What is the greatest obstacle for foreign investors? [Sastrowardoyo] Indonesia is the only ASEAN country and the only Asian country that does not give tax holidays [two preceding words in English], which was abolished on 1 January 1984. This is because we need all sources of revenue, including taxation. On the other hand, people often ask: "Why does Indonesia have a divestment program and others not?" The answer is, as I have explained earlier, namely, we do not want to become mere spectators.
