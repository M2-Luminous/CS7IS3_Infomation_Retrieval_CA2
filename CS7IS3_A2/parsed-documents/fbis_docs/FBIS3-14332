This optimistic and obscure sentence was uttered by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin last night. Rabin once again called on the Syrian regime: Do something to underline the seriousness of your peace intentions. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports: [Begin recording] [Segal] Prime Minister Rabin is waiting for a gesture by Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in the coming weeks. According to Rabin, Syria has to underscore its desire for peace with actions and not only words. Rabin hinted at the possibility of progress with the resumption of the talks with Syria in Washington in late April. [Rabin] I believe that some sort of better formula has been found to clarify the problems between Syria and us. [Segal] Rabin, who addressed the Council for Peace and Security last night, disclosed that he had decided on a referendum over the future of the Golan Heights in order to signal to the Syrians that they have to do something to convince the Israeli public about the seriousness of their intentions. That is one of the things Rabin would like to see in the negotiations with Syria. [Rabin] With the Syrians, there is the test of normalization before we discuss the line on which we will have to make a commitment to withdraw. [Segal] The prime minister referred to the support for the Hebron massacre among some sectors of the Israeli public. Rabin warned against the danger of Jewish racism. [Rabin] The identification among sectors of Israeli the public were larger than I had anticipated. I view that as a danger of Israeli racism, and more precisely, Jewish racism. [end recording]
