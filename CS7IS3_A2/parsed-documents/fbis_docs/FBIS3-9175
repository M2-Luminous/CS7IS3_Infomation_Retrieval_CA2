Vujicic, N. Smiljic: "Dubrave -- A Time Bomb"] [Text] Although Scandinavian and French troops have been at Dubrave Airport near Tuzla for 10 days now, there is no sign that the opening of the airport could occur very soon. There are many reasons for this. It is no secret that during the construction of any military airport, ways of destroying it if the luck turns are always foreseen. In the course of the hysterical campaign for opening this airport, the Western media and politicians simply forgot this fact and subsequently found themselves in a tight spot. The airport near Tuzla is a time bomb and should not be taken lightly, recounts Radovan Kecojevic, the former Yugoslav People's Army's [JNA] top expert for pyrotechnics and the man who mined Tuzla Airport. So far, 14 explosions have reverberated on the runways of this airport, while countless other highly destructive time bombs remain hidden. Unless the explosives at the airport are painstakingly and expertly defused, tragedy is unavoidable. This task, providing that the JNA submits the plan showing where the mines are on the runways, will take several months. I Did Not Give the Attestation Before the war, Radovan Kecojevic worked as a pyrotechnics expert at Dubrave Airport and was head of the team that mined the airport's runways. Since he remained in the town after the JNA withdrew from Tuzla -- which was taken over by the Muslims -- he was pressured by Alija's army to defuse the bombs at the airport, or to at least give them "attestation" that the airport could be used. Kecojevic says that he did not do so for moral reasons, and because he knew that he could not undertake such a task without expert and thorough preparation. There are 42 storage spaces housing explosives under runway number 1. All these places have been masked and hidden, says Kecojevic. Even if the UN troops were to find the so-called "Finnish highly explosive shells" ["finski fugasi"], they would have trouble defusing them because of the different ways in which these highly explosive shells are activated. Kecojevic explained how every army takes care to maintain variety when mining its military airports in order to surprise the enemy if he manages to capture the air base. Our collocutor also stressed that the JNA devoted a lot of attention to this problem. The airport near Tuzla was mined in several different ways, and a combination of various detonators was used. Some of the storage spaces for explosives at Dubrave Airport have electric detonators, says Kecojevic. It is possible to blow up these storage spaces from a greater or smaller distance with the help of thin electric cables, with immense consequences for the manpower and aircraft at the airport. The Detonators However, the highly explosive shells with mechanical detonators, chemical detonators, and those with a combination of the two present the greatest danger, claims this top pyrotechnics expert. Nor, indeed, should we exclude the highly explosive shells that can be remotely activated with radio waves. The mechanical detonators of the highly explosive shells react to vibrations of the ground and shocks on the runway caused by landing aircraft. For example, if a heavy transport aircraft were to cause vibrations on the runway, an explosion would occur. The same thing can occur with detonators made from glass and plastic ampules, which could go off suddenly during take-off or landing. There is a great chance of the runway being blown up. I witnessed this myself on 24 May 1992, when the Muslims took me to the airport in order to inspect its condition, says Kecojevic. Describing what he found at the airport after the JNA left, this expert says that the main runway had nine large craters, 7 meters deep and with a radius of some five to six meters. Runway number 1 was unusable, and in November of the same year, another five chain explosions occurred, causing similar damage. The situation is somewhat different on the airport's runway number 2, situated in Cigulje near Zivinice. It is possible that some of the highly explosive shells on this runway have been detected and defused. Nevertheless, there were numerous storage spaces for explosives on this runway, and it is certain that not all have been removed. Radovan Kecojevic does not exclude the possibility of Dubrave Airport being opened. According to him, this can be done after some eight to 10 months of work by pyrotechnics experts and engineering units. Since the Muslims did not have such experts, and since the UN experts have only just recently arrived at the site, they face an enormous task. Before this task is tackled, the French legionnaires have to clear the airport's substantial surface of infantry antitank mines, which were planted without any order.
