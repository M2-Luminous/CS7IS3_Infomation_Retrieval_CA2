FR940323-1-00051 FR940323-1-00006 Talussnails are extremely sensitive to desiccation and sedimentation resulting from disturbance of the talus and associated vegetation. In general, desert snails are known to protect themselves from drying out by crawling into deep, cool rockslides that are not filled with soil. The limestone rock or other talus that contains calcium carbonate is crucial to the species, as it aids in shell deposition and neutralizes carbonic acid that is produced during estivation (Hoffman 1990). The San Xavier talussnail is known to estivate for up to three years and in most years is only active for three or four days (Hoffman 1990). The San Xavier talussnail was included as a Category 2 species in the Service's May 22, 1984, notice of review of candidate invertebrates (49 FR 21664) and in the January 6, 1989, animal candidate notice of review (54 FR 554). Category 2 species are those for which the Service has some evidence of vulnerability, but for which there is insufficient scientific and commercial information to support proposed rules at the time. The San Xavier talussnail was included as a Category 1 species in the November 21, 1991, animal candidate notice of review (56 FR 58804). Category 1 species are those for which the Service has sufficient biological data to support proposals for listing. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the San Xavier talussnail ( Sonorella eremita ) are as follows: A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range. The San Xavier talussnail is a very restricted endemic and is extremely vulnerable to any disturbance that would remove talus, increase interstitial sedimentation, or otherwise alter moisture conditions in its habitat (e.g., road or trail expansion or alteration, mining exploration) (Hoffman 1990). Within the species' habitat are inactive mining prospects and mines, mining stakes, a powerline across the east ridge, and a road leading to a microwave site on the hilltop. A large copper mine is located nearby. There are housing developments of small acreage to the north and to the southwest of the hill. The habitat is too steep (30 to 40 percent slope) to permit house construction, but possible future threats include additional road construction, expansion of the copper mine and/or tailings, and small-scale prospecting and mining.
