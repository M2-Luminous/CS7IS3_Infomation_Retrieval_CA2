Secretary Liu Fangren's speech was divided into three parts: 1. To profoundly understand the great importance of this year's agricultural and rural work; 2. To successfully accomplish this year's basic agricultural and rural work tasks; 3. To further strengthen party leadership over agricultural and rural work. Secretary Liu Fangren said in his speech: Ever since the last rural work meeting held by the provincial party committee in late February of this year, all areas across the province have accomplished a great deal and have scored gratifying results in respect of implementing the spirit of the last central rural work meeting and the spirit of the last provincial party committee rural work meeting. In general, the province's rural situation has remained excellent. Nonetheless, we have not yet fulfilled all agricultural and rural tasks, satisfied all agricultural and rural demands, or implemented to the letter all agricultural and rural policies. We are still confronted with a difficult situation in this regard and with such thorny problems as increasingly high prices for agricultural production means, slow growth of summer crops, lack of agricultural funds and loans, slow increase of peasant income, and so on. Should these thorny problems fail to be resolved, the province's overall agricultural and rural situation would be adversely affected. In view of this situation, party committees and governments at all levels in the province should bravely stand up to difficulties, strengthen confidence, proceed from the overall interests of party work, conscientiously implement to the letter all basic central principles concerning this year's agricultural and rural work, profoundly understand the great importance of successful agricultural and rural work in 1994, and properly handle the strategic relations between reform, development, and stability. They must expand contacts with the outside world and with the provinces and regions to the east, ensure a sufficient food supply, emancipate the mind in a down-to-earth manner, implement to the letter each and every central and provincial agricultural and rural policy, stabilize the grain growing area, and raise the per unit area yield of grain and total grain output. They should step up wheat field management in the latter half of this year's wheat growing season, successfully nurse rice seedlings in hothouses, under plastic films, and in two stages, develop and transplant more maize strains with more nutrition, take steps to protect more than one million mu of high-yield rice and maize fields from excessive rainfall in spring and summer, turn more dry land into irrigated farmland as soon as possible, and make every possible effort to increase income on the part of the peasants by boosting diversified economic growth. Secretary Liu Fangren noted: This year, we should strive to raise the peasants per capita net income by 60 yuan over last year on average throughout the province, by more than 80 yuan in better- off areas where conditions permit, and by more than 50 yuan in poverty-stricken areas. Approximately 10 million people currently lack food and clothing across the province. In view of this situation, we should provide more assistance to and help poverty- stricken areas successfully shake off poverty, work out a new plan aimed at assisting poverty-stricken areas, carry out scientific farming, vigorously build a batch of pillar industries, energetically build infrastructure facilities, push ahead with education development in poverty-stricken areas, and enable poverty- stricken areas shake off poverty as soon as possible. Secretary Liu Fangren asserted: We should closely combine four types of work, specifically, family planning, economic exploitation of poverty-stricken areas, assistance to poverty-stricken areas, and spring plowing production. We should unswervingly carry out these four types of work in a down-to-earth manner and make unreserved efforts to keep the province's natural population growth rate at and below 14 per thousand this year. We should successfully build grassroots organizations in rural areas and ensure rural economic development with political and organizational guarantees. Secretary Liu Fangren urged all areas across the province to strengthen party leadership over agricultural and rural work. To this end, he stressed, prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and county party committees should put more energy toward agricultural work, earnestly improve work style, provide agricultural production with better services, and institute a responsibility system under which party and government leaders at all levels are held fully responsible for agricultural and rural work and are assessed in light of local agricultural and rural work achievements. The party committees at all levels across the province should also organize broad masses of cadres and people to set off a spring plowing upsurge at once and concentrate efforts, time, and human resources on spring plowing production over the next two months with a view to successfully winding up spring plowing production before the summer solstice. A number of provincial party and government leaders, including Wang Siqi, Wang Guangxian, Li Wanlu, Xia Guohua, Huang Yao, Hu Tiansheng, Wang Anze, Gong Xianyong, Mo Shiren, and Zhu Yaoguo, attended the rural work meeting, at which the province's prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and city party and government leaders summed up and exchanged experiences of implementing the spirit of the last provincial party committee rural work meeting.
