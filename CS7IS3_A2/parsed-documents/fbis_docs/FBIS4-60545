Only 10 families left the Qatif Bloc during that period. The Hof 'Aza Regional Council says today that expectations of compensation are not a factor in the Bloc's new settlers' decision. These details are revealed here for the first time by our correspondent Uri Revah: [Begin Revah recording] Were they motivated by the long-term prospects of compensation or by Greater Israel ideology? What are the motives behind the 140 families' decision to settle in the Qatif Bloc after the Oslo agreement? For instance, 41 new families joined Neve Deqalim, versus eight that left the place during the period. [passage omitted] In Nisanit in northern Gaza Strip, 61 new families settled since the agreement. One of the reasons may be the fact that a private house goes here for a mere 130,000 shekels. [passage omitted] Dozens of empty housing units are still available in the Qatif Bloc, and these are expected to be inhabited within a short time. [end recording]
