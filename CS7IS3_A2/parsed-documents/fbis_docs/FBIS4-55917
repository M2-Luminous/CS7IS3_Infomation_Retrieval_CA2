The congress was held in Nuremberg last weekend. Cheb is a west Bohemian district town situated near the Czech-German border. "I believe this is a significant moment," Zieleniec told journalists. "I hope that German political circles will think so as well, since thinking about the future is the basis of mutual reconciliation," he added. Zieleniec pointed out that the SL demands were the demands for a revision of the results of World War Two, with all consequences following from it. In this connection, he warned against the danger of an avalanche, "which can extend to very unpredictable and distant ends". Zieleniec said he considered the demands voiced at the congress for the abolition of the Benes decrees (on the displacement of Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War Two) to be standard demands articulated for long, with "differing extents of vehemence" by individual Sudeten German politicians. No considerable deviation from this trend was recorded at the Sudeten German congress, he added.
