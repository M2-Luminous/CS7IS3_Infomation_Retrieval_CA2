He said: I do not have the slightest doubt that this visit will be a new beginning in the relations between our countries, the relations for which we have made great efforts together and worked hard; especially great in this respect is Eduard Shevardnadze's role. He is respected and loved throughout the world as well as in the United States. The American administration, the American people supported and will support Georgia's independence, the country's territorial integrity and its inviolability. Several kinds of aid have been mapped out during Eduard Shevardnadze's visit both in trade and economy as well as the political aspect. I am very sorry that the conflict in Abkhazia has considerably hampered the good goals which have not yet been fully achieved. I hope that in the not too distant future we will see international peacekeeping forces deployed in Abkhazia, but before this happens many problems must be overcome and Shevardnadze's visit to the United States is very important in resolving these issues. We are living in an age when it is impossible to stay indifferent to the problems of one particular region or country. These problems influence the fate of others. Today's integration is very deep and from that point of view the Caucasus is the region of danger; it must be in the center of our attention, and it will be. I am sure that the meetings in Washington and New York will be beneficial to Georgia, the U.S. ambassador concluded.
