(a) Except as provided under §24.429, any application may be dismissed without prejudice as a matter of right if the applicant requests its dismissal prior to designation for hearing or, in the case of applications filed on Forms 175 and 175&hyph;S, prior to auction. An applicant's request for the return of his application after it has been accepted for filing will be considered to be a request for dismissal without prejudice. Applicants requesting dismissal of their applications are also subject to 47 CFR 1.2104. Requests for dismissal shall comply with the provisions of §24.429 as appropriate. (b) A request to dismiss an application without prejudice will be considered after designation for hearing only if: (1) A written petition is submitted to the Commission and is properly served upon all parties of record, and (2) The petition complies with the provisions of §24.429 (whenever applicable) and demonstrates good cause. (c) The Commission will dismiss an application for failure to prosecute or for failure to respond substantially within a specified time period to official correspondence or requests for additional information. Dismissal shall be without prejudice if made prior to designation for hearing or prior to auction, but dismissal may be made with prejudice for unsatisfactory compliance with §24.429 or after designation for hearing or after the applicant is notified that it is the winning bidder under the auction process. §24.429 Ownership changes and agreements to amend or to dismiss applications or pleadings. (a) Applicability. Subject to the provisions of 47 CFR 1.2105 (Bidding Application and Certification Procedures; Prohibition of Collusion), this section applies to applicants and all other parties interested in pending applications who wish to resolve contested matters among themselves with a formal or an informal agreement or understanding. This section applies only when the agreement or understanding will result in: (1) A major change in the ownership of an applicant to which §§24.423 and 24.423(g) apply or which would cause the applicant to lose its status as a designated entity under §24.309, or (2) The individual or mutual withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of any pending application, amendment, petitioner or other pleading. (b) Policy. Parties to contested proceedings are encouraged to settle their disputes among themselves. Parties which, under a settlement agreement, apply to the Commission for ownership changes or for the amendment or dismissal of either pleadings or applications, shall at the time of filing notify the Commission that such filing is the result of an agreement or understanding. (c) If the amendment would, if granted, cause the applicant to lose its status as a designated entity under §24.309, the applicant must comply with the obligations imposed by §24.309 (Designated Entities) and §1.2111 (Assignment of transfer of control; unjust enrichment) before the amendment will be granted. (d) The provisions of 47 CFR 22.927 will apply in the event of the individual or mutual withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of any pending application, amendment, petitioner or other pleading. §24.430 Opposition to applications. (a) Petitions to deny (including petitions for other forms of relief) and responsive pleadings for Commission consideration must comply with Section 1.2108 and must: (1) Identify the application or applications (including applicant's name, station location, Commission file numbers and radio service involved) with which it is concerned; (2) Be filed in accordance with the pleading limitations, filing periods, and other applicable provisions of 47 CFR 1.41 through 1.52 except where otherwise provided in 47 CFR 1.2108;
