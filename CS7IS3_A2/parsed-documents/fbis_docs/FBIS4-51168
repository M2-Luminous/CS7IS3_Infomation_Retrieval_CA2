While carrying out economic construction, they should also simultaneously handle tasks on maintaining stability. Nationwide stability mainly depends on rural stability. Once the rural areas are stable, the whole country will be stable. [video shows Luo Gan, accompanied by unidentified local rural leaders, visiting and inspecting various rural localities and addressing and holding talks with different groups of local people] Luo Gan said: Hebei's drive in strictly cracking down on various crimes in most of its rural areas has yielded a very effective frightening impact. Party and government cadres and personnel of political and law commissions at the forefront have worked very hard, have made concerted efforts, and have made important contributions to safeguarding social stability. Commenting on ways to maintain rural stability, Luo Gan pointed out: We should properly handle two events: First, we should develop production. Second, we should properly and comprehensively manage social order in rural areas. We should strengthen the development of grass-roots administration and organizations. Once a strong rural leading body is established, it will be able to lead the masses to develop the local economy and safeguard rural stability. We should let mass autonomous organizations, including village self-defense committees [chun zi bao hui] play their proper roles; should intensify the dissemination of general legal knowledge; and should let the broad masses of peasants be more familiar with the law. In particular, we should begin teaching youngsters general legal knowledge. We should resolve contradictions that arise under new historic conditions when they are young and are beginning to develop at an early stage. It is necessary to resolve contradictions at the grass-roots units. By carrying out comprehensive management, we should reduce crimes to the lowest possible level.
