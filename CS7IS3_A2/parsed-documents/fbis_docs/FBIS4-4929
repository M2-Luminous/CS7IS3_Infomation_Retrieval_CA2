"One of the important problems in the present produce-more-and-save-more struggle and in inner reserve mobilization is to save as much fuel as possible and obtain more reserves." In order to mobilize greater reserves of fuel in conformity with the rapid increase in fuel demand, "we should extensively conduct work to save not only the fuel for production purposes but the fuel for consumer uses as well." "One of the ways to save fuel for consumer use is to effectively use soot [yonjae] based on the great leader's teaching and the party's intent." "Soot, which is used for various fields, such as construction material industry, agriculture, and metal industry, thanks to the development of science and technology, is used to save and mobilize the reserve of fuel for consumer use as well." "Taking into account the number of families of residents using coal and petroleum, we know we can obtain considerable fuel reserves by saving the fuel for consumer use." "The use of soot enables us to save coal for consumer use." "Soot contains unburnt coal [miyonsotan] which can give off energy in the process of secondary burning, therefore, if we properly use it for the production of coal briquettes by mixing it with coal, we can save considerable quantity of coal for consumer use. If we separate unburnt coal from soot and add the relevant quantity to general soot, we can make coal briquette without using other coal at all. If we use coal briquette by burning it in a fire box which can retain heat well, we can cook rice and heat the room quickly." "The use of soot enables us to save petroleum for consumer use as well." There are inexhaustible sources of soot in the country, in the power plants, and in boilers at plants and enterprises, therefore, there are good prospects for saving fuel. The problem of primary importance in mobilizing and utilizing this fuel saving reserve is to effectively conduct the work of separating unburnt coal from soot. "To attain major success in the active campaign to save fuel for consumer use through the effective use of soot, we must enhance the role of functionaries in the administrative and economic organizations and in the fuel supply sector." "The more we make it possible to save fuel for consumer use, the more we can utilize it for production and construction in various sectors of the people's economy, and the better can we promote the expedience of the residents' life." "The functionaries should solve on their own the problems in utilizing soot for consumer fuel displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and contribute to a smoother solution to the fuel problem."
