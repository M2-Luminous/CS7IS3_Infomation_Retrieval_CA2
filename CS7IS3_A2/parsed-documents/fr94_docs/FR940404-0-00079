FR940404-0-00079 FR940404-0-00020 However, Vanuatu authorized the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) to provide observer data to NMFS for the 12-month period December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1993, for reconsideration by the AA. These data provided the information required by 50 CFR 216.24(e)(5)(vii). Submission of the most recent 12 months of data is described by ยง216.24(e)(5)(vii)(A), for reconsideration of a negative finding if the species composition rate was not acceptable for the fishing year. The data provided for the December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1993, period indicated that the mortality for eastern spinner and coastal spotted dolphin comprised 4.08 and 0.54 percent of the total mortality, respectively. An affirmative finding for Vanuatu was indicated based on these data. The overall, rather than a weighted, incidental kill-per-set (kps) factor for Vanuatu was used to determine comparability for both periods because the U.S. fleet had fewer than five sets in Fishing Area 3 on common dolphins, an area and species grouping in which the Vanuatu fleet made sets (50 CFR 216.24(e)(5)(v)(F)). Observers assigned by the IATTC accompanied all fishing trips made by Vanuatu-flag purse seine vessels in the ETP during the 1993 fishing season and during the 12-month period submitted for reconsideration, as required by the Notice of Determination published in the Federal Register on January 8, 1992 (57 FR 668). A complete list of Vanuatu-flag tuna purse seine vessels over 400 short tons carrying capacity and their status during the two periods has been submitted, as required by ยง216.24(e)(5)(ii)(B). Therefore, based on the information described above, the AA, after consultation with the Department of State, found that the average rate of incidental taking of marine mammals by Vanuatu-flag vessels was comparable to that of U.S.-flag vessels, and Vanuatu's regulatory program governing the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of harvesting yellowfin tuna by purse seine in the ETP was comparable to the regulatory program of the United States, as required by the tuna importation provisions of 50 CFR 216.24(e). As a result of this affirmative finding, yellowfin tuna and products derived from yellowfin tuna harvested by Vanuatu-flag purse seine vessels operating in the ETP may be imported into the United States through December 31, 1994. At this time, primary embargoes banning the importation of yellowfin tuna and products derived from yellowfin tuna harvested in the ETP by purse seine vessels of Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama remain in effect. In addition, intermediary nation embargoes banning the importation of all yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna products from Costa Rica, Italy, and Japan remain in effect. Questions regarding these primary and secondary embargoes should be directed to the Director, Southwest Region, NMFS (See ADDRESSES ). Dated: March 23, 1994.
