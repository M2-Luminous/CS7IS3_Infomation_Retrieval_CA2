FR940203-1-00008 FR940203-1-00002 Revising the definition of ``Unrestricted area'' to make it clear that for purposes of radiation protection, areas are either restricted or unrestricted, has no perceived environmental impact. Amending the radiation protection training requirements to clarify that they apply to individuals who in the course of employment are potentially exposed to radiation and/or to radioactive material, regardless of whether they may or may not be within a restricted area, will result in no impact on the environment. Adding ยง20.2205 to part 20, which would clearly restore the Commission's policy that individual workers and individual members of the public are notified, whenever NRC is notified, that they have been exposed to radiation or radioactive material in excess of the dose limits, will have no impact on the environment. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determination is based are available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room 2120 L Street, NW., (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact are available from Alan K. Roecklein, U.S. NRC, 5650 Nicholson Lane, Rockville, MD 20852, (301) 492&hyph;3740. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement This proposed rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval numbers 3150&hyph;0044, 3150&hyph;0014, 3150&hyph;0005, and 3150&hyph;0006. Regulatory Analysis The NRC has prepared a draft regulatory analysis on this proposed regulation. The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternatives considered by the NRC. The draft analysis is available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the draft analysis may be obtained from Alan K. Roecklein, U.S. NRC, 5640 Nicholson Lane, Rockville, MD 20852, (301) 492&hyph;3740. The NRC requests public comment on the draft regulatory analysis. Comments on the draft analysis may be submitted to the NRC as indicated under the ADDRESSES heading. Regulatory Flexibility Certification Based upon the information available at this stage of the rulemaking proceeding and in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the NRC certifies that, if promulgated, this rule will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities. The proposed amendments would apply to all NRC and Agreement State licensees. Because these amendments only clarify, restore, and conform existing requirements to the 1991 version of part 20, they are considered to have no significant economic impact on any large or small entities. However, the NRC is seeking comments and suggested modifications because of the widely differing conditions under which small licensees operate. Any small entity subject to this proposed regulation which determines that, because of its size, it is likely to bear a disproportionate adverse economic impact should notify the NRC of this in a comment that indicates_ (a) The licensee's size in terms of annual income or revenue, number of employees and, if the licensee is a treatment center, the number of beds and patients treated annually; (b) How the proposed regulation would result in a significant economic burden upon the licensee as compared to that on a larger licensee; (c) How the proposed regulations could be modified to take into account the licensee's differing needs or capabilities; (d) The benefits that would be gained or the detriments that would be avoided by the licensee if the proposed regulation was modified as suggested by the commenter; and (e) How the regulation, as modified, would still adequately protect the public health and safety. Backfit Analysis Because 10 CFR parts 19 and 20 apply to all NRC licensees, any proposed changes to these parts must be evaluated to determine if these changes constitute backfitting for reactor licensees such that the provisions of 10 CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,'' apply. The following discussion addresses that evaluation.
