However, his economics minister, Aleksandr Shokhin, later told THE GUARDIAN that without "extraordinary measures" the government would be unable to get the income needed to make it work. The latest version of the budget envisages spending 183,000 billion roubles (70.4 billion pounds) and a deficit of 62,400 billion roubles (24.3 bilion pounds), or around 9 per cent of gross domestic product [GDP]. This is a marginal revision of an earlier draft, approved last month which talked of a deficit of "about 10.2 per cent of GNP [Gross National Product]". In giving these figures, Mr Chernomyrdin rejected the demands of the industrial lobby for public spending of 243,000 billion roubles (93.9 billion pounds). "We cannot afford this," he told the Council of the Federation the upper house of parliament in a lacklustre speech. Mr Chernomyrdin rejected the idea of declaring an economic state of emergency which he said would eliminate the possibility of pursuing economic reforms. But in the corridors after the prime minister's speech, Mr Shokhin said extraordinary legislative measures would have to be introduced quickly if the government income foreseen in the budget were to be realised. Mr Shokhin said: "January and Febuary showed a decrease in industrial production of more than 24 per cent and I have to stress that this is the fifth successive year of decrease. We have now come to a make or break point. Either the market mechanism begins to work, or the process of industrial decline in a very broad scale will produce massive unemployment and the complete stop of industry, which would only help the most radical circles in the opposition." He said the central problem was to get money circulating again in the Russian economy. Russian companies had stashed 13.4 billion pounds in foreign bank accounts to avoid taxes. "We have to reassert control of all the money in circulation," he said. "We need extraordinary measures this month to get the normal market mechanisms going again. There is a lot of money in the country's economy but it is not used according to the rules of a market economy." He did not elaborate on what amendments would be made to tax or foreign exchange laws. At a cabinet meeting yesterday, Mr Shokhin was nominated as the government's representative on one of five "round table" groups to represent the executive, the legislature and political parties. The idea of the round tables was to hammer out a common accord on the economy, the regions and republics, and three other problem areas. After his speech, Mr Chernomyrdin tried to avoid answering questions from the representatives of the regions in the upper house. He would only say: "Come and talk to me in the White House." When Nikolay Gonshar chairman of the chamber's economy committee, started speaking of Japan's economic regeneration after the war, Mr Chernomyrdin broke in: "Don't compare us with Japan. The Japanese after the last war worked for 17 years without taking one day off on holiday, whereas our workers cannot keep sober from one Sunday to another."
