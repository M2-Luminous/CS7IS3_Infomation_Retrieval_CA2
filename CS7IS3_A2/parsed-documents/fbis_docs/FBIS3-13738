In this context, as from next week the president of state will start talks with national figures, political parties and social and economic organizations. This dialogue has been defined in the various statements made by the president of state as being an honest dialogue from which no one who respects the Constitution will be excluded; and a constructive dialogue that will bring together all Algerians who are concerned about the continuity of the state and the interests of the people. The purpose of this dialogue is to ensure Algeria's revival and to return to the rule of the people's choice in an atmosphere of clarity and continuity. Moreover, the state is endeavoring with determination to solve the country's current problems out of its resolve to serve an effort that requires more deeds than words. Due to the speedy nature [as heard] of the security situation, the mission of the security forces, which is to ensure the safety of the citizens and their property and eradicate the terrorist violence, needs to continue relentlessly. This mission is carried out with a spirit of self- denial and sacrifice by those who are in charge of leading it and executing it on the ground. The government is also continuously committed to tackling economic and social problems in the framework of the directives given by the president of state during the first meeting of the Council of Ministers on 27 February. It is obvious that this effort to restore our economy requires a commitment from the entire nation and its mobilization through the organizations representing it. Thus, the national dialogue, which the president of state is intending to resume, falls within the framework of a number of integrated and well-ordered actions. This dialogue will undoubtedly provide appropriate conditions for the emergence of a national consensus that will bring together all the Algerians who love their homeland and who adhere to patriotic values, the ideals of the eternal 1 November Revolution and the principles of our Constitution. This consensus will enable Algeria to confront the various pressing challenges facing it. It will also enable it to achieve the goals of the transitional period; these goals were and will remain: Civil peace, democracy, and prosperity.
