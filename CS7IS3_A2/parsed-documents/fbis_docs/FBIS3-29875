Thus, business circles are showing active moves to expand trade and investment in North Korea. Conglomerates that have received invitations from North Korea or have applied to visit North Korea including Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, and Lucky-Gold Star are aiming at once again examining their North Korean-related business projects that have been laid aside. In 1993, Daewoo received approval from the National Unification Board to carry out South-North economic cooperation. When Daewoo Chairman Kim U-chung visited North Korea in 1992, he met then-Vice Premier Kim Tal-hyon and concluded a contract to promote nine pilot projects. Therefore, if the opportunity comes, Daewoo is ready to jump into the projects with North Korea. In particular, Daewoo is planning first of all to start the project of developing the Nampo complex which is near Pyongyang and only five minutes away from the sea. Rather than concentrating on heavy industry, Daewoo's strategy is to actively use North Korea's cheap labor to produce textile products and daily necessities of life such as blouses, jackets, and bags. Based on the economic cooperation established with China, Samsung is showing high interest in the Tumen River development project; the road construction linking Jilin Province, China and Chongjin; and the project to develop Najin-Sonbong. It was learned that in this connection, about one month ago, Samsung invited officials of the Jilin Provincial team dealing with economic cooperation between China and North Korea to the ROK and held deep discussions on jointly developing key industries such as railway, road, harbor, and communications. It was learned that during the meeting a Chinese official said: "North Korea conveyed through an unofficial channel to China of the position that it will be possible for businesses advancing into North Korea to operate and possess property in a capitalistic way." Samsung is also promoting at the same time the establishment of joint venture plants in producing sweaters, foodstuff, and electronic products. Hyundai's Honorary Chairman Chong Chu-yong visited North Korea in 1989 and held discussions on the development of making North Korea's Mt. Kumgang and Myongsasimni tourist attractions and on the Wonsan Bay railway project. Currently, it is promoting large-scale projects. It is also promoting to establish a cotton textile plant. Lucky-Gold Star has been producing and selling working clothes and men's suits in the form of processing-on-commission trade in North Korea from 1993. In the long run, Lucky-Gold Star's goal is to advance into North Korea in the field of electricity, electronics, and synthetic fiber which are its main business forces. Sunkyong is promoting to establish a joint venture marine products processing plant, and a clothing and sewing plant. Ssangyong is promoting to establish a joint venture shoe plant and marine products processing plant. Forty other domestic businesses including Miwon, Hyosong, and Kolon are planning to carry out foodstuff business and establishment of department stores and textile plants in North Korea. An official of Lucky-Gold Star said: "The greatest barrier in economic cooperation with North Korea is the fact that businessmen and technicians are not able to go to North Korea. Since economic cooperation is dependent on the political situation, there is no stability in investment."
