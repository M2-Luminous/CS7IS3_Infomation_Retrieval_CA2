That is axiomatic. In turn defense production facilities can be effective under present conditions if they are part of powerful diversified industrial companies and financial and industrial groups -- efficient components of the market economy. Today the defense industry and science complex is living through exceptionally complex times. In the past few years it has undergone substantial changes. On average at enterprises of Russia's former defense complex the volume of defense production is 20 percent of the total production volume. Despite all efforts, the optimum path for the development of defense science and technology and defense production facilities under the conditions of the changes taking place in our country has still not been elaborated. Although many outlines of this path have already become clearer. Collective intelligence is needed for its elaboration, as is the comprehensive examination not only of the military, economic, and technological aspects but also of the social and legal aspects of this problem. The new supplement in KRASNAYA ZVEZDA can ensure such collective thinking. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already done quite a lot to cover these problems under present conditions but I am sure that it can do even more. Today a particularly strict, self-critical, extremely attentive and scrupulous examination of the problems of providing arms for the army and navy is needed. I think that with this sober, analytical approach constantly illumined with a high sense of concern for Russia's supreme interests and for our fatherland's defense capability, our newspaper's new supplement will be an important step forward in preserving and augmenting Russia's defense industry potential in its optimum dimensions for the state and the army. I very much hope that the newspaper will inter alia help reveal and educate new leaders of our defense industry and science. And for that, however paradoxical it may seem, you often have to look into the past and extract from it as much as you can in the way of lessons for the present and future.
