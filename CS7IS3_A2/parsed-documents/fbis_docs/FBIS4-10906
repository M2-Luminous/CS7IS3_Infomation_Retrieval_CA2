Hull was charged with involvement in "hostile actions," allegedly drug trafficking, and a bloody attack in which several journalists were killed in 1984. President Rafael Angel Calderon made these statements after learning of a news report from Managua stating the U.S. citizen has been in Nicaragua for two months. The U.S. citizen is also facing charges of alleged homicide [homicidio calificado] and attempted homicide. According to Costa Rican political sectors, Hull, who owns a farm in northern Costa Rica, near Nicaragua, was reportedly involved in the La Penca attack 10 years ago, in which several journalists and guerrillas of the anti-Sandinist group, then led by Eden Pastora, were killed. Hull has denied the charges, saying he is a victim of "communists." Hull fled Costa Rica five years ago after police arrested him.
