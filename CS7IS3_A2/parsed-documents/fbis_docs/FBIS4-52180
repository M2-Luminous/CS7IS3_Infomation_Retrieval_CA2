The private sector should minimize the domestic financial sources to finance their investment projects, the minister said, adding that the private sector should avoid using offshore loans despite their growing role in the country's development efforts. "The strict control of offshore borrowing is essential, not only to maintain the level of the balance of payments at a comfortable level, but also to reduce the debt burden, the minister said at a seminar on strategic financing sources. Bank Indonesia [Central Bank] Governor J. Sudrajad Jiwandono, president of the state-owned Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) [Indonesian State Bank], Winarto Sumarto and chairman of Merril Lynch Limited for the Asia and Pacific Region, Peter Clarke, were among the speakers at the seminar held by the EDITOR weekly magazine. Mar'ie promised to further address the country's non-bank financial sources to enable the private sector to benefit from the government's massive infrastructure projects in the 1994-1999 sixth Five-year Development Plan (Repelita VI) period. The capital market should be further developed to give the private sector better alternatives for raising investment funds, he said. Indonesia should invest at least Rp [Rupiah] 660 trillion (US$314 billion) to sustain economic growth in the current five year development plan. The private sector is expected to contribute around 37 percent of that figure. The Central Bank governor shared the finance minister's view on the need of the private sector to enter the capital market to obtain investment funds. "I think the capital market is the best financing alternative at present," Sudrajad said, adding that domestic banks are also a good financing alternative, but the available funds in the banks are not sufficient to meet the huge investment demand. He said the private sector should use local financial sources, as raising commercial loans from overseas will still be restricted in order to reduce the country's debt burden. Sudrajad said the country's debt-service ratio is expected to decline to 20 percent by the end of the Repelita VI period in 1999 from around 32 percent at present. He said the government will also continue to improve the investment climate to further attract foreign investments. "Foreign direct investment is one of important financial alternatives for development in the next five years," he said. In another development, the finance minister dismissed reports of a rush to buy dollars [US] based on rumors of the government's plan to devalue the rupiah.
