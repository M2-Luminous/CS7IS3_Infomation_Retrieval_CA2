The agreement between the government and the National Federation of Public Employees Unions, Fenasep, establishes wage increases of between 100 and 120 quetzales through a so-called emergency bonus program. The agreement also establishes Fenasep's inclusion on the Wage Policy Commission -- a strategy designed to bolster consumer protection and to make government services more efficient. President de Leon Carpio referred to this agreement in a news conference at the airport this morning, minutes before leaving for Mexico. [Begin De Leon recording] The government has nothing more to discuss in light of the fact that yesterday it signed an agreement that ends the strike, which was clearly illegal and even criminal in nature because it did not meet the legal requirements for declaring a strike. From this moment onward, the government declares that the problem has ended. Perhaps the most important point in yesterday's agreement, aside from the actual point of contention, is the pledge by both sides to make changes. The agreement itself reads: The government of the Republic promises to guarantee the enforcement of the Consumer Protection Law. Both sides have agreed on the need to review the government's current organizational structure to make it more efficient and thereby offer an effective response to the needs of the Guatemalan people. In view of Fenasep's need to implement more consistent general policies, from this date onward -- in other words, yesterday -- Fenasep is joining the government team on the Wage Policy Commission. This is being done in an effort to establish a framework that will define wage policies on a continuous basis and not just when the need arises. This means that the agreement that has been signed not only resolves this problem, but from this moment onward, both sides will sit at the negotiating table to review the state employment structure. If through these talks we see an opportunity to increase wages to bolster efficiency or because we encounter a reduction in the number of state workers, we can change wage policies at that time. This will be a result of the review process. We can say with satisfaction that the strike ended today, just as the media has announced. Any further job action will be considered illegal. Just as illegal acts were controlled yesterday, some of which were carried out by criminals, the same holds true today under acting President Arturo Herbruger. As of today, all public administration should be working normally in light of the fact that the government has accepted the emergency bonus, whose cost can be covered without affecting the Guatemalan people.
