Good evening, madam. [Chamorro] Good evening, Don Jacobo, I am delighted to hear you again here in Mexico, after your visit to Nicaragua. [Zabludovsky] Thank you for granting us this interview. [Chamorro] It is a pleasure, my friend. [Zabludovsky] Madam, President Salinas welcomed you today, and you spoke. What did you discuss? [Chamorro] You know, Don Jacobo, my dear friend, that when colleagues meet, we must talk about our sadness, our happiness, and about the future. I am happy to be here in Mexico, and I feel that we as presidents will reap fruits beneficial to the two nations. [Zabludovsky] When you took office as president of Nicaragua, I remember well that people said this was not a job for a woman. They said it was no position for a woman. [Chamorro] Now you have made me laugh, Don Jacobo. [Zabludovsky] [Laughs] Now that several years have passed, how would you evaluate the situation? [Chamorro] Jacobo, you have said that being president of Nicaragua was no place for a woman, but the people said they wanted it -- do not forget that voting is secret -- so here I am. I would like to say that there has been a total change in my country. We went from sadness to happiness. We have found profound reconciliation among all Nicaraguans. We have found forgiveness, which we needed after so many years of pain and distortion from past dictatorships. What can a nation do? We must find reconciliation among ourselves, to attain freedom and democracy, to reconstruct our nation, control and reduce militarism, and create a small Army, just as we always wanted. I am speaking about Nicaragua, of course, as I visit Mexico. General Sandino once said, as did former Costa Rican President Jose Figueres Ferrer, we need a small Army. You mentioned militarism, and I agree. We need a small Army in our country, which had 3 million inhabitants when I took office and has 4.5 million inhabitants now. I believe I am leaving a good legacy for all Nicaraguans. I prefer not to talk about other countries because I inherited my country. You know well enough that one should not interfere in any other country's affairs. We should respect and listen to each other. [Zabludovsky] Madam President, when you took office in Nicaragua, you defied many lines of thought. You did not pay much attention to pressure for Sandinism, the system that preceded you, to disappear. Not only did you ignore those perspectives, but you accepted many other viewpoints and political trends. You gave Gen. Humberto Ortega, who came from the system before you, the Defense Ministry. Now he feels he should be your successor. Do you think all this has been positive? [Chamorro] Let me say, Jacobo, that when I took office four years ago, I did so with the secret vote of all the people in Nicaragua who wanted to vote for a change in our country. It is true there were authoritarian people from the immediate past and even from before that. The Nicaraguans who have come home during the last four years want a change. Can you imagine? More than 1.5 million people have returned to Nicaragua. What does that mean? It means change. What has my mission been? It has been to change things, to find reconciliation, and to learn how to forgive each other. You speak of one person: Humberto Ortega, who used to be called Gen. Humberto Ortega. Allow me to say that there will come a time when things will have to change for Gen. Humberto Ortega, as well as anyone else with a military rank living in a democratic country. This is not being a dictator. It is freedom in democracy. Now, after many years, I am here on Televisa talking about my country. What do I want for my country? I want to get rid of totalitarianism, not only the Sandinists but also the Somozists. I lived through many years of that, and I want my country to be democratic, free, and sovereign, thanks to the people's vote. The generals must change. I have reduced the Army. They must continue to be Nicaraguans and stay in Nicaragua because they have no reason to flee the country. They do not have to leave Nicaragua. They have to continue being Nicaraguans. Everyone must learn how to lose. What does learning to lose mean? It means that when I finish my term I will hand over the country. I am very sorry if there is someone out there who does not like me. I am here for my country, for love, and for reconciliation. I told Humberto Ortega on 2 September that there must be changes in Nicaragua. He will step down very soon in 1994, if not sooner. In any case, he will step down. What does step down mean? It means to make changes democratically. He is a Nicaraguan personality who has done plenty for his country as well. [Zabludovsky] Is there reelection in Nicaragua? [Chamorro] As you well know, four years ago I was handed a country where there had been a dictatorship. We are now in a democratic country, where we are making constitutional changes. We will see if the National Assembly wants there to be reelection or not. Let me move ahead here, before you ask me: Dona Violeta, are you going to run for reelection? No, my dear friend, enough. I have done enough for my country. I am 64 years old and proud of it. I am proud to say that I feel happy to have worked for my country. It is difficult to heal wounds like ours. Some like it, and others do not. I would have preferred a politician to run the country, but to each his own. Praise the Lord. The people wanted Violeta to be here, so here I am. When they no longer want me here, I will gladly go home, and I will still be a Nicaraguan. I would not leave. [Zabludovsky] What would happen if the people ask you to run for reelection? [Chamorro] If the people want me to run again, I would have to think about it, Jacobo. Remember... [pauses] No, it has been enough. I think we should leave it to the politicians. They would probably do better than I. [Zabludovsky] Madam President, thank you, and my respect. [Chamorro] It was my pleasure, and I hope to see you in Nicaragua soon. [Zabludovsky] Very well. Good night, Madam President. [Chamorro] Good night, dear friend.
