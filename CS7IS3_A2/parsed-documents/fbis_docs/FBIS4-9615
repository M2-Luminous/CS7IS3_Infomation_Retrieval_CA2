FBIS4-9615 "dreeu083_p_94013" FBIS-EEU-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 POLAND Changes in Main Customs Office Changes in Main Customs Office 94P20655A 94P20655A CSO [Editorial Report] In an effort to reduce long traffic delays on Poland's borders and to combat the country's smuggling problems, the new head of the Main Customs Office (GUC), Ireneusz Sekula, plans to undertake "legislative, technical, and organizational changes" that will modernize the office and increase efficiency, according to a report in the Warsaw weekly GAZETA PRZEMYSLOWA I HANDLOWA (GPiH) of 8-14 March. Sekula, a member of the SdRP (Social Democracy of the Polish Republic), was labor minister and deputy prime minister in the governments of Zbigniew Messner and Mieczyslaw Rakowski, respectively, during the 1980's. In an interview in the Warsaw daily TRYBUNA (17 March), Sekula elaborated on details concerning his "new strategy" for the customs office. According to TRYBUNA interviewer Cezary Rudzinski, the customs office is the fourth-largest revenue source for the state budget, providing over 98 trillion zlotys (Z) to the budget last year from customs fees and taxes collected on 6 million customs clearances and postal packages. Office expenses amounted to Z1 trillion. Sekula estimates smuggling losses of $1-3 billion. According to the GPiH, last year alone customs officers uncovered 16,200 smuggling attempts, twice as many as in 1992, with the confiscated goods--mostly cigarettes, alcohol, and cars--amounting to approximately Z2 trillion. Through modernization and increased efficiency, GUC hopes to increase revenues to the state budget by minimizing payments lost to smuggling. Sekula sees the first order of business to be in the legislative arena. GUC, in agreement with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, has prepared a draft of "temporary changes" to the existing customs law, presenting it to the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers (KERM) in March, with the expectation that it will be reviewed by parliament during the current term and be passed "still this year." In the TRYBUNA interview, Sekula describes three major changes proposed by the draft: 1) All border crossings will be subject to the central management of GUC. As it stands now, management of individual border crossings is relegated to the voivodships in which they are located, resulting in uneven management, with some voivodships "having neither the inclination nor the money to manage them" adequately. The proposed changes would allow GUC to organize "a financial consortium to build and manage border crossings." 2) Many "anachronistic regulations dating back to the 1960's" that actually limit the legal authority of the customs inspectors need to be eliminated. Instead, the draft law proposes the establishment of a General Customs Inspector (GIC) and "customs police," with the "necessary legal authority" to function effectively. When asked to further clarify the role of the customs police, Sekula attempted to assuage the anxiety reflected in the question by emphasizing that the customs police "by no means" is meant to be a "gendarmerie watching over the customs officers." Rather, its role "above all" is to uncover smuggling and also to prevent it, making it more risky and, hence, less profitable. To that end, the customs police would not only inspect the consignee and check documentation, but also "inspect the provenance" of goods for sale in stores, wholesales firms, warehouses, and street stands. 3) Sekula intends to appeal a recent decision by the Constitional Tribunal that views the collection of "processing and handling fees" (oplaty manipulacyjne) by the customs service to be a "fine" because the discontinuation of such fees would "severely limit" and even "paralyze" the functioning of the customs service. In particular, he views these fees as necessary to the wage fund, allowing GUC to pay its customs officers better. Last year alone, GUC collected Z645.6 billion in processing and handling fees, with over half of this amount going to "bonuses and awards." Without such fees, the average monthly salary of a customs officer would be only Z2 million (about $100), adding to the chances of smugglers "corrupting" customs officers. A "no less important issue" is that of modernizing the technical equipment of the customs service, a project that Sekula estimates would cost $40-100 million, an amount that neither GUC nor the state treasury is in a position to finance. "Specialized firms," including IBM and ICL [the British computer firm International Computers Limited], have been invited to bid for the position of "systems operator" of this project. The systems operator--two may possibly be chosen--will have its initial investment returned, "with a profit," by charging the customs service a "fee" for the use of the system. In turn, GUC will save administrative and equipment costs and will be able to collect fees faster. It is expected that the system will be speeded up by using scanners that will read "any type of customs document," including SAD (the Standard Administrative Document of the EU [European Union], increasingly used in Poland) into the system and that this "will tighten the borders" throughout the country. The "brain" of the system, Sekula insisted, "will remain in Polish hands, in GUC." Another technical innovation discussed by Sekula is satellite monitoring "of all trucks transiting Poland," required because of the frequency, as noted by the TRYBUNA interviewer, of trucks "disappearing somewhere in Poland"--a reference to increased reports of theft, hijacking, and the smuggling of goods. Sekula would also like to see the transiting TIR (the highly-regulated European "International Transport of Goods by Road" trucking system) vehicles placed on rail lines, a procedure that would be inititated "beyond Poland's borders"--for example, at bases in Magdeburg and near Berlin. Trucks would thus be "protected" on their way from Germany to Brest (in Belarus) or Medyka (near Przemysl, on the Ukrainian border), and drivers would be able to rest. According to Sekula, the Germans "are extremely interested in using rail lines for these trucks, but the drivers "from the east" are against it, "mostly because they receive a per diem of 35 German marks" and thus profit from the delays in the current system, "whether they are driving or waiting in line" to get through customs. Sekula also discussed the issue of modernization and personnel expansion. Even though there are at present approximately 100 border crossings and 300 customs posts throughout Poland, employing about 10,600 people in the central and voivodship administrations, Sekula said, about 2,000 additional customs officers will be needed to assure a faster and fairer customs service. The border-crossing posts require rebuilding and modernization costing Z1.2 billion annually, which he expects will be funded by the financial consortia that would eventually earn "profits for the services rendered." A program for rebuilding the border crossings "is in place." Commenting on such efforts to modernize the service, the 14-18 March GPiH argues that "one dollar invested in strengthening the structure, including the hiring of new customs officers, is returned twice over in the form of greater returns of customs fees."
