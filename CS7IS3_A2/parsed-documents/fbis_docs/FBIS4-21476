Their implementation over the past two decades has involved substantial sums of money. But key EU officials on one side, and top executives representing the industry on the other, often have conflicting views on the problems faced by the sector. Recently, some industrialists appealed to companies to do all they could to ensure that those who make the decisions in Europe are fully aware of the cost consequences of new directives and take into consideration the consumers' willingness to pay. Tom Garvey, deputy director-general on environment at the European Commission, admits that the Commission is ``sometimes criticised for making proposals for new legislation without giving proper consideration to the financial implications.'' He argues, though, that the cost of providing water to very demanding standards has to be set against the advantage of the health protection it affords. ``There are two possible points of departure for such a debate. Firstly, can we afford to pay for the standards which are set? And secondly, can we afford not to have such standards?,'' Garvey says. However, water and waste management companies such as Britain's Severn Trent draw attention to the huge amount of money that Europe would need to spend in order to get anywhere near the standards, for example, of the UK or Switzerland. ``The enormity of the number of directives -- like the issues it raises -- renders the whole debate meaningless on a Europe-wide basis,'' says Roderick Paul, Severn Trent's chief executive. The water industry in England and Wales has needed to spend 28 billion pounds ($42bn) to improve its services. Severn Trent itself has spent more than 2bn pounds over the past four years to achieve high standards. Apart from providing water services in the UK, the company's waste water services business handles domestic, commercial and industrial waste in Belgium. ``When one considers EU directives in their broadest sense, I always find it strangely perverse that Severn Trent is helping Flanders to run its waste water services operation, and that Brussels itself has no sewage treatment capability,'' says Paul. Future economic growth is seen by some to be adversely affected by the high costs for clean water. ``The alternative -- poorly managed polluted water supplies -- may be an even worse threat,'' argues Garvey. He urges water sector officials in Europe to use the best available scientific knowledge, as in this way ``we are more likely to be able to keep the price of our water under control in the future.'' However, it may take some time before such a message is acted upon by all EU members. Valerie Homer, deputy director of the Water Companies Association in London, says the UK is the only EU country which issues comprehensive annual reports on the quality of water. Denmark and Portugal also prepare reports, but neither covers the entire country. In 1996, every EU country will be obliged for the first time to produce a report on compliancy with the water directives. This will be the first occasion when it might be possible to draw a clearer picture of the situation in Europe. Most water industries have either gone through change or are about to be reformed. In countries such as France and the UK they have been privatised, but water in most EU states is still controlled by municipal authorities. In Spain, public and private companies co-exist. Public subsidies towards capital development costs are available in some countries and not in others. Tariff structures also vary; water is only metered in certain countries. Paul believes that the way to meet cost challenges of EU regulations is to say that everything must be relative, because the basis upon which the regulations are set vary from country to country. He says: ``Apart from the EU, the last word lies with the industry. We cannot go on expecting the customer to pay for whatever the regulator's latest ideas may cost.''
