Most of the drug is hidden in trailer trucks or in ships, as certain police operations in the last few years have shown. Costa Rican Security Minister Luis Fishman told ACAN-EFE that, contrary to what everyone thinks, the maritime route is not the primary transportation means for the drug going from South America to North America, but rather the land route is. According to the minister, the drug generally reaches Panama from Colombia by sea. There it is loaded on to trailer trucks with different types of merchandise on its way north until it reaches the United States, the largest market in the world. The strongest blows against drug trafficking activities, however, have been dealt when the drug is being transported on ships, in high speed boats, on its way to the United States. The most recent blow took place last week in a joint operation between Nicaragua and Costa Rica. In this operation, the authorities arrested five Colombians and a Guatemalan citizen after being alerted by the DEA. The drug traffickers were caught by Nicaraguan authorities in Costa Rican waters. According to media reports, the group belongs to the Pereira Cartel in Colombia and will be returned to Costa Rica, where they will be prosecuted for drug trafficking. In a high speed boat, which left the Colombian port of Buenaventura, this group was carrying 650 kg of drugs, which would supposedly be unloaded somewhere in Guatemala from where it was to be transported to the United States by land, according to police sources. In the last four years, more than 3,000 kg of cocaine have been confiscated in Costa Rica alone, according to official reports. Most of the drug was transported in ships on the Pacific Ocean and were detected by radars operated by the DEA in northern Costa Rica and Panama. Fishman noted his government's firm commitment to fight drug trafficking activities with all its resources, but said the police lack the means for more effective action. In a report released earlier this month, the U.S. State Department praised the efforts made by the Central American Governments, with the exception of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, in their fight against drug trafficking and money laundering activities. Nicaraguan Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta said in Costa Rica on Monday that this joint operation, which resulted in the arrest of six drug traffickers on Friday and the confiscation of the drug is a demonstration of his country's willingness to fight drug trafficking activities. "It has been proven that the fight against drug trafficking activities is not the responsibility of a country, but of the international community. The success of the operation conducted by Nicaragua and Costa Rica is proof of that," he pointed out. According to the State Department, the scarce resources of the Costa Rican authorities and the lack of professionalism of the security services preclude greater progress in the fight against drug trafficking activities in Costa Rica. It pointed out that the port of Limon, the largest Costa Rican port, has become the primary drug trafficking point between the Colombian island of San Andres and the Nicaraguan Caribbean coast with the United States. Fishman has repeatedly talked about the need for greater cooperation by the consumer nations for a more effective action against drug trafficking in Central America.
