[Kaczmarek] Many persons want to implement privatization on their own. I believe that we must declare war on the belief in the healing power of branch holdings which are supposed to cure all Polish ailments. Many countries are currently abandoning such organizational structures in favor of manufacturing-commercial consortia, which minimize the risk of the economic activity that is being pursued. [Golata] The industry minister suggests that you share the responsibility for the effects of privatization. Does this issue concern only responsibility? [Kaczmarek] The crux of the dispute lies in the following: I believe that a separate law should be drafted which would define the rules of commercialization of state-run enterprises -- I do not think that they should be defined in the privatization law which is being amended right now. I do not think that we should start the discussion with the question of who decides the composition of the supervisory boards. First the relations between the Treasury and the method of managing the public wealth must be defined, and only then should we speak about the tools -- privatization and commercialization. We must humbly accept that the era of bureaucratic steering of enterprises is coming to an end; beginning is the time of constructing systems that regulate the functioning of the economy. In other words, the point is to specify the rules of the game within the various sectors. This is what the branch ministries should deal with, not with the fight for bureaucracy's power in the economy. The problem of the structure of ownership is of secondary importance. [Golata] Deputy Bogdan Pek criticizes all your decisions; Ryszard Bugaj queries the number of enterprises selected for participation in the Mass Privatization Program [PPP]. The atmosphere over privatization is not very favorable to you. [Kaczmarek] I think that Deputy Pek has already stopped criticizing me. The querying of my activities results from the fact that at the beginning of my activity I was not able to win the trust of the chairman of the Sejm committee. The differences of opinions on privatization were primarily a result of the different levels of knowledge on ownership transformations, in which I have been taking part for quite some time now. Nevertheless, I think that emotions have died down and a cease fire has gone into effect. Now, the criticism of Deputy Bugaj is of a definitely statistical, not substantive nature. I would expect a polemic concerning the changes brought about in the economy by the process of mass privatization. In my opinion, the fewer election campaigns, the better the atmosphere over privatization. It has always been so that in ownership transformations political capital was made. Now we should start making capital without this adjective. [Golata] Do you not get the impression that we are now in a waiting period? Employees are waiting for free shares, and enterprises are waiting for a magic law that would improve their financial condition... [Kaczmarek] I have come across such opinions. In the ministry no one is waiting for anything and the privatization program is being implemented. In two-thirds of all the transformations, decisions are made in voivodships. The PPP is in a phase in which it is difficult to expect any spectacular successes. I believe that people's expectations concerning the distribution of free shares have been aroused too much. Therefore, I am not surprised that enterprises and employees are waiting for a new privatization law. We are not going to force anyone to take part in mass privatization, even though we are often attacked for using procedures that are said to be too democratic. [Golata] It should be expected that at least 15 percent of the free shares of the privatized enterprises will bring about the opposition of all those who will not be able to enjoy this privilege. [Kaczmarek] I have already been asked such a question: On the basis of what norms do I want to divide Poles into two categories -- those who work in privatized companies and those outside them? I must admit that the pact on enterprise, negotiated by the trade unions, does not include any offer for the employees of the budget sphere, the people of free professions, senior citizens, disabled pensioners, and the employees of companies which will not be privatized. I think that a dispute over who should be given the shares and who should not does not make any sense. Privatization must be a result of a well-considered economic decision. [Golata] Giving away shares does not have much to do with economics. [Kaczmarek] Some have said not just "a" but also "b" by promising 100 million zlotys first, and then 300 million. In a country whose society does not have very extensive capital resources, such slogans arouse emotions and hopes. One cannot go totally "upstream" -- one must give satisfaction also to those who are not working in enterprises being privatized. [Golata] They still have the popular privatization and the National Investment Funds [NFI]. [Kaczmarek] These assure participation in the privatization process to all those who are willing to try it, and they are also a form of the state fulfilling its obligations vis-a-vis some social groups. [Golata] A post on an NFI supervisory board must be profitable since a few thousand people have submitted their applications for the position. [Kaczmarek] I am not sure whether these posts will be so profitable. Out of 6,800 candidates, about 100 will remain. I would like the supervisory boards to include persons with experience in the area of so-called financial engineering, as well as persons skilled in strategic planning. I know for a fact that Poland does not have too many such experts. I am first of all eager to have economic practitioners who are capable of showing a record of success. [Golata] The privatization program for 1994 provides that 12.3 trillion zlotys will go into the budget as profit from sales of enterprises. So that means we continue to regard ownership transformations as a source of providing additional resources to the state budget? [Kaczmarek] That is unavoidable. We must keep in mind that every transaction means not just an inflow into the budget of a sum equal to the price of the sale -- let us not forget taxes and customs duties which result from increases in the turnover of companies subjected to privatization. [Golata] Looking at privatization from the budget's standpoint often leads to accusations about insufficient prices of companies being sold. [Kaczmarek] I would like everyone who makes such accusations, to be able to listen to negotiations with the given strategic investor. On the other hand, I doubt whether we will manage to work out clear criteria for evaluating the ownership transformations minister's activities. [Golata] Just one unsuccessful privatization -- for instance that of Bank Slaski -- may annul 100 ownership transformations beneficial to the economy. [Kaczmarek] The lucky part about the whole misfortune of the Bank Slaski case, was that the bank was privatized by the Finance Ministry. But it was my ministry that was burdened with the entire odium. Unfortunately, big social expectations regarding privatization are accompanied by a small tolerance for mistakes that are made. Of course, you can always say one should have predicted a number of situations. But on the other hand, compare the first and the most recent agreements on capital privatization. There is a huge difference, qualitatively speaking. [Golata] An accusation is often levied that the ministry sells such companies to foreign capital, which should remain in Polish hands. This accusation applies for instance to the tobacco industry. [Kaczmarek] The dispute surrounding the tobacco industry is more ambition-driven than it is about substance. I am not completely convinced as to whose interests the persons defending the status quo represent -- is it the interests of state-owned companies, or else of foreign companies which have obtained a license to build new factories? In a situation where 22 percent of the cigarettes come from abroad, it is the importers that gain the biggest advantage from the dispute. I will strive to have the tobacco industry privatized. Every strategic investor, before he receives his portfolio of the majority of shares, will have to present an investment program and also the fundamentals of his policies vis-a-vis the growers. We must be taking care of the state's monopoly in Treasury issues, but we will not be striving at a monopoly of state property. We are no match for the competition. [Golata] Does the need to maintain a national character also apply to other branches? [Kaczmarek] In an increasing number of cases, the argument is also raised in talks regarding the oil branch's privatization. Unfortunately, a concept for having the branch privatized is still missing while time flies very fast. Poland's entry into Europe means we will be flooded with products made by Western refineries. Not a lot is happening regarding the privatization of the telecommunications industry. That is strange, when you take into account how highly profitable the sector is. [Golata] It seems that you will be successful in meeting one goal -- by the end of the year, the number of companies registered on the stock market will double. [Kaczmarek] That is not my contribution but just a case of a correct forecast. What happened at the stock market in March, must cause concern. But it could be that the Polish stock market is becoming normal. The fact that private companies are interested in joining the stock market, is cause for optimism. The prevalence of petty investors who respond nervously to changes in the economic situation, is a weakness of the Polish capital market. [passage omitted]
