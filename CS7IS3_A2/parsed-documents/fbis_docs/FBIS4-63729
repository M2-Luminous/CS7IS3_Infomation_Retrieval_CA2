You are definitely in favor of stronger ties with Russia, even though your Republic has been part of Ukraine since 1954. How would you like to prevent the possibility of exacerbating the conflict over Crimea? [Meshkov] The only way to avert such a conflict is to force the Ukrainian authorities to implement the commitments that they have made. For the time being, however, we have been witnessing something entirely contrary. [Wrubel] What do you mean: to force? [Meshkov] The current elite in Kiev is busy trying to figure out how to stay in power. However, it is no longer supported by the people. The Ukrainian people were sentenced to living in poverty. There are attempts to take advantage of the upcoming 50th anniversary of the deportation of the Crimean Tartars to aggravate the conflict. Under the pretext that public order is jeopardized, additional military units are being dispatched to our territory. We used to have 18,000 soldiers whereas now we have as many as 60,000. Who needs this? We are concerned about the economy, but what we get are military echelons, tanks, special units, and flame throwers. In addition, the United States and other countries are being appealed to for support. This may bring about inestimable consequences. [Wrubel] Your movement is being accused of promoting Russian nationalism, of separatism, and sometimes even of political hooliganism. [Meshkov] The motives of our activities have nothing to do with nationalism. On the contrary; the goal of our policy is to protect Crimea from an increase in nationalistic feelings. [Wrubel] Is the support given to you by Russia sufficient? [Meshkov] Most important for us is the support of our own people, of the inhabitants of Crimea. As far as Russia is concerned, we would certainly be happy if its official policy were firmer. Nonetheless, we understand, of course, that this is not always possible and that Moscow's stand depends on many various factors. [Wrubel] The forces that are giving support to you in Russia do not call up good associations. Those forces are accused of chauvinism and enmity toward reforms. [Meshkov] Crimea is the happy place on earth where there is no nationalism. Any attempts by external forces to arouse it will be abortive, both now and in the future. Thus, the support given to us by extreme groups will not in any way decide the character of our ambitions. Moreover, we are supported by various forces -- first of all by people who are concerned about the development of the situation in Crimea. [Wrubel] Many of your decrees have been annulled by President Kravchuk. Recently Kiev has opposed the changes in the posts of the minister of security and the minister of internal affairs -- both changes were made by you. Your powers are subject to quite considerable limitations, then? [Meshkov] Both of these cases are the best illustration of the conditions in which we are conducting our activities. We are getting ready for the implementation of an economic reform, whereas Kiev is employing forceful methods in order to aggravate the conflict. The minister of internal affairs breached official discipline and the Crimea Republic did not receive even a small portion of the information that the security services were sending over to Kiev. Now, this apparatus should work first of all for its own Republic, even if it considered it to be part of Ukraine. Therefore, I had to appoint new ministers. [Wrubel] One of the best-known Crimean problems is the issue of Tartars, whose leaders are rather critical of your program. What do you think needs to be done to resolve the problem of Tartars? [Meshkov] The issue of how this problem should be resolved is decided in the general declaration of human rights. Crimean citizens of Tartar nationality have suffered wrongs that should be compensated to them. Unfortunately, the Crimean Republic is not in a position to bear the financial burden of a just resolution of this problem. This is why we need help. However, also in this case I would like to stress that there is not at all an undercurrent of nationalism in the present difficulties linked to the resolution of the Tartar problem. [Wrubel] The Russian minister of defense and his Ukrainian counterpart, who held negotiations in Sevastopol on the Black Sea fleet, considered your participation in the talks to be undesirable. Did you feel offended? [Meshkov] I could feel personally offended, but this would not be rational behavior. However, the situation looks different if we perceive this event as an illustration of the attitude toward Crimea's president. It is a requirement of diplomatic protocol that defense ministers visiting some administrative unit advise, at least its authorities, that they are coming. However, even if the president of Crimea is shown disrespect, it must be remembered that it is not possible to show disrespect to the people who have elected him.
