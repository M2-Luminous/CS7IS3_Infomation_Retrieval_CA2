Justice Ministry spokesman Eti Asher explained yesterday that "Israeli law does not permit the extradition of Israeli citizens to foreign countries, even for extraditable offenses. That is the reason the United States has not submitted any request for the extradition of Rami Dotan and Attorney Harold Katz." [passage omitted] Asher added that the United States could request Israel's permission to initiate Israeli court proceedings against the men named in the charge sheets, if they are indeed convicted by the U.S. courts, but it has yet to do so. The United States can also demand their extradition from any third country they may visit or in which they may reside. [passage omitted]
