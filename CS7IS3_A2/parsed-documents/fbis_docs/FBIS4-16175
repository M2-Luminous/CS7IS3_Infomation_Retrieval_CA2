On Last Day of Spanish Visit Boris Nikolayevich Spoke of Bosnia, Civic Consensus, and His Own Health"] [Text] Madrid -- Apart from the seven documents signed by the Russian leadership in Spain, the leadership was also enriched with theoretical knowledge about the achievement of civic peace in the country. The fact is that in October 1977, two years after Franco's death, the so-called "Moncloa Pact" -- an agreement reminiscent of the "Agreement on Civic Peace" that is in preparation in Russia -- was signed in Spain. In the document all Spain's political parties, trade unions, entrepreneurs, and, naturally, its government agreed that it was time to build democracy peacefully in the country. The 101-page document was closely studied by the Russian president. Boris Yeltsin spent several hours with Spanish Premier Gonzalez to learn all the details of this consensus. As for the practical application of foreign experience, the Russian president made the following comment at a press conference: "We intend to sign the document 28 April and so far we are not backtracking from that. It is supported by the leadership of the State Duma and the Federation Council, the government, most parties and social movements, and so forth. I think that most will sign on the 28th, and the document will later be open for signing by those who want to do so." It so happened that the state visit to Spain was held in the context of Bosnia. On Tuesday Boris Yeltsin reiterated that the "decision to carry out bombing raids was irresponsible, and full responsibility for the possible consequences will lie with those who made this decision." From Russia's standpoint, the outcome of the conflict should be settled solely by negotiations. This is what Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, who is currently in the former Yugoslavia, is trying to achieve. The Russian president stated that, if necessary, he is prepared to urgently send Foreign Minister Kozyrev there too. The third and final day of the visit was spent in Barcelona and was full of different official events. Yeltsin met with Spanish doctors, whom he again thanked for their brilliant operation in 1990 after his aircraft's unsuccessful landing in Barcelona. In general the problem of the Russian president's health was not sidestepped. The newspapers have been enthusiastically picking up on this topic. B. Yeltsin said literally the following on the subject: "I would like everyone my age to have the same health as I have. Can someone who always plays a really hard game of tennis for 90 minutes (and with partners who are masters and meritorious masters of sport), someone who swims in the Black Sea in March when the water temperature is four degrees, have poor health? Someone who works 16-18 hours a day with hardly any days off.... That's something to be envied. "The other day I told my doctors -- let's do an all-day checkup this year, with any journalist present who wants to be. In any laboratory...they can do blood tests...do anything they want, you understand, to see how strong I am, how.... And we can do this all day, so that not only Russia but the entire world will know what is inside me."
