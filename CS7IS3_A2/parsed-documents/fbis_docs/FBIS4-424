The shooting was concentrated in the southern Gikondo area, according to Captain Eric Millet of the French Third Parachute Regiment. The shooting, now coming from the north, had earlier come in the east of the city where the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) had a battalion of 600 men. "It is hard to tell if the forces shooting from the north are RPF reinforcements (advancing) from the position they held two days ago 15 kilometres (nine miles) away, or if the rebels in the east have repositioned themselves," Millet added. On Tuesday the French Embassy had completely closed down, adding to the sense of panic among Rwandans trying to escape the fighting. the troops, sent to help the now completed evacuation of French nationals, said they would leave as soon as control over the city's remaining foreign population had been handed over to Belgian forces. More than 1,000 people have been evacuated from Kigali by air to date, the French troops said. The remaining foreign nationals, waiting at the French school, were to be brought to the airport in a convoy. A group of about 50 Rwandans who had sought refuge in the French embassy were brought to the airport Tuesday morning in a convoy of trucks. Their breakfast plates were still lying on the tables of the deserted embassy, whose doors had been left open. "Everyone has left," confirmed the branch chief of Kigali's International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Philippe Gaillard, who had placed sand bags around the ICRC offices in preparation for the fighting to come.
