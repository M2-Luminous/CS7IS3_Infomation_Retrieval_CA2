FBIS3-50208 "dreeu017__a94019" FBIS-EEU-94-017-A Document Type:Daily Report 26 January 1994 ANNEX Hungary Government Condemns Extreme Right-Wing Party AU2001162694 Budapest MTI in English 1042 GMT 20 Jan 94 AU2001162694 Budapest MTI Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Budapest, 20 January (MTI) -- The activity of the World National Popular Rule Party, an extreme-right group under the banner of World War II Hungarian fascist leaders, is unacceptable and beyond contempt for the government, said spokeswoman Judit Juhasz in a statement carried by the daily NEPSZABADSAG on Thursday. Juhasz spoke to the daily after the party, registered in October 1993, held a meeting on Tuesday of about 50 people. At the meeting, the party claimed to succeed the Hungarian fascist arrow-cross party of the 1930's and 1940's, and denied the Holocaust ever took place. The new group reportedly wants to rehabilitate arrow-cross leader Ferenc Szalasi, who unleashed a reign of terror when his party came to power in 1944. He was executed in 1946 for crimes against humanity. Juhasz regretted that Registration Court party synopses often differ from actual intentions. "The real motives and aims of these parties become clear only at their meetings and in their public statements." The Tuesday meeting makes this group unacceptable for the government and it violates constitutional order, Juhasz said. Asked by NEPSZABADSAG, she said the government feels constitutionally obliged to act against all forms of discrimination. At the commemoration of the liberation of the Budapest ghetto on Tuesday, the cabinet was represented by three ministers, signalling the government's clear position, Juhasz said.
