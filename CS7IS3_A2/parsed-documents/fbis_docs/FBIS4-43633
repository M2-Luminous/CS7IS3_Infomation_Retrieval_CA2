Speaking at a news conference in Ankara, Turkes recalled that the U.S. Senate put the condition that the aid to be extended to Turkey cannot be used in domestic security. Noting that this decision was made as a result of the influence of the Greek, Serbian, and PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] lobbies in the United States, Turkes said that it is humiliating. [Begin Turkes recording] Our advise to our government is to categorically reject this aid. The government should announce that a conditional aid is unacceptable. [end recording] Turkes noted that the blind eye turned by the Clinton administration to this decision is construed by NAP as an indirect support for the PKK. He added that if the government's decision to reject the conditional aid is well presented to the Turkish workers in Europe, the amount of the aid rejected can be collected as donations from these workers. He concluded by saying that his party will support such a move.
