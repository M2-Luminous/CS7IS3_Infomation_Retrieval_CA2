Thank you President O'Donovan, Distinguished guests, Ladies and Gentlemen: I am pleased and honored to have this chance to speak at a university which is famous in Japan -- not for its excellent basketball, but for the many excellent leaders it has produced. My wife and I have special feelings toward Georgetown, because of its strong ties with Sophia University in Tokyo, from which we both graduated. I am especially happy to see in this audience many young people. In a very real sense, I am working for you, and for our young generation back home, to help see to it that you, and we, have a better future. In this difficult period of global transition, the future is very uncertain. America, like most nations -- including mine -- has its own serious problems. But America still remains, in many ways, a role model. Any country which seeks to build a society based on democracy, which seeks to create a better life for its people, has much to learn from the American experience. I believe this, because it is part of my own family's experience. My wife and I are pleased that our son and daughter had the chance to live in America several years ago. Thanks to their home stay in small U.S. town, they made new friends, and expanded their understanding of what it means to live in a society which values individuality and open competition. If one word can sum up this new era, it is "change." Dramatic changes are taking place in the political life of the former Soviet Union. Europe has become more integrated than over before. And in America, you have new leadership which has dedicated itself to change. I would not be speaking to you today had not millions of Japanese decided that they wanted basic changes in politics. Today, I want to share with you my views on the challenges of change. I also want to discuss the actions I think Japan should take to help create a more stable and prosperous world. As these are common goals, U.S.-Japan cooperation has special importance in this context. In Japan, we have begun the process of reforming political and administrative systems which have become entrenched. As you can see by recent headlines, this process is causing us, and me, some pain. A story in the Washington Post the other day described me as "poker- faced." I don't see myself that way, but thinking about recent events, perhaps I do look a bit grim these days. It reminds me that Bill Clinton and I have lots in common. We've both had our troubles since coming into office. We both had our bad days in the media. And we've both had a very tough time trying to get people to agree on policy reforms. But just as your President is moving ahead, so are we. The problem is the pace of change in Japan. It always seems too slow for other nations. We also have an image problem - Japan, Incorporated. In the case of reform, I wish it were true. But the reality, as you have seen in recent days, is that Japanese are always struggling among ourselves. And conflicts on reforms have slowed progress. But I assure you, we are not only moving ahead, we are committed to seeing through our objectives. My goal is to make policy discussion and debate the heart of our political life. This reform also is the start of creating a more open political process. Public opinion polls show that the vast majority of Japanese strongly support my objectives. This process is important for another reason. I want to regain our people's trust and interest in politics. The reforms are only a first step in this direction. But this is still the most significant political reform movement in Japan in half a century. Another key objective of our inner-driven reform is market deregulation. When I was Governor of Kumamoto prefecture, I could see clearly how central government regulations were causing wasted time and effort. That is how we are seen in many other nations. We should reform our system, and this image of Japan. That is why, as prime minister, I am determined to do away with regulations which increase the cost of business, and cost to the consumers. For example, I would like to see actions including deregulations which would allow Japanese to purchase homes at about two-thirds the present average cost. Deregulation will help us achieve several objectives. First, it will create a more transparent market, with improved access for foreign firms. Second, it will lower business costs, which will promote imports, and lowering the price of many products. Third, it will create a more open and efficient administrative system. I intend to become personally involved in this effort, by heading a group to promote administrative reform and market deregulation. I want to emphasize that we are moving ahead with these reforms because they are in our own interest, and also because they are in harmony with Japan's international responsibilities. That is why, in the Uruguay Round talks, we made the painful decision on rice imports. This decision was made to help assure a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. This agreement is essential if we are to achieve our goals -- sustained, long-term economic growth, further liberalized trade, and greater world prosperity. A few days ago, we also announced a strong economic stimulation package. It includes a major income tax cut. I am confident that this action will create stronger consumer demand. This also is good news for foreign companies, who will take part in a new, open and competitive bidding system for public projects. It should also be good news for the rest of the world, because this package is an important step toward our common goal of expanding world prosperity. If the United States and Japan both firmly support their own economic growth policies, closely coordinating their actions, I also am certain that the problem of external imbalances will be eased. These changes inside Japan have another meaning. They symbolize changes in the way Japanese are thinking and acting in their relations with other countries. The time has come for Japan to play a much more dynamic role in helping to create the stable, peaceful world which we all desire. There are a number of areas in which I think Japan should become more involved. These include helping prevent and settle regional conflicts, helping nations build stable societies and helping efforts to cope with global problems such as environment and population. In settling regional conflicts, I believe that a comprehensive approach is an effective way to replace violence with stability. This comprehensive approach should include: diplomatic efforts to end conflicts, U.N. peacekeeping operations, humanitarian assistance and development assistance for rebuilding nations which have been torn apart by violence. The successful process which ended the Cambodian conflict was a good example of this approach. Japan was an active player at each stage of the process. Japan is no longer an international bystander. We are committing both materials, and people, to support efforts to stabilize trouble spots around the world. Today, for example, Japan is helping U.N. peacekeeping operations in Mozambique. In March, we plan to send a team of observers to help monitor elections in El Salvador. In the Middle East and other trouble spots, Japan is ready to play an active role to assist international efforts for peace. We also will increase humanitarian aid and other support for areas affected by conflict in the former Yugoslavia. All these efforts are essential, but there is another, even greater challenge. The end of the Cold War has created new opportunities for arms control and disarmament. One of Japan's major goals is to strengthen the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] system for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. That is why one of the first international policy decisions I made after becoming prime minister asserted Japan's strong support for the indefinite extension of the NPT beyond 1995. There have been reports in the last few days that Japan might change its policy should North Korea arm itself with nuclear weapons. I wish the people who write such reports would come to Japan and talk to our people. Then they would realize how deeply we feel about this issue. Let me be very clear on this point: I see no possibility that Japan would decide to become a nuclear power. Such a policy would be against Japan's national interest. We, like you, are very concerned about the current situation on the Korean peninsula. And we are determined, working closely with government leaders in the Republic of Korea and America, to help settle this issue. On the issue of conventional arms control, Japan also is actively involved. We are the only major nation in the world which is not selling any weapons to other countries. We have proposed a U.N.- supervised system to make it easier to monitor international sales of conventional arms. We want to broaden this system, to make it more effective. Economic assistance is another important action to assure long-term global stability and prosperity. In recent years, Japan has become the world's largest donor of ODA. Japan is actively using economic aid to promote what might be called "good governance." We are encouraging recipient nations which are making efforts to move toward more democratic government, introduce market economies, control military spending, and promote policies to control or dispose of weapons of mass destruction. Japan's ODA decisions are being strongly influenced by countries which follow such policies. As we seek long-term peace and prosperity, we must also focus on other problems which threaten the well-being of people around the world. Coordinated action is essential on four key issues: protecting the environment, dealing with population problems, stopping the spread of AIDS, ending drugs as a social threat. Two years ago, Japan pledged more than 7 billion dollars in ODA funds to support environmental protection programs around the world. Since then, Japanese aid to helping to restore forest lands in Mexico and Indonesia, supporting the treatment of solid waste in Brazil, and supporting research to deal with acid rain in China. Environmental protection is also one of the key global issues in the framework talks. I want to see ever closer cooperation between our nations in this vital area. Today, I informed President Clinton that Japan will pledge 3 billion dollars over the next seven years to support programs on population and AIDS. The president told me that the U.S. government will provide 9 billion dollars to deal with these problems during the same period. We also want to strengthen international cooperation to fight the threat of drugs, and to find a cure for cancer. My friends, As we approach the twenty first century, I see many opportunities for U.S.-Japan cooperation in the most dynamic region in the world, the Asia-Pacific. In the recent APEC leaders' meeting in Seattle, President Clinton spoke with conviction about the importance of the Asia-Pacific in America's future. He made some of same points in a speech during his visit to Tokyo last year. I welcome these messages. We need and want an active U.S. presence in Asia, in the context of both economic and security issues. We strongly support the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and have backed up that commitment by providing major financial support for U.S. forces in our country. In fiscal 1993, the total was 4.6 billion dollars. Our ratio of financial support for all U.S. base expenses, except salaries, will increase to about 70% by fiscal 1995. In the new Asia-Pacific era, U.S.-Japan security arrangements remain an essential stabilizing force, in both the political and military sense. Coordinated action by our two countries in Asia-Pacific is essential if we are to avoid the dangers of isolationism and protectionism. We both should encourage China, for example, to play a positive role in regional stability. In this sense, I support President Clinton's policies to expand contacts with China. Dialogue and policy coordination will be essential in deepening mutual trust among nations in this region. In the business world, contacts already are becoming much closer. And there is a new trend. American and Japanese companies, for example, are cooperating in projects to improve Indonesia's power generation system. And American and Japanese companies are providing technical aid to help develop China's auto industry. This kind of synergy shows how APEC members can use their special talents to produce results which are, to use the American expression, "win- win." Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. The Asia-Pacific, once a battlefield, is now one of the most promising regions in the world. The bitter memories of conflict and destruction half a century ago are a constant reminder of the challenges we now face. We must succeed in building a new era, based on mutual respect, with the goal of creating a peaceful and prosperous future. My friends, For half a century, there have been generally strong, positive relations between our nations. I believe that our best years lie ahead. Ongoing changes in both countries will help to strengthen U.S.- Japan relations. We still have serious economic and trade problems to solve. We can do it, but only if we work together in a spirit of partnership and mutual trust. we also must guard against distorting those problems. We must work to keep our relationship balanced, remembering the importance of our close cooperation in political, security and global policy matters. We also need to remind each other about the rich, human dimension of U.S.-Japan relations. It is not governments, or companies, but people, after all, which give a relationship its greatest value. Many thousands of Americans and Japanese have formed deep and lasting friendships. These are not famous people, but the kind of people who are the heart and soul of our societies. They include students and scholars, business executives and engineers, artists, musicians, athletes, and yes, even a few journalists. They live in Washington, and Tokyo...in Denver, and Nagoya,...in Miami, and Osaka. They share the same values and interests. They and their families also are trying to cope with similar problems. But they all have hopes and dreams for a better future life. These strong but too often ignored human ties between our countries are the best reason for all of us to dedicate ourselves to making a good relationship even better. That is my goal, and my promise to you.
