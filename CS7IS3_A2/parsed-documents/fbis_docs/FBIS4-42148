"It's work in progress, it's a dialogue (with Russia) which becomes serious and intense and on NATO's side, we'll make our position known hopefully pretty soon," Balanzino said. [passage omitted] Balanzino said: "We've taken good note of the Russians' intention to sign PFP as it is without any change or modification." However, he was cautious on whether or not the signing would take place during a NATO foreign affairs ministers' meeting in Istanbul on June 8. "These are things that need time and reflection. We will certainly be active and not wait too long before coming to a conclusion and define our position," Balanzino said. "But I don't know if we will be able to reach a signature (in Istanbul). To dialogue with Russia is not a walk in the park. We've to be serious and take time," he said.
