He does not know whether the commander will be subordinated to the Ministry of National Defense [MON] or directly to the president. Yesterday, the government adopted a draft of changes in the Army prepared by MON. The document entitled "Defense Problems and Military Aspects of the Polish Republic's Security Policies" was debated by the government during a secret meeting with the participation of President Lech Walesa and General Tadeusz Wilecki, chief of the General Staff. After it is approved by the president and the Council of Ministers, the draft will be submitted to the Sejm before the end of May. What Kind of Commander? The draft says that the civilian defense minister will cease being the Army's direct commander. A post of chief commander will be established who will be responsible for training and mobilization. He is supposed to be in charge of land forces, air forces, the Navy, and the General Staff. It is not known whether the chief commander will be subordinated directly to the president or to the defense minister. Minister Kolodziejczyk did not hide the fact that the problem is of constitutional importance. "We leave the resolution of this issue up to the politicians," he said. According to Kolodziejczyk, the Sejm will find it easier to approve the version under which the chief commander would be subordinated to the minister. If the commander were to be subordinated to the president, one would have to include that function in the Constitution and make the commander responsible for the Army's combat readiness. "The coalition will not agree to tinkering with the Small Constitution while a `big constitution' is still not in place," the MON chief explained to journalists. Up to now, it has seemed that the Belweder has striven to have direct supervision over the Army and that the minister supports these plans. But Minister Kolodziejczyk said yesterday that the president's position on this issue is "very pragmatic." "He is eager to establish the kind of system of commanding the Army that would contain a safeguard protecting against destabilization and sudden political changes," Kolodziejczyk added. As an example, he cited the year 1992, when a conflict occurred between the president and Minister Jan Parys. "So the point is for the president to have supervision over the chief commander?" asked confused journalists. "My understanding was the opposite of that," Kolodziejczyk replied. What Kind of Guard? The Belweder-promoted idea of establishing a National Security Council as the chief organ of state security has been postponed indefinitely. The argument was that, as Kolodziejczyk explained it, one would have to "tinker with the Constitution." Instead, the MON draft envisages the establishment of a National Guard, of which the basis would be formed by several thousand troops of the Internal Affairs Ministry's Nadwislanskie Units. But the guard would be subordinated not to the president, as the Belvedere wanted, but to civilian defense (that is, to MON) and would provide assistance during natural disasters, among others. What Kind of Army? The document contains a list of legal acts concerning the Army, which the Sejm should adopt in the immediate future, as well as a report on the Army's technical condition. According to the minister, the Army's technical condition is "dangerous," and Poland may lose its credibility. "Shortly, nobody will simply appreciate us as a partner," the minister warned.
