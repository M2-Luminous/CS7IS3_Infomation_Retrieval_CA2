He was reacting to a Friday [29 April] statement by Slovak Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus that the two prime ministers should consider the abolition of the old bloc on the Slovak-Czech clearing account before it was discussed by the Slovak Government. Lintner said that Moravcik was surprised by Filkus's statement, but added that "the times are hectic and a need for a meeting between the two premiers may arise as early as tomorrow." Bratislava considers the abolition of the old bloc, which is used by enterprises in speculative payments to the detriment of Slovakia's balance of payments, the most urgent issue in relations with Prague. Under the old bloc, the 1-1 ratio is applied in payments related to trade agreements concluded before the currency split on February 8, 1993. The new bloc uses ECUs. The Czech Government approved a proposal to abolish the old bloc as early as in mid-April, but the Slovak Government recently returned a similar draft for rewriting and it has not reappeared on the government's agenda to date.
