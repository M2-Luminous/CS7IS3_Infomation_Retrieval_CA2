Why did he do it so soon? It could be just an accident. The journalists asked, so he replied. The president is an impulsive man; he likes fast responses.... But he is also capable of waiting. He has proved that many times, like in the 1980's, for instance. So one could assume that his statement to PAP was made deliberately. Candidates' Worries Walesa has to start off his campaign very early. An enormous amount of work is ahead of him. A year and a half before the elections, he has neither political backing nor popularity. Without appropriate structures, he will not be able to collect money or organize rallies or put up posters.... He will not win without the electorate's support. He needs time to bounce off the bottom. Aleksander Kwasniewski, who is leading in presidential popularity polls, has a completely different worry on his mind: His problem is to maintain the popularity and not to allow the voters to get bored with him. That is why he is dragging his feet, and he does not want to begin the campaign yet. Stocktaking of Supporters By announcing his decision, Walesa is trying to force Kwasniewski and other competitors to disclose their intentions...and to make mistakes. After all, the candidates will be under the particularly watchful eye of the mass media and the voters. Currently, it is the president's blunders that get the biggest publicity. Walesa also most probably wants to conduct a "stocktaking" of his supporters. He wants to check whether he can count on the support of someone else apart from the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms. True, it is known widely that he has supporters in different parties (for instance, the Christian-National Union, the Peasant Accord, and Solidarity), but it is also known that these supporters are few and far between. Perhaps by submitting his candidacy the president wants to force them to be more active. He is probably thinking: "Even if they fail to win their parties for me, they could at least prevent them from coming up with countercandidates." He Abuses People and Then He Dumps Them Do such tactics have a chance of being successful? For the moment, rather not. Unfriendly feelings toward Walesa within the post-Solidarity camp are just too high. He is regarded as a high-risk investment, as a politician who "abuses people and then dumps them." A right-wing leader recently compared the president to a coachman who, while fleeing to escape wolves, is giving more and more of his passengers to the prey of the wolves, one by one. Is it any wonder that nobody wants to ride Walesa's coach? The style of his presidency--that is, the policy of constant "wars at the top"--also arouses enormous reservations. If Walesa wants to dream of a big political camp, he must change his style. And perhaps he also must change the composition of his chancellery. But will he agree to sacrifice [presidential aide] Mieczyslaw Wachowski in return for his reelection? And will that be enough? Directly to Voters If the parties turn their backs on Walesa, he will address the electorate directly. He will tour Poland, he will organize rallies. He feels best as a people's tribune. Nobody talks to crowds better than he. He will definitely not give up on television, either. He will be launching attacks on the National Radio and Television Council and [Television Chairman] Wieslaw Walendziak. He will try to replace them or to force them to be obedient. The campaign of a lonely Walesa will be more populist. It will definitely be anticommunist. But will it also be antimarket? So far, two slogans have been hanging above the president's bed: First of all Walesa, and second of all--capitalism.
