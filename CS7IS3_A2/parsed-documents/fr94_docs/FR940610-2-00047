FR940610-2-00047 FR940610-2-00039 FARM CREDIT ADMINISTRATION Statement of Policy on System Institution Activities Involving the Potential for Nonexclusive Territories; Extension of Comment Period AGENCY: Farm Credit Administration. ACTION: Proposed statement of policy; comment period extension. SUMMARY: The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) Board published for comment a proposed ``Statement of Policy on System Institution Activities Involving the Potential for Nonexclusive Territories'' in the Federal Register on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17543). The comment period is scheduled to expire on June 13, 1994. The FCA Board hereby gives notice that the original comment period is extended to July 13, 1994. DATES: The period for receipt of written comments is hereby extended to July 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed or delivered (in triplicate) to Kenneth D. Smith, Executive Assistant to FCA Board Member Gary C. Byrne, Farm Credit Administration, 1501 Farm Credit Drive, McLean, Virginia 22102&hyph;5090. Copies of all comments received will be available for examination by interested parties in the offices of the Farm Credit Administration, 1501 Farm Credit Drive, McLean, Virginia. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kenneth D. Smith, Executive Assistant to FCA Board Member Gary C. Byrne, Farm Credit Administration, 1501 Farm Credit Drive, McLean, Virginia 22102&hyph;5090, (703) 883&hyph;4000, TDD (703) 883&hyph;4444. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The 1971 Act authorizes the FCA to issue and amend the charters of System institutions and regulate the exercise of their powers. Included in this authority is the ability for the FCA to issue or amend charters or promulgate regulations that would result in increased competition among System institutions. The issue of competition among System institutions arises, typically, in two types of situations. First, charters could be issued authorizing two or more System institutions to extend the same types of credit services to the same types of customers in the same geographic territories; such charters have typically been issued as a result of mergers or other chartering actions requested by institutions. Second, institutions could be authorized by regulation to engage in certain activities outside of their chartered territories. The FCA Board has determined that an extended comment period would be beneficial in order to ensure that all interested parties have an opportunity to comment on the proposed statement of policy on System institution activities involving the potential for nonexclusive territories. Dated: June 7, 1994. Curtis M. Anderson, Secretary, Farm Credit Administration Board. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14202 Filed 6&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6705&hyph;01&hyph;P
