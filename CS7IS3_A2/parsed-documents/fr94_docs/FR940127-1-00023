FR940127-1-00023 FR940127-1-00008 8. Contingency Measures As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIPs that demonstrate attainment must include contingency measures. See generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 13543&hyph;13544. These measures must be submitted by November 15, 1993 for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should consist of other available measures that are not part of the area's control strategy. These measures must take effect without further action by the State or EPA, upon EPA's determination that the area has failed to make RFP or attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. The Columbia Falls nonattainment area SIP contains an outline of steps to be taken if attainment of the PM&hyph;10 standard is not achieved; however, these steps do not adequately satisfy the contingency measures requirement. Since the SIP does not provide for these measures to take effect without further action should EPA determine that Columbia Falls has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM&hyph;10 standard by December 31, 1994, EPA is taking no action at this time on the Columbia Falls contingency measures. The State has until November 15, 1993 to submit its contingency measures. III. Implications of This Action EPA is proposing to approve the PM&hyph;10 SIP submitted to EPA on November 25, 1991 (with the exception of the Kalispell specific rules, 501&hyph;506) and on May 6, 1992 for the Columbia Falls, Montana nonattainment area. Among other things, the State of Montana has demonstrated that the Columbia Falls moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area will attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. EPA is also proposing to approve the Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program as it applies to Columbia Falls, which was submitted to EPA on November 25, 1991. The portion of the plan concerning the Kalispell PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area will be acted upon in a separate action. As noted, additional submittals for the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are due at later dates. The EPA will determine the adequacy of any such submittal as appropriate. IV. Request for Public Comments The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of today's proposal. As indicated at the outset of this document, EPA will consider any comments received by February 28, 1994. V. Executive Order (EO) 12866 This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The U.S. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on U.S. EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. VI. Regulatory Flexibility Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
