Shortly before making his address, Solana said that the final decision on air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions is up to the military command of the UN peacekeeping force on the ground in accordance with the legal framework of the United Nations and NATO. Martin Garcia Vega reports from the Congress of Deputies: [Garcia Vega] Javier Solana said definitive conclusions cannot be drawn from the statements made by the warring sides at such a delicate time. He was speaking to journalists in the lobby. The Spanish foreign minister prefers to look at the positive aspects of some actions. [Begin Solana recording] For the first time in a long while we have a several day ceasefire holding in Sarajevo. This means that Sarajevo, at the moment, is a city which is no longer shelled. Therefore, there are no victims in Sarajevo. Something like this has not happened in months. If only this has been achieved, then perhaps all the efforts we have engaged, on the diplomatic front over the past few weeks, have been worth it. [end recording] [Garcia Vega] Solana and Garcia Vargas are now addressing the Congress outlining the situation in the area.
