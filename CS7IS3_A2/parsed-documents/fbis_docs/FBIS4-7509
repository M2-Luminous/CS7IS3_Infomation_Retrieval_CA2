There were units of the MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs], a bit of territorial defense [TO], and armed groups of Muslim youths with differing views of the political and military objectives of the fight, and most of the talk was about the Patriotic League. That is why the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] played the decisive role in defending a large portion of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina at that time. The Muslim units became stronger, underwent transformation, and ultimately the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed by unifying all the available potential. Today that army even has trained military cadres, mainly former officers of the former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], some of whom took part in the war in 1991 against the Republic of Croatia, but left the JNA after the war began in Bosnia and Herzegovina. No one has as yet given a complete answer to the question of how and where the Muslim leadership has been getting arms and equipment for its army. Official sources speak about "materiel" found in the MUP, booty captured from the enemy is mentioned as an additional source along with its own production in plants of the "special-purpose industry," which are located on territory under control of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and occasional purchases are mentioned incidentally. Although no one wants to say anything about the ways in which those occasional purchases are advanced into Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is evident that military equipment is being acquired on the world black market and delivered to Bosnia and Herzegovina in spite of the embargo on the importing of arms. Eyewitnesses, including, for example, a journalist of the German television station ZDF, say that they have seen in Sarajevo ammunition made in Iran; at one time there was quite a bit of noise over the origin of a missile which destroyed an armored vehicle of the HVO in Gornji Vakuf; and even the fact that arms and ammunition are being produced in Bosnia and Herzegovina indicates that there are certain supply channels, because the territory under control of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have everything necessary for independent production. The Fight for Influence Although arms and equipment of Western origin in the possession of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be logically explained only by delivery in humanitarian convoys and aircraft for delivery of aid to the surrounded Muslim enclaves, it is not possible to provide a solid confirmation even of that explanation. However, throughout the entire story of delivery of arms to Bosnia and Herzegovina this is not the only unknown, nor probably is it even the most interesting one: It is not more interesting than the one about who "is covering" the costs of the purchase and shipment. One can get a suggestion of the answer from the fact that the Islamic countries, even in an assessment of Alija Izetbegovic, are not setting aside sufficient funds to care for casualties in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is, it is hard to believe that the oil-rich Islamic countries, especially those in which Islamic (fundamentalist) regimes are in power, are forgetting Muslims in any part of the globe, especially if they are in a situation which could deteriorate into their complete destruction, but at the same time could also result in the creation of another country with an Islamic regime. Reliable reports indicate that one should go beyond logical judgment. According to those reports, the Islamic countries, above all Iran and Saudi Arabia, are investing large sums to equip the Muslim army in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The visit of every political, military, and humanitarian official from the Islamic countries presupposes an abundant cash donation, and all that money is flowing into accounts which are mostly under the control of Haris Silajdzic, prime minister, and Bakir Alispahic, minister of internal affairs. There is indeed even a certain rivalry taking place between Saudi Arabia and Iran, because each of these two states wants to achieve maximum influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and today this is possible exclusively by offering all possible support to the Muslim army. Boats for Fast Missions The most recent form of rivalry evident between the two countries when it comes to expanding influence on the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina are the orders of ships for the future Muslim navy and the training of Muslim naval officers. That branch of the surrounded force, in the opinion of the command of the Muslim army, is essential to the survival of the Muslim people. "Unless we have a sea and a navy, Yugoslavia and Croatia will smother us, because those two states have a navy which should be taken into account," says one of the high Muslim officers. Iran has ordered 17 vessels for a future Muslim navy in Scandinavian shipyards. Six rubber boats, each of which carries 25 men fully armed, have been ordered; they are part of the combat equipment intended for the coast guard. These personnel are not part of the boat's crew, but that is the number of marines the vessel carries to the intervention point. There are also orders for six assault landing boats that will be built of light metal. These boats are today being built either of light metal or plastic reinforced with fiberglass, and they are designed for anticommando activities and rapid missions on the open sea. The future Muslim navy is also to get four coastal rescue boats used in navies to provide assistance in towing larger vessels, in transport, and in aiding landing vessels in their withdrawal after performance of their mission. The 17th vessel is a salvage vessel, a vessel intended above all for carrying arms and ammunition, but it is also equipped to rescue damaged vessels and to raise vessels which have sunk. Where To Find Sailors Since naval officers in the former Yugoslav navy were largely from the Croatian coast, in spite of the carefully conducted personnel policy, the numerous defections of trained personnel from the JNA to the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina have not provided the Muslim army with a particularly large number of men trained for active service in the navy. So that the vessels ordered, some of which have already done their shakedown cruise, would not be without crews, the Islamic Republic of Iran has decided to accept about 200 Muslims for training as future naval officers. That entire program was annoying to Saudi Arabia, and so that country, in an effort to reduce or completely eliminate Iranian (Shiite) influence on the Bosnian Muslims, ordered four vessels which informed sources say are the most up-to-date in the world. The number of future naval officers and also the number of naval vessels ordered are only the beginning of activities to organize a Muslim navy, although we can still not say in what port it would tie up. At a time when he was still powerful, Sefer Halilovic publicly announced his intention to enter Ploce with Muslim units and plant his flag there. Muslim politicians one after the other, in much more refined style, of course, began long ago to talk about the necessity of access to the sea for the Muslim national territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatian and Muslim negotiators have spent many hours on this problem in negotiations for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but a Muslim navy probably never even occurred to an objective observer. In certain Muslim circles who consider the present state of affairs to be a national rebirth for the Bosnian Muslims and who believe that this is the right moment for a permanent solution of the problem of a state for the Bosnian Muslims, there is constant mention of the idea of a Muslim sea from the Neretva to Bar, which means that there would be an abundance of suitable locations for a naval port. A Navy Without a Port Semso Tankovic said on a recent television program: "The Bosnian Muslims will have a navy, that is quite certain." Even he did not say in what port it would tie up. The existence of "naval" plans is not denied even by Alija Izetbegovic, but he, taking advantage of the results of the most recent Croat-Muslim negotiations, talks about a joint federal navy. Because an agreement about the armed forces of the future federation and confederation still has not been spelled out precisely, one can only guess about the federal navy. The question, that is, is whether there will be such a navy at all. Corps General Anton Tus said in a recent interview: "From the operational standpoint, preparation of the armed forces and the conduct of defensive warfare will require coordination of certain wartime units of the two states and a joint command in the use of those forces. I am referring to ground forces, air force and air defense, while defense on the sea is in the jurisdiction of Croatia." The beginning of the Muslim navy was ordered when there was not even any mention of a U.S. peace initiative, so it is possible that even the top Muslim political leadership itself does not know what it will do with it if the negotiations about federation and confederation are taken all the way to a successful conclusion. But the question of the port where they plan to tie up their navy still remains open. If it is Neum or even Ploce, then there is no point in building the navy, not because ecological balance would be destroyed by building a port at Neum, but because that port would not have an outlet to the open sea. A Muslim navy stationed in it would be imprisoned in an area of less than 100 square kilometers.
