Ciller in the message conveyed her impressions to the leaders she viewed during her visit to Bosnia on Feb 2 saying "the developments in Bosnia up to now showed that the aggressor was allowed to gain territory by force." The message went on saying "the aggressive powers continue their actions to devastate the multi-cultural structure of Bosnia and a mortar attack of Serbians which killed 68 people and wounded 200 others targeted the Bosnian civilians. She added that the attack was a challenge to all civilization values and initiatives for a peaceful solution. Ciller described the recent letter of the UN General Secretary Butrus Butrus-Ghali sent to NATO which called for an air operation and protection of Sarajevo against Serbian attacks as "late but favorable." Ciller said such an air operation will protect Sarajevo from Serbian attacks and will give an open message to the aggressors. She said if NATO fails to take necessary measures after this letter, it will lose its credibility.
