Li Zemin said: This year is critical for pushing forward reform in a comprehensive way and accelerating economic development. The overall requirement for the work is that we should continue to carry out the guiding spirit of the 14th CPC Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the ninth provincial CPC congress by further emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, accelerating economic development; pushing forward economic restructuring, technological progress, and enterprise management; and enhancing economic quality and efficiency through reform, reorganization, and transformation so as to maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy and to promote social and political stability. Li Zemin said: It is an essential task to maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. But we must adopt new approaches to develop our economy because great changes have occurred in the economic environment this year. It is absolutely not practical for us to continue the same old ways of rashly launching new projects and engaging in extensive enlargement and extensive management. We should have a real change in our guiding ideology of economic development. A new economic structure has created good conditions for enterprises to compete on equal terms and to seek self-development. It is necessary to seize favorable opportunities by deepening reform and taking greater advantage of the market mechanism, as well as of economic, legal, and policy means to gradually lead the economy onto the right track of optimizing the economic structure, enhancing economic quality and performance, and becoming more export-oriented. In terms of concrete guidance for the work, we should, first of all, work harder on agricultural production. We should conscientiously put it on the priority agenda. Party committees and governments at all levels should strengthen their leadership and correct their laissez-faire tendency so as to stabilize grain production. The orientation of the reform adopted by the central authorities last year should be maintained. It is necessary to conscientiously carry it out in accordance with various policies and measures adopted last year by the provincial meeting on rural work. Meanwhile, further efforts should be made to adjust and improve the reform in light of current new conditions and problems. All in all, we should not only maintain stable grain production but also continuously increase peasants' income. Efforts should also be made to ensure the supply of vegetables, pork, and other nonstaple products in large and medium cities. We should adopt measures to gradually establish means of macroeconomic regulation and control over the production, circulation, and storage of grain, edible oil, meat, and vegetables to stabilize the market with a sufficient supply. Second, great efforts should be made to restructure the economy and enhance economic efficiency. It is imperative to seize vital opportunities to achieve new progress. We should also meet the requirement of the market, focus on improving economic quality and efficiency, and accelerate the pace of readjustment. While striving to improve large and medium enterprises, we should attach great importance to medium and small enterprises, which are large in number and which affect many economic sectors. Particular attention should be paid to reorganizing and transforming enterprises which are small in size, have insufficient funds, have large losses, and are unable to function properly. More efforts should be made to improve products, to enhance technical progress, to expand markets, and to merge enterprises. We can achieve better economic results through strengthening the reform, management, reorganization, and transformation of enterprises. Third, it is necessary to accelerate the growth of the export-oriented economy. It is our unswerving principle to develop an export-oriented economy. We must take steps and make greater efforts to publicize our drive and in communicating with the people. In this way, we can foster a favorable image and maintain the positive momentum of increasing foreign funds, foreign trade, and economic ties with foreign countries. Fourth, we must continue to accelerate the construction of basic facilities, further free our way of thinking, and continue to thoroughly carry out the reform so as to gradually relieve bottlenecks. Li Zemin said: In carrying out reform, we should adhere to the principle of integrating measures for achieving major breakthroughs with supplementary measures. In light of requirements for establishing a modern enterprise system, we should make a breakthrough in reforming property rights, accelerate the change of enterprises' operating mechanisms, and deepen their overall reform. While focusing on experiments with the modern corporate system, we should make more efforts to reform medium and small enterprises, which are large in number and which affect many economic sectors. Active efforts should be made to explore rational forms and ways to merge and manage medium and small enterprises. For small enterprises, we should work harder to improve their structure by having them contracted out or leased. We should transform and merge them. In some cases, we should auction them off or let them go bankrupt. We should clearly define their property rights and carry out an inventory and examination of their stockpiles and capital. Collective enterprises in urban and rural areas should actively and properly practice, to a greater extent, the shareholding corporate system. To keep in step with this effort, we should also push forward the development of the factors-of-production market and the reform of organizations making up the social security system. Li Zemin said: The greater difficulty we encounter in reform and economic development requires that we exert greater efforts to "grasp two links" because this is a task which has a great bearing on the overall state of social stability. At present, we should attach great importance to ideological and political work and launch an extensive propaganda and educational drive. Meanwhile, we should integrate ideological and political work with efforts to solve the people's concrete problems. We should conscientiously carry out the work of stabilizing commodity prices, improving the "vegetable basket" project, subsidizing the living expenses of workers and staff members, and helping people solve their problems. It is imperative to analyze and handle various contradictions among the people. We should give priority to ideological and political work as well as to other related work, and we should carry these out thoroughly. In terms of the anticorruption struggle and the construction of spiritual civilization, we should carry these out in accordance with the plan adopted by the provincial party committee. We must see to it that the expected results for the current stage are achieved. Li Zemin said: It is necessary to stress the importance of investigation and study. Leading comrades at all levels should have a clear understanding of the trend of economic and social development. Their current important task is get rid of such activities as wining and dining. They should go to grass-roots units and the production front line to learn the real situation so as to gain the initiative in leading the work.
