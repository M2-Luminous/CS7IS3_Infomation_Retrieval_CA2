He said the pilot had been hospitalized, but did not say where nor give his condition. The F-16 fighter plane was on a routine training flight when it went down near the small town of Portoroz near the Adriatic coast as the pilot tried to make an emergency landing for reasons that were not immedialy known. In Ljubljana, the Slovenian news agency STA said the fighter's pilot had contacted Portoroz' small civilian airport shortly before the crash asking permission to land because of a technical failure on board his aircraft. When given the go-ahead, he tried to bring his plane down on the tiny landing strip but was unable to keep it on the runway. STA said the plane crashed into the Adriatic after the pilot ejected. It also said the fighter had weapons on board but the pilot ejected them into the sea before attempting to land. The U.S. spokesman here said the plane had been training for NATO's operation Deny Flight, which enforces the no-fly zone over Bosnia. Planes at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization base in Aviano have been patrolling Bosnian skies for months and are among those that would be used should NATO go ahead with its threat to launch air strikes on Bosnian Serb forces besieging Sarajevo.
