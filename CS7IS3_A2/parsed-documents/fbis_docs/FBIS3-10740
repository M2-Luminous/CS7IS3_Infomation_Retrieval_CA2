[Davietjarov] I would like to say first that Paraguay is for us a new country. Our company is working in nearly every country in the world, except Paraguay. Second, we always thought Paraguay was a dictatorship like Russia was. We now know you are on the road to democracy and as we understand it, your government seeks to give the Paraguayan people a better, a more dignified life. This is what we want for our own people: a dignified life for all. You must know that Russia is one of the largest oil exporters in the world, but because some of our oil has run out, we have people looking for oil in different places. This is why we thought there may be oil in Paraguay. [Loma] You know the Americans are already here looking for oil. [Davietjarov] We know the Americans are looking for oil in Paraguay. We want to know what is happening here. We want to know exactly what the possibilities are here. This is our first contact. We also want to know about the relations you have with other oil companies. After that we will know what to do. This is only the start. We can be a good competitors for the Americans. We have good experts. Not everything that is American is necessarily better, especially regarding the first stages of prospecting for oil. We are the best at that. [Loma] What is the role of Rosnef in the Russian economy? [Davietjarov] Rosnef controls 70 percent of the Russian oil market, 65 percent of byproducts, and 65 percent of the sale of oil fields in the country. From the Russian map, you can see we control over 70 percent of the oil territory. It is a company that has more than 1 million workers [as published]. It controls over 55 percent of the oil business in Russia. I am the vice president of the consortium that used to belong to the state, which is now in the process of privatization. This process will conclude late this year. [Loma] Could you tell us in what Latin American countries your company has commercial interests? [Davietjarov] We have been in Cuba for a long time, supplying oil. In Venezuela we buy and sell oil. We also worked with various U.S. companies with interests in Latin America. We buy machinery and oil extracting equipment. [Loma] You do not operate in many Latin American countries. [Davietjarov] We work mostly with the Americans in this continent, especially with West-coast companies which deliver oil and byproducts to the East coast of Russia because it is too far to bring it through the European part of Russia. [Loma] What is your opinion of the international oil market following the imbalances created by the Persian Gulf War, and the fall of the Communist system in your country and in Eastern Europe? [Davietjarov] The market collapsed but our exports did not decrease. They remained at the same level. The international oil price dropped but this did not influence the Russian market. [Loma] What role do you believe Paraguay could play in the international oil market? [Davietjarov] Paraguay buys oil from Algeria. You must produce oil in your country if you are to influence the market. We believe that because Paraguay is located in the heart of South America it could become a good platform for exchanging Brazilian oil, for example, with Chile and other countries after the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] becomes operational. A big oil refinery could be built here to produce oil byproducts for neighboring countries. We met yesterday with Integration Vice Minister Fadlala and saw many positive points in the program he showed us. Paraguay can play a major role in the Mercosur even if no oil is found here. [Loma] Will you look for oil here? [Davietjarov] No, but we are ready. [Loma] Ready, for what? [Davietjarov] To meet with the minister and discuss the problems and possibilities. We will then make our offer. [Loma] This delegation seems to be the most important to have arrived in the history of bilateral relations. Does this represent greater rapprochement between the two governments? [Davietjarov] Our government program consists of maintaining good relations with all countries as well as integrating into the world and working in any country. We are not here only to carry out propaganda in our favor but also to learn. We have to learn the good things existing abroad. It would be a great pleasure for us to learn many things in Paraguay. [Loma] During your first news conference, as soon as you arrived, you noted that you did not know much about Paraguay, but you would be interested in obtaining more information with the goal of establishing commercial channels. Have you learned anything significant yet? [Davietjarov] This is the first time that we are meeting and become acquainted with the people here -- not only at the ministries, but also on the streets where we have talked with various pedestrians. We are becoming acquainted with the city and everything is going step by step. If you only meet ministers, you do not get much information. It is necessary to become acquainted with the people, and we are doing just that. [Loma] Can you tell me if you have signed any political or economic agreement? [Davietjarov] We have been here for a very short time. We have held and we will hold many meetings. We have presented our offers. I can only tell you again that we are ready. We hope our offers will be interesting for Paraguayan entrepreneurs and businessmen. We are ready to sign agreements. We have more than 1 million people working in our consortium. We are sure some Paraguayan products will be of interest in Russia or at least for your consortium. [Loma] According to assessments by various international observers, the political situation in Paraguay is not entirely stable at this moment. What would your enterprise do if the democratic process were discontinued here? [Davietjarov] We are interested in good relations, especially economic ones, which should take place within an atmosphere of political stability. Nevertheless, I am sure that we, like any foreign company established here, can work well under any political system. Business is business. [Loma] What was your perception of Paraguay while you were in Russia? What is the Russian people's perception of Paraguay? [Davietjarov] In our encyclopedias we have accurate information on Paraguay. From the newspapers, I had a factual report that the political system had changed and that the country was on its way to democracy. I am mentally blending this data with what I now see here for myself. We hope that democracy will continue in Paraguay. [Loma] Let us now discuss your country's domestic situation. The IMF has admitted that your program of reforms is too risky and did not take into account, or took very little into account, the social cost, which is very high. Do you agree? [Davietjarov] I can only give your my personal opinion. Our people, rich or poor, will not back down. Everyone in our country dreams of liberty. We say in Russia that bread alone is not enough to live on. Our people are beginning to enjoy liberty and do not want to lose it. Not just liberty, but also the privatization program, which is going very fast. For example, the privatization of the oil industry. Some 25 percent of our enterprise has been offered to the workers, completely free of charge. Another 15 percent has been offered to them, allowing them to purchase shares over three years without paying any interest. These special measures have been exclusively implemented in the Russian oil industry. Because our enterprise is taking the initial steps toward privatization, the majority of stock must remain in the hands of the government. The complete process will take about three years. I believe this is the appropriate way to do things. This is the general situation. Most people support the government in the implementation of the program of reforms. [Loma] President Yeltsin has just replaced the economy minister, who was very radical, by someone who is more conservative, seeking to reduce the pace of reforms. Do you believe this is a timely change? [Davietjarov] I personally know the new economy minister and can say that he is in favor of a market economy. Unlike you, I do not believe this change of ministers necessarily means a slower pace toward a market economy. There is another, more simple explanation for this change of ministers. When you are heading for an unknown location, you must first go slowly, but on other occasions you must go at full speed. I can tell you that our government program will not radically change. We have a new parliament in which there are many economists. I am sure that their decisions will be correct. Our people understand perfectly that problems always occur during changes of this magnitude. [Loma] What is your personal opinion of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and on the great success he achieved in the past elections. [Davietjarov] I am personally sure, very sure, that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will never be our country's president. [Loma] Why not? [Davietjarov] Because he totally lost the success he achieved in the elections following his remarks and visits to various foreign countries. The Russian people now know him well. I believe Vladimir Zhirinovskiy should stop considering himself the future president of Russia. [Loma] What is your personal opinion on Russia's current situation? Do you believe the West has abandoned you in a sense? [Davietjarov] My personal opinion is that Russia, alone, must be able to succeed. We have great scientists and intellectuals. The country can succeed alone and overcome this difficult situation. If the West moves away, it will return sooner or later. It is not a problem. (he laughs) [Loma] Would you like to add anything for the Paraguayan people? What would you like to tell the Paraguayan people from the Russian people? [Davietjarov] No one in my country has given me the right to speak in his or her name. Nevertheless, as an ordinary Russian citizen, I hope you will continue on this democratic path and have good relations with all countries, including Russia. Our people work hard and, according to what I have seen so far, Paraguayans also work hard. We have something in common. I hope Paraguay will be modernized as we are being modernized.
