The Social Democratic Party [SPD] presidium commented on it by blandly describing it as a "serious incident." But just a few months ago, the SPD still voiced strict opposition to combat missions at its party congress and brought the matter before the constitutional court. How do these two positions fit together? [Wieczorek-Zeul] We hold to the position the SPD took at its party congress. Our foreign policy must not be based on military operations. If we take over the government as of next fall, that means that the mission of the Bundeswehr will continue to be the defense of the alliance and the defense of our nation. [DER SPIEGEL] And what about UN peacekeeping operations? [Wieczorek-Zeul] Let us leave semantics out of it. "Peacemaking" is synonymous to waging war. In our view, the Bundeswehr should only take part in humanitarian and peacekeeping blue helmet operations at the request of the United Nations. [DER SPIEGEL] What if the constitutional court decides that combat operations are permissible? [Wieczorek-Zeul] An SPD-led government will not resort to any such decision. We will make a political decision on every single peacekeeping mission in accordance with the criteria we agreed upon at the party congress. [DER SPIEGEL] Does the SPD still consider the 28 February mission unconstitutional as Burkhard Hirsch, the Free Democratic Party (FDP) Bundestag deputy, does or was that a "peacekeeping blue helmet mission" as specified by your party congress decision? [Wieczorek-Zeul] Of course German participation in the AWACS flights was and still is unconstitutional. That is why we lodged the appeal with the Karlsruhe [constitutional] court. The NATO operation itself, on the other hand, was lawful because it was based on a UN resolution. [DER SPIEGEL] How can something be legitimate, if it is unconstitutional? [Wieczorek-Zeul] From the point of view of international law it was legitimate. The question of legitimacy under international law and the constitutional situation in the FRG have nothing to do with each other. [DER SPIEGEL] Now what about the FRG's obligations under the alliance? [Wieczorek-Zeul] The SPD is not responsible for the fact that the UN assigns military missions to a military defense alliance such as NATO as a regional organization. Up until a few months ago that was unthinkable. But if such orders are issued, they can under no circumstances alter the the NATO mission, which is to defend the alliance. Under the NATO treaty no obligation exists to take part in operations such as the AWACS flights. The FRG can say without any hesitation that it will not take part. [DER SPIEGEL] The Bosnia operation is a NATO action on behalf of the United Nations. Isn't it time the SPD made up its mind whether it is prepared to cede such powers to the UN or merely wants to keep on calling for a stronger UN? [Wieczorek-Zeul] In procedures like these the danger is that NATO might control the UN and not the other way around. The Bundeswehr chief of staff has since demanded that NATO should not accept any mandate from the UN in the future but should intervene militarily on its own. We cannot but be strongly opposed to that. [DER SPIEGEL] Why did the SPD presidium create the impression in its statement that the opposition did approve of the decision to shoot down the aircraft? [Wieczorek-Zeul] It was not the presidium's job to "approve" the downing of the aircraft. That is not what we did. We said it was legitimate. And beyond that we gave priority to the situation of the people living in the former Yugoslavia and did not engage in a debate on basic issues. [DER SPIEGEL] At the Munich military affairs conference SPD chairman Rudolf Scharping said there are "no real differences" on basic foreign policy issues between the SPD opposition and Christian-liberal coalition. [Wieczorek-Zeul] The way I understand what he said at that conference--and it is a position to which I subscribe as well--is that the SPD does not put the basic decisions of German foreign policy into question, i.e. membership in the European Union, in NATO and in CSCE. But there are serious differences with the coalition on the mission of the Bundeswehr. We do not want any war and combat missions. [DER SPIEGEL] Internationally, Scharping's Munich statement was also taken to reflect agreement with the Bundeswehr actions in Bosnia and Somalia. [Wieczorek-Zeul] It is understandable, isn't it, that one does not get involved in domestic policy debates in front of international visitors? But Rudolf Scharping's "no" to combat missions by the Bundeswehr was quite unequivocal at the military affairs conference. [DER SPIEGEL] SPD Bundestag caucus chairman Klose--who has not been dismissed as the "foreign policy expert" of Scharping's government committee--wanted to characterize the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs as an example of "credible deterrence" but was kept from including this assessment in the party executive's statement on the ultimatum. Why? [Wieczorek-Zeul] It is simply the wrong language to use. For that matter, we reached a decision later which Klose agreed with. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you think the ultimatum addressed to the those laying siege to Sarajevo and the downing of the combat aircraft are instruments which could also be applied to pacify the remaining hot spots in the former Yugoslavia? [Wieczorek-Zeul] I neither consider these instruments, nor the United States and the majority of the countries of Western Europe to be exemplary. Otherwise the Croats and Muslims would not be looking for a solution at the negotiating table in the United States and Russia would not be making efforts to influence the Serbs. The situation in the former Yugoslavia cannot be changed or improved by war but only by political means. [DER SPIEGEL] Politics did not enter the picture successfully until after the ultimatum had worked. [Wieczorek-Zeul] Unfortunately that is true. People would have been spared a great deal, if political pressure had been brought on all participants two years ago. Happily, we have been spared the proof of whether bombardments would have pacified the country--or expanded the war, as we all feared. [DER SPIEGEL] The social democrats create the confusing impression that their party chairman and their parliamentary leader agree on foreign policy and security policy issues on the voters' behalf but that within the party Heide Wieczorek-Zeul--who has been caricatured by many as the "holy inquisition"--is keeping watch over strict adherence to the decisions taken at the party congress. [Wieczorek-Zeul] I dispute the idea that Rudolf Scharping is on a different course from mine. We reach our decisions together; nobody secretly or publicly takes a different position from others. [DER SPIEGEL] In the first draft of your government program the SPD keeps clear of a debate on the role of the Bundeswehr. The relevant passage merely reads: "We would like to see the Bundeswehr remain an alliance army." That is a bit thin. [Wieczorek-Zeul] So far we just have a preliminary draft in hand. Let us talk again when the program is really on paper. I am sure that the position on the role of the Bundeswehr will then be as clearly defined as we have discussed it here.
