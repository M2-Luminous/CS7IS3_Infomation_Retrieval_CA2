De Gruber reiterated that an alliance with the friendly parties could not be made in response to personal interests. [Begin recording] [De Gruber] On Sunday we nominated a presidential slate of three candidates. We said PA was a serious party and that the three candidates on the slate were to go to the campaign. In any case, convention delegates agreed to form alliances with other parties after 23 January, provided that those parties wished to join the alliance. They left that possibility open. [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] with Molirena, then? [De Gruber] Yes. [Reporter] Do you wish to meet with Professor Carles? [De Gruber] If he wants to meet with me, I would be pleased to meet with him. [Reporter] Will the PA presidential ticket change? [De Gruber] No. [Reporter] Are you aware of the fact that this division is making it possible for the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] to win? [De Gruber] Listen, we -- and I personally -- did all we could to form an alliance. I said this a month ago in David. We believe there must be an alliance of all parties. However, here the interests of some prevailed over those of the country. [Reporter] Some people have said that the president has talked too much about politics and may be violating some electoral provisions. Do you agree? [De Gruber] The president said at all times that there will be free, clean, and democratic elections in this country. No matter who wins, the president will surrender the Presidency to that person. Nobody can prevent him from making any statements he may have made as a member of his party after working hours. [Reporter] Do you fear a possible trial of the president? [Legislative Assembly President] Arturo Vallarino said it was possible. [De Gruber] Listen, I understand Arturo Vallarino said that if the Molirena members were expelled from the government, they would try the president. I ask him: Why didn't the Christian Democratic Party think that way when they left the government? The president has the power to dismiss or appoint whomever he chooses. [Reporter] Mrs. Mireya, you said interests have prevailed within Molirena, but they say the Arnulfists.... [De Gruber, interrupting] I must warn you that I did not say the interests of Molirena as a party have prevailed over those of the nation. [Reporter] Under what circumstances would you negotiate with Professor Carles? [De Gruber] We are ready to talk to all parties that want to come and talk to us. We are ready to talk to all parties except one. [end recording]
