FBIS4-53623 "dreas099__a94023" FBIS-EAS-94-099-A Daily Report 12 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Stricter Penalties Planned for Bid-Rigging Stricter Penalties Planned for Bid-Rigging OW2105001594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 12 May 94 Morning Edition p 5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2105001594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The Ministry of Construction [MOC] mapped out final measures designed to impose strict penalties against construction companies whose directors or employees were involved in bid-rigging or bribery for public works project. The MOC already approved a decision that it can order construction companies to suspend business for one year at most if they are found guilty of bribery and other crimes in regards to public works project. However, the MOC firmed up its decision this time to: 1) consider bid-rigging in violation of the Antimonopoly Law as subject to business suspension; and 2) impose more than one month of business suspension in case of bribery and more than 15 days in case of bid-rigging that violate the Antimonopoly Law. At the same time, the MOC will also introduce a minimum period of business suspension. The MOC wants to publicly announce criteria for the measures by next week and to start their application as early as August after about three months notification. The ministry will also inform local governments, which are in a position to supervise local contractors, of the measures and to ask them to adopt similar criteria. A decision to determine whether a process of selecting a contract winner is bid-rigging can be made on the basis of either criminal law or the Antimonopoly Act. Evidence that can prove a contract winner was selected through discussions is sufficient to prosecute a suspect on the basis of the Antimonopoly Act. In a case of prosecution based on criminal laws, however, it is necessary to prove, among other things, that companies involved in such a process actually gave or accepted money. Therefore, very few companies were arrested for violation of criminal laws. So far, the MOC has only given written warnings to construction companies who were involved in bid-rigging in violation of the Antimonopoly Act. However, they will be ordered to suspend business if the new criteria are applied. Business suspension will be imposed after a suspected company accepts the Fair Trade Commission's warning against bid-rigging or when the same commission determines that bid-rigging actually took place. Regarding the issue of introducing a minimum period of business suspension, the MOC will set a period almost equal to a period for which a construction company is taken out of a list of nominated contractors when it's executives or employees are arrested or indicted for bid-rigging. As for criminal prosecution regarding bribery and bid-rigging in violation of criminal laws or the Antimonopoly Law, a construction company will be ordered, in principle, to suspend business for three months at least if its executive, who has the right to represent the company, is found guilty. It will be two months if an ordinary employee or a branch manager of a company is involved in bid-rigging. Less than one month of business suspension will be ordered if an employee of lower rank is involved. A 15-day business suspension will be ordered regardless of rank if the Antimonopoly Law is violated. A construction company will be ordered to suspend business for a maximum of one year if it fails to take adequate measures to prevent the recurrence of bid-rigging. If it is ordered to suspend business, a construction company branch office will be banned from all activities to win contracts. In the past, there was no distinction between privately funded projects and public works as far as the application of penal measures were concerned. Therefore, only a maximum of 15 days of business suspension was imposed against bid-rigging for fear that "a long-term business suspension may drive companies to bankruptcy."
