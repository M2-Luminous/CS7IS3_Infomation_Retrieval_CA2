In its statement given to CTK by a member of the extreme-right SPR-RSC leadership, Josef Krejsa, the party said that in connection with the report by the Supreme Inspection Office (NKU) on the KPR's financial management it would also "have to lodge with the NKU a complaint of (KPR head) Josef Dobrovsky." "The strange management of state property, probably involving bribes and unjustified payments, are the best proofs of the character of not only Havel's collaborators, but of himself as well," the statement says. According to the NKU report, the KPR made last year unsubstantiated payments amounting to 769,753 crowns (about $25,500) from its budget. [passage omitted]
