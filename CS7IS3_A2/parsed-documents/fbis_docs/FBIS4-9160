The realistic nature of his program is seen as a negotiating basis even by those people who would reject coalition with the MSZP out of hand. He is often the topic of conversations and many guesses can also be heard about him while he does not give many interviews. What are his views on the party's tasks in the near and distant future, and what are his views on his own role? Eszter Radai interviewed Laszlo Bekesi. [Radai] The politicians of rival parties and even independent political analysts claim that [MSZP Chairman] Gyula Horn is using you to make the MSZP appear presentable and suitable for coalition -- while there is a tough struggle between the two of you. What are your views on this? [Bekesi] If this was true, I would find it flattering that I can make a whole party presentable or suitable for coalition. Naturally, no one ever denied that there are a number of trends in the MSZP. It is usually me who represents the technocratic views that are based on rational facts, which place the economy in the forefront, and push the ideological considerations into the background. [Radai] Assessing the coalition possibilities, leaders of other parties have recently been stating that they would not have any objections to the Socialists if you determined the party's image and it could be guaranteed that your program would be implemented. For example, [Federation of Young Democrats, FIDESZ Chairman] Viktor Orban said that "Bekesi's program could be a basis for negotiations." [Bekesi] A party that has any self-esteem does not normally accept conditions that are set for it by its rivals. The program that is known as the Bekesi program was accepted by the MSZP and this is our official program. Seeing this as a negotiating basis means a potential partnership. However, it lacks seriousness to tell us in a message whom we should replace and where we should place people. As matter of fact, not much later we learned from the FIDESZ's other statements that no matter what kind of program the MSZP has, relations between these two parties will not be formed on the basis of the programs, rather, on the basis of the sentiments of the two parties' leaders toward each other, on the basis of the past, on prejudices, and I do not know what else.... [Radai] Is it certain that the Bekesi program will remain the MSZP's program? In the past years, we have had plenty of chances to see that it is possible to deviate from programs. Will you be able to resist the pressure, especially if it is exerted by the trade union leaders who are in the coalition? Are you not afraid that you will be blackmailed regularly? [Bekesi] The election alliance with the National Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary [MSZOSZ] does not imply the dangers that are often mentioned. For example, the dangers that, in the government position, the MSZP's ability to act will be hampered by the dominance of trade unions; the economic policy based on modernization will be replaced by an economic policy based on distribution; trade union demands can be asserted much better from within than from outside; or that politics and interest representation will be mixed up. These dangers do not automatically follow from an election alliance. [Radai] However, we are talking about a prominent place on the MSZP's list; [MSZOSZ Chairman] Sandor Nagy is on the second place, ahead of you. [Bekesi] This certainly has a negative message, but I would not like to discuss this just now. However, if the danger of setting up a trade union type government was in the background of the election alliance then I would be the first one to protest most decisively. In fact, I would not even participate in this. This would be just as bad for the country as the confirmation of another conservative governmental cycle. [Radai] Nevertheless, I do not understand why you exclude the possibility of this. [Bekesi] Because the MSZP accepted a modernization program on which its whole political program and campaign is based, and on the basis of which it decided its coalition principles and laid them down in writing. Otherwise, the program would have been modified, its modernization goals would have been softened, and actual trade union demands would have been included in it that -- if this is what the electors wish -- then could be implemented as a government program. However, this did not happen. On the other hand, we never denied -- in fact, I usually emphasize this -- that, in the course of implementing the program, a government that includes the MSZP will fight tough battles with the interest lobbies, in spite of the election alliance with the MSZOSZ. Therefore, we are not to prepare for some kind of a peaceful coexistence based on concessions, rather, the chance for the self-restriction of trade unions will increase, and the basis for this will be established precisely by the good relations between the MSZP and the trade unions. [Radai] In your view, are people who will vote for the Socialists aware that they will also be voting for a very strict economic program that is much more liberal than social democratic? [Bekesi] It only makes sense to describe an economic program in economic philosophy terms if a government or country has a choice. However, today in Hungary, the room for maneuver is so narrow and the path is so determined that a realistic economic policy necessarily has to have more liberal than conservative or social democratic elements. Rather than meaning that the MSZP is promoting a liberal economic policy, this means that in this situation, being realists, the MSZP is also accepting the goals that have a liberal content. In fact, I do not even protest against being called a liberal economic policy maker because I am convinced that for decades, this will be the only realistic economic policy in Hungary. [Radai] Has your move from the original eighth place to third got anything to do with the fact that the Bekesi program has become the official party program? [Bekesi] The official explanation for the eighth place was that the party leadership adhered to two basic principles when it made up the party list, namely that it should reflect the party hierarchy, and that it should ensure the agreed positions of election allies. In this context, my eighth place was justifiable because I do not participate in the work of the party's leading bodies, I am only a simple parliamentary deputy. However, the national list can, at the same time, be seen as a kind of party message as to what programs and people it considers important for itself. Therefore, my eighth place was unacceptable for the party's majority and naturally for me, too. The election committee that made the original proposal obviously had not properly assessed the situation and the power structure. It would have been a strange decision that would not have strengthened respect for the party if a politician who played a major role in drawing up the program had been pushed into the background. The assessment of the power structure was mistaken because it was based on the assumption that the congress and the party's majority that is to make the decision would accept this. It did not accept this, in fact, there was an grassroots outcry. [Radai] [Prime Minister] Peter Boross recently said that the MSZP is deceiving its electors by not naming its prime ministerial candidate. Why and for how long do you wish to keep this issue pending? [Bekesi] Until the elections, or even further. We will decide this at an extraordinary congress after the elections but before the coalition talks. Social-liberal, Christian-social, or broad social-liberal-conservative coalitions require a completely different prime ministers. A concrete person can even prevent and exclude certain possibilities. As we do not wish to limit ourselves and do not wish to prevent the establishment of an efficient coalition, we are now waiting, and we do not exclude the possibility of finding a suitable person, who enjoys the confidence of the other possible coalition partners, from outside the party. [Radai] Is it also possible that the MSZP will win the elections with a big majority, reaches very good results, and still offers the prime ministerial chair to someone else? [Bekesi] No, this is impossible. A party that plays a determining role after the elections and generously offers its prime ministerial function to someone else does not exist anywhere in the world. [Radai] An increasing number of people, including some Socialist politicians, have been saying that they are afraid that the MSZP will win too well, and it will find it difficult or impossible to find coalition partners. [Bekesi] It is undoubtedly true that a strong imbalance in the power structure can make it difficult to form a coalition. It is unlikely that we will reach more than 50 percent. Therefore, it has to be a coalition. However, if the MSZP's majority is so big that the partners would be in a subordinate position, they might prefer to be in an opposition role. Of course, this is only speculation. On the basis of various assessments and my personal experience, I do not exclude the possibility that we will win the elections. However, I am not expecting a landslide victory. Should this nevertheless happen, it will present a new situation. [Radai] What are your views on [Alliance of Free Democrats, SZDSZ campaign chief] Balint Magyar's recent statement according to which the SZDSZ is only willing to enter into a coalition with the MSZP if the liberals can be the leading force of the coalition? [Bekesi] This stance is a bit difficult for me to accept. I am not saying that we cannot talk about this, but ultimatums should not be made, because this is a very delicate and complicated issue. [Radai] Is it possible that you will be the prime minister? [Bekesi] Hardly. This is very unlikely because the MSZP's leadership has completely different ideas. I do not know what most people in the party think about this issue because I have never been assessed this way. [Radai] Would you object to Gabor Kuncze being prime minister? [Bekesi] Not at all. Kuncze is a nice person, calm politician, and I have a very good relationship with him. It is a different matter what kind of political power structure, election results, and coalition agreements are needed for Kuncze's name to be put forward. It is certain that I could work very well with him, I think he is an excellent person. [Radai] What will the MSZP do if it wins the elections but does not find any coalition partners? [Bekesi] If it does not find any coalition partners because all parties distance themselves from it then it will have to go into opposition. This is the only case when a victorious party has a political and moral basis to go into opposition. In theory, it is also possible -- although I cannot imagine this -- that we accept governing in a minority. This would probably only last a very short time. We would probably be turned out of office on the first possible occasion. In that case, new elections would have to be called.
