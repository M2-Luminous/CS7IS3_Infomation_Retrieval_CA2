Koyo said on state radio late Thursday that more than 3,000 of those affected "held false qualifications", while the others were in fact "fictitious" employees created to enable people to obtain "five to ten salaries" each month. Most of those dismissed were recruited under the former ruling party, the Congolese Labour Party, under pressure from the trade unions, which responded to Koyo's announcement with a strike threat. The head of the main CSTC labour confederation, Louis Gondou, said "all this is illegal because we concluded an agreement with the government for the payment of January and February salaries to these 8,050 employeers who worked normally." "The workers will meet Friday to decide whether to strike against this measure," he added. Koyo also announced that the government planned to lay off 934 civil servants aged over 55, who should have been retired a year ago but were not because of "bureaucratic difficulties." The planned lay-offs will enable the government to cut the annual pay allocation for some 80,000 civil servants from 134 billion CFA francs (229 million dollars) to about 122 billion CFA francs (208 million dollars), informed sources said.
