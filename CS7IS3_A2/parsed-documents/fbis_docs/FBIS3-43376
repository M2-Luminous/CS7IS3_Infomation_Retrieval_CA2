Mwaanga's resignation also comes in the wake of international concern over corruption and drug dealing in the Zambian Government expressed by donors at a consultative group meeting in Paris last month. "I want to inform the nation of my solemn decision to stand down as minister of foreign affairs with immediate effect," Mwaanga told a packed press conference at his office, adding that his decision was as a result of a relentless campaign fuelled by "people and entities with limitless malice." "I am not involved in drug trafficking and I am not involved in corrupt practices or abuse of public office...but it is my duty to see to it that government position is not compromised," he said. The minister said his decision to step down was aimed at giving the government a free hand to investigate fully and thouroughly the allegations levelled against him. "It is my perception that the government should have unfettered ability to investigate allegations of drug trafficking, corruption and misuse of public funds by public officers at whatever levels," Mwaanga said. He became the fourth cabinet minister to voluntarily leave the two-year-old government of President Frederick Chiluba. Since ushering in his cabinet after the 1991 multi-party elections, Chiluba has been under persistent pressure to act on alleged high level corruption and and drug trafficking in his government. Local press reports and opposition figures have alleged that there are a number of ministers involved in the vice and accused Chiluba of failing to take action because they bankrolled his 1991 presidential campaign. Mwaanga, Community Development Minister Nakatindi Wina and her husband Sikota, who is deputy speaker of the National Assembly, were detained for months by former president Kenneth Kaunda for their alleged involvement in mandrax drug trafficking in 1985. The findings of a special tribunal appointed by Kaunda to investigate them have not been made public. Finance Minister Ronald Penza told journalists after the Paris meeting that donors had withheld 96 million dollars of the required financial assistance of almost a billion dollars because of their concern about drug trafficking and corruption in the Zambian Government. He said the donors described Zambia as "the Columbia of Africa" and he called on Chiluba to take action before the next consultative group meeting in March. Deputy Minister for Economic Planning Dean Mungomba, who accompanied Penza to Paris, has echoed the finance minister's views. "Our relations with our cooperating partners will be strained if serious steps are not taken before March.... We have dealt with serious problems like inflation and monetary control, I do not see why drug trafficking cannot be dealt with," Mungomba said. Mwaanga said, however, that he will remain a committed member of the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) although "the campaign against me has been orchestrated by colleagues in government who are themselves the very epitome of greed, who from their first day in government have used every opportunity to sustain their appetite for material possessions." He appealed to the other ministers accused of drug dealing to follow his example.
