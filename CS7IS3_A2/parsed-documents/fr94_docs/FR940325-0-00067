FR940325-0-00067 FR940325-0-00015 PART 675_GROUNDFISH FISHERY OF THE BERING SEA AND ALEUTIAN ISLANDS AREA 4. The authority citation for part 675 continues to read as follows: Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. 5. In ยง675.20, paragraphs (j)(1) and (j)(6) are revised to read as follows: ยง675.20 General limitations. * * * * * (j) Allowable retention of pollock roe. (1) For purposes of this paragraph (j), pollock roe means product comprised of pollock eggs, either loose or in sacs or skeins. Pollock roe retained onboard a vessel at any time during a fishing trip must not exceed 7 percent of the total round-weight equivalent of pollock, as calculated from the primary pollock product onboard the vessel during the same fishing trip as defined in this paragraph (j). Determinations of allowable retention of pollock roe will be based on amounts of pollock harvested, received, or processed during a single fishing trip. Pollock or pollock products from previous fishing trips that are retained onboard a vessel may not be used to determine the allowable retention of pollock roe for that vessel. * * * * * (6) Calculation of the amount of retainable pollock roe. To calculate the amount of pollock roe that can be retained onboard during a fishing trip, first calculate the round-weight equivalent by dividing the total amount of primary product onboard by the appropriate product recovery rate. To determine the amount of pollock roe that can be retained during the same fishing trip, multiply the round-weight equivalent by 0.07. The result is the maximum amount of pollock roe that can be retained onboard during that fishing trip. Pollock roe retained onboard from previous fishing trips will not be counted, for purposes of this paragraph (j)(6). If two or more products, other than roe, are made from different fish, then round-weight equivalents are calculated separately for each product. Round-weight equivalents are then added together, and the sum multiplied by 0.07 to determine the maximum amount of pollock roe that can be retained onboard a vessel during a fishing trip. However, if two or more products, other than roe, are made from the same fish, then the maximum amount of pollock roe that can be retained during a fishing trip is determined from the primary product. * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;7139 Filed 3&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P
