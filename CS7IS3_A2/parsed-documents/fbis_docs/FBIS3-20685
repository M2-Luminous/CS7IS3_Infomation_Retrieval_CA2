Knezevic reveals to POLITIKA that he was born in the vicinity of Knin and that he had lived in Zagreb for 40 years, before leaving in 1990, when "first unpleasantnesses started," after resigning from the position of director of Radio-Television Zagreb. Knezevic states that the FRY office will be located in the center of Zagreb, "three tramway stops away from the place where he used to live." POLITIKA states that Knezevic personally knows many current Croatian leaders, including his successor at Croatian Television -- Antun Vrdoljak. Answering a question on the order in which the normalization of relations between the FRY and Croatia will be carried out, he responds that first postal, then railroad, and finally road links will be established.
