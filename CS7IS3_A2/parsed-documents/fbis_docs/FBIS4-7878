In the afternoon Mr. Cindoruk visited the National Assembly and talked with National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov. [Begin Cindoruk recording, in Turkish fading into Bulgarian translation read by Tsenkova] Except for sending Turkish Blue Helmets to Bosnia-Herzegovina, we did not have any other issues on which our opinions were not similar, Cindoruk said. He also added that it was not so much a difference of opinions on that issue but rather a different interpretation of the UN decision. However, according to Mr. Yordanov, the participation of Turkish blue helmets in the Yugoslav conflict will revive the historical memories of the population in the region. A modern policy cannot be based on memories. According to Aleksandur Yordanov, the Bulgarian position is correct, balancing, and moderate. It requires from all countries to stay away from the conflict, even if they feel equally engaged in the situation in former Yugoslavia. The positions of the two countries on developing Black Sea economic cooperation also were discussed. At the moment the Turkish parliamentary delegation is meeting the minister of foreign affairs.
