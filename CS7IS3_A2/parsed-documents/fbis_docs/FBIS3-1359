Sporadic gunfire continued to be heard, especially in the northern areas of Bujumbura. In the area of Kamenge, which has been most affected by the prevailing insecurity, the situation seems to have eased. The mayor of Bujumbura and the commander in charge of security in that area today toured the area and witnessed the situation that has relatively bettered and called on the hundreds of people that have fled to return to their homes. [sentence as heard] In the meantime, Defense Ministe Lieutenant Colonel Gedeon Fyiroko talked about the prevailing situation and the way the Army was working to take control of the situation. They also showed to reporters a heap of weapons that had been taken from what were said to be rebels fighting the Army in the northern areas of the capital. They also denied any rumors of a military coup attempt in preparation. Mathias Ndayiragije has more: [Begin Ndayiragije recording] Insecurity which prevails in this country could be settled soon, the defense minister said, if all moral forces could indulge in such business. He said other forces must collaborate with the government and the population as a whole, in an attempt to find ways out. For him, the first thing to be done was to create confidence among the population and be aware of the danger as it results in several losses of human lives, for which the minister for defense does not want to make stories or accounts whatsoever, because it is a shame. [sentence as heard] All rumors which are [word indistinct] in this country tend to create mutual hatred among the population and this hatred results sometimes in mutual exclusion. As for rumors which said there ought [as heard] to occur a military force coup, the defense minster said that the Burundi Army keeps loyal and fully supports the government and all the democratic institutions of the country. The Burundi minister expressed concern over the disarmament issue because people who have no civil rights to hold weapons continue to seek them and this will always constitute a threat to the country's security. There are [word indistinct] thousands of weapons circulating among the population, and some of them are not available in the Burundi arsenal military stock. Some of the weapons are manufactured and imported from South Africa, Israel, Brasilia, China, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Russia and so on. Those weapons include guns, (?F.M. Karash), grenades of different kinds, as well as rockets. There were also some weapons which are not available in the Burundi military stock arsenal but which are actually used in the Rwandese Army. Most of the other weapons such as pistols, are used by the Burundi intelligence services. For him an action of disarmament should start soon and provide [break in transmission]. [end recording]
