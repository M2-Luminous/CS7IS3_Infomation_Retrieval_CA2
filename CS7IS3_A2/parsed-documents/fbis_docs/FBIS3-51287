Torricelli is calling on Clinton administration officials and human rights advocates to testify at a hearing on the Chiapas uprising. "The United States should make very clear to the Mexican Government the type of political reforms required if we are to maintain a new relationship," stated the Democratic representative, who said the hearing has been scheduled for 2 February. Tello said Torricelli's initiative is unfriendly and offensive. It seems that the legislator is unaware, Tello stated, of the measures the Mexican Government has taken to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Chiapas. It seems that they want to take up the old arguments that went on during the NAFTA debate and link commercial policies to interventionist intentions in Mexico, the foreign relations secretary concluded. [no quotation marks as received] A group of U.S. legislators who support NAFTA have sent a letter to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to express their concern over the events in Chiapas and to ask him to facilitate investigations by human rights groups and the media in the area of conflict.
