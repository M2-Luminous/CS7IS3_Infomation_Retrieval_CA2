They announced their withdrawal the night before last, saying that the dialogue had reached a dead end because of differences between the ruling coalition parties (the General People's Congress [GPC], the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG], and the YSP) over local government, election methods, and formation of a shura council. A statement issued by the Yemeni opposition said that these differences developed into exchanges of accusations, escalated by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's speech the day before yesterday in Ta'izz, over the aims some ruling coalition parties hoped to achieve through the meeting of the Yemeni Ulema Society at the Mu'adh Bin-Jabal Mosque in al-Jund, the disregard for the Dialogue Committee's efforts, and the House of Representatives decision to ask the prime minister and the ministers to withdraw from the Dialogue Committee and return to their posts to discharge their duties as members of the government. In his Ta'izz speech, the Yemeni president accused the YSP of "seeking secession" with funds from certain Arab states. In reply, the YSP issued a statement expressing interest in preserving Yemeni unity and in continuing efforts to build a modern state. It condemned the "lies and abuse" aimed at it. It expressed confidence that the Arab states mentioned in the speech were eager "to establish cordial relations based on mutual respect, sovereignty, fraternal cooperation, and good neighborliness" with Yemen. The opposition's statement accused the ruling parties of serving their own interests, not the people's interests. It added that "the opposition submitted reasonable papers and serious proposals for ending the crisis and laying the foundations for stability in the country but the ruling parties reacted to the document with reservations, making it impossible to continue the dialogue." That, it said, "convinced the opposition's National Bloc parties that the dialogue was not serious and was futile, and this made them withdraw from arguments which benefit nobody in these exceptional circumstances." Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, planning minister and member of the GPC Political Bureau, said in reply that "they should let their conscience be the judge as to who obstructed the dialogue." He emphasized that the GPC did not postpone a single session or reject any proposal made during the committee's work since 8 November. 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, member of the GPC Political Bureau and head of its General Department, has described the opposition's withdrawal and statement as "some kind of political upstaging" and accused the YSP of "using them [the opposition] to abort the dialogue." In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, he said that "the real identity of the opposition is now clear. It is just the other face of the YSP. It hastily withdrew for reasons of political gain and media blackmail." [passage omitted]
