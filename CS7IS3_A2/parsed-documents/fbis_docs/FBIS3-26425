Koo made the remarks at a meeting of an Economics Ministry-sponsored task force that is studying ways to decrease the deficit with Japan. Koo said the time for using tax exemptions to stimulate investment is over, and that Taiwan must now establish independence in high technology in order to get the economy in gear. Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng said at the meeting that the deficit with Japan can be cut by an industrial structure upgrade and by domestic manufacturers producing higher quality products in order to tempt Japanese buyers. Hsu said, however, that domestic manufacturers must get over their mindset that Taiwan's industries are too weak and reliant on Japanese imports of key components and machinery. Until this happens, he said, the trade deficit with Japan will continue.
