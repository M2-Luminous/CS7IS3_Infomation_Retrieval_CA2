FR940810-0-00054 FR940810-0-00021 OSHA proposed in 1990 to expand the requirement. Under the proposal, supervision of all asbestos construction worksites by a ``competent person'' would be required; the training of a competent person would be keyed to the kind of asbestos operation. However, the proposal left undecided whether onsite, continuous supervision of all asbestos-related work would be required for all asbestos work. The final standard resolves these issues. A ``competent'' person, as defined in the general construction standards, must supervise all work under the asbestos construction standard. That person must be ``capable of identifying existing asbestos *␣*␣* hazards in the workplace, and has the authority to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate them␣*␣*␣*'' 29 CFR 1926.58[b]. OSHA reiterates its statement in the proposal that ``all construction site employees would benefit from the presence of a competent person to oversee asbestos-related work'' (55 FR at 29726). However, the need for on-site supervision varies with the hazard potential of the work undertaken. All workers performing Class I construction work must have continuous access to an on-site supervisor, who meets the training requirements for designation as a ``competent person'' under this standard. Supervision for Class II and III work does not always require a continuous on-site ``competent person,'' therefore the standard requires inspections at ``sufficient'' intervals and at employee request. Supervision of installation of asbestos containing construction materials and Class IV work must also be accomplished by complying with the ``generic'' requirement for ``frequent and regular'' inspection [Paragraph (0)(2)]. Training for ``competent persons'' can be accomplished in a number of ways and meet the standard's performance requirements. For Class I, II and III work, the ``competent person'' must take a course such as a course under the EPA Model Accreditation Plan for accredited contractor/supervisor, project designer or management planner course, or their equivalent in content, duration, and criteria for success. Class IV work may be part of larger construction projects, in which case the competent person trained to supervise the project should supervise the on-site cleanup activities which constitute the Class IV work. Explanation of Provisions of the Final Standards The following is a provision-by-provision discussion of the revised asbestos standards. Thus all the provisions in all three standards: general industry, construction and shipyard employment, relating to a topic will be discussed under the heading for that topic. For example, under the scope heading, the scope of the general industry standard will be first discussed, then the scope of the construction standard, and finally the scope of the shipyard employment standard. Similarly, under the methods of compliance heading, the provisions in each standard relating to that topic will be discussed. Where a discussion applies to all three or to two of the separate standards it will be so noted and will not be repeated for each standard. OSHA believes that this format will help the public understand where and why the various standards contain different provisions relating to the same subject matter. Further, it will avoid repetition in explanations where a common policy rationale applies to more than one asbestos standard. (1) Scope and Application Paragraph (a). General Industry Standard. 29 CFR 1910.1001. The general industry standard covers all activities (except agriculture), covered by the Act which are not otherwise covered by the construction asbestos standard, 29 CFR 1926.1101, and the new shipyard employment standard, 29 CFR 1915.1001. Consequently, marine terminals and longshoring would be covered by the general industry standard if asbestos were being loaded, unloaded or stored. The asbestos construction standard, in existence since 1986, lists activities which it covers. This includes construction activities though they may take place at a factory or agricultural premises. The new shipyard employment standard, likewise lists its covered activities.
