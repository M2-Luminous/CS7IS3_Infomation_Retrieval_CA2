As such, the situation is characterized by the following features: A spiral inflation which has grown by about 2 percent per month for the widely consumed goods; A quasi-end to job creation and the loss of job opportunities in all sectors of production as a result of lack of investment and the bad management of the economy. Thus, unemployment, which is rife among youth, was on the increase; A financial situation was characterized by a deficit in the public sector of the economy, a matter which compelled the treasury to pay off part of this sector's debts; A sharp deficit in the budget: It was much more than what was estimated at the beginning of the year. It was the result of a drop in the oil revenues, in particular, as a result of a drop in the oil prices in world markets, in addition to a decrease in ordinary tax revenues, given the decline in the production and service sectors of the economy; A sharp imbalance in the balance of payment which led to restricting imports and controlling through the use of rules and laws scares foreign currency resources. This led to a grave scarcity of the intermediate goods which are destined to the productive apparatus. [passage omitted] Two-pronged activity was undertaken to re-organize the economy: A corrective activity directed towards the achievement of a balance between the available resources and domestic and foreign expenditures. [passage omitted] An economic revival activity which was aiming at creating productive working posts and consequently reducing unemployment through investment, the revival of the economic apparatus, regaining the confidence of the private economic operators and the reorganization of the distribution net work. The success of this revival activity requires a progress in economic reforms and its implementation has to begin, particularly in the fields that include special initiatives and the sectors which have significant repercussion on the economy such as the building sector. Around these two axes, the most important activities of the government in the economic, financial, and monetary spheres were presented in this brief round-up. [passage omitted] Generally speaking, the in-depth analysis of the government's activities and its intervention should show that the scope of its activities have focussed on reforming and stimulating the economy. Concerning economic reforms, under this title comes the current relations with the IMF aimed at achieving a plan of economic stability, dealing with foreign debts and introducing measures to reduce the budget deficit. Regarding relations with the IMF, the government decided since its appointment to resume negotiations with the IMF in order to draw a plan for stability. This decision was based on the following estimated factors: The main features of the state of the internal and external finance are an increasing deficit in the budget as a result of the decline in the petroleum revenue and increasing difficulties in securing financial cover for imports through external financing at reasonable cost. The restoration of internal and external financial equilibriums, I mean a return to an economic policy financed by the existing resources, is the only way to control inflation, boost the economic apparatus, promote private investment, reduce speculative economic activities, and launch actions for the creation of productive and permanent jobs for young people. Thus, the government is determined to face up to the country's economic and financial situation. There was no suitable remedy [as heard] to improve growth and create jobs. These facts have led to the resumption of talks with the International Monetary Fund. It is worth mentioning in this respect that these talks were never interrupted. The government has given these talks a clear objective and it has drawn up a strategy of negotiations with the IMF taking into account the particular circumstances which the country is going through. This objective was announced from the very start and the idea is to achieve a program for economic stability. As a result of this strategy these negotiations have moved in a direction which allows our country to benefit from the support and understanding of our international partners with a view to persuading the IMF to take into account our country's special situation and also to pool its own financial resources to help us in our efforts to revive the economy. It is worth noting that the government was anxious not to start negotiations with the IMF before informing its social partners, workers and trade unions. The government thus presented the analysis which led it to choose this path and also the strategies of the negotiations [as heard] which will follow. The talks with the IMF consisted of three stages. In the first stage, there was a joint analysis of the country's economic and financial situation. This analysis led to in-depth discussions last September in Washington between government representatives and senior officials in the IMF. In the second stage, the two sides agreed to define the economic, financial, and monetary measures which the government would adopt to stabilize the economy. The talks relating to this stage were held in Algeria in the first two weeks of December 1993 between a team of Algerian experts and a team of IMF experts. The objective sought by the two sides was mainly to reach an understanding on elements of the economic policy which should include a structured program in order to improve the country's economic and financial situation. In the third stage, the two sides agreed to lay down criteria on which these various elements should be based with a view to achieving the desired economic and financial results. They also agreed to discuss these criteria on the strength of technical reports prepared by the two sides. The elements of the plan of stability which received financial support from the IMF must be tackled during this stage. Intensive work had been undertaken to prepare for these negotiations both at the level of the government and the technical bodies. The technical aspects of relations with the IMF are considered to be under control. They attracted the attention of the directors of the economy concerning the correct Algerian viewpoint with regard to the soundness of its program which will be put before the IMF. These directors have expressed their approval and support after Algeria reached agreement with the IMF. [passage omitted] The government in its negotiations with the IMF provided for itself a negotiating margin to enable it to stringently and clearly undertake this plan which would have positive effects on social strata. In this framework, one can explain the measures that had been taken recently with the General Union of Algerian Workers [UGTA] within the framework of social protection. [passage omitted] With regard to the problem of foreign debts, foreign debts at the end 1993 stood at $25.9 billion. It is expected that servicing these debts in 1994 would cost $9.3 billion out of which 7.1 billion dollars are earmarked for the loans and $2.2 billion as interest. The revenues from exports during the same year could be less than the cost of servicing the debts. As well as being heavy in terms of the economy's ability to sustain servicing them, the main feature of Algeria's foreign debts is that they are of very short terms and they must be settled within a period of three years. The heavy weight of the debts had increased as a result of the drop in the revenues from the exports of carbohydrates coupled with the continuing fall in the price of a barrel of oil and this doubles the efforts to tackle it. The search for a negotiated solution with the creditors to reduce foreign debts must take place through a deal with the IMF. However, this entails results which are known beforehand and effects that can be undertaken. As far as the budget deficit is concerned, the government has paid great importance to reduce the budget deficit which has resulted from a number of economic complications; it is matter which should be taken seriously. The financial year 1993 was ahead of the forecast; a matter which has enabled the government to take measures to reduce this year's deficit, which is estimated at 12 percent of the GDP. However, as far as 1994 is concerned a number of measures, which would allow a reduction of the deficit to an acceptable level, around 3.6 percent of the GDP, have been taken. Although this should still be considered a high level given the inflationary trends in the economy this figure can, however, be achieved through the following measures: Cuts in a number of secondary expenditure which would be coupled with further rationalization of other expenditures. An increase in ordinary tax revenues; which will be achieved only through a program to combat tax evasion. [passage omitted]. The use of some of the money, which has been set aside for the past few years. [passage omitted] Encouraging investments in the framework of the small and medium-sized companies thanks, in particular, to the law on investments directed mainly at the private sector. Enforcing the finance law of 1994. Facilitating the objection of foreign financing. As far as the law on investments and encouraging small- and medium-sized companies are concerned, and regarding the financial situation of the country, it is difficult to lay down a strict program of economic research. The economy, however, has the potential to have vitality instilled into it, and this potential has not been fully exploited. For this, it needs individual initiative as this is based on restoring confidence in the private sector in particular. Since it was appointed, the government has adopted a number of measures aimed at not marginalizing the private sector. [passage omitted] Protecting national production was the subject of measures aimed at raising duties on some products. All import restrictions would be lifted on those products which might compete with national products. Measures had also been taken to encourage products destined for export by reducing customs duties imposed on raw and semi-manufactured materials used in the manufacturing of products suitable for export. In the same context, and in order to encourage economic activities by companies whose capital allows for the sharing of risks between numerous investors in a single project, the tax index on the companies' profits had been reduced from 42 percent to 38 percent in the present financial law. Concerning facilities for acquiring hard currency, in addition to these measures, which are of a legislative nature and which reflect the government's desire to encourage the revival of economic activities, the sum of 60 million American dollars in cash was made to the banks to cover the needs of the private sector for imported materials and spare parts. Within the same context, the special committee received instructions to grant permits for obtaining foreign financing for the import requests submitted by the private sector to obtain products for the sectors considered of priority, such as the construction sector. To these measures was added the settlement of the problem of the loss in exchange rate incurred by some private investors as a result of the devaluation of the dinar in 1991. All these emergency measures would pave the way for the solid revival of the productive activities of the sector of small and medium enterprises. The adopted economic policy forms a sovereign national choice which is responsible and which was taken after a lot of thinking and adapted to the serious challenges of the current situation. This policy, the essential points of which have already been presented, has been completed and consolidated, particularly with tight and realistic plans, to correct the course of national or local public enterprises whose problems have been identified. These enterprises will have to adapt their methods of management to the new situation which is characterized by special requirements. In order to allow it to bear fruit, this policy was adopted as a method of work in reorganizing the national financial resources. This policy constitutes a rational choice for a successful move to a market economy since numerous elements of such an economy have already been put in place. This policy requires a continuous effort, discipline and a firmness which does not tolerate shortcomings. In addition to the basic choices which meet the requirements of the present time, the reform and the revival of the economy depend on an collective effort since they will guarantee a return of growth and restore hopes for a regained prosperity to be shared out among everyone. God's peace and mercy be upon you. [applause]
