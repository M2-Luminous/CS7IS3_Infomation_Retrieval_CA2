FBIS3-14267 "drnes058_j_94008" FBIS-NES-94-058 Document Type:Daily Report 17 Mar 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Reform Party Official on Terrorism, Conflicts NC2403211594 Cairo AL-AHRAM in Arabic 17 Mar 94 p 6 NC2403211594 Cairo AL-AHRAM Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Report on interview with Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zanadani, representative of the Yemeni Alliance for Reform in the Presidential Council, by Amin Muhammad Amin in Sanaa; date not given] [Text] Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zanadani, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council representing the Yemeni Alliance for Reform [YAR], has affirmed that his party wishes to resolve all existing differences between the General People's Congress Party [GPC] in the north and the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] in the south. He said his party does not wish to exploit the current differences between the two parties to obtain seats of power in the country. In an interview with AL-AHRAM held at his residence in Sanaa, Shaykh al-Zanadani said that the YSP wants to internationalize the Yemeni crisis and move it from the House of Representatives to the international community. He clarified that the YAR, the third member of the coalition in the government, wants to keep the Yemeni issue in the hands of its sons. It does not want the dispute to go outside Arab circles for a solution. The Presidential Council member noted that his party insists on telling the truth, a step that does not satisfy either of the sides to the dispute. We demand that the people's will be respected in accordance with the Pledge and Accord Document. We call for presenting all our issues before the House of Representatives to discuss them and pass the resolutions that bind all sides. On the conflict between the GPC and the YSP regarding how to implement the document, in which the YSP is demanding that those charged in the assassinations be arrested first, he said that his party supports the GPC on the need to merge the state institutions before arresting the defendants, especially since the government is a coalition between three parties. Responding to a question on the role the YAR could play in arresting the suspects in the assassinations, he said we always stand by the truth and do not accuse anyone. We demand a fair trial and the elimination of political influences on decisions. He affirmed that the road to power can only be through the ballot box. Regarding the various accusations that the YAR practices terrorism, he said: I am one of those who experienced an assassination attempt and acts of terrorism before the parliamentary elections. However, the current conflict prompted some sides, especially the YSP, to exploit the issue of terrorism, in particular with some Arab countries that do not know the facts behind the conflict in Yemen. The truth is that there are political and tribal conflicts and that a state of vengeance exists between the YSP in the south and a number of citizens whose sons, brothers, and family members were killed. Therefore, the problem of revenge will continue to be a time bomb in Yemen if it is not wisely handled. He noted that the YAR presented a proposal for resolving the problem of vengeance in Yemen. The proposal includes signing an agreement and issuing a decision on stopping Yemeni bloodshed and then setting a date for a general pardon of past incidents. All the chapters of vengeful acts before this date will be closed and the national interests of Yemen will be promoted henceforth. All murders and acts of revenge that take place after that date will fall under Islamic laws and punishments. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zanadani denied accusations that he harbors terrorism and heads the military wing of the YAR. He said that there were some youths who were very religious and found out that some people in Aden were behaving in an un-Islamic manner. They found out, for example, that there is an alcoholic beverage plant in Aden and that the police killed demonstrators in the al-Rahman mosque in Aden. As a result, some of these youths adopted violence as a course. Moreover, the YAR advised them to follow peaceful means to find out the truth and handle the situation. Some of them heeded our call and returned to the path of righteousness. He said that Usamah Bin-Ladin [prominent Saudi businessman] has a group who follow him and carry out some terrorist acts. But some of them regained their senses and backed out of the acts they were supposed to commit. He clarified that the Islamic nation is torn between two cultures. The first is the culture of decline, which has distorted Islam. The second is the culture of colonialism, which casts doubts over Islam. This is why we all have to work on protecting the fierce onslaught against Islam. The member of the Presidential Council affirmed the absence of an armed wing in the YAR. He said the Yemeni people are armed anyway. However, we do not call for reform through weapons and killing, but through wisdom and sound advice. On acts of terrorism in Egypt and accusations that he supports them and harbors some of the Egyptian terrorist groups in Yemen, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zanadani said: I love Egypt and lived there for quite some time. This is why I cannot carry out terrorist acts against it. What harms our Egypt, harms us also. We wish it all the best. We are ready to fully cooperate with it to annihilate terrorism, which is hiding behind the veil of the true Islamic religion. He said that Yemen is too small to be a source for exporting terrorism to fraternal Egypt. Regarding the presence of a terrorist camp that he allegedly patronizes in the region of Sa'dah in the north supervised by Shaykh Muqbil, the Presidential Council member said that he does not order people to carry weapons; he fights violence and terrorism. We have recorded tapes of Shaykh Muqbil in which he condemns terrorism. He added: I informed Ambassador 'Ata' Harun, the ambassador from Egypt to Yemen, that we are ready to welcome the visit by any Egyptian official to the headquarters of Shaykh Muqbil in Sa'dah to learn about his school that teaches the Koran and the true religion and whose students are from various nationalities who wish to learn about Islam. It is not a camp for exporting terrorism. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zanadani concluded his speech: We do not approve the principle of change through force and the use of violence and terrorism. At the same time, we cannot allow Yemen to be a country from which Egypt is harmed.
