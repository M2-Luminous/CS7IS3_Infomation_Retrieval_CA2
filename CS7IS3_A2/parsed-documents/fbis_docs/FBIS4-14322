The sources linked the announcement of the high alert with the movement of protest demonstrations from the city of Medani in central Sudan to al-Husayhisah, Abu Haraz, Rufa'ah, al-Hilaliyah, and then al-Kamilin. Several Sudanese sources inside and outside the country said yesterday that demonstrations have reached the city of Atbara, the largest industrial city in Sudan. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT could not confirm reports that demonstrators burned down some railroad maintenance workshops in Atbara. Sudanese authorities fear the possibility of the demonstrations, staged to protest deteriorating living and economic conditions, moving to Khartoum, especially after what happened in al-Muradah district a few days ago and what happened in Omdurman a few weeks ago. In the context of the measures taken as a result of these developments and demonstrations, al-Jazirah University Director Mubarak 'Ali Majzub issued a decision dismissing 29 male and female students from the university, from which protest demonstrations were launched in Medani last week.
