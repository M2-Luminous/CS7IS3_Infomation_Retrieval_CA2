This voice, he declares, will not be stilled by bribery or character assassination, nor stifled by threats, from stating its legitimate demands to ensure that political freedom and best interests of the peace-loving people of Saudi Arabia are recognized. Al-Khalawi defected from being the first secretary at the Saudi mission to the United Nations in New York after writing a letter to heir apparent [Crown Prince] 'Abdallah last month stipulating his "sincere opposition" to the Riyadh government. He laid out that he opposed policies based upon family favoritism, corruption and the purposeful incitement of hatred among various social and sectarian groups, which he said, were to divide and weaken the social fabric of the Saudi people. In addition, he spoke against steps taken taken by the regime in the international arena that involved itself in "wars and enmities with Muslim countries, both Arab and non-Arab" and entering into nuclear arrangements without necessary legal guarantees. The former Saudi diplomat has since sought political asylum in the United States and made known his views to the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights in Saudi Arabia (CDLR), which moved its office to London in April this year. His defection is the first from a senior political figure and is seen as a coup for the committee, set up last year by a group of Saudi academics calling for moderate reforms to the autocratic rule of the royal family. In a letter to the CDLR, al-Khalawi suggested that he had been subjected to a kidnap attempt and a visit from Saudi intelligence since writing the letter. He said that he was first made an offer to buy his silence before threats were made to his life and those of his close family both in New York and in Saudi Arabia. The governor of Riyadh, Prince Salman, is also understood to have asked his relatives to bring him back from the U.S. or failing this, to stay in exile themselves. The former diplomat said he also has proof of the severe violations of human rights that have been going on in Saudi Arabia from almost 14,000 secret documents he collected while being first secretary at the United Nations for the past four years. His letter to the heir apparent set forth demands for the elimination of such wrongdoings, which he said he could no longer tolerate.
