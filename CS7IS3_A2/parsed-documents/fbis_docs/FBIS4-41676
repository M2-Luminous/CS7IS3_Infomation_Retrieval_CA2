He was speaking in reply to the opposition leaders' strong criticism of Russia's joining the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program. The Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signed the program in Brussels last Wednesday. The "Russia-NATO" protocol was adopted on the same day. "This is a serious, important step" Panov said. He believes that criticism expressed over the past few days was counterproductive, because it contained no alternative or any other proposals. "They (the opposition - IF) simply don't like it. Probably, this is inevitable when political struggle is afoot. But criticism must be well-founded. Otherwise it is just not serious at all," Panov said.
