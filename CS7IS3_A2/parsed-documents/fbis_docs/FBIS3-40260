Now you are implementing the program of military cooperation with NATO--the "Partnership for Peace." Has Poland's security been enhanced over the past three years, as Polish foreign policy has been reoriented toward the West? [Kolodziejczyk] Has it been enhanced in relation to which period? If we go back to the period of the Cold War, then I must say that, paradoxically, our security was greater because it was based on the parity of well-organized and fully controlled martial potentials. After the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, control over the nuclear arsenal became noticeably weaker and is still incomplete. In this context, the agreement on Ukrainian nuclear disarmament, which U.S. President Clinton managed to negotiate, should be treated as a step that enhances the security of Europe--and also the security of Poland. Now we can only hope that this agreement will be put into effect fairly soon. The present condition of our Army is so poor that, if we make the abstract assumption that Poland would have to wage a circular war [wojna okrezna], it would not allow us to ensure security to our country. That is certain. However, the issue of our sovereignty will not be decided in the military area; it will by decided by the economy. This does not mean that the Army would all of a sudden lose its importance. We are reforming it laboriously and, despite all of the financial problems, we seem to be closer to the goal that we have set. [Wagrowska] Has the turnaround toward the West, declared by politicians, been approved of by the military? [Kolodziejczyk] An obvious change has been made in the way we think about our security, first of all among the professional military cadres. The Army is not interested in being close to politics, maybe with a few exceptions. The image of the enemy was long and persistently created in the Army; however, it was not perpetuated so much as to have any effect today. This was probably because our Army "is satiated" with people with university degrees. I cannot say such good things about the issues of the organization of the Polish Army and the level of technology at its disposal. Unfortunately, the pace of change depends here on how much money we get, but not only on that.. Work on changing the legal foundations of the Army's functioning was only partially successful. The last two Sejms lacked the willingness to deal with these problems and to define what the civil Ministry of Defense should really be. Thus, the division of powers is still rather vague, and responsibility for issues of defense remains rather blurred. [Wagrowska] I gather that completing the legislative work is your first and foremost request for the present Sejm. [Kolodziejczyk] The Sejm must eventually adopt appropriate constitutional and legal provisions. It must define the scope of responsibilities of the president, as well as the instruments by which he could fulfill his duties efficiently. Therefore, the Ministry of National Defense [MON] suggests that the Security Council be given such prerogatives that could allow it to influence the government's activities in the area of defense. The prime minister, according to the Constitution, is also responsible for the state's security. MON believes that the government's representatives in the Security Council should form a Committee of Defense Affairs in the Council of Ministers, which, similar to the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers or the Social Affairs Committee, would deal with issues of state defense (not only the issues of the Armed Forces). The committee would submit concrete solution proposals to the Council of Ministers, which would accept them or not. However, the drafts of these solutions would have to pass an appropriate legislative path, or, if the powers of the government allow for this, they would be accepted directly by the Council of Ministers. Such an attitude, however, calls for prior amending of the Small Constitution, as well as amending of the Law on General Duty of Defense of the Republic. This law must very precisely divide powers between the civilian defense minister and the General Staff head (now I am using the present name because there are suggestions that he be called the inspector general or the commander in chief). This process is under way. Unfortunately, the talks between ministries in all issues are extremely lengthy, and they raised many doubts of a political rather than a substantive nature. [Wagrowska] When do you expect the legislation process to be complete? When do you plan to begin implementing reform in the Army? [Kolodziejczyk] I hoped that the prepared bills would be submitted in the Sejm as soon as January because the participants of the last session of the National Defense Committee expressed unanimous views on the issue of the bills. In the meantime, however, new problems cropped up, which I cannot understand at all. I am afraid that once again someone wants to cut down the legal regulations concerning the present state of affairs, as well as concerning certain politicians. [Wagrowska] Who exactly is blocking the reform? [Kolodziejczyk] I will not say that because I do not want to aggravate the situation. MON has prepared a detailed set of regulations that defines the rights and duties in the ministry; however, this time it was I who blocked its implementation--untill the most basic decisions that we talked about are made. [Wagrowska] However, the new command structures in the Polish Army depend on the Defense Ministry, but they are not functioning yet as well. [Kolodziejczyk] The work on correcting these structures is almost complete. Changes concerning the General Staff will be quite fundamental. In line with the new concept, the first soldier in the country--that is, the head of the General Staff--is supposed to bear the responsibility for training, combat readiness, and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces. He will have five deputies: for strategic-defense planning, ground forces, air forces, navy, and logistics. The General Staff will be decreased and will be, in the event of the greatest need, a center that coordinates the combat efforts of the various types of forces. The commander of the ground forces, which is the greatest novelty, will be the commander of corps-brigade structures, which, as I see it, are lighter and more mobile. In line with the previous strategic concepts, a military district became a self-dependent Army for the period of war. Poland had two Armies of the first group--made up of the Pomeranian district and the Silesian district--and one Army of the second group, formed on the basis of the Warsaw Military District. In line with today's doctrine of equal security of all borders, we have formed the Krakow district. This is the general concept; however, as it always happens, the devil is in the details, and our officers in the General Staff are just now driving this devil away. We are planning to complete the work in February. MON would like to be able to implement the reform of command structures as soon as possible. [Wagrowska] The importance of the Krakow Military District for state security has been discussed for some time now. However, somehow it just cannot be established. [Kolodziejczyk] As I have said, the Krakow Military District is subordinated to the strategy of ensuring equal security on all of the state's borders. Previously, both in the south and in the east, on the so-called eastern wall, Poland was almost completely "naked." This must be rectified; however, it can only be achieved at the cost of formations that were many years ago grouped in the western part of the country. The Krakow Military District is being established, even though it is being done very slowly; this is because we have too little money, chiefly for infrastructure, which is extremely costly. Being in a difficult financial situation, we decided to earmark all of the money that we had for the improvement of the technical condition of the Army. We could act this way because there is no danger of a sudden attack on our country; even in the event of any danger, we will undoubtedly have enough time to move the needed formations to the endangered region. Now, if we had wanted to distribute the money in a different way, if we had allocated a little for the infrastructure and a little for equipment, ages would have passed before we could achieve what we wanted. [Wagrowska] The generals that I have spoken with stress that we should gradually stop maintaining the ground forces and that they should be transformed into air-ground forces. Do you share these opinions? [Kolodziejczyk] Yes, I do because air-ground forces are more mobile and more efficient in combat; therefore, they would be better in warding off any attack. [Wagrowska] A few years ago, the assumption was made that 40 percent of the Armed Forces would stay in western Poland, 30 percent would be stationed in the central part, and another 30 percent would be in the east. How is the dislocation going? [Kolodziejczyk] I do not think that there is a chance to complete very soon the process of regrouping the Armed Forces from west to east, for the reasons that I have mentioned before. We are improving the positioning of soldiers by reducing garrisons in the western part of Poland. The idea of regrouping forces is the cause of alarm in the east. At this point, I would like to recall my recent talks with the Belarusian defense minister, who understands perfectly well that the shifting of our forces to the east is not supposed to pose any danger to his country. Politicians, however, sometimes use the issue of dislocation in their gamesmanship. I think that the fears of Ukraine and Belarus have been generated, among other things, by reprehensible negligence in the eastern policy of our country. Building a state's security, as I understand it, in today's European conditions should consist of maintaining as good relations with all neighboring states as possible; in close regional cooperation; in continental structures of security; and, finally, in disarmament. [Wagrowska] What does the issue of changing the armament of the Army look like? [Kolodziejczyk] Unfortunately, I regret to tell you that, over the past few years, the Army has not received anything new, except a modernized tank, which is called "hard" but which actually is still not hard. We are still far from the technologies that we should have. [Wagrowska] What, then, does the Polish Army need the most? [Kolodziejczyk] Fire systems and systems for controlling fire. Our scientists, to be sure, are close to building such systems, but we are not able to manufacture all of the components in Poland, or it simply does not pay to manufacture them all here. [Wagrowska] Dangers to our security may be caused mainly by local conflicts around the Polish borders. All the same, it is known that the radio-electronic reconnaissance systems, the most important element in warning of impending danger, leave a lot to be desired. It is not even able to distinguish an enemy aircraft from our own because practically all aircraft in the neighboring states were made in the Soviet Union. [Kolodziejczyk] All the same, the eastern wall is protected. To make the air surveillance system more efficient, we need at least 12 radio location stations with the "our-alien" reconnaissance systems. We are creating a new identification system. This issue is related to the problem of abandoning some frequencies, which has become well-known recently. We will not be able to abandon them until all of the location equipment in the planes and helicopters is replaced. The work on this, carried out jointly with "Thompson," will take from two to three years. [Wagrowska] What are your priorities as far as cooperation with NATO is concerned? What is it exactly that Poland needs from the West, from the point of view of the requirements of our security? [Kolodziejczyk] It is first of all technical and technological cooperation that allow us to take rational advantage of our scientific and production potential. So far, we have consistently been denied this help.
