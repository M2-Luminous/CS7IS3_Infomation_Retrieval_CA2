We asked Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement Chairman Vojtech Bugar for his opinion on the law. [Pankovcinova] Some Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and Slovak National Party [SNS] deputies labelled the law "anti-Slovak" and walked out of parliament as a sign of protest. Could you explain the gist of this law? [Bugar] They labelled as anti-Slovak articles 15 and 18, which state that, if someone wishes to have his first name entered in his mother tongue, the first change of the name in the register is free. Likewise, if a woman wants to have her surname entered in her documents in the mother tongue, without the suffix -ova [characterizing female surnames in Slovak], this law allows her to do so free of charge the first time. An amendment specifying the usage of the first name and the surname also passed in parliament. This means that the first name and the surname in the mother tongue (that is, without the suffix -ova) will be used in the spoken and written Slovak language with the ending -ova and will be inflected according to Slovak grammar rules. Therefore, it is absolutely okay when a Slovak speaker will refer to my wife as Mrs. Bugarova. She will only have the chance to have her surname entered in her identity papers as Bugar. [Pankovcinova] Are you satisfied with the adopted law? [Bugar] Yes. Parliament adopted a very liberal law and complied with the recommendation of the Council of Europe. The present and future governments will be able to appear at international forums with dignity because this law could serve as an example also for other states in which there are ethnic minorities.
