Two new reforms involve foreign investors, namely, the reform of the taxation system and the reform of the foreign exchange management system, Lu told a news conference. These reforms are beneficial to overseas investors because they are designed to adapt China to the global market, he explained. According to Lu, Guangdong's unique advantages in wooing overseas investors include a relatively developed market economy, a fast pace of reforms and preferential policies granted by the central authorities. "More importantly, Guangdong Province is near Hong Kong and Macao and is the ancestral home of millions of our Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan compatriots, overseas Chinese and foreigners of Chinese origin," he said. These advantages have enabled Guangdong to score rapid progress in its economic and trade cooperation with the rest of the world, he said. He cited the following facts to illustrate Guangdong's achievements: -- Guangdong's exports soared by 46 percent to 27 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, roughly 29 percent of China's total exports; -- Its imports shot up by 71 percent to 19.1 billion dollars, 20 percent of China's total imports; and -- It introduced 9.65 billion dollars in overseas funds last year, 40 percent of the country's total. To date, the province has brought in a total of 29.6 billion dollars in overseas funds, excluding the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station, Lu Ruihua said. He invited more overseas companies to invest in Guangdong in such areas as the power industry, ports, railways, roads, airports, automobiles, metallurgy, electronics, chemicals, new materials, biological engineering, farm and sideline products processing, export-led processing, and services.
