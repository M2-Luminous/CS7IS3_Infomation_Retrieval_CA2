Therefore, how a state or organization steals or protects secrets demonstrates its overall management ability. And it often serves as a key factor determining victory or defeat. In the Sixth Republic era, President No Tae-u and Kim Yong-sam, then chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], frequently waged such war against each other. The first confrontation came in about April 1990, shortly after the three-party merger. At the time, Pak Chol-on, then minister of state, who was wielding real power as President No's virtual alter ego, fired the first shot with his remark: "If I open my mouth ...." Kim Yong-sam responded by facing President No at Chongwadae over a Manila envelope he carried with him. Taking out a document from the envelope, he said to the president, "Such covert operations against me...! I might as well take to the streets and die at the hands of people, but not at your and your men's hands." The document he pulled out was a top-secret plan concerning a so-called operation to incapacitate YS [Kim Yong-sam], which President No had been briefed about by So Tong-kwon, director of the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP], a few days earlier and which he asked his chief secretary, No Chae-pong, to study. The president was so shocked that he sent for his physician following YS's departure. NSP Director So lost face with the president and No Chae-pong, the chief secretary, came under a secret NSP investigation. Chongwadae staff would recall that the incident made President No realize, with fear, YS's terrible destructive power for the first time. In another round, YS found himself the loser. In the summer of 1991, he went to Cheju, ostensibly on vacation. While there, he staged, in part openly, a demonstration demanding an early nomination by the president for him as the DLP's presidential candidate. President No had repeatedly cautioned YS to refrain from raising issues relating to a political agenda as the president still had 19 months to serve. And this defiance by YS infuriated the president. President No called in YS, who had just returned from Cheju, to show him a document--a list of campaign pledges prepared by a research institute run by YS' close aide. The list began with "I will thoroughly liquidate the military culture." "Do you think that you should be allowed to do things like this already?" President No demanded. The revelation enraged YS. He summoned the aide and told him to "get lost--to America or wherever." There was a time YS implicitly showed off his information gathering power to President No. In about September 1991, when Chongwadae and the NSP were unaware of opposition merger negotiations under way between Kim Tae-chung and Yi Ki-taek, the president heard for the first time what was going on from YS at one of their weekly meetings. The result was that the president took action against the NSP officials concerned, censuring them for the blunder. "No one knows better about Kim Tae-chung than I do," said YS to the president, with evident pride. Leaks of secrets in the Sixth Republic were so bad that people called the Administration a "water-like government." Former President Chon Tu-hwan, then in exile at Paektamsa, a Buddhist temple, was fully aware of visible and invisible pressures which Chongwadae and the NSP were then applying on him. A typical case was the "Lake Leman plan" designed to banish Mr. Chon overseas against his wishes to return to his Yonhuidong home. Upon discovering the plan, Mr. Chon, taking it as the last straw, phoned to President No protesting vehemently. He also kept a recording of the telephone conversation. Espionage war like this waged between the present and former state leaders shows how easily core secrets and information of the government can be leaked in a climate that mixes up public and private interests. At the same time, it raises concern over the fact that our state secrets are being utilized more as tool of internal power struggle than for national security, because the loophole can lead to leaks of national security secrets. Chongwadae is said to be extremely sensitive to security these days in the wake of a secret visit to Korea of James Woolsey, director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which was exposed by press photos. There was also a case of a Korean military officer on active duty leaking military secrets to a Japanese correspondent. In yet another case, information on a top-secret strategic process in the North-South dialogue was exposed by an opposition assemblyman. Chongwadae's concern over the continued divulgences is understandable. It is a matter of course that each nation has its secrets that, for the sake of protecting and preserving its security and interests, cannot be divulged to others. Especially in advanced countries, national security and diplomatic secrets, confidential internal memos and personnel regulations of administrative organizations, and business and personal secrets are strictly excluded from the objects of the freedom of information by law. At the same time, there are established criteria governing what are state secrets and who should protect them, as well as the balance of the freedom of information and that of speech. In comparison, Korea seems to have many problems with its management of state secrets, in principle and in ability. Deplorable indeed are abuses of such secrets for the mere convenience of the ruler, the slack discipline and the lack of ethical standards in this country, as seen in the Sixth Republic case of a Chongwadae senior presidential secretary for diplomatic and security affairs--a symbol of national security itself--who could easily seek asylum overseas. If the present civilian government can restore the control of state secrets to where it belongs by correcting the flaws and disorder of the Sixth Republic, and without curtailing the people's right to know, the accomplishment will by itself save the regime from criticism of "incompetency." It can be said that the teaching of Han Feizi that "plans succeed when secrets are kept, conspiracies fail when secrets leak" is a wise saying touching at the cardinal point of information control capability.
