He said: Lebanon's stance is clear; it demands implementation of Security Council Resolution 425 providing for Israeli withdrawal to the internationally recognized borders to enable the legitimate Lebanese Government to extend its sovereignty throughout Lebanon. He added: Lebanon will then obligate itself and pledge to exercise its responsibility as a government and undertake to keep law and order in the area from which Israel will withdraw. Buwayz said: We tell the Israelis that this resolution is independent of the Middle East dispute. He added: Let them acknowledge this principle and then we will be ready to form a joint military committee to prepare an agenda and take the necessary steps to implement security measures. Then, and in solidarity with the other Arab countries, Lebanon will make progress in the peace talks and may then recognize a state of comprehensive and final peace. Buwayz said: We offered to make progress in two stages: The first is a purely Lebanese stage through implementation of Resolution 425 and the second concerns progress on the regional level. He asked: What did Israel do? He said that Israel linked the Lebanese file with all the regional files, particularly the Syrian one. He noted that Israel is demanding that the Lebanese Government control the resistance as a precondition although it knows that this is impossible. Israel also knows that the resistance is a result, not a cause, of the occupation. The result cannot be eliminated before the cause is first removed. He said: Israel knows full well that this or any other Lebanese Government cannot give up the principle of resistance as long as it has no sure and definite guarantees to regain its territory. Thus, he said, Israel is setting out an impossible precondition whereas we pledge to establish peace and stability when Israel withdraws from the south. Moreover, Israel links its withdrawal with the signing of a comprehensive peace agreement. Israel knows that a comprehensive agreement requires the restoration of all Arab rights. Buwayz pointed out that Israel links the south Lebanon problem with the regional problem. This is not the first time Israel has done this. He said that Israel maintained the same attitude after the 17 May Agreement. After one and a half years of peace negotiations and after ending the negotiations, Israel links the result of all negotiations with Syrian approval and commitment to security in south Lebanon and even with the political part of the agreement. He said that Israel accuses us of linking our file with that of Syria. He said: It is Israel that links our file with Syria's. Israel accuses us of linking our file with the regional file although it is the party that does this. Buwayz noted that Israel maintains that it cannot make progress on one track while it has made no progress on the Palestinian track. Israel is deliberately prevaricating to foil this round in the hope of reaching particular agreements with the Palestinians. Discussing the multilateral negotiations and Lebanon's refusal to take part, Buwayz said: Lebanon maintains this stance because we are still determined and more convinced than ever that joining the multilateral talks is premature. We cannot join these talks before the bilateral talks make firm, tangible, and substantial progress. We insist on our position that participation in the multilateral talks is wrong. Lebanon was the first country to warn against joining the multilateral talks. He revealed that there is a regional-international plan to solve the problem of Palestinian refugees in the diaspora, a solution that provides for settling these refugees living in Syria, Egypt, and Jordan, where they are now, and for distributing the Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon.
