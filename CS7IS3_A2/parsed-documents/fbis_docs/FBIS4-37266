The latest of these were intensive efforts by Egypt and its president, Muhammad Husni Mubarak, to arrange a meeting between representatives of the two parts of Yemen in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, which should have been held today. However, since early this morning the forces of the ruling military regime in Sanaa have resumed their random shelling and rocketing of peaceful residential areas in the city of Aden to kill civilians -- women, children and the elderly -- and destroy their homes. This follows the failure on the part of these forces to realize their strategic military ambitions of occupying our territory and forcing our people in democratic Yemen to submit to the adventurist authority of Sanaa by force of arms. Also since this morning the forces of the ruling military regime have continued their attempts to advance towards Aden, but our defending Armed Forces repulsed them and prevented any advance by these enemy invading forces. Battles are continuing on all fronts following the refusal by the ruling military regime in Sanaa to listen to the voice of good sense and logic. Instead, it chooses to press on with its adventurist hostile operations against our people.
