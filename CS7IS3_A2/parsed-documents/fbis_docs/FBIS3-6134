The trial run made on several occasions covered the long distance from Mangyongdae District's Songsan to Sopyongyang Stations passing by Potonggang District's Kwangbok, Red and (Kyongun) Streets. All of the streetcar's operative functions and spare parts operated smoothly in accordance with the technological demand. The streetcar moved swiftly and this made the people happy. By upholding the party's intention of developing the country's transportation and freighting system, and providing safer and more comfortable transportation conditions, the workers of the Kim Chong-tae electric locomotive general enterprise highly manifested the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude to make a new type streetcar and underground electric railcar in just 70 days. They also successfully guaranteed the trial run of the streetcar and underground electric railcar. The streetcar was manufactured and completed safely in accordance with the topography of the capital and the passenger demand. According to the automatic operation of the streetcar, all the electric equipment and damping devices were operated smoothly from the first trial run. In particular, the efficiency of the starting apparatus, made by introducing the structural method of the electric circuit in accordance with our country's situation, was very good. This made it possible for the traction electric motor's starter to move freely, and firmly guaranteed its operation's reliability and safety. The underground electric railcar also had a successful trial run covering many blocks. All the elements including the traction part, electronic equipment, damping device, and buffer device operated normally. In the vigorous road of the overall march of socialism of our own style, our heroic working class magnificently produced a modern streetcar and underground electric railcar through their own strength, technology, and material, and successfully guaranteed the trial run. This has made the mass production of the vehicles possible to develop the country's transportation and freighting system. It is also of great significance because it provides safer and more comfortable transportation conditions and cultivated living conditions for the people. The streetcar and underground electric railcar, which will actively contribute to displaying the might of the country's self-dependent national economy and developing the capital's transportation and freighting, will soon go into mass production.
