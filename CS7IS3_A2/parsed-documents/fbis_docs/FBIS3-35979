His bodyguard swam after hotel property that had been thrown in a lake, while the Yugoslav businessmen organizing and paying for the trip by the deputy's team smashed glasses at supper in classic Russian style. The Slovene Internal Affairs Ministry ordered him to leave the republic, probably in response to the statement that not "every small place can call itself a state" (Slovenia is a small country even by European standards). Zhirinovskiy went from Slovenia to Belgrade, managing en route, in Budapest, not only to explain to flabbergasted Hungarians that they had no prospects, that no one wanted their "Ikarusz" buses and apples because they had plenty of their own, but also to indicate a way out of the situation. According to the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader, it is to galvanize the ideas of CEMA and the Warsaw Pact and create a zone of East European cooperation. In the capital of Serbia and Yugoslavia the visitor was greeted with tumultuous applause in a hall which was packed with many more admirers than journalists invited to the press conference. Zhirinovskiy said that he had told Chernomyrdin that he would not rest as long as Kozyrev was a minister: "My task is to remove him from the Russian government." Belgrade's next guest or, to be more precise, the guest of the local orthodox neocommunists, will be Gennadiy Zyuganov, in Febrary. "I come here as a victor, as chairman of the party that gained three times as many votes as those who are are now governing Russia," Zhirinovskiy said. "I want to warn the Western countries' governments that to bomb any cities in Bosnia will be to declare war on Russia.... Let them not forget that there are still Russian forces in Europe and they could remain there for a long time." This is exactly what the conflict participants are seeking to achieve in the Balkans -- to involve the powerful of this world in the bloody internecine strife. The Serbs are trying to involve the Russians, the Muslims are trying to involve the Islamic world, and the Croats are trying to involve the West. Zhirinovskiy said he was against East European states joining NATO: "If they want to clean the boots of the Germans, British, and French, let them join." Russia will not do so. And as soon as it has a new president, his party will create a Union of Slavic States. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's words meet with a warm response in the hearts of a section of Yugoslav society. After all, he is promising the victims of sanctions and war what they want: The lifting of sanctions and victory both over economic problems and on the battlefield. When Zhirinovskiy finally wins, Russia will defend its Orthodox brothers. There are others who think differently. Like, for example, the BORBA newspaper commentator voicing the opinion of the Serbian democratic opposition: "We should be more concerned about the support for Zhirinovskiy than about Kozyrev's refusal to adopt a `pro-Serbian stance'.... Serbia and Yugoslavia are certainly in a very difficult situation. But it is equally difficult to imagine that anyone would vote for the destruction of Russia and the whole world for the sake of our salvation."
