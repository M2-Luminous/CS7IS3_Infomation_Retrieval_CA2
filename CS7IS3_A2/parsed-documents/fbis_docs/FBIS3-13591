The Democratic President has decided to woo big business away from the traditional Republican camp by acquiring the legal power to wage trade retaliation on its behalf. The immediate objective is to bring Japan to heel. But judging by the clarification issued by the administration that the intention is to issue a "symbolic rather than a real threat", Washington is in no hurry to risk a trade war with a nation that can say no. It is clear that given the prevailing mood in Japan, where the Morihiro Hosokawa Government is under severe political pressure to stand its ground, the outrageous American demand for handing over a predetermined share of the domestic market, will have to be toned down. Even so, the "symbolic threat" is significant. It seeks to pin down Japan to bilateral trade negotiations, and abjure redressal from the multilateral GATT dispute settlement mechanism. In a unipolar world, not just Japan, no nation dare demur: Washington has clarified that Super 30l has not been revived for trade retaliation against any one country which means it can be directed against any country the US chooses to. The lone voice of protest against Clinton's megalomania has come from Peter Sutherland, the director-general of GATT. But he has phlegmatically pointed merely to the "risk" to multilateralism when actually it is being aborted. True, the powerful European Commission is opposed to bilateralism. But Brussels wants trilateralism. This means carving the Japanese market between Europe and the US. Why, for instance, should Motorola Inc. of US alone get the whole of the foreign share of the telecommunications market of Japan? What about Ericsson of Sweden? Europe is riding piggyback on the US. Japan is asked to make its telecommunications technology compatible with those the US and European companies have developed, including some nearing obsolescence. But no one talks of America and Europe making their technologies compatible with Japanese ones. Compatibility has a cost: who should bear it, the exporter, wanting a market, or the importer? The American-European gang-up is ominous for countries like India. In December last year, the developing countries fell in line with the iniquitous Dunkel draft in order to ensure multilateralism and free trade. In less than three months, the rich countries are racing to carve up the world in a manner reminiscent of the colonial powers of the 19th century. What is on is not merely a war among the giants. The US is having second thoughts on the 10-year MFA [multi-fiber agreement] agreement on textiles. It proposes to auction import quotas for textiles (from India and others) to American firms. This is nothing short of an import duty on textiles. With GATT in hibernation, bully Clinton is unstoppable.
