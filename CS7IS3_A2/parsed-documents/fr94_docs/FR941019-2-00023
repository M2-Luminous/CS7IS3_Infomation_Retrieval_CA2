B. Purpose of the Guidelines and Design Principles The final guidelines and supporting materials have been developed to reflect the goal of maximizing participation without compromising the usefulness of the data voluntarily submitted. Commenters on the draft guidelines generally supported the appropriateness of this goal, although some did not agree on how to strike a balance between maximizing participation and establishing a meaningful data reporting system. The flexibility provided by the draft guidelines, which takes into account the reporter's ability to use existing information and select appropriate quantification methods, was supported by many commenters as necessary to encourage participation. However, some comments from environmental public interest groups and forestry public interest groups urged that the final guidelines include requirements for verification of emissions reductions and carbon sequestration data. These commenters believe that the flexibility provided by the program made data verification essential to the credibility of the information entered into the database. Many of these comments acknowledged that the statute directed neither DOE nor reporters to obtain verification of data reported, but suggested that third party verification could provide users of the database with better assurances of its accuracy. Some of these commenters indicated that, in the alternative, the program should direct reporters to indicate the basis for the data submitted based on a categorization system, and that the database should be designed to allow sorting of data on the basis of this categorization. For example, a report would indicate that data was based on measurement, estimation, or use of default tables, and whether emissions reductions project reports were accompanied by historic or entity-wide emissions data. A database user would be able to retrieve reported data on the basis of these categories. In order to provide the flexibility necessary to encourage reporting, the guidelines do not provide prescriptive features such as verification. Rather, the guidelines indicate that a reporter will be asked to categorize the data submitted. This categorization will include third party verification as well as whether the data was measured or estimated. Segregation of data by categories will be possible. DOE believes the approach of requesting the identification of data derivation, and of any data verification performed, accommodates both the need to maximize participation by providing flexibility, and the need to create a useful and accessible database. C. Changes to Draft Guidelines for Final Guidelines After reviewing the comments received, DOE revised several provisions of the draft general guidelines and some provisions of the sector-specific supporting documents. The changes to the draft guidelines include: the addition of gases to the list of those reportable under the program, with delayed implementation for some of those gases not covered in the draft guidelines; a limitation on reporting project activities to those that achieved new emission reductions or carbon sequestration beginning with January 1, 1991; revision of the discussions about distinctions between primary and secondary effects, and between direct and indirect emissions; and guidance on amending a previous year's report.
