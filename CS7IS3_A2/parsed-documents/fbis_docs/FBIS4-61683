Along with this, Ukraine would be allowed to export farm produce to the European marketplace. It would use part of the profits to purchase pesticides. Brittan met with the Ukrainian leaders on 5 May. The Ukrainian Government requested him to drop Ukraine from the C List of nations with government-controled economies. The European Union placed restrictions on imports from the countries of the C List. According to Brittan, the European Union would be willing to help Ukraine in the field of power production and encourage free enterprise in that republic. But, he said, Ukraine would be taken off the C List only if it made progress on the road for economic liberalization and, more specifically, privatization. More reform in Ukraine would enable the European Union to speed up moves to lift the anti-dumping restrictions. Brittan wanted to know when Ukraine was going to pay off the European Union's 4.5 Mn ECU loan. Ukrainian Finance Minister Grigoriy Piatachenko said Kiev would square its debt with the European Union by mid-May or before the European Union's Commission sat down to decide whether to render more aid to Ukraine.
