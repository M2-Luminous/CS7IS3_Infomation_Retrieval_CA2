Minimum wage will thus grow from 14,620 to 20,500 roubles. The same indexation coefficient will be applied to the recalculation of wages in the budget-supported branches of the economy. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reports a statement by Russian Vice-Premier Yuriy Yarov that mass unemployment in the country threatens with such a social outburst in comparison with which "the consequences of hyperinflation would pale into insignificance". If ways to resolve the problem are not found now, "the situation will run out of control soon," he maintains. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA carries a series of articles about a Bogychany hydropower station which has been under construction on Angara River since 1976. It follows from an article by First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets that the hydropower station will be a highly effective one because it will operate at the place of the Angara discharge regulated by Lake Baykal and Bratsk man-made lake and will make it possible to effect a saving of more than 5.5 tonnes of scarce organic fuel every year. It is essential to take all measures to bring the station into operation in 1997, Soskovets writes. TRUD runs an article by Sergey Tsvetkov, chairman of the ecological commission of the writers' union of St. Petersburg, who urges a cancellation of the Russian governemnt instruction to build transportation technology facilities in the gulf of Finland. Tsvetkov maintains that an expert conlusion simply baffles one with contradictions. "Of course, the development of Russia is impossible without harbours, but at what price will they be created? And who can prove what will be cheaper -- to transport goods via the Baltics or our own ports?" the article points out. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) points out the need to complete the construction of a nuclear-powered guided missle cruiser Peter the Great. "We need the Peter the Great cruiser to speak to the United States, which regards its Navy as `the only one dominating the world ocean', on a par, and to prevent a final collapse of the Russian Federation's shipbuilding industry. The cruiser should be commissioned without fail by the tercentenary of the Russian Navy," the newspaper emphasises. The press highlights South Korean President Kim Young-Sam's visit to Moscow. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reports the visit under the headlines "The Kremlin Is Prepared To Support Sanctions Against the DPRK" and "Russia Needs a United and Non-Nuclear Korea". Touching upon President Boris Yeltsin's meeting with his South Korean counterpart, the newspaper writes: "The fact that Seoul needed such a meeting not less but even more than Moscow was confired by the two presidents' talks and by the ensuing joint press conference in the Kremlin. South Korea in principle received what it wanted from Russia. Notwithstanding tentative reservations, Boris Nikolayevich in the end uttered the word `sanctions' (against North Korea)". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Yevgeniy Kozhokin, director of the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, who calls for refraining from intellectual extremism. Pointing out that the task of the institute is to participate in the elaboration of Russia's national security concept, Kozhokin examines whether it is worthwhile for Russia to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, "it seems to me that we shall be able to uphold our national interests more effectively by accepting, not rejecting, this partnership". PRAVDA runs an article by Viktor Veshnyakov, a deputy to the State Duma, who opposes Russia's joining NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. This kind of ideas, he believes, "erode the collective security treaty which CIS countries concluded in 1992". Veshnyakov favours the establishment of an effective defence union within the CIS framework as "the military basis of a Euro-Asian collective security system". He calls for Russia to hold arms reduction talks with NATO precisely from these positions. PRAVDA carries an article by Gennadiy Zyuganov, a State Duma member and chairaman of the central executive committee of the Russian Communist Party, who urges "the restoration of genuine government by the people as represented by a single system of councils of people's deputies". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, referring to information from a general staff officer, reports the existence of "a huge underground town near Moscow, with several thousand civilians and military people working there every day -- state security, interior ministry, and army people. The subterranean town is tens of meters below ground, sometimes to a depth equalling to a 10-15 storey building sometimes. If necessary it is possible to get by special trains to practically any point of the capital."
