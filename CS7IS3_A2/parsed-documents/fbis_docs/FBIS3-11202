Ruben Blades, Papa Egoro Party presidential candidate, met with Colon Free Zone businessmen and merchants to exchange ideas and hear suggestions on the future of that free zone. Blades proposed holding a referendum in October for a Constituent Assembly to reform the current Constitution which he said is not fitting for the nation's future and much less for the 21st century. (Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 11 Mar 94) Blades, during a debate organized by the Panamanian Ecumenical Committee on 14 March, proposed "a moratorium on the payment of the foreign debt in order to give a solution to the serious social problems that the vast majority are experiencing." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 16 Mar p 1) Ruben Dario Carles, "Change 94" ticket presidential candidate and former comptroller general, said during a debate organized by the Panamanian Ecumenical Committee on 14 March that he "had nothing to do with the foreign debt" payment to international financial institutions. Carles' remarks that the U.S. operation in Panama had not been an "invasion," rather a "liberation," was rejected by other party members and sympathizers while he called the audience present at the debate "ignorant" on these two issues: the foreign debt and the U.S. invasion. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 16 Mar p 1) Carles on 14 March visited San Miguelito District where he heard expressions of general discontent from the residents. Carles has stepped up his political campaign not only in the capital but also in the countryside. On his visit last week to Veraguas Province, he said: "I had the opportunity to reiterate what I had said was a fundamental matter in that sector: a reforestation program as well as the development of a tourist site on Montijo Gulf." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 14 Mar 94) Carles reiterated on 15 March in San Miguelito District that he will solve the public services problems in 100 days. "I have been able to confirm that the basic problem of these urban and suburban areas is the lack of jobs -- which we will generate -- and the deficiency in public services. In the first 100 days of my administration these will be improved," Carles noted. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 15 Mar 94) Samuel Lewis Galindo, National Consensus Alliance presidential candidate, called for nonviolence in the campaign. "The presidential candidates and the party leaders favor that the political campaign be conducted within certain levels and certain bounds so violent passions are not unleashed. I am certain that this is the position of the seven presidential candidates. It goes without saying that there are small groups that commit censurable actions, however there is still time to halt them," Lewis Galindo noted. (Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 11 Mar 94) Lewis Galindo went on the campaign trail to diverse towns in Cocle Province, taking the message of change to the residents. He also visited some residential areas of El Cristo where he was warmly received. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 14 Mar 94) Lewis Galindo said Panama currently has a foreign debt larger than the one it had on 20 December 1989. Lewis Galindo added that the current negotiators of that debt do not want to recognize their responsibilities and the errors they made and that there is no such Economic Plan. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 16 Mar p 1) Lewis Galindo, while visiting residents in the poor Boca La Caja neighborhood, promised to make an all-out effort during his administration to generate jobs and improve living conditions. "In these poor neighborhoods we want to create an emergency plan that will give jobs to 50,000 Panamanians, to improve -- in these same neighborhoods -- the social conditions of so many people," Lewis Galindo said. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 10 Mar 94) Mireya Gruber, Arnulfist Party, PA, presidential candidate, said she was not able yesterday to attend the renewal of the electoral ethical commitment because she was on the campaign trail. "I arrived at home at 2300, and this is why I did not attend. However, our candidates did," Mireya Gruber noted. "We will respect our commitment." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 10 Mar 94) PA party members held a Democratic Alliance dinner in favor of the 8 May elections and in honor of candidate Mireya Gruber. PA and Liberal Party personalities attended the dinner led by Mireya Gruber. During her speech Gruber made reference to diverse points of her government platform; among these employment, sports, and housing. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Mar 94) Gruber over the weekend participated in a three-day tour of Chiriqui Province, reaffirming her promise to keep in touch with the people. Our government will be for all Panamanians, said Mireya Gruber, indicating that health, education, employment, and housing problems will have top priority in her administration. Gruber also urged the younger generation to stay away from drugs. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 14 Mar 94) Gruber said she will file formal charges against the PRD with the Justice and Peace Commission for attacking her in Chiriqui. The PRD publicly rejected the attack by one of its party members. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 15 Mar 94) Ernesto Perez Balladares, Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, presidential candidate, announced yesterday during a Rotary Club meeting possible changes to the Labor Code, should he win the coming elections. He urged the United States to make clear whether it has any intention of keeping a military presence in Panama after the year 2000. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 16 Mar p 1) Eduardo Vallarino, Christian Democratic Party, PDC, presidential candidate, said during a debate organized by the Panamanian Ecumenical Committee on 14 March that one of his government program's top priorities is "to postpone payment of the foreign debt."
