FBIS4-10125 "drlat067_l_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 Bolivia Paz's Secretary Claims U.S. Plotting Against MIR Paz's Secretary Claims U.S. Plotting Against MIR PY0604220294 Madrid EFE in Spanish 0245 GMT 6 Apr 94 PY0604220294 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Excerpts] La Paz, 5 Apr (EFE) -- Susana Seleme, who was the private secretary of former President Jaime Paz Zamora, today said she was a "victim of the good faith errors" by the former president. Seleme said this while being questioned by a congressional commission investigating the former government's alleged links with drug trafficking. [passage omitted] Seleme is among the group of militants of Paz Zamora's party, the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), charged with being involved with traffickers following a police investigation prompted by statements by trafficker Carmelo Dominguez, aka Meco. The Bolivian Police investigation is centered on Paz Zamora's friendship with alleged drug trafficker Isaac Chavarria, aka Oso. Seleme is charged with having protected alleged trafficker Edgar Fernandez Lezcano -- who regarded as Chavarrias' aide -- and of having accepted money from Chavarrias to finance the MIR. Paz Zamora's former secretary today denied having had a personal relationship with any of these individuals. She admitted, however, having spoken over the phone to Meco Dominguez once and with Chavarrias on several occasions when they unsuccessfully tried to contact, through her, Paz Zamora when he was president. Seleme admitted that Paz Zamora and his family had a long-standing friendship with Chavarrias. She added that she thought Paz Zamora believed that the person who is now regarded as a trafficker was involved in strictly legal deals. Seleme took advantage of the occasion to say that she believes the struggle against trafficking in Bolivia is a violation of human rights. She recalled an attempt to abduct her a few weeks ago, apparently by police who mistakenly abducted her niece whom they interrogated for several hours. She spoke of the charges, also being investigated by Congress, by several inmates charged with trafficking who said they had been brutally tortured in "clandestine strongholds" by alleged Bolivian and foreign police agents. Seleme said the charges linking the MIR with trafficking are part of a "sinister plan" organized by "the first world power and its representation in Bolivia," referring to the United States and its embassy in La Paz. "I deeply admire Bill Clinton (U.S. President) and (his wife) Hilary Clinton, but I do not think human rights should be violated to fight trafficking," said Seleme. She added: "I am not a delinquent. I am willing to shoot myself to prove I am innocent." She also voiced her conviction that her party colleagues are also innocent.
