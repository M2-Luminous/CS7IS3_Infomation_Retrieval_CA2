A grenade exploded in front of a police station at Pietrodicerce, and a powerful bomb went off outside the Solenzara military base near Bastia. This is the first time the bombers manage to get within the perimeter fence, which is surrounded by barbed wire and watchtowers. Christophe Lurie reports from Bastia: [Lurie] The bomb was placed within the perimeter of the Solenzara military base, an hour's drive from Bastia. The explosion, which took place at 0300 this morning, caused significant damage to the office of the commander of the air base. Colonel Jackie Cognet had already been the target of a previous attack. On Friday [15 April] night, a grenade was thrown at his home from a vehicle, but did not caused any damage. These two attacks could be linked to tomorrow's visit to Corsica by Defense Minister Francois Leotard, who will be in Ajaccio to present the results achieved over the past year by the Balladur Government.
