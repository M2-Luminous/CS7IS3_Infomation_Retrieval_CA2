However, what is happening now is an overall drop in the value of the dollar against all major currencies, rather than an appreciation of the yen. Compared to 4 May, when more than 10 central banks of the advanced nations engaged in coordinated intervention in the foreign exchange market, the situation is somewhat different. First, the monetary authorities of the major powers did not engage in coordinated intervention in the exchange market on 21 June. The fact that the Bank of Japan [BOJ] went into vigorous dollar buying in the Tokyo market the next day, 22 June, indicates that Japan apparently wants to have coordinated intevention. The reason why this did not materialize could be either problems about the effectiveness or technicalities of intervention, or the monetary authorities of the United States and Europe could not reach a consensus. Second, the economic condition in Europe has improved considerably, and Japan is seeing signs of an economic recovery. Such circumstances may have affected policy coordination among Japan, the United States, and Europe. What triggered off the Black Monday (stock prices crash) in October 1987 was the conflict of interests between the monetary authorities of the United States and (then) West Germany. Coordination among the advanced nations is indispensable for the stability of the currencies. This historical lesson should be recalled at this time. On the contrary, it is possible that the U.S. monetary authorities may ask Japan to lower its official discount rate in the name of policy coordination to defend the dollar and stop yen appreciation. Behind the massive selling of the dollar are apprehensions about inflation, as well as the relatively low interest rates in the United States. There is a strong possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board (FRB) may raise the official discount rate to defend the dollar, and Japan will be called upon to cut interest rates together with the United States. This would be a pattern identical to that during the coordinated lowering of interest rates in March 1986. What we want the Ministry of Finance and the BOJ to do is to be very careful about coordinated lowering of interest rates. We must not allow a repeat of the bubble economy. A mistaken policy option in the name of coordination with the United States is unacceptable. In that sense, there is no need to overly fear the depreciation of the dollar and appreciation of the yen. There has been a sharp rise [as published] in crude oil prices, which are quoted in dollars, as a result of dollar depreciation. Concerns about imported inflation in the future cannot be totally discounted. In such a case, yen appreciation serves to shut off imported inflation. There should be further efforts to narrow the gap between domestic and overseas prices to pursue benefits arising from yen appreciation. On the other hand, there is an opinion that since the real interest rates in Japan are still relatively high, there is still room for further lowering of the official discount rate. In the decisionmaking process, the most important thing is to accurately gauge the economic conditions in Japan and the United States. Compared to last year, when Japan was weakened by the damage of yen appreciation, present Japanese economic condition has more vitality. However, in terms of the prevailing economic conditions, it is too early to lower the official discount rate. Is the U.S. economic condition really sturdy? We see partly cloudy skies. If the perception of the Japanese and U.S. economies changes, there will be correponding changes in the exchange rates. Exchange rates will probably be a major issue at the Naples summit (meeting of leaders of advanced nations) to be held in Italy in July. Along with efforts to reduce current accounts surplus by expanding domestic demand and opening up the market, Japan may be asked to lower interest rates. The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have resumed, but it remains uncertain whether an acceptable conclusion can be reached before the summit. The United States remains discontented with Japan's tax reform. However, monetary policy should never be used as a tool of compromise.
