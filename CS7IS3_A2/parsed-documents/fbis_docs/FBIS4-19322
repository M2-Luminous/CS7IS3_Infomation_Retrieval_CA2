Even if a decision by the Constitutional Court should allow the participation of the Bundeswehr in armed blue beret missions, as it is generally expected to do, German soldiers would not be deployed in the former Yugoslavia, Kinkel told DPA today. The participation of Bundeswehr soldiers would have to be approved in every individual case by the Bundestag, the foreign minister stressed. An approval by the Bundestag for an armed or even unarmed German mission in the former Yugoslavia is certainly not to be expected. Thus, this problem is not topical. Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union) expressed a similar view at the end of last week. "In this part of Europe, the memory of World War II is particularly present. Thus, one must ask oneself the question whether German help -- no matter what kind -- is welcome at all," the chancellor stated in an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG. The chairman of the Bundestag group of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, Wolfgang Schaeuble, basically advocated participation in military operations in Bosnia in an interview with the Cologne EXPRESS (Saturday edition). However, this is only possible "if all those affected agree."
