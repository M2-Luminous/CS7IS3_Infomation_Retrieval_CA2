FR940802-0-00069 FR940802-0-00012 431.107. 433.68, and 433.74. 434.27 and 434.28. 441.351, 441.352, 441.353, 441,356, and 441.365. 442.505. 447.253, 447.272, and 447.299. 483.10, 483.410, 483.420, 483.440, 483.460, and 483.470. 484.10, 484.12, 484.14, 484.36, and 484.52. (See note below) 493.614, 493.633, and 493.634. 494.52, 494.54, 494.56. 494.58, and 494.64. In addition, we are deleting from the table §§405.1221 and 405.1229, which were approved under OMB control number 0938&hyph;0365. ( Note: On August 14, 1989 (54 FR 33367), §405.1221 was redesignated as §484.12, and §405.1229 was redesignated as §484.52. The approved information collections for the redesignated sections are already included in the table.) For the convenience to the reader the entire updated table is being presented in this final rule. III. Regulatory Impact Statement We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. As noted above, this regulation is technical in nature and merely updates the display of currently valid control numbers assigned by the Office of Management and Budget to collections of information contained in HCFA regulations. Therefore, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and will not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Accordingly, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act. IV. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking and Delay in Effective Date We ordinarily publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register , and invite prior public comment on the proposed rule. The proposed rule includes a reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed, and the terms of substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved. In addition, section 1871 of the Social Security Act (the Act) generally requires a 60-day public comment period. However, this procedure can be waived when an agency finds good cause that a notice-and-comment procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and incorporates a statement of the finding and its reasons in the rule issued. We routinely publish a notice in the Federal Register when an information collection requirement clearance request that is identified in a rule or notice is submitted to OMB and the public is offered an opportunity to comment. This regulation is technical in nature and merely updates the display of OMB-assigned control numbers of approved collection of information requirements contained in HCFA regulations text. Therefore, it would be redundant and provide an unnecessary delay to solicit comments on this display of the approved OMB control numbers. For the above reasons, we find good cause to waive both proposed notice and comment rulemaking procedure and a delay in the effective date as impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. Under these circumstances publication of the correct up-to-date rules without further delay best serves those governed by these regulations.
