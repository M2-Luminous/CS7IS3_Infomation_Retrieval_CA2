Etienne Reuter, head of the Hong Kong office of the European Union (EU), told the Financial Review that the December review would only look into a modification of the scheme, which would probably be reimposed next year. This was certain unless a strong lobby "provoked" a review for its removal, Mr Reuter said. The quota scheme was nothing new... it merely simplified similar schemes imposed by countries in the EU, he said. EU members had imposed 4,700 notional restrictions on imported goods which were simplified into the quota scheme. Items covered under the quota scheme are toys, footwear, gloves, porcelain kitchen and tableware, ceramic kitchen and tableware, glassware and radios. The imposition of the scheme brought howls of protests from Hong Kong manufacturers. Many have based their operations in China. Meanwhile, Luis Larroque, executive vice-president of the Spanish Foreign Trade Institute, said Spain had opposed the quota scheme and was supporting limited barriers against Chinese goods. However, the quota scheme was "provisional only" and would be lifted when "some part of the EU industries have adjusted to the world market", Mr Larroque said. Mr Reuter also gave an assurance that the 20 China-made products placed under surveillance for possible import quotas would not mean the EU would necessarily restrict these products soon. "They are just being monitored and there are no indications that trade (of these goods) will be restricted," he said. Trade groups in Hong Kong and the EU are protesting against the imposition of the quota scheme and have petitioned the Chinese government to push for its removal. The quotas would mean substantial cuts in their export receipts, which could reach more than $3 billion by year's end, local groups said. Europe's Foreign Trade Association (FTA) -- which groups big importers of Chinese consumer goods, including department stores -- have written to the Chinese government. These groups want the import restrictions to be delayed at least until next year because orders have already been placed with firms in China. Local and EU trade groups have also complained that the quota scheme was complicated and will result in uncertainties in the planning of purchases. Other groups complained that the scheme would increase bureaucracy and thus add to operating costs.
