He said that today there are no countries which have territorial claims to Ukraine, as was made by the Russian parliament. The speaker believes that the territorial claims could be associated with the election of Yuriy Meshkov as the Crimean president. However, he said, now Russian-Ukrainian relations have no grounds for fears. Plyushch has described as artificial the problem of Ukrainian debts to Russia. He believes the problem is blown up by pro-imperial forces in Russia who rely on a strong propaganda machine. Plyushch believes that Russia could place some of its debts as legal successor of the Soviet Union on Ukraine. In addition, not only the Black Sea Fleet, but the entire former Soviet navy should be divided, he said. Plyushch said that following the trilateral statement on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, the United States promised to set aside for the republic some $500 million for dismantling nuclear weapons.
