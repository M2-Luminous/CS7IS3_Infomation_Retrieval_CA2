During the past few days, Washington has, once again, brought serious crisis to the Korean peninsula through its provocative acts such as the announcement of stationing Patriot missiles in South Korea and deciding to resume its joint maneuvers with North Korea. [passage omitted] Paying attention to the current situation in the east Asia region and the Pacific Ocean makes it clear that the American policy aimed at creating tension in the Korean peninsula is intended as a long-term measure. The east Asia region is the focus of attention of the big powers, such as America, because it seems that that region would play a more significant role in international developments in the future. Particularly that the Pacific Ocean region has, during the past few years, turned into an international focal point, and the rate of growth in some of the countries of the region, such as China, has reached a level that is currently unachievable by advanced industrial countries. It is clear that the continuation of such a trend, which is achieved through the continuation of efforts to maintain stability in the region, would force America to withdraw its 6,000-strong force from the Korean peninsula, which would mean losing its economic or military control of the region. That is an issue which, according to the White House politicians, contradicts the American strategy.
