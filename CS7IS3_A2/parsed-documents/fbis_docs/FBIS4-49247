After an official inspection of the area, which aims to lift local farmers from poverty and improve the environment, a committee of experts from the WFP's Beijing office said they were quite satisfied with the preparation work and ensured the Chinese side that they could find no reason to delay the project. As one of China's largest overseas aid projects in the past few years, the five-year project will involve aid in wheat worth 13 million U.S. dollars from the WFP and 22.86 million yuan (about 2.5 million U.S. dollars) in investment from China's central and local governments. The aid will be used for five major agriculture, forestry and water-conservancy projects in the three mountainous counties of Guyuan, Longde and Pengyan, located in the south of the region. The project includes the construction of a group of reservoirs, wells, and technology centers to improve irrigation and transportation, and train technicians, especially women. The illiteracy rate in the area is expected to drop from the existing 36.3 percent to 18.7 percent, provincial officials said. When the project is completed in five years' time soil erosion will have been brought under control and water resources will have been protected, which is expected to double the output value and rescue 175,000 people from poverty, they said.
