FBIS4-29679 "dreas119__a94006" FBIS-EAS-94-119-A Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Reports on U.S. Air Base Issues in Okinawa Reports on U.S. Air Base Issues in Okinawa U.S. Forces Training OW1706091294 Naha OKINAWA TIMES in Japanese 17 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 23 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1706091294 Naha OKINAWA TIMES Japanese BFN [Text] Kin -- Over burdened with military exercises that U.S. Forces in Okinawa have frequently conducted near residential areas, residents in Igei District, Kin Town, set up signs reading saying "All Military Vehicles Are Prohibited From Using This Road" in two locations on 16 June. In this way, the residents clearly manifested their objection to the passage of U.S. military vehicles through their district. Igei District is located near a Camp Hansen training ground and U.S. Forces have intensified guerrilla warfare training in Range-5F (jungle warfare) since late May; Range-5F is located near a reservoir forest. A growing number of U.S. military vehicles have passed through the district to the range. Igei District chief Masafumi Ikehara said: "Setting up those sings is our inevitable response to protect our children's educational climate and the lives of our residents." Igei District villages are hundreds meters away from Range-5F. During live-firing training, rounds land near the reservoir forest, which is a source of water for the residents. According to a resident, U.S. troops fire their automatic rifles, mortars, and other heavy weapons during their training, and the sounds are audible. Tsuneo Nakama, chairman of the Igei District Administrative Committee, has said: "It is highly possible that fire caused by the training could burn the reservoir forest and there is a fear of stray bullets." On 3 June, the committee adopted a resolution demanding that the live-firing exercise be halted, Range-5F be removed, and the passage of U.S. military vehicles through the district be prohibited. The committee has asked Kin Town and the Okinawa Prefectural Government to make the same demand, but training still continues unabated in Range-5F and the number of U.S. military vehicles passing through the district is growing. U.S. military vehicles pass through residential areas in accordance with "the Japan-U.S. Status of Force Agreement [SOFA]." American troops and military vehicles freely pass over almost all roads in Okinawa in the name of "their movement between military installations." Masafumi Ikehara has vented his anger over damage inflicted by U.S. military bases, saying: "No matter SOFA, it is ridiculous that U.S. Forces in Okinawa are threatening the lives of our residents without listening to their opinions. U.S. Forces in Okinawa have continued to cause accidents in Igei District during their training and our district is like a battlefield. We can no longer tolerate the frequent passage of U.S. military vehicles through our district." Each of the two signs, measuring 1.8 meter in height and 0.9 meter in width, was set up at a farm road near Range-5F and at the entrance to the town road in the village. The two signs read in English, "Any Military Vehicles Are Prohibited To Go Through This Road." Igei District, that put up the two signs, plans to stringently check the passage of U.S. military vehicles through the district and check on training by U.S. Forces in Okinawa.
