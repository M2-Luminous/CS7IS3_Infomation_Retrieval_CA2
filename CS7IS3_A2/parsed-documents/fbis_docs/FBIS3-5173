Speaking to reporters shortly before his departure, Squadron Leader Prasong expressed confidence that the Philippines would have no objections to the idea of inviting Burma to the meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers in Bangkok in July.

Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan is due to visit Brunei soon to sound out the opinion of the remaining ASEAN member state. But ASEAN officials have made clear that a formal invitation would require more progress in Burma and more discussion among ASEAN members.
