He said this week was disappointing because the UN secretary general -- unjustifiably -- did not submit his report to the Security Council. The spokesman added: Butrus-Ghali now has the report to finalize and it is up to him to decide. Referring to Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' actions, the spokesman said they are part of his delaying tactics. He concluded: He is making fun of the UN secretary general and the Security Council.
