FR941004-1-00073 FR941004-1-00018 A few examples of such efforts include the American Public Welfare Association's policy on Commitment to Change, the ``decategorization of funding'' and collaborative planning efforts in a number of States, the Children's Trust Funds and Children's Cabinets, and support for demonstrations of improved planning and child welfare service delivery from the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, and the Kellogg Foundation. Today, there are a variety of models of family preservation providing services to families at risk or in crisis. These models differ in level of intensity, services approaches, duration of services, and entrance parameters. Specific program models include Homebuilders, the Families First programs, Family Services America programs, and Maryland's Intensive Family Services program. Also, today, there are hundreds of community-based family support programs nationwide including center-based models (family resource centers); school-based models; home-based models, including home visiting programs; and models that combine several approaches, such as Parents and Teachers, the Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY), and the Healthy Families America initiative. The Family Services America programs are considered both family preservation and family support. Many Indian tribes and tribal organizations also have developed and implemented family-centered or family-based services, including family preservation and family support programs. Tribal programs may be center-based, home-based (include home visiting), or contain elements of both. Most programs seek to build on family strengths and use traditional and cultural activities as a part of their services approach. Several Federal programs or initiatives also have focused on prevention, family-centered practice, and a community-based approach. Some examples include: •The Head Start Bureau's Family Services and Family Support Projects, and Parent and Child Centers; •The National Comprehensive Child Development Program demonstration; •The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect's State community-based prevention grants associated with Children's Trust Funds; •The National Family Support Resource Center and the National Family-Based Services Resource Center (beginning in 1994, it will be known as the National Family-Centered Practice Resource Center) funded by the Children's Bureau; •The Family and Youth Services Bureau's Family Resource and Support program; •The Public Health Services' (PHS) ``Healthy Start'' program; •The Office of Community Services' Family Support Centers (homeless families demonstration); •The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Family Self-Sufficiency demonstration program; and •The PHS Child and Adolescent Services System Program (CASSP), a planning model for coordinated mental health services for children now implemented in all States. F. ACF Implementation of the Family Preservation and Support Services Legislation: Lessons Learned From the Field The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) recognized that for the new program to be effective, we needed to engage in a variety of learning activities that would support the development of useful guidance and appropriate Federal regulations. As one part of our implementation of this new legislation, we convened a series of focus groups in both the Central and Regional Offices with family support and family preservation program directors, practitioners, and experts; State, county, and city child welfare administrators; State and local agencies with experience in providing such services; representatives of Indian tribes and regional and national Tribal organizations; national advocacy, interest group, and professional organizations; representatives of national organizations representing Governors, State legislators, and counties; and parents, foster parents, and consumers of child welfare services. In addition, we met with or received written materials and recommendations from a number of other experts and practitioners in the field. The suggestions, guidance, and information we received through this process have been invaluable to us in the development of the Program Instructions to States and Indian tribes on applying for FY 1994 funds (ACYF&hyph;PI&hyph;94&hyph;01, January 18, 1994, and ACYF PI&hyph;94&hyph;04, January 18, 1994) and this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM):
