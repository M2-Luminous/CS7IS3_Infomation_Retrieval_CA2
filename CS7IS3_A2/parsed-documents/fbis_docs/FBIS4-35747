FBIS4-35747 "drnes107dd_94017" FBIS-NES-94-107 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Involvement in Political Bodies Seen Hamas Involvement in Political Bodies Seen TA0306105794 TA0306105794 BFN [Editorial report] Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 3 June carries a 200-word report by Roni Shaqed and David Regev stating: "Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] leaders in the territories and outside are discussing the possibility of turning the movement into a political party to operate -- during the first stage -- in the Gaza and Jericho autonomy area. "By adopting this approach Hamas wants to preserve its political power and become an element which will participate in elections to institutions and organizations -- including the self-rule bodies. "Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, one of Hamas' leaders in the Gaza Strip, has confirmed that his movement is examining the possibility of turning into a political party similar to other political parties in the territories, including Fatah. He noted that the establishment of a party does not change the movement's thinking or strategy, but rather constitutes a way to advance its cause among the public." A 600-word report by Yosi Torpstein on page A10 of HA'ARETZ on 3 June says that "Hamas and the Democratic Front may join Fatah in establishing a temporary municipal council in Nabulus. In a meeting this week attended by all organizations and institutions in Nabulus, Hamas made its agreement conditional upon support of all the political forces in the city and preparations for elections to be held in the near future." The report adds that "the contacts toward the establishment of a municipal council are directed by attorney Ghassan al-Shak'ah, who was appointed by 'Arafat and who enjoys the support of most Fatah activists in Nabulus. Al-Shak'ah noted that he intends to set up a committee for managing city affairs in the next year -- after which elections are to be held, according to al-Shak'ah. He noted that the municipal committee will maintain contacts with the self- government authority in Gaza and Jericho." HA'ARETZ adds: "Sources in Nabulus explain that a municipal council is necessary because international aid for municipal development is conditional upon an authoritative local body which will maintain contacts with donors. They added that most political bodies in the city recognize the importance of financial aid for municipal development, and that most of the population supports this move." An 800-word report by Yehuda Litani on page 8 of Tel Aviv SHISHI in Hebrew on 3 June, however, accentuates the growing tension between the Palestinian police and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The report says that "General Nasr Yusuf, the commander of the Palestinian army and police forces in the Gaza Strip, this week almost issued a sharp public warning to Hamas, but was prevented from doing so at the last minute by Yasir 'Arafat." The report notes that Gen. Yusuf and PLO officials in the strip were angered by Hamas' execution of two suspected collaborators, contrary to the orders issued by Gen. Yusuf immediately after he entered the Gaza Strip. The report goes on to say that "there is great tension between the two organizations in the Gaza Strip, and according to Palestinian sources in Gaza 'one match could ignite the entire area.'" The sources add that any further Hamas activity which is not coordinated with the PLO, and Gen. Yusuf in particular, "could result in direct and violent confrontation between the Palestinian Authority members and Hamas in the Gaza Strip." In a meeting with Gaza journalists, Gen. Yusuf issued a sharp warning to Hamas "not to undertake independent operations which are not coordinated with official security elements." The report adds that the tension between the organizations was exacerbated by the detention of an Islamic Jihad activist suspected of involvement in the murder of two Israeli soldiers and by Gen. Yusuf's call on Hamas and Islamic Jihad to hand over their weapons, a call which has been publicly defied by Hamas. The reports ends: "Gen. Yusuf, who considers himself to be the supreme commander of the Palestinian security forces in the autonomy, regards Hamas rejection of his demands as a direct challenge posed by the Islamic organizations and an attempt to undermine his authority."
