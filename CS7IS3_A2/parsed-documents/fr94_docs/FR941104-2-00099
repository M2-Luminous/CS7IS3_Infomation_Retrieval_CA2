FR941104-2-00099 FR941104-2-00059 Toll-Free Number The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is establishing a toll-free number to be used by the public for general inquiries. The system will be available for a 6-month trial period, during which public comments will be sought. The toll-free number will be answered by an operator at the main Switchboard and then forwarded to appropriate internal offices. Callers may also contact individual employees when their telephone numbers are known. The NRC also maintains various other toll-free numbers for a variety of specific information purposes, such as electronic bulletin boards and meeting notifications. These numbers will remain unchanged. The new toll-free number, 1&hyph;800&hyph;368&hyph;5642, will become effective on November 1, 1994. A small sample of the callers may be asked to evaluate the trial program, and to provide their area code and business association with the NRC. Written comments on the toll-free service may be addressed to the Chief, Rules Review and Directives Branch, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 31st day of October 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. George H. Messenger, Acting Director, Office of Information Resources Management.
