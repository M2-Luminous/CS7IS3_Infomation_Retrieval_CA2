FR941121-0-00079 FR941121-0-00009 Even in the absence of specific regulatory requirements, we expect Medicare contracting HMOs and CMPs to expedite any initial coverage determination and reconsideration if a delay in the decision, and a subsequent postponement or suspension of treatment, could have serious, adverse consequences on the health status of the beneficiary (for example, cause impairment of any bodily function and/or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part). Comment: Two commenters believed that the 60-day time period frequently is not long enough, and that the time limit should apply only to ``clean cases'' or should begin after all materials are received. Response: The 60-day limit is consistent with the time period allowed in making the initial organization determination, is supported as reasonable by most commenters on the proposed rule, and should be adequate in most circumstances. Nonetheless, while we do not agree with the specific suggestion of the commenters, we are amending ยง417.620 (Responsibility for reconsideration; time limits) to allow extensions for ``good cause.'' The ``good cause'' extension authority will not diminish the new time limit requirement, but will allow for unusual circumstances such as natural disasters or circumstances that make it difficult or impossible for the enrollee to provide necessary information in a timely way. This will benefit both the enrollee and the health plan. Comment: Several commenters believed that a time limit similar to the 60-day limit on reconsiderations that is placed on HMOs/CMPs should be placed on HCFA's reconsiderations. In support of this position, one commenter cited the stipulated settlement in the case of Levy v. Sullivan concerning HMO appeal delays. Response: We do not accept this comment. In order to provide meaningful review of the HMO's/CMP's decision, we (or the independent reviewer with which we contract) must have the complete record of the dispute. When the HMO/CMP conducts a reconsideration of its original decision, it presumably has all of the documentation it considered relevant to its initial decision. However, our experience demonstrates that the independent reviewer must often request that additional material be submitted. Our current policy allows the HMO time to obtain the additional information. If the information is not received, the contractor will make its decision based on the record available. Since legitimate delays may occur, however, we believe it would be to the parties' advantage to have a flexible deadline for the independent review. We are, on the other hand, concerned that beneficiaries not suffer undue financial hardship during an appeal. We monitor the activities of the contractor and the status of reconsiderations as part of our overall monitoring of compliance with program requirements. Our contract with the independent reviewer also contains a 30-day timeliness standard for clean claims, as stipulated in Levy v. Sullivan, Civ. No. 88&hyph;3271 DT (TX) (S.D. Cal., filed March 13, 1989). That agreement, however, did not require that this be incorporated into regulations and does not preclude us from revising the contract to reflect intervening circumstances. Comment: One commenter suggested that the 60-day period begin with the date of receipt of the request by the health plan. Response: Section 417.620(c) specifies that the HMO must act within 60 calendar days ``from the date of receipt of the request for reconsideration.'' Comment: One commenter suggested that the appeals regulations explain the consequences of failure to meet the 60-day time limit or to issue written determinations. One commenter urged a system of intermediate sanctions for HMOs/CMPs that fail to make timely organization or reconsideration determinations. Response: We agree with the commenter that there should be consequences for failure to provide determinations in a timely manner and within established time standards. As explained in an earlier response to a comment, we believe that the regulations at ยง417.608(c) permit a Medicare enrollee to move to the reconsideration process if timely notification of an adverse organization determination is not made. To ensure that the 60-day limit serves as a time ceiling for this stage of the appeals process, we are adding a provision to ยง417.620. This provision clarifies that failure to complete the reconsideration within the time allowed, or to obtain a ``good cause'' extension from us, constitutes an adverse determination and the appeals file must be submitted to us. Regulations were published on July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36072) that allow us to impose intermediate sanctions and civil money penalties for a number of performance violations on the part of HMOs and CMPs. Though the sanction and penalty authorities are untested at this time, we will be assessing how information from the appeals process may be used to improve plan performance or initiate a sanctions process in response to suspected violations such as a substantial failure to provide required medically necessary services and the failure adversely affects the enrollee.
