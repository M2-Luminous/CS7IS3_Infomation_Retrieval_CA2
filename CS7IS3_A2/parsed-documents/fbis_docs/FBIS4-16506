"Everyone should understand that Moldova is an independent state and can take any decision," Moldavian President Mircea Snegur stated in this connection. Some Romanian law-makers called on their colleagues to condemn "the inclusion of the traditional Romanian lands into the new Soviet empire," according to the Kishinev radio. Dumitru Motspan, deputy chairman of the Moldavian parliament and also the leader of the ruling Agrarian and Democratic Party, called Romania's reaction insulting. The recent poll and parliamentary elections showed that overwhelming majority of the population stood against unification with Romania and for independence, he told ITAR- TASS. "We will conclude profitable economic and other agreements with all countries of the world, join international unions and do not intend to ask anyone's permission for that," Motspan stressed. "The inclusion of Moldavia into CIS and the economic union would allow it to establish civilized mutual relations with CIS countries, to restore old and create new mutually beneficial economic links," he added.
