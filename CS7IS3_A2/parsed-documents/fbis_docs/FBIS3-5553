That day, the two missiles without warheads were fired from a base in the northern edge of Beaufort Sea in the North Pole and reached Alberta and Saskatchewan Provinces in west Canada, respectively, after flying 2,500 kilometers. Concerning this, the U.S. military authorities merely noted that a cruise missile test-firing was conducted, and did not elaborate on the functions of the fired missiles or any other details. It is not necessary for one to mention again what these missiles are used for. Almost at the same time, a train carrying 60 nuclear warheads arrived in Russia from Ukraine. The warheads, which were left in Ukraine after the collapse of the former Soviet Union, were to be moved to Russia and dismantled according to the agreement signed by U.S. President Clinton, Russian President Yeltsin, and Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk last January. This agreement stipulates that all of the 1,600-odd nuclear warheads and 176 long-range missiles in Ukraine will be destroyed. It is a fact already known to the world that this agreement was realized through strong and persistent U.S. diplomatic efforts. How should we explain the inconsistency of the fact that the very moment when nuclear weapons of one country were being destroyed, another is test firing a nuclear delivery system? The United States voluntarily assumed the role of world police both in name and reality. This being the situation, the United States is attempting to inquire into not only political and military but also economic and even human rights issues of the nations of the world, and asserts that it will punish them for their wrongdoings. Strong measures against the North Korean nuclear development are a practical example of the role of global police from the military standpoint. Making an issue over the ROK's National Security Law and interfering in the human rights issue in China are the result of voluntary assuming the role of police on human rights. It is true that the voluntary assumption of the police role by the United States has positive aspects, because a certain order and system should be maintained in the international community, just as in relations between individuals, and because the United States has become the only superpower of the world, both in name and reality, after the collapse of the U.S.-Soviet Union confrontation system. Thus, it is not bad for the United States to assume the role of maintaining military and diplomatic order. However, whoever maintains order should be stern with itself as much as it demands order from others so as to win their trust. Since the United States demands that the international community reduce its nuclear weapons and delivery system, it should also refrain from acting to evoke suspicion from the international community. Is the United States stern enough with itself so as to be recognized as the police by the international community?
