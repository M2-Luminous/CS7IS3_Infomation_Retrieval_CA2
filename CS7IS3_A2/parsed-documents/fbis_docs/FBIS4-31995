Topics discussed included how the former ruling party should prepare for its four-year opposition role, party spokesman Karoly Herenyi said at a press conference in Budapest on Thursday [16 June]. Among the tasks considered the most important by the MDF are to protect the Constitution and law, to preserve the achievements of the last four years, to safeguard human freedom rights and private property, and to enforce freedom of the press at least to the extent that characterized the last four years. According to the two bodies, the press can be both a brake and a guarantee against the future two-thirds coalition majority. The participants set down as a basic principle that the MDF would like to receive at least 10 percent of the places in the newly formed parliamentary committees, but would consider it ideal if it could enjoy the same conditions as the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) did in the previous cycle, in other words, that it receive greater representation than its numeric proportion, and have a representative in all parliamentary committees.
