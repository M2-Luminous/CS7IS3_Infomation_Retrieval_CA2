The new mechanism is aimed first and foremost at resolving the problems of nationalism, interethnic conflicts, and religious intolerance. It is on a French initiative that work has begun on the Stability Pact, directed toward the nine states of Central and East Europe, including the three Baltic countries, which have declared their intention to join the EU's ranks. A meeting of delegations from 57 European countries was held in Paris as part of this. The forum examined the problems of stability from the standpoint of democracy and human rights, not in a military context. "We are ready to accept the new members into our ranks," Alain Lamassoure, French minister for European Affairs, noted, "but we do not want to open the doors to new conflicts." The focal points of possible conflict are connected with the position of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltics and the Hungarian minorities in Romania and Slovakia. The EU expects these countries to go through a "preparatory class" prior to joining, where they will learn the rules of good conduct. Paris favors the earliest possible signing of an agreement on partnership and cooperation between the EU and Moscow (it seems that this will happen as early as June) and is energetically supporting Russia's admission to all the European institutions. After some hesitation, Moscow supported the French initiative. It believes that the Stability Pact should not exist as a separate entity but should form an organic part of the CSCE fabric. In Moscow's view, another major aspect of this pact is the fact that the document is based on the principle of the inviolability of borders. Furthermore, to all appearances it will promote the protection of the rights of the Russians in the Baltics. The Paris conference has begun work on the pact which will end with its signature in about a year. After the adoption of the basic document by consensus at the present meeting, regional talks will be held. The first talks will be on the rights of minorities in the Baltics. Andrey Kozyrev proposed the creation of a European University in one of the Baltic states, where instruction would be given in the local language and in Russian.
