The Argentine foreign minister reportedly explained in general terms the concrete meaning of the sanctions that Washington is threatening to levy, although he must have also dispensed a few sarcastic remarks about the senators' lack of political acumen in the handling of this issue, which plays a key role in the relations between the two countries. This was the minister's reaction to the legislative maze, where the bill on patents got lost after the national executive branch sent it to the Senate in May 1993. The truth is that the bill became the target of a tug-of-war between the ruling party and the opposition, until it was finally left in the hands of a complex system of committees, three of them controlled by the opposition Radical Civic Union and the other two by the JP. This allowed the opposition not only more elbow room, but also left it in control of the issue to deal with all the interested parties. In fact, the person who knows most about the subject in the Senate is the speaker for the opposition: Jose Genoud, senator for Mendoza Province. Genoud favors a new patents law that will recognize the right of every inventor to produce and market his medicines, but unlike the administration he wants the law to set restrictions to prevent monopolies, and also believes that the law should give Argentine pharmaceutical laboratories a reasonable period of time to adjust. The slumber of the ruling party was shattered earlier this week when reports from Washington indicated that U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had officially notified Minister Domingo Cavallo that at the end of April Argentina will join the black list of countries that have not approved a pharmaceutical patents law, as large U.S. pharmaceutical industries want them to do. The inclusion of our country on that list make us vulnerable to commercial sanctions, which does not mean they will be imposed immediately. Kantor does not have the authority to determine the type of sanctions that will be imposed, or the moment for their implementation. His job is to point out which countries are, in his opinion, violating commercial commitments with the United States. In order to understand the situation it is necessary to go back to 1991, when George Bush was still president and his representative was the inflexible Carla Hills. At that time Domingo Cavallo thought it was a good idea to use the issue of patents in negotiations. He promised to speed up the approval of the patents law, which was being pushed by U.S. laboratories, in exchange for more flexibility on the issue of the debt. But the initiative could not prosper in Congress. The U.S. Embassy and Government then started pressuring the Menem administration to take up the issue with Justicialist legislators. However, executive branch recommendations have so far not fared well, and President Menem says only that the executive branch has sent the bill to Congress, and the issue is in the hands of legislators. The government understands that even though the country is included on the black list, sanctions will not be imposed for at least a year. This period is enough for Congress to approve the GATT agreement, which would give Argentina the possibility of resorting to GATT's more flexible and benign requirements in the area of patents. If this is the case, the United States will find it harder to apply sanctions.
