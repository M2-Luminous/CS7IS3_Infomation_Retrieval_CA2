FR940527-1-00003 FR940527-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;26] Airworthiness Directives; Hamilton Standard 14RF, 247F, 14SF, and 6/5500/F Series Propellers AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Hamilton Standard 14RF, 247F, 14SF, and 6/5500/F (formerly Hamilton Standard/British Aerospace 6/5500/F) series propellers, that currently requires initial and repetitive inspections of the propeller control unit (PCU) servo ballscrew internal spline (BIS) teeth for wear, and replacement, if necessary, of PCU servo BIS assemblies. This action would increase the repetitive inspection interval from 500 to 1,500 hours time in service (TIS) since last inspection for propellers that have a ballscrew quill damper installed. This proposal is prompted by the availability of improved hardware that enhances the lubrication of the BIS and significantly reduces BIS wear. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent inability to control the propeller blade angle due to tooth wear in the PCU servo BIS assembly. DATES: Comments must be received by June 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;26, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299.
