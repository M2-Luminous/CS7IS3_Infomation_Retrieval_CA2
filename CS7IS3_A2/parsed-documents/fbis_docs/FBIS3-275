Viewing the latest developments in the Mozambican peace process, the UN special representative said he was happy that the government had decided to start demobilizing its forces without waiting for the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] to do the same. Aldo Ajello noted that this is a sensible and important initiative and he added that work must start now to do away with what he described as technical red tape, so that government and Renamo can start demobilizing their troops as soon as possible. Those troops are currently confined to assembly areas. [Begin Ajello recording, in English with passage-by-passage translation to Portuguese] I have said that the decision of the government is extremely positive and I would like to stress this point because I think that it is one of few gestures of confidence that we have recorded since the peace process began. I think that Mr. Dhlakama understood that and I think his statement this morning was correct. Mainly, what the government did was to recognize Renamo's good faith. Renamo was having problems producing its lists of men to be demobilized, but it really wanted to demobilize them. The government offered to get the process under way unilaterally. It was a good and wise decision. At the same time, it helps to build confidence all around. As for Renamo, I have its first list here. This list was drawn up in conjunction with our officials, so that each soldier will have his own serial number, thereby allowing us to identify each soldier. We will do everything that is needed to [words indistinct] all that data is on our computers. You must be aware that there have been some misunderstandings concerning this list. However, I do not think they will be repeated. I can see, though, that the government's gesture has produced a positive gesture from the other side, even if this is only a small list. Nonetheless, our people are working on upcoming lists. [end recording] UN Special Representative Ajello said that the Finance Ministry is working hard to process documentation relating to the subsidies to which soldiers on both sides are entitled. That UN official also disclosed that 45 percent of the government forces expected at the assembly areas have already been registered. A total of 50 percent of the Renamo forces have already been registered. In his opinion, the existing gap is being rapidly bridged.
