Demiral, together with Ankara Security Director Orhan Tasanlar, showed to journalists, the room where six deputies, who were arrested a day before, had stayed and the room in which they were interrogated. [passage omitted] Demiral said that the deputies were questioned on violating Provision 125 of the Penal Code. `Under Provision 125, crimes against the state do not necessarily have to be armed attacks,' Demiral said. `The illegal organization has a political flank and a military flank.' Demiral refuted the claim of DEP defense attorneys that all party telephones were tapped. `This is not true,' he said. `Those that were tapped are the ones that were used to communicate with PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] head Abdullah Ocalan and the organization's members.'
