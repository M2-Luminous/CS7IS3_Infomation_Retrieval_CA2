This has taught "a lesson" to the British Government, which interfered in its internal affairs. The deportation of the ambassador of a foreign country is not a minor matter on which the decision can be easily made in diplomatic affairs. The Sudanese Government showed the British ambassador the door only after it had conclusive evidence proving he had "interfered in something which had nothing to do with him." The British Foreign Ministry afterward asked the Sudanese Government to reconsider the decision and has now announced the deporting of the Sudanese ambassador from London. However, this unreasonable move cannot change the fact that Britain has interfered in the internal affairs of another country and it only shows the phantom of the former British Empire refuses to leave. Here, we might as well look back at an event which occurred over 100 years ago. If the British Government is not forgetful, it should remember better than others how Gordon died in the Sudan. As a colonial governor, Gordon was insufferably arrogant and acted like a tyrant. He was, of course, more imposing than the present British ambassador to Sudan. However, when the Sudan national hero Mahdi started an uprising, the vigorous and heroic struggle against the British colonial rule immediately swept across Sudan and the people captured Khartoum. The feeling of the fighters in the uprising was high and they pierced Gordon's body with a sharp spear. This butcher, whose hands had once been stained with the blood of the Chinese people, finally died on the staircase of the British governor's residence. This was a punishment meted out by history for the colonialist. What is surprising is that today, when the world has developed to the end of the 20th century and every shred of the "prestige" of the British Empire has been swept away, some people in the British Government are still following the example of their ancestors and are engaged in activities which interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. They really show no understanding of the times.
