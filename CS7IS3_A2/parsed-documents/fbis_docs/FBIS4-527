This course of action has been condemned by the Republican Democratic Movement [MDR], the main opposition party. Its West Africa representative, Leon Kaberuka, spoke to Raphael Mbadinga. [Begin Kaberuka recording] The origin of the present crisis....[pauses] It is true that the country is facing problems, considering the fact that changing over from a one-party system of government to a multiparty democracy is a sufficiently arduous task. It was at the delicate stage of the changeover that the RPF unleashed war from Ugandan territory in the belief that it is better to resort to the use of arms than to engage in political dialogue. The origin of the crisis is that the RPF believed that the solution to the country's problems -- that is the refugee, economic, and political problems -- could be solved by the use of force. Things cannot work out that way. No other party has so far adopted that philosophy, otherwise the other parties would also have taken up arms against Habyarimana. That is very easy to do, and should that have happened, the country would have immediately been turned into Somalia, Liberia, or Angola which is what the Rwandan people do not want. [end recording]
