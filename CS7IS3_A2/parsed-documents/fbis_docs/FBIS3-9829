According to reports from one month ago, this should have been the merger congress of the NDS, the Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic [AD SR], and the supporters of Roman Kovac and Jozef Moravcik. [SME] Why will the centrist parties not merge on Saturday [26 March]? [Cernak] Following all of the talks that have been held, there is unanimous will to proceed jointly. However, we realize our responsibility before voters not to create an incoherent conglomerate, as was the case with the Public Against Violence movement or the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, which later fell apart. There is only one remaining difference among us. Colleagues Knazko, Kovac, and Moravcik identify more with liberal ideas and the Liberal International, while we find sympathetic a conservative orientation and the European Democratic Union. We have therefore decided to establish two entities--a liberal one and one with a conservative orientation. Otherwise, we have almost identical programs, and it is highly probable that, before the elections, we will set up a centrist coalition bloc. Meanwhile, the AD SR will merge with Moravcik's followers. We will proceed further according to the political circumstances, but for sure jointly. [Kovac] Mainly because the Alternative of Political Realism is not technically prepared for such a step yet. In view of the fact that Cernak's group has been preparing its assembly for a long time, we have agreed that its assembly should go ahead. We must still complete the technical preparations. The question of further cooperation will be assessed by us in mid-April. [SME] Will you discuss a merger or merely a joint ticket for the elections? [Kovac] I do not rule out either possibility. [SME] In other words, you deny the information from behind the scenes, according to which the reason for the failure of the centrist parties to merge is the problem of who would be the party's chairman? Besides, not all of the centrist parties have established structures in the countryside. The NDS is the sole exception, and it would thus probably have the largest number of elected delegates at the merger congress.... [Cernak] What you say has its logic. Apart from the differences in the orientation of our programs, which I have already mentioned, there is among us yet another difference of opinion: how to build the party. The AD SR has already declared that it would be a selective party and Messrs. Moravcik and Kovac, too, would not want to build their structures any further than the district level. We, on the other hand, are trying to win "our man" in every small village. It should be a person who commands authority at the local level and who could explain the party's program and objectives. We had differences on this point, and the problem regarding the number of delegates would apparently also result from this. However, for me, this is not a substantial issue. If we want to successfully defy Meciar's populism and his visits to every little village, we must do the same and rebut his assertions by making our arguments heard in the same village. [SME] Who else, besides you, is running for NDS chairman? [Cernak] I am not the only person running. There will be at least two or three candidates. The list of candidates will be put forward today. I do not want to anticipate events.
