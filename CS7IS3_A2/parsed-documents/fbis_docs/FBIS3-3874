The two figures are only slightly lower than last year but still much higher than the national average set by Beijing nine per cent economic growth and 10 per cent inflation. In his report to the Sixth Plenum of the Shenzhen People's Congress which opened yesterday, Mayor Li Youwei said that the Special Economic Zone's (SEZ) total output value this year would stand at 51.5 billion yuan (HK$45.73 billion) [Hong Kong dollars], a 24.5 per cent increase over last year's -- a milder but still significant increase compared with 30 per cent growth in 1992. Mr Li said that inflation would be kept below 15 per cent compared with 19.9 per cent in 1993. Soaring inflation had been a major headache for Chinese leaders who saw it as the source for social discontent and potential disorder. Mr Li said that the Government faced the arduous task of keeping prices stable because the central Government planned to implement a number of important reforms. He said pricing departments must strengthen control over prices of basic necessities and services particularly the so-called "vegetable basket" and the "rice bag" for consumers. And according to an SEZ Finance Bureau official Chen Xitao, Shenzhen will allocate 10 million yuan to subsidise prices, a staggering increase of 153 per cent over 1993. Despite steady economic growth last year, Mr Li said social order had deteriorated to an alarming level with an increase in serious crime. Corruption, particularly that involving government officials, remained a major concern. Also of concern was the need for a better monitoring system. Public securities, legal and judicial forces would also be strengthened and improved, with more people, better equipment and in tense training, he said. The SEZ government would pool resources to clamp down on serious crime, like murder, robbery kidnapping and triad activities. A system to make public securities' officials more accountable would be introduced to improve their performance. Shenzhen also planned to tighten control on migrants? Labour and housing management to control unauthorised workers in the city. Mr Li said. The mayor made only one reference to the Qinshuihe explosion in August and the Zhili factory fire in November in Kwairong which killed 84 workers. Instead of reporting on the investigation of these two accidents, he only called for better safety precautions. Meanwhile, Mr Li revealed in his report that 86 government officials including more than 30 senior one had been punished for corruption or unlawful conduct last year and 68 party cadres had been ordered to sever their relationship with various companies. Mr Li told delegates that 192 administrative charges had been cancelled and other unlawful charges and penalities checked.
