Cot, on a brief visit to Genoa, told reporters the European Parliament did not intend to interfere with Italy's internal affairs when it approved a motion on May 4 asking the Italian president to make sure the new government would "remain faithful to the fundamental values" of the European Union [EU], referring indirectly to the possibility that the new executive (which had not been formed yet) would include ministers of the National Alliance, the new name given to the Italian Social Movement, heir to Mussolini's Fascist Party. "We do not plan to put intentions on trial over the issue," Cot said, adding however that "contradictory statements have been made," referring to National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini, who insists he is a "post-fascist" but has not formally renounced the party's historical roots and recently defined Mussolini as the century's greatest statesman. Fini's party has five cabinet posts in the new government and on Monday [16 May] National Alliance presented, as it has done at the beginning of every legislature for decades, a legislative bill to revoke a constitutional law passed in 1948 banning the revival of the Fascist Party. The party later withdrew the bill, saying it had been mistakenly filed with the speaker's office by an over-zealous secretary. Cot said: "The Italian government must be told: Since you claim you have nothing to do with the Fascist past, you must also say that the Fascist past has nothing to do with you." He warned that, "unless a political clarification is made, relations may become complicated." Cot also made reference to statements by the new foreign minister, Antonio Martino, who claimed he would never have anything to do with a Fascist minister, noting that "while Martino says reassuring things, others are saying the opposite." Italy, in other words, "must say it follows the anti-Fascist line" that is at the foundation of the EU, Cot asserted. "A formal declaration made by the Italian government reneging a past that is hateful to all may clear the air." He compared the Italian situation to that of Japan, where the justice minister was forced to resign two weeks ago for having downplayed the Nanjing massacres of 1937. According to Cot, the European Parliament is concerned about the issue just as it is concerned about the rise of extreme right-wing movements across Europe. "We are living in a time in which watchfulness over the values of democracy must be doubled," he said.
