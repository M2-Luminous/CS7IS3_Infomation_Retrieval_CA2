Instead, the government will send a Finance Ministry mission to Moscow in early June to sound out the possibility of obtaining the repayment in kind, Second Assistant Finance Minister Yim Chang-yol said. While meeting with reporters Yim said the government believes that getting the credits repaid in kind best serves national interests under the present circumstances. The Finance Ministry mission will be led by Chong Tok-ku, Finance Ministry's director-general for international cooperation, he said. The assistant minister said that it may be possible to obtain the repayment in such goods as coal, machinery and asbestos and in the right to use land for the construction of a Korean trade center in Moscow. If the feasibility of obtaining the repayment in kind were determined in the mission's visit early next month, a meeting of high economic cooperation officials will take place toward the end of June or early July to discuss the matter in earnest, he said.
