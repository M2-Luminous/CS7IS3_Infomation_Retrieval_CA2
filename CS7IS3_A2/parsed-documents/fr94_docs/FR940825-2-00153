FR940825-2-00153 FR940825-2-00096 D. Market Impact The Commission believes that the listing and trading of Semiconductor Index options and Index LEAPS on the Phlx will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets. 22 First, as described above, for the most part, no one security or group of securities dominates the Index. Second, because (i) at least 90% of the numerical value of the Index must be accounted for by securities that meet the Exchange's options listing standards, (ii) each of the component securities must be traded on either the NYSE or the Amex, or as NM securities traded through NASDAQ, and (iii) the component securities must be subject to last sale reporting pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 of the Act, 23 the component securities generally will be actively-traded, highly-capitalized securities. Third, the 7,500 contract position and exercise limits applicable to Index options and Index LEAPS will serve to minimize potential manipulation and market impact concerns. 22 In addition, the Phlx has represented that the Phlx and the OPRA have the necessary systems capacity to support those new series of options that would result from the introduction of Index options and Index LEAPS. See Letter from Michele Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, Phlx, to Thomas McManus, Attorney, OMS, Division, Commission, dated June 24, 1994; and Memorandum from Joe Corrigan, Executive Director, OPRA, to Richard Cangelosi, Assistant Vice President, New Product Development, Phlx, dated April 18, 1994. 23 See supra note 8. Lastly, the Commission believes that settling expiring Semiconductor Index options and Index LEAPS based on the opening prices of component securities is consistent with the Act. As noted in other contexts, valuing options for exercise settlement on expiration based on opening prices rather than closing prices may help reduce adverse effects on markets for securities underlying options on the Index. 24 24 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30944 (July 21, 1992), 57 FR 33376 (July 28, 1992). It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 25 that the proposed rule change (SR-Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;02), as amended, is approved. 25 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 26 26 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
