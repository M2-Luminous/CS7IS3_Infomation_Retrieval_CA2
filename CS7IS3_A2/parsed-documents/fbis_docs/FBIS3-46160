It is believed that so long as both sides observe strictly the principles on which the two countries established diplomatic ties and the relevant principles in the joint communique, the prospects for the development of Sino-French relations will be very good. At the ministry press conference, Wu Jianmin said in a comment on the current status and prospects of Sino-French relations: Today is the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic ties. It was a historic decision made Mao Zedong and General De Gaulle. For most of the last 30 years, the two countries achieved highly fruitful cooperation in various areas, though Sino-French relations did suffer serious setbacks. The two governments, after consultations, issued a joint communique, which opened a new page in bilateral ties. Wu Jianmin told reporters that Philippe de Gaulle, son of General de Gaulle, was among the persons who visited China with French envoy Peyrefitte.
