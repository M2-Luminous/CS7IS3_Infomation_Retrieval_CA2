FBIS4-9344 "dreeu079_k_94006" FBIS-EEU-94-079 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 CROATIA HDZ Denounces Breakaway Members in Address HDZ Denounces Breakaway Members in Address LD2304172694 Zagreb Radio Croatia Network in Serbo-Croatian 1300 GMT 23 Apr 94 LD2304172694 Zagreb Radio Croatia Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Text] The Presidium of the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] today addressed a message to the members of the HDZ and the Croatian public. We will broadcast the message in its entirety. At a critical historic moment in the struggle to defend Croatian state sovereignty, when we have achieved the greatest results and obtained recognition from the whole of the international community for our consistent, peace-loving, and democratic policy, but while we are still facing serious challenges and uncertainties on the path of establishing full sovereignty over Croatian areas under the protection of the peace forces -- but in fact under Serb occupation -- and the no less grave problem of establishing peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina; in such internationally complex circumstances, we are facing an attempt to cause a rift in the HDZ. The HDZ Presidium is, therefore, addressing the HDZ members and public with the following message: The initiative launched by Josip Manolic and Stipe Mesic to form a new political party called the Croatian Independent Democrats [HND] marks the final stage of their departure from the HDZ's program and policy. The process of their departure from the HDZ's central policy has been under way for more than a year, and it gained momentum after the second general convention of the HDZ, held on 15 October 1993. Manolic and Mesic protested their deep dissatisfaction with decisions adopted with an overwhelming majority at the convention. Their objections referred to the new program envisaging the completion of the transformation of the HDZ from a Pan-Croatian democratic movement [opcehrvatski demokratski pokret] into a Pan-Croatian and all-people's party [opcehrvatska and opcenarodna stranka] which bases its democratic policy on the principles of Christian civilization. They expressed particular disapproval over the new party leaders and the HDZ presidium that was elected in a secret ballot at the convention. Over the past few months Manolic and Mesic were increasingly open in expressing their views that were contradictory to those of the HDZ leadership, the president of the republic, and the prime minister in all important issues concerning internal and foreign policy. Through their separate political activity and the initiative to launch a new party, Manolic and Mesic continued and deepened the work of those from the opposition and from abroad -- the letter of the six and the Initiative Circle -- who called for a change in the constitutional order, the resignation of the president of the republic, and early elections. Considering the circumstances in the internal and international spheres, there can be no doubt as to the intentions and consequences of such activity. The attempt to cause a parliamentary and constitutional crisis, and especially the discrediting of the state policy of the president of the republic did not and cannot aim at anything other than the destabilization of the internal order and the weakening of the international position of democratic Croatia, and consequently the weakening of Croatia's negotiating positions in resolving the problem of the occupied Croatian areas, ending the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the realization of the Croat-Bosnian Muslim Federation and confederation, as well as in reaching economic and financial agreements with other countries. Naturally, respecting the constitutional and democratic rights of every citizen, the HDZ Presidium recognizes Manolic's and Mesic's right to hold differing views and form a separate party. However, the HDZ Presidium has not only the right, but also the obligation toward HDZ members and the Croatian public to present its view on their stances and activity, because this is not only an attempt to create a rift in the HDZ as a majority party, but also an attempt to change the policy of the state. The Croatian people have achieved their sovereignty and the Croatian state has secured its place in today's world under the leadership of the HDZ owing to the correctness of its policy and the stability of its democratic order. By pursuing such a policy, Croatia has gained trust and made friends and allies in the modern world. On the other hand, the world, the important international players, need a stable Croatia as a reliable factor in the creation of a new international order in this part of Europe. In whose interest is then the destabilization of Croatia? Only people who are politically blind and yearn for power or those who cannot reconcile themselves to an independent and sovereign Croatian state. Precisely because it is obvious to every rational human being the attempt by Manolic and Mesic to bring about a division and a constitutional crisis is doomed to failure. Of the 16 deputies that they claim to be in the Initiative Committee of their party, several have already denied any connection with them. The HDZ has retained the majority in both Croatian Assembly chambers, while messages of support for the HDZ Presidency and reports of a growing membership are being received, precisely because of the departure of Manolic and the like. Attempts to cause a division and to weaken the HDZ are already turning into a process of strengthening and consolidation of the HDZ as the focal party on the Croatian political scene. The HDZ will resume its tried and tested policy at both the domestic and international levels without taking any right or left turns away from its program principles and goals. The HDZ will remain a pioneer in the construction of a democratic Croatia in the period of economic and cultural renaissance, in the construction of a legal system. The HDZ will encourage private entrepreneurship and resolutely struggle to overcome all remains of the old communist regime, all bureaucratic, criminal, and immoral phenomena. The HDZ Presidency is calling on all its members and deputies in the Croatian Assembly, in county and municipal assemblies, to justify the trust placed in them by the people who elected them. A question now arises of personal responsibility, before public and party bodies, for the conscientious execution of the duties entrusted, for regular participation in the Assembly Chambers, and the responsible implementation of party policy. All civil servants are requested to fulfill their obligations, including the one on keeping state secrets. They also bear collective responsibility for their own specific areas, especially with regard to economizing at all levels. Personal changes that will take place in the leaderships of the Assembly Chambers -- given the democratic right of a majority party -- will not cause any changes in Croatian policy either at domestic or international levels. On the contrary, they will insure its more consistent implementation. Similar and even greater turmoil than that in the HDZ is also present in the opposition parties. They are the expression of democratic shifts in the balance of political alliances and will serve to strengthen the democratic system in Croatia. All our experience so far gives us solid reasons to conclude that the HDZ, with its well-proven leadership, will come out of this situation even stronger and more united, at the head of the struggle for the preservation, consolidation, and construction of a sovereign and independent Croatian state, the state of full democratic liberties, progress, happiness, and prosperity for all its citizens -- the HDZ Presidency states at the end of its message.
