FR941026-1-00025 FR941026-1-00013 Section 1653.2(b) sets forth the requirements for a court order to be ``qualifying.'' Section 1653.2(b)(1) describes the type of legal document that can be a qualifying order. The first sentence is designed to clarify that the language ``court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation,'' as used in both 5 U.S.C. 8435(d) and 8467 has been interpreted by the Board to mean ``a court decree of divorce, a court decree of annulment, or a court decree of legal separation.'' In order to have a qualifying court order, a court must be involved. A legal separation agreement that has not been approved by a court, for example, is not a ``court decree of legal separation,'' and therefore cannot constitute a qualifying court order. Also, a property settlement agreement must be court-approved in order to be qualifying. This means that the court's approval must be demonstrated on the face of the document or in an accompanying court order. The second sentence of ยง1653.2(b)(1) is designed to make it clear that a ``court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to [a decree of divorce, of annulment or of legal separation]'' may occur at any stage of the proceeding, not just after the entry of a final decree of divorce, of annulment or of legal separation. For example, courts often issue orders during a divorce proceeding in order to preserve the status quo in anticipation of a final decree dividing the property of the parties. The proposed regulations also allow for the possibility that an order serving a function other than preservation of the status quo could be deemed ``incident to'' a decree that has not yet been entered. If the Board receives an otherwise valid order awarding a former spouse a portion of a TSP account, but prior to payment receives a valid amended order changing the earlier award, the amended order will be honored. However, under no circumstances will the Board accept the return to the TSP of funds that have been properly paid pursuant to an earlier order, even if a subsequent order would dictate such a result. The processing of multiple court orders is addressed in ยง1653.3(k). Section 1653.2(b)(2) addresses the requirement in 5 U.S.C. 8435(d)(2)(A) that a court order must ``expressly relate'' to a participant's TSP account and the requirement in 5 U.S.C. 8467 that the court order must ``expressly provide'' for payment to someone other than the participant. For an order to be honored under either provision, the order must unambiguously address the TSP account. Section 1653.2(b)(2)(i) requires that an order must clearly and specifically deal with a participant's TSP account. It is not sufficient to use generic language that is arguably broad enough to include the TSP. For example, an order that states, ``Former Spouse is awarded 50% of all of Participant's Federal retirement benefits'' would not be language that expressly relates to the TSP, even though the TSP is a Federal retirement benefit. The clearest and most effective way to ensure that an order is honored is to actually name the Thrift Savings Plan; parties to divorce actions are encouraged to attempt to obtain such specific language in their orders. However, ยง1653.2(b)(2)(ii) makes it clear that, even if the Thrift Savings Plan is identified by name, the order must not contain language that is inconsistent with the division of a participant's interest in a defined contribution plan, such as the TSP, in which the participant has an individual account. References to ``benefit formulas,'' ``accrued benefits,'' or ``eventual benefits'' may or may not be acceptable in context, because such terms have the potential to raise questions as to whether the order is truly dealing specifically with the TSP account as opposed to simply including the TSP among other retirement benefits to which the participant may be entitled. Since use of such terms may lead the Board to reject an order as not expressly relating to the TSP account, these terms should be avoided in favor of references to the ``TSP account'' or ``TSP account balance.'' Section 1653.2(b)(3) further implements the requirement of 5 U.S.C. 8467 that a payment pursuant to a court order must be expressly provided for in the order. If the order requires a payment from the TSP account, it must either award a specific dollar amount or divide the participant's account balance by applying a fraction, a percentage, or a formula that yields a mathematically possible result. For example, a formula where the numerator is larger than the denominator and therefore yields an amount greater than the entire account balance is not acceptable. All of the variables for the formula must also be set forth in the order or must be available through reference to Government employment records. The dollar amount, percentage, fraction or variables used must be clearly determinable; they cannot be qualified by terms such as ``approximately.'' The order may or may not provide for interest or earnings to be added to the amount of the award, but any award of earnings must also be clearly determinable. The order may also award a survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8435(e). Under ยง1653.2(b)(4), an order will only be deemed qualifying if it calls for payment to the spouse, former spouse, attorney for the spouse or former spouse, dependent children of the participant, other dependents of the participant, or the attorney for the participant's dependent children or other dependents. Payment cannot be made to the participant or to others, such as credit card companies, mortgage lenders, or other creditors of the parties to the divorce. The TSP is a retirement savings plan, and the occasion of a divorce should not be a general opportunity for the participant to obtain access to his or her account or for the parties to use retirement savings to liquidate their general debts. In this context, payment to the attorney for the participant is tantamount to a payment to the participant, since the participant owes a debt to the attorney. Thus, the proposed rules would not permit such a payment. In contrast, it is permissible for the court to award a payment from the TSP account to the attorney representing the spouse/former spouse or dependent children or other dependents for legal fees incurred in connection with the divorce, because direct payments to the spouse/former spouse or dependent children or other dependents are also permissible. The Board will not honor an order asking for payment to be made jointly, such as to the former spouse and his or her children. Rather, the order should separately specify the award to be made to each person.
