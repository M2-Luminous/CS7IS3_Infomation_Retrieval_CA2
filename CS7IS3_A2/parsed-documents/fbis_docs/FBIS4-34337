They want to return to the mountains, to land they abandoned when the Revolution triumphed. The Agriculture Ministry is evaluating and accepting these petitions, acting under a Politburo accord that allows the state or cooperatives to give up unattended land that has agricultural potential. Approximately 600 caballerias to date have been apportioned and are now covered with tobacco crops, worked by the people who have made these requests. Jordan spoke at length with those who were originally farmers and who are now working in restaurants or other activities in the cities. These lands, abandoned for more than 20 years and having agricultural potential and will be replanted with tobacco, coffee, trees, and other crops. Jordan told the farmers that the Agriculture Ministry will be happy to review any request from anyone anywhere in the country. Jordan went on to inform them that the Ministry is confiscating the land of those farmers who do not meet the commitments they have with the state. Family contract [contrato familiar] is the name given to the document that was drafted by the Agriculture Ministry and the bank that grants credit to those who request this contract to cover initial expenses. It is nice to know that farmers, people, and families are requesting land so that the production of tubers, vegetables, and grain -- food for our population -- increases.
