FR941121-0-00050 FR941121-0-00005 14 CFR Part 121 International Crewmember Certificates AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Compliance with certificate application process. SUMMARY: In keeping with the President's initiative to streamline government, the Department of State (DOS) has determined that it will cease processing applications for the international crewmember certificate after December 31, 1994. By this document, the FAA is informing the public that applications for international crewmember certificates, currently processed under 14 CFR 121.721, 121.723 and 135.43, will no longer be processed by the FAA. These certificates, which facilitate the entry and clearance of those crewmembers into International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) contracting states, will no longer be issued, and crewmembers will have to obtain standard international passports. This document is intended to allow air carriers, pilots, and other affected individuals sufficient time to make alternative arrangements. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Daniel V. Meier Jr., Project Development Branch, AFS&hyph;240, Air Transportation Division, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone (202) 267&hyph;3749. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Department of State (DOS) informed the FAA that it will cease processing applications for the international crewmember certificate after August 1, 1994, and recommended that the FAA require all applicants to possess valid passports in accordance with 22 U.S.C. 2705. Since the FAA cannot verify an applicant's citizenship, and because DOS will cease processing for the international certificate, the FAA also planned to cease processing applications by August 1, 1994. FAA requested an extension of the procedure, including DOS processing, beyond the August 1, 1994, deadline until rulemaking could be completed to withdraw regulations (14 CFR 121.721, 121.723 and 135.43) that will be obsolete due to DOS's actions. DOS agreed to extend its deadline until December 31, 1994. Since the FAA's notice and final rule will not be complete before DOS ceases processing applications, the FAA is publishing this document to inform the public that it will be futile to submit applications for the international crewmember certificate to the Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) after December 31, 1994. The FAA is initiating rulemaking action to eliminate the regulatory procedures that will be obsolete after December 31, 1994. Issued in Washington, D.C., on November 2, 1994. Thomas C. Accardi, Director of Flight Standards Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28280 Filed 11&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
