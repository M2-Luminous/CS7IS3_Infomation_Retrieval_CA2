Disgruntled members of the Royal Lesotho Defence Force were still holding hostage the wing commander of the country's Air Force, Lt- Col Patrick Majare on Saturday after they shot him during an armed confrontation on Friday morning. Wing Commander Majare was believed to be under armed guard in a Maseru hospital following an operation to an injured shoulder carried out by a civilian doctor. The rebel soldiers have ignored pleas from the government to release the commander so he can receive further medical treatment in Bloemfontein. The situation in the capital of the tiny mountain kingdom appeared calm on Saturday, with shops trading and residents going about their business as usual. By lunchtime Mr Botha had met senior government and opposition figures, including the Prime Minister and Defence Minister Dr Ntsu Mokhehle. After lunch he was scheduled to meet with all the senior army officers, before trying to bring the two factions face-to-face to resolve their differences. The rebel soldiers ostensibly are demanding a doubling of their salaries, but South African and Lesotho Government sources confirmed to SAPA it appeared the salary issue was a smokescreen for political grievances. The real issue is believed to be opposition to the ruling Basotholand Congress Party. Lesotho and South African Government officials have not ruled out an attempted coup. However, the leader of the main opposition party -- the Basotho National Party -- on Saturday scoffed at such speculation. Mr E R Sekhonyane admitted the situation was serious but said the chances of resolving it were good. "I don't even want to think of a coup," he told SAPA after a meeting with Mr Botha at the home of South Africa's Ambassador Gerhard Visser. Mr Botha, speaking after his first round of talks, stressed the region could not afford more conflict and disruption. Southern Africa would end up being ignored by the First World if it didn't get its house in order, he said. Resolution of the issue depended largely on goodwill from all sides, Mr Botha said. He warned even such a seemingly small issue as a pay dispute could blow up into a major problem: "Don't even start a small fire. You don't know how much dry grass there is around," Mr Botha said. Both Mr Botha and Lesotho Foreign Minister Molapo Qhobela were at pains to point out Mr Botha's visit was at the request of Maseru. "The prospects are good of resolving this thing," Foreign Minister Molapo Qhobela said. "We've had a coup before, and it would be silly if the people of Lesotho were now to have another." He pointed out that all the country's political parties had issued a joint statement on Friday calling on the disgruntled soldiers to lay down their arms. "This little problem can be resolved," Mr Qhobela said. Mr Botha is scheduled to fly back to Pretoria around 5PM on Saturday.
