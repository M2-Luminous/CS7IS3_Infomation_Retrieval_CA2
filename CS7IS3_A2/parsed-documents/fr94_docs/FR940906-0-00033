FR940906-0-00033 FR940906-0-00017 New information submitted during the comment period reaffirmed that the white sturgeon population continues to decline, and is not more widespread or found in other areas of the Kootenai River basin. According to BPA (1993) and Giorgi (1993), estimates showing a decline in the white sturgeon population from an estimated 1,194 fish (range 907 to 1503) in 1982 (Partridge 1983) to 880 (range 638 to 1,211) in 1990 (Apperson and Anders 1991) are not directly comparable because the 1990 survey occurred in a river sampling reach almost 50 river km (31 river mi) longer. However, both BPA and Georgi concur the population is declining. The Service believes recent population trends and population estimates accurately reflect the current status of the fish. Trends in population demographics reveal an aging population with no known recruitment of age 1 sturgeon since 1978. Additionally, although mark-recapture studies reveal that white sturgeon move freely between the Kootenai River and Kootenay Lake, there is no evidence that white sturgeon reside or spawn in other tributaries entering Kootenay Lake, British Columbia. The Service acknowledged in the proposed rule that the white sturgeon population in the Kootenai River has been declining since the mid-1960's, with limited intermittent recruitment until 1974; and indicated that there are causal factors of decline other than ``*␣*␣* significant modifications of the natural hydrograph *␣*␣*'' (58 FR 36379). For example, reduced biological productivity, habitat loss due to diking, poor water quality and contaminants, inadequate regulatory mechanisms, and possibly disease were all identified in the proposed rule as contributing to the decline and affecting recruitment of Kootenai River white sturgeon. Giorgi (1993) also reported that the relationship between recruitment and ``*␣*␣* spring/summer flow volumes in the Kootenai River is not apparent''. Based on year-class comparisons between 1974 (the last year of successful reproduction and measurable recruitment) and recent years with high flow conditions that resulted in no recruitment, Giorgi concluded that if ``*␣*␣* the linkage between flow levels, spawning, and recruitment were as strong as some have theorized, recruitment from these years should have occurred.'' The Service believes these types of comparisons are valid only if additional flow-related factors considered important in affecting sturgeon spawning behavior and early age recruitment are considered_the seasonal timing and duration of peak flows to encourage spawning behavior and the effects of load-factoring. For example, recent tracking studies have revealed reproductively mature white sturgeon equipped with radio and sonic transmitters moving upriver to the pre-spawning staging areas downstream of Bonners Ferry around mid-May (Apperson 1992; Marcuson 1993). These fish will commonly stay in the suspected spawning reach immediately upstream through July dependent upon flow conditions and whether they have spawned. In 1974 when the last strong year-class of sturgeon occurred, flows were increasing and remained highest during the May and June period, providing habitat conditions suitable to spawning and survival of eggs/larvae to age 1 recruitment. Peak flows in the Kootenai River have varied seasonally in each year since 1975 when Libby Dam operations began. Load-factoring has affected the discharge stability at Libby Dam and sustained flows through the spawning reach near Bonners Ferry throughout the spring/summer sturgeon reproduction season. For example, in 1981 flows peaked at Bonners Ferry near the same volume as in 1974, but not until July, while higher than normal natural flows (since 1974) peaked around mid-June in 1990, early May in 1991, and May 15 in 1993. Recent monitoring efforts documented white sturgeon spawning in 1991 and 1993, and some level of spawning has likely occurred in several or most years since 1974. The Service believes the combination of diminished mean discharge since 1974 at Bonners Ferry and the effects of daily and weekly load-factoring on flow fluctuations have adversely affected sturgeon spawning behavior and egg/larval survival which has inhibited recruitment to age 1 since 1974. In summary, no new significant distributional or demographic information affecting the status of the white sturgeon were reported by any respondent. Moreover, monitoring and survey programs conducted from 1990 through 1993 substantiate conclusions in the proposed rule that the Kootenai River white sturgeon population continues to decline and recruitment has been virtually non-existent since 1974. There is no recent evidence of successful spawning and survival past the egg stage. Existing regulations and experimental flow programs have not been effective in arresting this decline. The Service maintains that this final rule is based on the best information available. The Service also believes that sufficient information is provided on the Kootenai River population of white sturgeon to warrant making a determination on their status under the Act.
