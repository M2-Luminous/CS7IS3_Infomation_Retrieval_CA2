Shenyang is one of the most important heavy industrial centers in China. The city's gross national product grew at an average annual rate of 15.6 percent to reach 37.45 billion yuan in 1993, an increase of 26 billion yuan over the 1986 figure. The results of monitoring by the environmental agency show that annual mean value of the total suspended particles per cubic meter of air in 1993 was 0.434 mg, 0.87 mg less than in 1986, the amount of monthly dust fall per square kilometer in the year was 29.81 tons, 11.2 tons less than eight years ago and the annual value of the content of sulphur dioxide per standard square meter in the air was 0.122 mg, 0.037 mg less than eight years ago. The city used more than 10 million tons of coal last year, accounting for 70 percent of the total amount of energy consumed. The city has been working hard to eliminate pollution sources, especially soot and dust emitted by factories and family stoves. Restaurants in urban areas of the city are required to use clean fuels. More than 3,000 old-fashioned boilers have been replaced by modern central heating facilities. Any enterprise whose discharge of wastes and dust exceeds the state set standards would be warned or fined. The city authorities have also encouraged a tree planting campaign as part of the efforts to improve the environmental quality.
