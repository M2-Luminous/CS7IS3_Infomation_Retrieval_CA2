Stanislaw Bahdankevich Does Not Violate Laws"] [Text] CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Karatchenya and Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Myacheslaw Hryb, who returned from St. Petersburg, where they participated in the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, organized a news conference for journalists. Myacheslaw Hryb opened the press conference with a joke saying that the journalists were so occupied with the presidential race that they almost forgot about the Supreme Soviet chairman. Myacheslaw Hryb assessed the agreements signed in St. Petersburg and answered a range of questions. The Supreme Soviet chairman was convinced that interest in him and his personal opinions on some pressing issues of our life did not decrease. We paid attention to five key questions which Myacheslaw Hryb had to answer: on CIS prospects, on the initiative -- regarding the creation of the Eurasian union -- of the Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev, on unexpected changes in prices for bread, and on National Bank Chairman Stanislaw Bahdankevich's recent moves. "Our St. Petersburg meeting was very fruitful. In my opinion, work aimed at strengthening the CIS has sense, and the CIS has prospects," is how Supreme Soviet chairman answered the first question. Following are his words regarding Nazarbayev's initiative: "The president of Kazakhstan proposes two versions of the so-called Eurasian union -- mild and tough -- with which we should acquaint our society. What I like in this proposal is that it plans to set a union of states with equal rights. Under these conditions, the obligations of the allies would be more specified because the union does not foresee associate membership. In my opinion, this proposal does not run counter to the CIS. However, I would like to emphasize that the attitude of the CIS leaders toward this initiative is different. "I think that we should not change the text of the Constitution," stated Myacheslaw Hryb regarding the monetary merger. He confirmed his earlier position which is that the state requires a tough Constitution because only such a constitution can be respected. Myacheslaw Hryb said that when he spoke earlier with president Yeltsin, they agreed that the fifth, and, probably, the eighth clauses of the agreement could be redrafted. However, the text of the agreement was submitted to Deputy Prime Minister Shokhin and work halted for a while. As for the unexpected changes in prices for bread and some other foodstuffs, Myacheslaw Hryb said: "The government adopted this decision when I was in St. Petersburg. My personal opinion is that currently we cannot do without state management of the economy. The majority of enterprises are state-owned but the state cannot even affect the prices for products of these enterprises." "We exercised juridical expertise regarding recent decisions adopted by the National Bank. It confirmed that everything was done within the limits of competence," said the Supreme Soviet chairman in reply to the last question. "As for Stanislaw Bahdankevich who adopted presidential candidate Stanislaw Shushkevich's proposal to head his `shadow' cabinet, this is his personal affair. By the way, former Interior Minister Yladzimir Yahoraw also joined the Shushkevich team and became his campaign manager. Well, this is their personal position."
