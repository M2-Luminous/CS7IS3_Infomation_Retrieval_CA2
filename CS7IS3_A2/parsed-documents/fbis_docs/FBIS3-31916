He added the government will maintain all the agreements signed for the approval of the economic plan. Minister Cardoso said that the commitment the government needs from Congress is a zero deficit this year. He explained that there are conditions to compensate, via other measures, for the resources that would have been collected with the income tax increase on large companies and the financial operations tax which were not approved by Congress. [Begin Cardoso recording] From the point of view of numbers, there is no problem in replacing what was denied, but this something else cannot come from the workers or from the middle class; it must come from companies because they benefited from the decision of the minority in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday which opposed the approval of the tax rate increase on companies, which was a small rate. I reaffirm that the struggle against inflation is everyone's struggle for the benefit of the Brazilian people because there are favorable conditions for investment in Brazil -- the time is right. But this is everyone's struggle, otherwise inflation will not be defeated. [end recording] Cardoso also said that the government will continue to fulfill the agreements reached during the negotiations for the approval of the economic plan. He added that in the amendment for the creation of the social emergency fund, the states will also be excluded, like what happened to the municipalities following the retention of the participation fund. Cardoso explained that in exchange for the retention the states accepted a cut in the budget program equivalent to $200 million. The fund will also receive the PIS [Social Integration Program] revenue from the banks.
