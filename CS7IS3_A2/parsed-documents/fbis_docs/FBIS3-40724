Kaul, has emphasised that China posed a primary strategic challenge to India in the long term, notwithstanding the recently-signed LAC [expansion not given] agreement. Stressing the need to develop a sound strategy to meet this "formidable challenge," the air chief observed that China had emerged as the most powerful military nation which with its high rate of economic growth and sustained military programme had drastically altered the military balance in Asia. "India is thus placed with two contrasting security dilemmas. On the one hand, the probability of an armed conflict with China has been reduced in the short term, but in the long term, by 2005, the threat (from China) will be of a different magnitude altogether," he said. Delivering his valedictory address at the end of the two-day seminar on "Challenges to India's national interest in 1995-2010 and Indian response" organised by the United Services Institute, Air Chief Marshal Kaul reflected on the double standards of the U.S. foreign policy, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the unabated low-cost proxy war by Pakistan, the grim internal security situation and the poor quality of the Indian polity. He pointed out how all these factors had a dangerous bearing on India's future national security interests. The air chief strongly advocated India's need for enhancing its conventional military capabilities, while simultaneously initiating confidence-building measures with countries in the neighbourhood to ensure regional stability. Reflecting on recent American efforts to revoke the Pressler amendment on Pakistan, the air chief warned that the fall-out in this eventuality would add to the security complications. "Therefore, as an overall threat perspective, I visualise Pakistan as a potent threat in the short term and China as a potential strategic challenge in the long term", he said. Criticising Pakistan for continuing to exercise the low-cost option of instigating militancy and separatism in Kashmir and Punjab, he observed that since partition Pakistan had been following a single track foreign policy of forcing Kashmir's secession from India. "The prospect of stability and tension-free relations with Pakistan is not in sight. Since Independence, Pakistan has tasted democracy for only a few years and hence, its political framework still remain fragile. Besides, pressures from the military junta and Islamic fundamentalists mixed with a strong perception of its own insecurity has crystalised into adoption of a nuclear weapons programme and a foreign policy inimical to our interests," he said. Accusing the U.S. of hijacking the United Nations, Air Chief Marshal Kaul said that after the Gulf war, the U.N. was being used by the U.S. more as an extension to serve its foreign policy interests. India has been subjected to pressures such as NPT, MTCR, GATT, NAFTA and Super 301, and pointed to the recent trend of "coercive diplomacy in the garb of human rights issues" with a frequent temptation by the west to wield the human rights stick to settle foreign policy issues. Pointing to contradictions in this policy, the air chief said: "The U.S., the so-called champions of human rights, has admonished China for human rights abuses but still continues to finalise business deals and extend military co-operation to China," he said. He regretted that in recent times India's capabilities in international fora has been somewhat eroded due to lack of diplomatic support from Russia which is evident from its policy on cryogenic engines, NPT and even Kashmir. Stressing the need to set the Indian polity in order, the air chief said India needed to be politically cohesive and internally strong. Founders of the constitution had evidently presupposed that our polity would be educated and have basic civic sensibilities. "However, our political system has not been able to meet the aspirations of our people. Today, we see more sectarian, partisan and motivated behaviour with dangers of communalism and fundamentalism causing tremendous strains on the chosen secular fabric of our country," he said.
