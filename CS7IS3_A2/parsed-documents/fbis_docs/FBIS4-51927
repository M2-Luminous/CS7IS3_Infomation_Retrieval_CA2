How can the two nations escape from playing a poker game? Potential Problem of Voluntary Increase of Imports [passage omitted] While trade negotiation is a economic phenomenon, it is also a complex phenomenon in which politics and economics are entwined when we consider the fact that it is an international political negotiation, and that it concerns each participating country's domestic political balance. First, let's look at the economic aspect. The United States has been asking that Japan should open up its market, specifically the product and the service markets, in order to solve Japan-U.S. trade imbalance which has reached $60 billion. Despite Japanese Government's repeated promises to open up its market, Japanese import of U.S. products had not increased. The United States demanded Japan to set an import target (or quota). This concerned mainly the automobile, auto parts, medical equipment, communications, and the insurance fields. In regards to this request, Japan's position was that setting a quota would create a managed trade and did not agree with the principle of free trade. The Hosokawa dministration was working toward easing the governmental control, and they could not agree to setting an import quota which would necessitate reinforcement of governmental control. Viewed in the light of trade theory, Japanese Government's argument is correct. In order for the principle of market to work effectively, it is necessary for buyers to be able to consider the quality, price, delivery, after-sale service, and choose the most advantageous products or services. It is totally against the principle of free trade, which promotes effective production using prices as a type of signal, to set a import target of how many percent of auto parts should be imported from the United States. If regulations of the central or regional governments, or a collusion of industrial organizations or corporate groups are preventing Japanese consumers from purchasing economical and diverse consumer goods and services, or if corporations are kept from importing products that are advantageous for them, such regulations and collusion must be removed. The tariff and non-tariff barriers must be removed. However, voluntry export controls which limit the amount of export from Japan, and the voluntary import-boosting program which sets a quota on Japan's import, completely oppose the principle of free trade which helps worldwide distribution of resources by encouraging each country to make effort in providing products and services efficiently. Furthermore, voluntary import-boosting program could create more problems than voluntary export controls. In the case of voluntary export controls, manufacturers put restraint on production by themselves. This is not desirable, considering the nation's distribution of resources; however, at least the production is done by efficient combination of production factors to produce a certain quantity. But, when there is a quota to fulfill in the quantity of imported parts to be used, they may have to use inferior parts also, thus the efficiency of production itself is hindered. In addition, there is no principle found anywhere in the world trade which consists of many countries that equilibrium of the balance of trade between two countries should be maintained. It is not strange that a country, such as Japan, which has little natural resources, has a deficit in the trade with a country rich with national resources, such as Australia, and has a surplus in the trade with an advanced country, such as the United States. Lester Thoreaw, in the interview with THE NEW YORK TIMES said that he had a trade deficit with his barber and stationary stores. It is based on such understanding on economics, that a group of U.S. economists, including Jagdish Bhagwati, Hugh Patrick, and Gary Saxonhouse, sent an autograph letter (the author of this article also signed it) to Japanese Government to warn them not to agree to the U.S. Government's request for voluntary import-boosting program easily, and that a group of Japanese economists (representative: Kazuo Ueda, professor of Tokyo University) also issued a similar statement. The U.S. reaction was as follows: They understood Japan's position based on the principle of free trade. Under the Republican administration, the United States had demanded Japan remove tariff and non-tariff barriers. Notwithstanding that Japanese Government had promised cooperation in this matter, in reality, however, there were no visible results concerning opening of the market. As an intimidatory strategy, the United States has decided to demand Japan to set a quota--according to President Clinton, to make Japan agree to quantitative and qualitative standard (indicator or criterion). Since their regular tactics did not work, they are hoping that Japan's closed door may open with imposition of quota. The Structure of "Double-Layer Game" The trade negotiation must also be looked at from politicoeconomic point of views. Trade negotiation is generally understood as an attempt by representatives from two countries to solve a conflict of interests between the two countries, each trying to make it more advantageous for his own country. However, it does not mean that the nations concerned have definite national interests. There are complex interests, such as the interests of export industry, the interests of import industry, and interests of consumers. For this reason, when we look at a trade negotiation as a game, the game between two governments are played on the ground of domestic games of conflict of interests. In this sense a trade negotiation has a structure of "double-layer game." Naturally, domestic political situations put limits on how far the government can compromise with the other government. On the other hand, international negotiations can influence the domestic political balance in a subtle way. The recent breakdown of Japan-U.S. negotiation must be understood in the light of domestic political balance in the two countries. As mentioned in the beginning of this article, although President Clinton has many problems both domestically and internationally, the U.S. economy has been recovering smoothly. However, the rate of economic recovery varies regionally, and recovery of California and New England is slow. Also in this recovery, the production and the consumption may be increasing, but unemployment rate is still high due to rationalization by reduction of labor force. President Clinton hoped to score points by succeeding in Japan-U.S. trade negotiation, but this did not happen. The opposition party, Republicans, did not opposed to Clinton's policy to demand Japan to open the market, though they did not agree to managed trade, Clinton's position would not have been any easier domestically even if the Japan-U.S. talks reached a compromise. Prime Minister Hosokawa is backed by a very shaky coalition government. In any country, the interests of manufacturers are more likely to become a political pressure than the interests of consumers. However, this tendency is especially strong in Japan. (Refer to the author's book From My Study Room at Yale University published from NTT Press in 1993.) The customs tariff is low; however, the Japanese manufacturers have been cordially protected in various ways, such as import restriction of agricultural products symbolized by the rice issue, overprotection on financial and securities, and insurance industries, the closedness of construction industry seen in the `dango' [bid-rigging by collusion], the recession cartel, and regulation of air, rail road, and bus fares. There is International Finance Bureau in both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry has International Policy Bureau, and the Economic Planning Agency has Economic Welfare Bureau. These bureaus reflect both directly and indirectly the pressures from outside, as well as the consumers' position. However, the traditional Japanese Government has reflected the manufacturers' interests of certain industries more strongly, as indicated in the term "genkyoku" [principle bureaus]. The Hosokawa administration set out a policy to ease bureaucratic regulations and to reflect consumer interests. The administration has begun to take action favorable for consumers in handling the issue of importing rice, which had been a difficult political problem. In addition to the conflict between consumers and manufacturers in Japan, the United States is watching the power relationship between Japanese politicians and the bureaucracy. Some (for example UCLA's Dr. Rosenberg say that politicians are more powerful in Japan also, citing the MOF's banking and securities agreement as an example. Others (for example Junko Kato of Tokyo University) say that the introduction of consumer tax, which was unpopular among the people as well as politicians, was possible because the bureaucrats were able to manipulate politicians, using their expert knowledge and skills. In this sense, the intricacies of the current economic policy are interesting. In collaboration with Prime Minister Hosokawa's income tax reduction policy, it was the MOF that suggested to raise the consumption tax to 7 percent in 1997. However, the Social Democratic Party of Japan, the main party of the coalition, opposed to this plan and the tax raise did not come through. This gave the impression that politicians may have influence. However, upon discovering that the tax reduction is only for one year, I realized just how strong the bureaucrats' power is. What we must pay attention is that voluntary export controls and voluntary import-boosting program have different domestic interests structures. First, let me explain the voluntary export controls. Politically, it is easier for exporting companies to approve voluntary export controls. Unlike being imposed a custom duty on by a foreign government or meeting a minimum import quota, the exporters can expect to monopolize profits by restricting production. Consumers abroad will suffer, but their voice is weak. The reason many countries often agree to voluntary export controls is that the incentive mechanism described above is at work. On the other hand, in the case of voluntary import-boosting program, it is difficult to find a group that benefits from voluntary import-boosting program, no matter how strongly foreign exporters demand it. When imports increase, the price of imported products declines. This is beneficial for the Japanese consumers. However, the logic of imposing an import quota, that regardless of how effective or ineffective the products are, it will be beneficial for the consumers, is quite indirect. A simple and specific request for deregulation, such as "Remove the trade restrictions" is more effective in appealing to the consumers. Just as voluntary export controls, voluntary import-boosting program requires intervention of the supervisory office as well. However, they probably do not like to intervene, knowing that it will not be profitable for the industry, even though they are used to controlling and giving governmental guidance. One of the causes of the trade negotiation breakdown was that there were no incentives in voluntary import-boosting program as in voluntary export controls. The Process Toward "Adult Relationship" People in the United States tend to exercise what they insisted regardless of the other party's situation. Now that the trade negotiation has ruptured, they will try to impose some kind of sanctions on Japan. We can see this in the custom duty on Japanese car phones. This action was taken as a measure responding to Motorola's appeal to restrict Japanese car phones export. In addition, there have been other sanctions reported, such as import restriction on several Japanese products by means of custom duty, and restriction on Japanese corporations' investment in the export bonded processing area. Furthermore, they have named dozens of Japanese corporations as their target of sanction. Upon returning to Japan, Prime Minister Hosokawa and those close to him clearly stated that if the United States should take sanction against Japan, Japan would retaliate, or appeal to GATT. As U.S. newspapers report, the Clinton administration wants to open up Japanese market by strongly pressuring Japan. However, they are racking their brains as to how to avoid a trade war between the two countries and to keep both countries from falling into the undesirable protected trade situation ("Prisoner's dilemma"--Refer to the Note). Prime Minister Hosokawa must share the feeling. Note: "Prisoner's dilemma" means that if each of the two prisoners, who had been confined separately, cooperated and did not confess their crime, both of them will be cleared of the charge. However, if one confessed and the other did not, the one who confessed will be pardoned, and the one who did not will be convicted. This situation is a dilemma for both of the prisoners. Since they are both afraid that the other may confess, they both may end up confessing their crime. The battle between Japan and the United States resembles a poker game. Both countries are trying to threaten each other with retaliatory measures in case of betrayal, waiting for the other to give up, each trying to reach a solution which is advantageous to its national interests. However, this game is in vain if trade negotiation come to a breakdown. For the United States, which dealt with international relationship as if playing a game, the recent trade negotiations have been like walking on a tight rope. It is also a very difficult situation for Japan, which has been like a brother to the United States and has been used to cooperating with the United States. However, what is fortunate for both countries is that trade will continue, and the trade negotiation will also take place again. If it were a one time game, it will be highly possible that both countries to be in the "prisoner's dilemma" because their distrust in each other may make them betray each other. But since the game will continue, they may try to cooperate, fearing each others retaliatory measures in the future. These strategic reasons and the trust relationship between the leaders of the two nations bring a ray of hope in the future of Japan-U.S. economy. As the prime minister himself has said, the last summit meeting can be understood as a process in which Japan-U.S. relationship is changing from the "big brother - little brother relationship" to "equal adults relationship." The United States was irritated that the obedient little brother would not do what he promised while saying "We understand" concerning the U.S. request to open up its market. Now Japan has begun to say, "We have grown up now. We would like to negotiate as equals. We cannot give away to the United States concerning the free trade principle." The United States told Japan to speak up clearly as they themselves do, but when Japan did just that, they did not like it. The growing pain is necessary for Japanese economic diplomacy. When we see fast speaking Clinton in a press conference or watch a discussion between Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Saxonhouse, (ex-presidential candidates), on CNN (Cross Fire), we come to realize that Japanese politicians must improve their communications skill in order to share the world leadership. However, though he did not use many words, Prime Minister Hosokawa clearly declaraed his intention and that seemed to have given a favorable impression on people in the United States. He was especially persuasive when he said, "I am fighting with the bureaucratic restrictions in Japan. I cannot agree to the quantitative quota which would require industrial restrictions." President Clinton sounded rather defensive when he said, "The United States is not demanding a quantitative quota. We are merely requesting establishment of objective quantitative and qualitative criteria which can indicate the degree of openness of the market." As the idea of Japan that can say "No" takes roots, a meaningful and clear communications style will be understood more and more. Unpredictable Future Situations Changing the subject, let's discuss the balance between the exchange rate and the macroeconomics. The news of collapse of Japan-U.S. trade negotiation created a stir in the world financial market, and stock prices in Japan fell sharply. Especially, the yen rate soared by as much as 4 percent in a day. Because they failed to set a quantitative quota, high yen rate is the only way to diminish the trade imbalance. Therefore, the market reacted on the prediction that the U.S. Government will take measures to approve or promote a high exchange rate of the yen. When cheap dollar was expected, there was the fear that the number of purchasers of treasury bills will decrease. Thus the short-term interest rate also rose in the United States. However, it is doubtful whether intervention in the exchange market by Japanese or the U.S. Governments will be able to control the yen rate. But, the reaction of the exchange market is understandable because now that Japan must expand its economy even more after the collapse of trade talks in order to reduce their trade surplus, and this will lead to higher interest rates and bring about the yen's higher exchange rate. We should also pay attention that under the floating exchange rate system, the effect of financial and monetary policies is different from that of the fixed exchange rate system. Under the fixed exchange rate system, both an expansive monetary policy and an expansive financial policy would stimulate the domestic economy and reduce the surplus balance of current revenue and expenditure, (and where movement of the capital is allowed, a financial policy would work more effectively). On the contrary, under the floating exchange rate system, while an expansionary monetary policy may help expand the domestic economy, it may also increase the surplus because of the lowered interest rates and the cheap yen. On the other hand, an expansionary financial policy may help reduce the surplus through higher interest rate and the yen's high exchange rate, but it may not help the economic recovery. Japan needs to expand its fiscal policy in order to reduce the surplus balance of current revenue and expenditure, and it needs easing of monetary and financial policies for economic recovery. Incidentally, it was interesting to watch the progress of their tax reduction proposal in the light of macroeconomic effect. The income tax reduction would increase consumers' disposable income and is effective for stimulating the economy. However, if the consumtion tax raise is planned for three years later, the constant income, which indicates the consumers' average income toward the future, would not rise very much and the stimulant effect would not be very strong. However, those who predict that prices will go up in three years may try to buy up durable consumer goods. If this bill had passed, it would have been an interesting experiment to see how well this type of stimulating effect might have worked. This bill turned out to be only a one-year tax reduction bill. The constant income will change little, and the stimulant effect on the economy will be very weak. Acting as an adult means that there are some responsibilities to fulfill. Now that Japan has refused the quantitative quota, it must strongly declare that it will increase access to Japanese market from outside in some other ways. This should lead to the welfare of Japanese consumers. At present, it is unpredictable as to what kind of sanctions and retaliatory measures will be repeated between Japan and the United States. Will their action result in going against the world's free trade trend? There is no knowing whether the two adults will come to an agreement and escape the "prisoner's dilemma." The Policy Japan Should Take Thinking about the matter calmly, it is hard to believe that there is an impossible gap to overcome between the interests of the two nations. First, let's look at the industries at issue. Since Prime Minister Hosokawa's policy is to ease restrictions, he must theoretically be for reducing the interests of the government agencies, (Ministry of Health and Welfare, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and Ministry of Finance), that oversee medical equipment, communications, insurance industries, and their supporting industries. Internationally insisting on free trade, Mr. Hosokawa must make serious efforts to remove the non-tariff barrier created by government restrictions. It is a good opportunity for him to take advantage of the collapse of the international negotiation, which is a semi-emergency situation, to overcome the domestic conflict of interests. Second, since Japan has been troubled by a recession for a long time, its attempt to solve the imbalance of current revenue and expenditure will not create a zerosome situation for the two countries. This is because recovery of Japanese economy through macroeconomic policy will at the same time help reduce Japan's trade surplus with the United States. As I mentioned earlier, financial expenditure and tax reduction are effective in reducing the surplus of the current revenue and expenditure balance. However, these would cause the yen's exchange rate to rise and might turn into be a recession creating pressure. An easy-money policy may help stimulate the economy but may cause the yen to become cheap and increase the surplus of current balance. A desirable "policy mix" of macro policy is to reduce tax--not just one year--and if this begins to cause a high interest rates and high yen rates, to ease monetary policy, (of course, if cheap yen situation should progress, or if the available employment competition rate exceeds one, Bank of Japan is responsible to enforce monetary restraint and avoid reviving the "bubble economy"). Of course, the cause of the current account deficit of the United States is its financial deficit and the low savings rate of the public. Japanese Government needs to continue to point this out to the United States. Some say that the government deficit and the current account deficit have not been linked together in the past few years. Even if this was true, the deficit should be blamed on the low savings rate of the public, the tax system which should promote saving, and the economic policy. It is a good news that Japan is growing to be able to say "No" in the international society. However, it is not easy to be responsible for what has been clearly said. This is evident in the fact that the United States is strongly demanding Japan to meet the "reasonable criteria" which Prime Minister Miyazawa vaguely agreed to. Japanese economic diplomacy needs to gain strength which is both firm and flexible--sometimes being angry and sometimes using humor to dodge the other's attack--so that avoid simply submitting to foreign countries' (traditionally the United States) will, and at the same time, avoid upsetting the other party and causing a breakdown of negotiation.
