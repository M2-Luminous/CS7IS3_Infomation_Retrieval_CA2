The records held by the U.S. Congress contain information that confirms that the United States and Jordan have violated the UN sanctions against Iraq in order to provide humanitarian aid to northern Iraq. A statement by Lee Hamilton, head of the House Subcommittee on Europe and Middle East Affairs, has been placed on record. It is as follows: "It is all right for Jordan and the United States to violate the embargo, but it seems that we do not want anyone else to do the same." While the officials of the U.S. Defense and State Departments briefed the subcommittee on the U.S. policy on Iraq, Hamilton asked: "The Accounting Office, which is affiliated with the Congress, has claimed that we acquire oil from Iraq. Is that right?" Ronald Newman, head of the State Department's office for Iran and Iraq affairs, replied to Hamilton. He said: "We acquire the oil through mediators in northern Iraq. That is more economic." The views Hamilton and Newman exchanged are as follows: [Hamilton] I was informed a short while ago that the sanctions are important and that they should be maintained. As far as I can see, the United States allows Jordan to acquire oil from Iraq. Does that not conflict with our policy? [Newman] I do not believe that it conflicts with our general policy. The terminology we use should be clear. I do not deny the source which supplies the oil. [Hamilton] We are maintaining the sanctions together with the rest of the world. However, we have acquired oil from Iraq. Do you disagree? [Newman] The UN Security Council Resolution 689 contains humanitarian provisions. We work with a limited budget." [Hamilton] We also allow Jordan to acquire the oil it needs from Iraq. Is that not so? [Newman] Yes, that is right. Jordan has been receiving oil from Iraq in return for that country's debts for some time now. The UN Sanctions Committee has placed that on record. [Hamilton] It is alright for Jordan and the United States to violate the embargo, but it seems that we do not want anyone else to do the same. [Newman] We do not believe that we have violated the embargo. What we have done was for humanitarian purposes. Hamilton also asked why they have asked for $15 million for their aid operations in northern Iraq from the budget for 1995. A State Department official said that the cash was required for the basic needs of the people in northern Iraq. Meanwhile, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly has disclosed that U.S. officials are holding talks with the Turkish Government on the question of retrieving the oil in the pipeline between Turkey and Iraq. Stressing that she realizes how important the lifting of the embargo on Iraq is for Turkey, Shelly said: "However, Washington is opposed to any initiative against the embargo."
