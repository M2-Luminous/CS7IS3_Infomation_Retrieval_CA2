Like your previous messages, this one clearly shows your constant consideration for the destiny of our country and the Cambodian race in your role as the father of peace and national reconciliation who wants to hold a roundtable meeting to achieve national reconciliation and peace quickly. In accord with the constant position of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], all of us -- to the best of our ability -- have always studied and thought about how to assist, support, and fulfill Your Majesty's national reconciliation initiative. This responds to the profound aspirations of the Cambodian nation and of every Cambodian. For reasons Your Majesty is already well aware of, though, I am of the opinion that under current circumstances, in order to ensure security and provide equal status to all sides attending the roundtable meeting, the meeting should be held in one of the places Your Majesty suggested in your second formula or another neutral place. Your Majesty is already aware that Phnom Penh is not safe for the PDK delegation and is also not a neutral venue. Please forgive any improprieties. [Signed] PDK Chairman Khieu Samphan [Dated] 1 May 1994
