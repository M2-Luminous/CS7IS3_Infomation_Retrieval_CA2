Backed by Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam to harness the potential of the region's largest river, the 4,350 km-long Mekong, the multi-billion dollar project will ultimately create three large economic zones in the region's most backward areas. Should China and Myanmar [Burma] join in, the investments flowing in is expected to turn into a flood. The four Mekong countries envision the setting-up of the Strategic Study Projects, comprising the three large economic zones, along the course of the river and its tributaries that flow through Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. These zones will come alive with 11 hydroelectricity generation plants, half a dozen harbours and bridges, and an ambitious agriculture and irrigation programme to be cranked into motion by multilateral loans. But politics often got in the way of economics. The future of the 37-year-old Mekong Committee -- a four-country group that coordinates the development -- is in jeopardy due to differences among the four. The four dissolved the committee in December 1992 and agreed to forge a new deal on sharing the river water. However, a September 1993 deadline for setting up a new committee passed without agreement being reached. Thailand has now blocked Cambodia's bid to rejoin a new Mekong Committee until a water-sharing pact is hammered out. Cambodia, which quit the committee when the Khmer Rouge took over the country in 1975, is however, supported by Vietnam and Laos. Phnom Penh officials have repeatedly told Thailand not to link the membership issue with the water sharing pact. But Thailand, facing a severe drought, wants more freedom in using water. However, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia would like the four to reach prior consensus before any water is used. Tie Limthong, deputy permanent secretary of the Cambodia National Mekong Committee told BUSINESS TIMES [BT] this week: "Cambodia has not yet been re-admitted to the Mekong Committee. A date for the next committee meeting has not yet been set." Other differences are over inclusion of China and Myanmar in the Mekong Committee. Thailand recently proposed the inclusion [of] both countries, but as the other three members were not enthusiastic, the proposal was dropped for the time being. Efforts to get the committee running are on, and a breakthrough is expected. The committee's work has since been carried out by an interim committee financially supported by the United Nations. In the face of this dithering, the well-fleshed out economic zones will have to bide their time. The first one, called the Upper Mekong Navigation zone lying up-stream in the north, consists of Myanmar, Laos, and small parts of Thailand, Vietnam, and China's Yunnan province. The concept to build effective navigation and transport systems on the river and its tributaries will benefit a wide swathe from Jinghong in China's Yunnan province, down to Luang Prabang in Laos, covering distance of about 700 km. The Mekong Committee says that riverine and cross-border trade between Laos, Thailand, China and Myanmar will increase from the present annual level of 20,000 tonnes to over 250,000 tonnes in the year 2000 -- of which 210,000 tonnes are expected to be transported on the Mekong River, and the remaining on its tributaries such as Nam Ou in Laos. To prevent bottlenecks from choking off the Mekong, the committee plans an ambitious study. Economic development in the zone was boosted with the recent completion of a landmark 700 metre-long bridge over the Mekong connecting the Lao capital of Vientiane with Thailand. This makes it possible to drive from Singapore to China across Malaysia, Thailand and Laos. The US$30 million (S$ [Singapore dollars] 47 million) bridge was funded by Australia. However, Laos was cool to a Thai proposal to build a second bridge over the Mekong. The Lao government told the Thais to wait until the country's internal roads and telecommunications had improved. Landlocked Laos has also been eyeing prospects of trade with the Chinese province of Yunnan. Both countries have opened a river route to accommodate 150-tonne barges. Cars from Thailand travel through Laos to markets in Yunnan, and business is booming as middlemen en route take their cuts. The Upper Mekong Navigation area is also the focus of a major road development programme. Last year, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar and China agreed to set up transport links through the remote Golden Triangle -- a move that will give the booming southern Chinese provinces their first overland access to Southeast Asia. A second economic zone is the Southern Lao Transport Corridor straddling southern Laos, northern Cambodia and central Vietnam. The development rationale for this area is to provide landlocked Laos with access roads to a seaport in Vietnam. Lao Deputy Prime Minister Khamphoui Keoboualapha told BT that his country plans to build a deep seaport in Quang Binh in central Vietnam, financed by a build-operate-and-transfer scheme or multilateral loans. The idea for a port and a road linking Laos with Vietnam was first suggested several years ago by Laos' late president Kaysone Phomvihan. Thailand entered the picture when former Thai premier Chatchai Chunhawan adopted the concept as a way to flesh out his policy of turning Indochinese battlefields into marketplaces. Thailand, too, is keen to build economic ties with Vietnam and wants to extend a road from Thailand to Vietnam through Laos. Under this plan, Laos would serve as a land-bridge for Thailand to enter Vietnam. The region is integrating ever closer with an agreement between Thailand and Laos to build a road linking the north-eastern Thai province of Ubon to the southern Lao province of Champassak. A third economic zone that goes by the name of Inland Navigation Strategy stretches in a wide arc across Cambodia and encompasses a small part of southern Vietnam. The thrust is on improving river-borne transport of people and cargo that is crucial to the predominantly agricultural Cambodia economy. Destroyed by the long civil war, the river's infrastructure such as ports and bridges need urgent repair, and large parts of the river are silted and need to be dredged. By far the biggest investments are being drawn into building electricity-generating plants in all three economic zones. As many as 11 plants are to be built along the course of the Mekong and its tributaries in Laos, Cambodia and Laos in addition to 11 existing plants. The Mekong basin possesses a potential to generate 58,000 mw [megawatts] of hydroelectricity. Studies show it would be technically and economically feasible to harness about 37,000 mw. Of this amount, a mere 245 mw -- less than one per cent of the basin's potential -- has been exploited through the construction of 11 dams along the tributaries. These include the Nam Pong and Lam Dom Noi in Thailand and the largest, the Nam Ngum in Laos with an installed capacity of 150 mw -- 80 per cent of which is exported to Thailand. Power projections in the lower Mekong basin show that demand will rise three-fold from about 10,000 mw in 1990 to 24,000 mw in 2000. Thailand will account for about 70 per cent of the demand and require an additional power generation capacity of about 1,000 mw a year from the year 2000 onwards. To hook up the Mekong region, an integrated transmission system is planned to link the river-based generating plants which will be economically more attractive than either isolated national grids or several parallel regional systems. While this is still in the distant future, another regional system is set to take off. Next week, Vietnam will be fully linked with a new 1,500-km power line connecting the Hoa Binh hydroelectric plant, 74 km north of Hanoi to Phu Lam in Ho Chi Minh City. The 500 kv [kilovolts] transmission line will supply 2.5 billion kwh [kilowatt hours] for Vietnam's southern cities. While large projects are the order of the day, the Mekong countries are also keen on micro-hydropower to accelerate rural electrification. Micro plants -- already operational in some Indochinese countries -- are considered environmentally safe compared with diesel generators which have mushroomed all over Cambodia and Vietnam in order to beat the power shortage. Micro plants, moreover, do no dislocate huge numbers of people from their homes and their ecological impact is much less. For instance, the 20 mw Nam Mae Kham power project in the Thai part of the lower Mekong basin will enable the state to reduce electricity generation by a diesel plant to help meet demand in Chiang Rai which is just 40 km from the plant site, in addition to supplying 5,000 farming families in the area. It's a different story in Laos where mini-hydropower plants supplying only the domestic market often turn out to be costly as the power market to be served is small and the energy price low in comparison to the investment. Still, a 115 kv transmission line from Nam Ngum to Luang Prabang is being planned as a first step to electrify remote northern Laos. But the line's full power-carrying capacity cannot be utilised during the initial years of operation due to the small domestic power market. However, by connecting various small power plants to the line, the line can operate at full capacity right from the start. After Laos, Cambodia has the second-largest hydropower potential of over 8,000 mw. At present, the country has a few plants, each with a capacity of less than 10 mw and a combined capacity of 85 mw. Construction of some of Cambodia's projects, such as Prek Thnaot dam, commenced in 1969 but stalled due to the war. The process began again in 1989 but got bogged down in issues relating to resettlement of some 11,000 people. The Mekong projects also involve enormous river works such as rehabilitating Phnom Penh port which threatens to become a major bottleneck in the water transport system if further expansion is not carried out early. All this must wait until the Mekong Committee gets its act together.
