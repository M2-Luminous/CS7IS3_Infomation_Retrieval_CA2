FR941031-1-00014 FR941031-1-00002 It should be noted that insurance is the only related service for which there is any restriction on employee incentive compensation. At this time, the FCA has concluded that there is no need for similar limitations on other related services because those services are not as directly linked to the loan-making process. Furthermore, customers may be able to more readily evaluate the benefit of other related services. 3. Section 618.8040_Other Regulatory Changes The requirement in ยง618.8040(b)(10) that the bank review annually the individual association member insurance services would be eliminated. This provision was originally included to be consistent with other related service requirements in subpart A, which are now also to be removed. The proposed rule removes the annual review requirement from both subparts A and B. As previously discussed, the FCA believes the review function is most appropriately handled at the level of the institution offering the program. The FCA expects that each institution offering insurance will review its program periodically to determine that it is operating in a safe and sound manner and that it remains consistent with the institution's business plan and long-term strategic goals. In order to reflect the creation of Agricultural Credit Banks, the FCA clarifies that under proposed ยง618.8040(a) ACBs may provide insurance to the persons eligible to borrow as identified in titles I and II of the Act and corresponding regulations. This would not be a change from the existing regulations. Technical changes were also made to parts 611 and 620 in order to conform with the proposed regulatory changes in part 618, subparts A and B.
