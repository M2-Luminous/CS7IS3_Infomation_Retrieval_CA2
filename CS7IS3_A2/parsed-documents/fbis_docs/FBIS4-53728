Speaking at a senior party members' meeting, Kim said, "social unrest is expected in June whether we want it or not.... labor unions and campuses are restless and the matter of the national teachers' union, which vows to rearm itself once it is organized, also is uneasy." Moreover, the North Korean nuclear problem poses many unanswered questions, although a breakthrough seems to have been reached, Kim said. The ruling party chairman demanded that the parliamentary investigation into the Sangmudae scandal be concluded in a firm and rational way with the party floor leader playing a central role, expressing concern that the probe will create an uproar. Kim's remarks were considered a call for the party to address domestic political issues next month when President Kim Young-sam pays a state visit to Russia. The comments, however, also reflected ruling party lawmakers' view of the current political uneasiness arising from radical campus activities and labor unions striving to form a new national alliance, experts say.
