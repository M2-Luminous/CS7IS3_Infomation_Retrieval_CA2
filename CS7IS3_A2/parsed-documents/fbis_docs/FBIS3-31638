I was assigned this task by the newly elected members of the Duma of the Russian Federation," Mr. Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Duma, the lower chamber of Russia's Federal Assembly, told the press. He is heading a Russian parliamentary delegation which arrived here today. The chairman of Bulgaria's parliament, Mr. Aleksandur Yordanov, said he was happy that a Russian parliamentary delegation of such a high rank has come to Bulgaria immediately after the parliamentary elections and the passage of Russia's new Constitution. "Mr. Rybkin and I will have the opportunity to discuss various issues of bilateral cooperation as well as legislation problems in connection with the reform in our countries, and last but not least, we intend to discuss the situation in the Balkans," he explained. In connection with the latest developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina Mr. Rybkin said that whatever happens, NATO's ultimatum should not be carried out and that a peaceful way out of the conflict will have to be found. Russian MP's believe that in order to find a peaceful settlement, the concerned parties should accept the proposal of the foreign minister, the government and the president of Russia that the members of the UN Security Council meet in Geneva and that all sanctions be lifted. During its four-day visit here the Russian delegation will meet with Parliament Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, the parliamentary political forces, Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov, and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. The delegation will also be received by President Zhelyu Zhelev. Tomorrow the delegation is scheduled to visit Pleven (in northern Bulgaria).
