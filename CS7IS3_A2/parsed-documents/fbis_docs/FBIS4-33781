Approximately 100 business, intellectual, as well as many other organizations participated in this demonstration. In essence, Congressman Charles Rangel as well as other political figures, intellectuals, and businessmen believe that maintaining the blockade is an ill-fated remnant of the Cold War which punishes the Cuban people and hampers legitimate interests of U.S. firms, who are interested in trading with Cuba. Among other reasons, they argue the fact that the United States maintains good trade relations with two socialist nations with which it fought in the past: China and Vietnam. The truth is that if someone expects to find a reason -- even from the most radical perspective of extreme conservatism -- to justify the existence of the blockade, it would be difficult for that individual to find an intelligent reason that does not contradict the agreements on trade, such as the latest one within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or principles of the UN Charter, which sustain international rights. Each day, two arguments gain force in the heart of U.S. society, one being of an ethical nature and the other of legitimate interests. The first points out that it is unfair, with or without political reasons, to punish an entire people, who only want peace and respect for their decisions regarding domestic policy. The other argument is linked to legitimate interests of U.S. businessmen who see in Washington's unwillingness to authorize them to trade in and with Cuba a serious hindrance to their legitimate business interests. I have just learned, to give an example, that the Texaco Corporation is interested in participating in exploration and drilling for oil in Cuba, under the same conditions as the European, Canadian, and Latin American firms. Other sectors, such as the food, pharmaceutical, tourist, and airline, as well as many other industries -- a long list which would be embarrassing to read -- do not want to be excluded from the opportunity of doing business in Cuba due to a prohibition by Washington, a prohibition basically supported by political stubbornness.
