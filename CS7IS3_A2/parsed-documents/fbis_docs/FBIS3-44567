The top CPC leaders view the use of "Mao's birth" to negate Deng Xiaoping's theory and line as a "left" deviation and the total negation of Mao Zedong as a "right" deviation. They have sensed that the resurgence of "leftism" is very terrible. Therefore, while marking the 100th anniversary of Mao's birth, they want to limit the scope of the activities. The Contradiction Between Respecting and Degrading Mao On 13 December, the CPC Central Committee Secretariat held a teleconference of party and government leading cadres of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, at which Hu Jintao delivered a speech and conveyed the central instruction on activities recently carried out by local authorities to mark the centenary of the birth of Mao Zedong. The instruction says: We must undertake commemorative activities in strict accordance with the requirements set out by the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, rather than on a large scale. We must not debate the appraisal of Mao Zedong. We must not force others to undertake such activities and must not urge prefectures, cities, enterprises, democratic parties or organizations to do so. We must do a good job in the current central work and tasks, and must study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The Central Committee urged preventing and checking both "left" and right deviations making use of activities in some localities and departments to stage a resurgence, as well as a guard against negating the basic appraisal of and conclusion on Mao Zedong which were made at the Sixth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee. The remark "not debating" laid bare the contradiction between respecting and degrading Mao, and the awkward predicament in which the CPC decisionmaking body found itself. Hu Jintao: Prevent a Handful of People From Whipping Up the "Leftist" Ideological Trend At the conference, Hu Jintao pointed out the acuteness of the contradiction when he said: In some localities and departments, debates on the appraisal of Mao Zedong and the understanding of Mao Zedong Thought have caused work delays and even clashes at meetings. He urged promptly correcting this abnormal, disorganized anarchy and lack of discipline, and preventing a handful of people in one or two departments from using activities marking the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth to whip up the "leftist" ideological trend, and to attack and negate reform and opening up to the outside world, the party's central work, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory. The "clashes at meetings" mentioned by Hu Jintao referred to brutally attacking each other by banging on tables. This state of affairs is rarely seen in regular activities or at other meetings of CPC organizations. This being the case, Hu Jintao -- in all seriousness -- termed the state of affairs "abnormal, disorganized anarchy and lack of disciple." This remark was also an embodiment of Deng Xiaoping's idea of "guarding against rightism, but mainly preventing `leftism.'" Those Who Want To Restore the "Leftist" Line Will Be Removed From Office As for as those who want to use activities marking "Mao's birth" to restore the "leftist," line the CPC decisionmaking body will resort to wielding the killer mace -- dismissal from office -- against them. At the conference, Hu Jintao said: Party committees and governments at all levels must have a firm grasp of leadership and the initiative, pay close attention to the current central work, and prevent and criticize the handful of people attempting to divert the orientation of this work. Those who refuse to correct their mistakes after being helped must quit their leading positions and the party. Those who capitalize on "Mao's birth" in order to inflame and agitate people constitute a "tiny minority of people." Most party- member cadres -- particularly those who greatly suffered during the Great Cultural Revolution -- either showed indifference or had an extremely strong aversion to "Mao's birth." Marking "Mao's Birth" Is Regarded as a Task According to restricted XINHUA news reports, most central departments, commissions, and offices regarded conducting activities to mark the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth as a task. The meetings, report meetings, and forums marking the occasion were very dull and spiritless, with more than 30 percent of the expected participants requesting leave. At the report meetings sponsored by central organs to commemorate the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth, some veteran comrades raised objections and said the commemoration was "inappropriate in timing and not in keeping with the common aspirations of the party and the people." Still other veteran comrades denounced the errors committed by Mao Zedong during his final years and the catastrophe brought about by the Great Cultural Revolution. Some excessively fierce clashes between people with differing views took place at some meetings. These phenomena could be found among both the central and local authorities. Restricted News Reports Show Local Authorities' Resistance to Commemorating "Mao's Birth" According to restricted XINHUA news reports on 15 and 16 December, among the activities sponsored by local authorities to mark the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth, the following phenomena could be found almost everywhere. 1. Local party and government leaders regarded conducting activities to mark the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth as a task assigned from the higher authorities; in most cases, local party and government organizations carried the activities only perfunctorily. 2. In doing their work, propaganda departments found themselves under great pressure. They were afraid both of evoking repercussions among their subordinates by exceeding the central commemoration requirements and of not attaining the goals of the commemoration activities. 3. Organization departments were passive in their work. Most cadres, party members, and activists were unenthusiastic, and some remained unconvinced as to the purpose of all the activities. 4. Grass-roots party organizations and some party committees stated openly that they did not want to carry out the commemoration activities for fear that the "leftist" ideological trend would spread again, that the activities would hamper their work, and that they would serve as a blow to the feelings of middle-aged and elderly intellectuals. 5. The community was interested in Mao Zedong's life, style, and related stories, which had a relatively great impact. Some people did not understand why the Communists -- who did not believe in gods or heresy -- could praise and commemorate someone as a god. It is not difficult to understand why local cadres have defiant feelings to the commemoration of "Mao's birth." They all are afraid of the resurgence of "leftism" because their interests would be greatly harmed should the disaster of "leftism" befall the country again. This situation merits attention. Peng Zhen: Do Not Provoke the People To Review the Bitter Experiences of the Mao Years It has been reported that in early December 1993, Peng Zhen made another speech on the commemoration of centenary of Mao Zedong's birth. He urged stressing on appropriateness, realism, paying attention to reactions from within both the party and society, and refraining from provoking the people to review the bitter experiences of the Mao years. Some Eighty Research Fellows Urged the Central Committee To Guard Against "Leftism" More than 80 research fellows at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences wrote a letter to Jiang Zemin and the party Central Committee to urge preventing Mao Zedong's "leftist" ideological trend disrupting the current central work and undermining the confidence and rallying force of the broad masses of people for carrying out the four modernizations in the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and that history, as well as the will of the majority of people inside and outside the party, be respected. The Voice Opposing the Commemoration of "Mao's Birth" Is Building Up At the third plenary session discussions, the party committees of Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shandong, Anhui, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Fujian, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia reported to the Central Committee that in society there were strong voices opposed to commemorating the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth. More than 17 celebrities in Shanghai and Beijing stated that they would go on a hunger strike on 26 December to protest the commemoration. Two Hunan Teachers Kill Themselves To Protest "Mao's Birth" Commemorative Activities Unexpectedly, there actually were people who killed themselves to protest the commemoration of "Mao's birth." This hearsay came from Mao's birthplace: Hunan. Since the beginning of 1993, two middle school teachers from Hengyang and Xiangtan cities in Hunan had written 10 or more letters to the CPC Central Committee, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and the Hunan Provincial CPC Committee, calling for a halt to nationwide activities marking the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth or at least for carrying out the activities in a low-key manner. They said the activities should be carried out in accordance with the principle of voluntary participation. In August, during the summer holidays, with the signatures of nearly 30 university and middle school teachers, the two teachers asked to go to Beijing to make their demands known. A deputy director of the Complaints Bureau of the State Council said: We understand your wishes, but the matter must be decided by the Central Committee. The Hunan Provincial CPC Committee criticized the two teachers and warned them against being used and against creating chaos. It has been reported that the two teachers wrote a letter to Deng Xiaoping entitled "Comrade Xiaoping, People Are Longing for Your Decision" and a letter to Jiang Zemin and the CPC Central Committee entitled "To Make Fresh Contributions to the People, It Is Imperative To Thoroughly Criticize Mao." Time and again, the two teachers' demands and protests were rejected, distorted, and shelved the moment they were submitted. In despair, the two teachers committed suicide by throwing themselves into the Xiang Jiang on 26 November. The Hunan Provincial Government accused them of being "distraught." The emergence of activities to mark "Mao's birth" and related events has proved that the root of "leftism" is still with the CPC, the disaster of "leftism" has not been eradicated, and the soul of "leftism" still haunts Zhongnanhai.
