Favorable GATT Impacts on Chinese Agriculture Once we "recover our GATT seat," Chinese agriculture will first acquire the proper profit and development opportunities, mainly in the following areas: 1. It will contribute to the export of Chinese farm products and their manufactured goods. As China is a large agricultural developing country, farm products and their maunfactured goods have always occupied a crucial position in our export trade. Meanwhile, most Chinese farm products still have a clear price advantage in export trade, with most of our domestic farm product prices now being generally lower than their international market prices. If we export these farm products to the international market, they will be highly competitive. So China must and can sharply expand its export trade in farm products and their manufactured goods. Once we "recover our GATT seat," we will win many preferential terms, such as tariff concessions, and reduction and elimination of nontariff measures and barriers, including quantitative restrictions. It is of particular importance that as a developing country, China will also enjoy according to pertinent GATT provisions its differentiated and more favorable treatment toward developing countries. That is, that quantitative restrictions by developed countries on export trade with developing ones should be more flexible, and that developed countries should fulfill their promised committment to developing ones to reduce or eliminate tariffs and other barriers. The acquisition of these favorable terms will be bound to stimulate sharp growth in the export trade of Chinese farm products and their maunfactured goods. In addition, the conclusion of the Uruguay round of multilateral GATT negotiations will bring a sharp liberalization of farm product trade on a worldwide scale. This will obviously be even more favorable to farm product foreign trade. 2. It will help China to utilize foreign investment, introduce technology, and upgrade our traditional agriculture. GATT trade accomodation limits are now expanding from tariffs and nontariff measures on traditional goods trade to new fields, such as service trade, intellectual property rights, and trade-related investment measures. The conclusion of trade agreements in these new fields will bring definite growth opportunities to Chinese agriculture. In the 1990s, China's agricultural development is in an exceptionally crucial period, during which farm product growth will need much funding and technical support. But due to China's current stage of industrialization, we are experiencing related domestic funding and technology shortages. Once we "recover our GATT seat," China will be able to exploit our signatory status, based on the unconditional MFN principle and the special terms for developing countries, to win technical, economic, and financial aid from GATT members and international financial institutions for the development of Chinese agriculture. Economically developed countries and certain international business and trade organizations are now all paying more attention to the improvement of agricultural development conditions in developing countries to resolve their subsistence-climate issues. In these areas, they are all willing to provide aid, such as funding and technology. Obviously, as a developing country and a GATT member, we will have the full opportunity to completely utilize such aid to build our domestic agricultural infrastructure and improve our agricultural production conditions, in order to reinforce our agricultural development stamina. 3. It will be favorable to China's use of developed-country management and agricultural-development experience. China is now in a reform period, in which our overall economy is preparing for the transition to a socialist market economy. Meanwhile, this period is also one in which Chinese industrialization is making the transition from an initial stage to an intermediate one. Faced with this reform and development climate, we still lack experience in agricultural management and development. But once we "recover our GATT seat," China can learn and understand from GATT members, particularly economically developed countries, their agricultural development principles, policies, and measures in the intermediate industrialization period on market economy terms, drawing on their experience to reform and forumulate China's agricultural development policy, to promote domestic agricultural development. 4. "GATT recovery" will be beneficial to Chinese imports of farm products, particularly grain. China is a country with a relative shortage of agricultural resources, where economic development and rapid population growth have always made farm-product supply and demand relations very tight. To balance these supply and demand relations, China has been a net grain-importing country since the 1960s. Looking to the future, as our population enters its third childbearing peak and our economy grows quickly, our society is likely to have to steadily increase its exports of farm products, especially grain. According to GATT principles on concessional tariffs, free trade, and reciprocity, China will certainly win many concessional terms in importing such farm products from GATT members. II. Negative GATT Impacts on Chinese Agriculture Once China acquires GATT standing, our enjoyment of the various GATT rights will win certain favorable terms for our agricultural development. But meanwhile, as China will have to assume corresponding committments, such as lowering our tariffs, reducing or eliminating nontariff barriers and measures, and opening domestic markets, this will likely have certain negative impacts on Chinese agricultural development, mostly in the following areas: 1. Once China lowers tariffs and eliminates or adjusts certain trade-restriction measures, certain low-cost and high-quantity farm products with relative quality advantages from other GATT countries will be bound to gain access to Chinese markets, to compete sharply with Chinese farm products. This will be a definite shock to certain Chinese farm products. The most-impacted will be ones, such as food-use vegetable oils, nonfood-use vegetable oils, rubber, lumber, sugar, tobacco, soybeans, milk products, and tropical fruits. In this case, domestic production of high-priced but relatively low-quality farm products will probably be confronted with the danger of shrinkage. And the sag in production of these products will directly impact peasant job and income growth. 2. Once we "recover our GATT status," GATT members will certainly demand that China open its farm product markets wider, which will mean weakening our many import-protection measures for farm products in ways, such as lowering tariff rates, and reducing all tariffs and nontariff barriers and measures that have a negative impact on farm product trade. This is likely to have certain negative impacts on China's future agricultural development. Since China has a huge population, a severe shortage of agricultural resources, and an exceptionally weak agricultural foundation, requiring domestic agriculture to produce enough to meet most industrialization needs under these conditions will obviously require much agricultural support, by taking the route of protection of agriculture. Even if we adjust our urban-rural relations and stabilize our rural social environment, China is sill likely to have to take the route in the future of protecting our agricultural development, which will certainly clash with GATT principles. Based on the regulations drafted in the previous seven rounds of GATT negotiations, the negative impact on Chinese agriculture from GATT reentry would seem to be not too obvious, or to be only local. This is because we could make use of pertinent GATT provisions to request exemption from GATT obligations, to protect our staple farm product production and trade. But as the Uruguay round of negotiations has been concluded, making farm product trade more liberal, all measures that impact market access and export competition will fall under stronger and more effective GATT regulations and disciplines. In which case, faced with trade liberalization and open farm product markets, with Chinese agriculture unable to be protected more strongly, the steady rise in production costs will very quickly dissolve our competitive price advantage. Then subject to overseas farm product pressure, our domestic agriculture will certainly be faced with a stiff challenge. The first to be affected by this challenge, and the area that will be most deeply impacted, will be Chinese grain production. Since reform and opening, China's domestic staple food production costs have generally risen at a rate of more than 10 percent a year. This rise in grain production cost has clearly brought our grain prices closer to international grain-market prices. In the future, as farm product marketization intensifies and production costs continue to rise, our domestic grain prices will very quickly exceed international market prices. At which time, with open markets and less protection, large amounts of international grain are likely to flood the Chinese market, which will certainly pose a severe threat to Chinese grain production. 3. GATT reentry will affect our domestic farm product supply and demand balance, sharpening the shortages of certain farm products. As stated above, while most domestic farm product prices are still generally lower than international market prices, "GATT reentry," winning us many preferential treatments, will mean that China's farm product exports with competitive price advantages will certainly grow sharply. But while this growth will bring China a huge foreign exchange income, it is also likely to quickly reduce domestic supplies of similar products to create shortages. This is because limited by a severe shortage of agricultural natural resources, farm product growth is also limited, while rapid domestic economic development and population growth will make farm product demand ever sharper. Under these conditions, large-scale exports of certain farm products will be bound to reduce domestic farm product supplies, and even cause shortages. 4. In the Uruguay round of GATT negotiations, a series of farm product trade liberalization measures were set forth, one of the most important being the lowering of farm product production and export subsidies by preset deadlines. While differences exist on the extent of subsidy reduction by the Keynes group composed of 14 countries, such as the U.S., Argentina, Australia, Brazil, and Canada, with the EC, GATT members unamiously agree that subsidy reduction is imperative. Once production and exports subsidies are lowered, the direct impact on farm products will be higher prices. Concerned international economists have specially studied this, holding that the corresponding liberalization of grain trade among industrially developed countries alone will likely bring an average increase in world farm product prices of 22 percent. This will include price increases of 37 percent for wheat, 26 percent for feed, 21 percent for beef and mutton, 12 percent for pork, poultry, and eggs, 26 percent for dairy products, and 37 percent for sugar. Undoubtedly, higher farm product prices will benefit net farm product exporting countries, enabling them to export less farm products in exchange for more foreign exchange income. But conversely, it will be adverse to net farm product importing countries, as they will only acquire less farm product imports for more foreign exchange. Since China is generally a net farm product exporting country, reducing the various subsidies will benefit us. But as China is a net grain importing country, higher grain market prices will certainly increase our foreign exchange spending on imported grain, which will be adverse to maintaining a domestic balance between grain supply and demand. III. Development Policies That Chinese Agriculture Should Choose 1. From now on, China should conduct active adjustments and reforms in areas, such as macroeconomic organization and farm management system, in full preparation for a positive acceptance of all GATT impacts on agriculture. I hold that the greatest current issues for Chinese agriculture and farm-related industries are decentralized macroeconomic control, system disorder, and a lack of organizational coordination mechanisms. In such a state, China not only cannot make very good use of the favorable terms brought to agriculture by the GATT, but also will find it very hard to cope with the adverse impacts that it will have on our agricultural development. So it is suggested that China could start by organizing a policy, advisory, and coordination agency integrating production and trade of farm products and their manufactured goods, which agency would set and coordinate policy related to production and trade of farm products and their manufactured goods, providing agriculture with policy advice and macroeconomic control in areas, such as utilizing foreign investment, introducing technology, and importing and exporting products. 2. We need to draw up as quickly as possible good farm-related development policies and plans, to pave the way for our taking full and good advantage of the favorable opportunities brought to Chinese agricultural development by our "GATT reentry." For instance, once China "regains our GATT seat," as to its export advantages for certain Chinese farm products and their manufactured goods, we should draw up corresponding development plans, and adopt certain incentive and support policies. In the areas of using foreign investment, introducing technology, and importing farm products, we could make certain advance plans, to keep from missing opportunities and creating unnecessary losses. 3. As to the possible negative impacts of the GATT on our agriculture, we should also take corresponding countermeasures, which I hold to be as follows: A. As a developing country, China should make full use of pertinent GATT provisions, to provide suitable protection for our production and trade of staple farm products, by strengthening state support for agriculture, investing the necessary funding and technology, and actively cultivating our agricultural development capability. B. While observing GATT provisions, and within GATT-allowed limits, we should give our agriculture the proper support. We need to take certain active legal, economic, and technical steps to encourage and support farm operators in consciously reducing material consumption, conserving labor, and raising product quality, to ultimately improve our farm product competitive capability. In addition, to lower agricultural production costs and improve our product competitive advantages, China also needs to begin to achieve land economy of scale and raise labor productivity, by applying certain effective principles and policies to shift our surplus agricultural workforce to other industries. China could suitably deregulate urban job markets and speed up nonfarm production and development, to absorb the large amount of surplus labor that is stuck in the farm sector. This would eliminate the waste and surplus in our agricultural workforce, expand the operating scale of our farm workers, and raise their labor productivity. C. Due to land-resource limitations, China's agriculture will be able to neither produce all of the farm products needed for our economic development, or meet all other economic development needs as to farm product volume. So it is recommended that starting now, China should choose farm products with domestic production advantages and strong links to the national economy, for priority support and development. We should correspondingly phase out those farm products with no domestic production advantages and weak links to the national economy, appropriately conceding the domestic markets for these products. 4. We need to take the initiative to lower certain farm product import tariffs, and reduce certain nontariff measures. Except for a few staple products, such as grain, China's current tariff rates on most farm products and their manufactured goods are 50-70 percent, and in some cases even as high as 150-180 percent, which is obviously too high. Once we regain our GATT status, we will have to lower our tariff rates on certain farm products and their manufactured goods. What method should we use to lower tariffs that would have the minimum impact on China's agriculture and its product trade? I hold that the more ideal method would be to first lower tariffs on those farm products that are less tied to our national economy. Moreover, we could consider lowering these product tariffs more sharply. Conversely, as to those farm products that are more tied to our national economy, we should strictly control tariff-adjustment times and degrees. Only in this way can we reduce to the minimum the negative impact on our agriculture of lower tariffs. In addition, based on GATT demands, China is also going to have to reduce certain nontariff measures against farm product imports. In this area, we can act in accordance with the links between farm products and our national economy, by taking the initiative to eliminate certain administrative measures, such as product licenses and import examination and approval, and by streamlining technology health-criteria examination and customs entry formalities.
