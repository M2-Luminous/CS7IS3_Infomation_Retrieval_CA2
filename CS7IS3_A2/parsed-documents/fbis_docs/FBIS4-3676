Hayden said the project will play a positive role in popularizing new technologies and in improving the quality of sheep bred in China, which includes the sheep's hereditary features and mutton and wool quality. To inspect the development of the project, the governor-general made a special trip to the Nansha [Spratly] sheep-breeding pastureland, located in the suburbs of Urumqi, capital of China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which was jointly set up by China and Australia. He checked and was satisfied with the wool of the sheep, which had been cultivated from Australian breeds. The Sino-Australian joint project on sheep research was initiated in accordance with the technological cooperation agreement between the two countries. It is one of Australia's biggest aid projects to China in agriculture, in which Australia has invested 6.44 million Australian dollars. The five-year project, starting from 1991, involves nine items and 30 subjects covering the fields of breeding, nutrition, reproduction, wool technology, pastures, and veterinary surgery as well as women's participation and development. At present, 33 Chinese have been sent to Australia for long-term and short-term training sessions, while two Australian experts are working in Xinjiang. A Chinese official with the research center said that the two Australian experts are working well here and the project has been developing smoothly. To improve the teaching conditions of the school in the pastureland, the Australian Government has provided ten thousand Australian dollars and improved the laboratory of the school. One hundred thousand Australian dollars will help to establish a knitting mill, which will enable 80 Kazak women to get jobs, part of the effort to solve the Kazak nationality women's employment problems. Governor Hayden highly praised such cooperation, which may promote the economy in the autonomous region inhabited by minority nationalities.
