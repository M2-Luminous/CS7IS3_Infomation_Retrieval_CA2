Almost a year and a half after Governor Chris Patten outlined his plans for political reform, the Legislative Council [Legco] is faced with a real decision about whether to turn these reforms into law. It would be a great pity if the decision is stalled once again by the procedural manoeuvre which Councillor Elsie Tu has in mind. Tu, a bitter opponent of the Governor and his reform plans, is thinking about asking today's council meeting to postpone discussion of the first stage of the reform bill. She has every right to oppose, or indeed, amend the bill but she has no real grounds for suggesting yet another postponement of legislation. The uncertainty which swirls around the proposals must be brought to an end. Legco has a duty to not only pass legislation on the first stage of the reform bill but also on the more controversial second stage which contains plans for enlarging the franchise. When the reforms were first proposed they appeared to command widespread public support. That, at any rate, was the verdict of countless public opinion polls. A significant new poll, published in today's paper, shows that support is ebbing. Opinion is now evenly divided on even the modest reforms under discussion in Legco today. We do not suggest that every new opinion poll should cause the Governor to dash out and alter his plans, nor that the members of Legco should respond like Pavlov's dogs to every new poll finding. However, there are clear indications that support for reform is eroding. The reasons are probably complex but China's campaign of opposition is evidently having some effect. Previous polls have shown that even those who support the idea of more democracy as a matter of principle are reluctant to see it expanded in Hong Kong in the face of Chinese resistance. We can understand a reluctance to foster confrontation and increasingly sympathise with the Government's efforts to try to achieve a negotiated agreement with China, even though the negotiations disintegrated into something close to farce. Nevertheless, the case for reform remains strong and the need for legislation to provide a framework for the coming elections is pressing. Our poll shows the Governor still has support for going ahead with plans for the 1995 Legco elections. However, a small majority of those questioned believe in the retention of ex-officio seats for members of the Regional Council [Regco] and the district boards and opinion is evenly divided on the idea of maintaining appointed seats in Legco. We find the reluctance to dispense with appointed seats particularly bizarre because even the Basic Law decreed that appointment to the legislature must end. We are also sceptical about the virtues of small cabals being empowered to elect members through Regco and district boards. In sum, it is hard to find much which is really objectionable in the bill before Legco today and we see few merits in the amendments being advanced. Yet it cannot be denied that the appetite for reform is fading. If the public really want an electoral system riddled with undemocratic and unrepresentative practices, they are quite entitled to have precisely such a system. If they have taken the apparently pragmatic view that this is the best that can be achieved, given China's views on the subject, their assessment is reasonable. However, there comes a time when principles should be given precedence above pragmatism. People who pride themselves on their pragmatic views of affairs tend to see history as static. They argue that the realities of today will be the realities of tomorrow. History rarely works out quite like that. Chinese history, with its violent lurches from regime to regime, is a perfect illustration of this point. It therefore seems more realistic to start from a point of principle and work backwards from there. If it is right for Hong Kong to join other modern societies in having the ability to elect its law-makers in a fair and representative way, then Hong Kong should try to achieve such a system of elections. To settle for less is to accept that the territory should always settle for second best. Second best is not the Hong Kong way of doing things, nor should it become so.
