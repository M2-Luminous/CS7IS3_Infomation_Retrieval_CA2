And despite all the difficulty in leaving Egypt after more than 40 years, he has returned to stay and to plan a new life. He has returned to live in his homeland. In an interview with Basimah Nafadi, MENA correspondent in Gaza, Sha'th said that he has resigned from all his other jobs and has returned to his homeland. He said: "We have all struggled to return to our homeland. There should be no hesitation on the part of anyone to return to Palestine to build this homeland for whose liberation and independence we have struggled. The time has now come to struggle to build it." Sha'th admitted that the current situation in the Gaza Strip and Jericho is difficult. But he added that hope, anticipation, defiance, and aspirations fill the hearts of all Palestinians. He noted that among the problems that must be tackled are the thousands of detainees, wounded, and handicapped and the need to rehabilitate them. This is in addition to the problems of unemployment, building the Palestinian economy, and establishing a state. This, he said, requires an effective, clean, fair, capable, and modern government. Sha'th said that just as we have established the Palestinian police who regained the people's confidence after 27 years of occupation, an effective Palestinian government administration will win the confidence of the donor countries to begin providing the necessary funds for infrastructure projects. Palestinian and Arab investors will also begin establishing projects to build a strong Palestinian economy. Sha'th said that infrastructure and public utility programs have already been prepared. About half of the international aid will be allocated for housing. There are also plans for tourism, agricultural, and industrial projects. Palestinian investors, he said, will greatly contribute to the development of the Palestinian economy, noting that he has met with many of them since he arrived in Gaza. Regarding the Paris meeting of donor countries, Sha'th said that this meeting has created a new relationship with the Palestinian National Authority. He noted that the problem of Palestinian police salaries is being resolved and that their salaries for the months of April and May have been paid. He said that he met last night and until 0300 today with Palestinian police and security commanders and discussed their needs and resolved their problems. He said that efforts are currently being made to solve the problems of more than 50,000 members of the families of 7,000 Palestinian policemen. He admitted that this is a big problem, as there is need to provide housing for these families under difficult conditions that exist in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Sha'th said that he was able to see first-hand the enormous economic problems facing the Palestinian people. Workers are prevented from returning to their jobs in Israel, and only about 5,000 of the 150,000 workers have been allowed to return. The Israeli authorities have also not given permits to car and truck drivers to travel to Jericho or even to enter the West Bank. This is in addition to problems of unemployment and problems that people arriving through the Rafah crossing point are facing from the Israelis.
