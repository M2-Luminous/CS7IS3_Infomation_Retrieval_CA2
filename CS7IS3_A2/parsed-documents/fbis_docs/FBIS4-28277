In an interview with AL-JUMHURIYAH that will be published on Thursday, the foreign minister explained that the most important of these commitments was to continue the dialogue and the negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang to reach a peaceful solution to the problem, respect the sovereignty of North Korea, stop the military maneuvers that the United States conducts with South Korea, and replace the lead-operated nuclear reactor in North Korea with one operated by light water [wa istibdal al-mufa'il al-nawawi lada kuriya al-shamaliyah wa al-ladhi ya'malu bi al-rasas bi mufa'il jadid ya'malu bi al-ma' al-khafif]. The Korean official affirmed that his country has offered all facilities to the inspection committees sent by the International Atomic Energy Commission. The commission made unacceptable requests to Pyongyang to open the military bases for inspection, based on information and photographs taken by U.S. spy satellites. This led the Pyongyang government to reject the request and to propose a four-point initiative to solve the crisis. These are: resumption of the bilateral talks between Washington and Pyongyang; U.S. withdrawal of its nuclear weapons from South Korea; North Korean submission of the necessary guarantees to accept periodic and non-periodic inspection of its nuclear installations; and North Korean return to the treaty banning the dissemination of nuclear weapons as a full member with all obligations. Answering a question about North Korea's position if the UN Security Council adopts a resolution to impose sanctions against it, the North Korean foreign minister said that in such a case his country will withdraw from the treaty banning the dissemination of nuclear weapons and will view such a resolution as a declaration of war. It will not sit idle in the face of the plots being prepared against it.
