Building a framework of major commodity markets in Shanghai in accordance with the needs of a socialist market economy is a new agenda. The 10 commodity markets all have the characteristics of a modern market: -- The markets are comprehensive and large in scale. Shanghai did not have a head start in major commodity market construction; however, it has advanced quickly and has surpassed the early starters. It not only leads the rest of the country in the number of national-level commodity exchange markets but also ranks among the top in transaction volume. The total amount of transactions reached 450 billion yuan last year. In addition, the municipality has comprehensive commodity markets, consisting of eight capital goods and two consumer goods markets. The eight capital goods markets cover all the categories of capital goods. -- The markets have instituted mechanisms for conducting futures transactions and are advancing toward becoming standard futures markets. All 10 major exchanges have instituted mechanisms for operating futures transactions, including a membership system, a cash deposit system, open bidding, and uniform settlement. In addition, they are all working hard to promote futures transactions. Shanghai's metals exchange conducted 108,737 million yuan of futures transactions using standard contracts last year, representing 28 percent of the total volume of the exchange's transactions. Shanghai's building materials exchange conducted four transactions using standard contracts as soon as it began operation at the end of last year. -- Their members are numerous and scattered throughout the country, and their structures are rational. Each of the exchanges has several dozen members, and one has 209. About half of their members come from other parts of the country while the other half are local enterprises. Among them are producers, end-users, businesses in the circulation area, and specialized brokerage companies. -- The rate of contract fulfillment has been fairly high. All the exchanges have formulated self-regulatory rules governing administration, transactions, and membership, thereby ensuring a good and sound market order. -- Development is uneven. Trading is more active in exchanges dealing with commodities that are more market-oriented. Shanghai's metals exchange, for example, had a record daily transaction of 5.7 billion yuan, and its total volume of transactions last year reached 400 billion yuan, making it the third largest metals exchange in the world. Trading is rather slow in exchanges dealing with commodities that are more planning-oriented. Shanghai's automobile exchange market, farming goods exchange, and coal exchange had an average of 612,000 yuan, 739,000 yuan, and 964,000 yuan, respectively, in daily transactions. Shanghai's 10 major markets have already made positive contributions. They have, for example, made initial contributions to reducing price fluctuations in spot markets by helping set prices and guide production. They have helped enterprises reduce their inventories and save capital through rational allocation of resources. They have removed from the economic system the elements of "informal transactions" and other factors affecting fair competition. They have helped train a number of specialized personnel for many emerging industries and trades. Shanghai's national-level commodity exchange markets have also encountered problems during their development. The main problems, as reported by the exchanges, are the lack of a municipality-wide unified authoritative administrative agency; the lack of municipality uniform transaction rules and regulations; the lack of an independent settlement company serving the needs of the exchanges; and the lack of special warehouses for transactions in kind. In addition, futures personnel training and management are in chaos, and there are too many departments demanding transaction data. Further, the exchanges' self-regulatory rules and regulations are still in an early stage of development. There are many loopholes in hedging risks on the part of the exchanges and in monitoring members' trading practices. Shanghai's national-level commodity exchange markets should pay close attention to the following tasks to ensure steady, regularized, and sound development: 1. The municipality should set up a separate market supervision and management commission to undertake comprehensive planning and rational distribution and to strictly screen the categories and varieties of commodities placed for trading. The commission should remove commodities not suitable for futures exchange and should help coordinate matters related to trading. 2. The municipality should transform two or three selected exchanges into standard futures commodity exchanges ahead of others and link them to the international market by cultivating and developing them on a priority basis. It should prescribe medicine for exchanges with slack business according to their symptoms: replacing commodities that will be planning-oriented for the next few years; based on the requirements of spot exchange, regulate markets that are not suitable for futures transactions; and merge various specialized futures exchange markets when conditions are ripe so that transactions can be conducted in a single market to improve efficiency. 3. The municipality should step up training of trading specialists, conduct in-depth study on trading issues, help organize influential multi-purpose brokerage companies, and attract more producers, end-users, and intermediary businesses to engage in futures trading.
