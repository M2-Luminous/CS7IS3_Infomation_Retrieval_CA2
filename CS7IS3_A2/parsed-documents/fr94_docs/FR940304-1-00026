FR940304-1-00026 FR940304-1-00007 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;213&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 (Regional Jet) Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 (Regional Jet) series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the stall protection system (SPS) input wiring, a revision to the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to specify that a pre-flight check of the slip/skid indications must be conducted prior to engine start; and modification of the attitude and heading reference system (AHRS). This proposal is prompted by a report that the AHRS could send conflicting input to the stall protection computer (SPC) on the airplane. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the loss of stall warning protection on the airplanes. DATES: Comments must be received by April 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;213&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
