John Lippitt, a director of GEC [General Electric Company], told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee which is investigating the 1 billion pound aid-for-arms deal, that the restrictions to come into force next year were "fundamentally flawed." Mr Lippitt was giving evidence with Sir Robin Biggam, chairman of BICC [British Insulated Calanders Cables], the parent company of Balfour Beatty, which won the 417 million pound dam contract, and Allan Gormly, a director of Cementation International. All three condemned a review conducted by the ODA which from next year will limit aid to exporters to creditworthy countries with average annual income below 760 pounds per capita and to schemes costing less than 48 million pounds. This compares with 2,465 pounds per capita with no limit on the cost of schemes under the OECD rules agreed by Britain's competitors. Mr Lippitt pointed out that such a policy would remove support for all big schemes like power stations and dams. In addition every country in Southeast Asia would become ineligible for aid except China and Indonesia. "We don't mind following the rules which apply to other countries but the Overseas Development Administration is proposing to take our troops 50 miles ahead of everybody else. We know what happens when troops are put in such a position -- they are massacred." He also accused the German government of breaching the rules to win bids which Britain was poised to sign over the Shanghai and Canton metros. "Chancellor Kohl who was visiting Beijing at the time was determined to win every single metro contract in China," he said. As a result the Germans gave grants of 51 per cent and 68 per cent. OECD rules limit grants to 35 per cent. Earlier Sir Robin criticised the ODA,s handling of the Pergau project, which secured 234 million pounds of British taxpayers, aid. He said the department's two day assessment of the scheme was "absurd" and could not have been accomplished without visiting the site. Questioned by Labour MPs, the directors denied that donations to the Conservative Party from GEC and Trafalgar House increased their chances of winning contracts.
