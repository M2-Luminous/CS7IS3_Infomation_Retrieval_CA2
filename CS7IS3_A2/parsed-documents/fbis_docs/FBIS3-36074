Yeltsin's first official visit to a Commonwealth state, leaving aside his fleeting visit to Ashgabat and his talks with Saparmurad Niyazov. The political nuances of the visit were examined at Andrey Kozyrev's conference with North Caucasus leaders. As the minister remarked, this is a major step aimed at implementing a strategic line in the Caucasus, which Russia has traditionally regarded as a zone of its geopolitical interests. Russia would not like to have on its border a state torn apart by internal conflicts and drowning in economic chaos and crime. The preconditions for establishing cooperation have been created. Georgia has become a member of the CIS and the Collective Security Council. But it remains the only neighbor with which Moscow does not have a framework treaty on the bases of relations or agreements on border questions. The Russian delegation is taking a set of these documents with it to Tbilisi, where it intends to sign them. There is nothing in them that conflicts with the interests of the North Caucasus republics. They have no grounds for suspecting that any kind of "military-political alliance" is being prepared between Russia and Georgia against Abkhazia, the minister stressed. One of the main tasks of the visit is to promote the settlement of conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Andrey Kozyrev pointed out that in principle Russia has decided to conduct peace-keeping operations in Abkhazia and intends to seek the participation of UN and CSCE international observers in it. The minister recognized at this point that Russia bears the main burden of the peacemaking work and the protection of people's lives, Georgia's sovereignty, and the rights of the ethnic minorities.
