The satellite, to be put into orbit between October and December, is manufactured by the Hughes Corporation of the U.S. It will be the second satellite launched by China for Asia Pacific Satellite Communications Co. Ltd of Hong Kong. Asia Pacific plans to launch the first satellite in the first half of this year from Xichang Space Centre in Sichuan Province on a Long March-2E rocket carrier, according to a December 1992 contract with the CGWIC. The second satellite, HS601, a large capacity satellite, will blast off from Xichang using the same model of rocket. Both sides refused to disclose costs for the launch. Zhang Tong, president of the CGWIC, was pleased with the recent decision by the U.S. Government to lift export bans on three satellites to China. "It is a positive move and we appreciate the decision," he said before the contract-signing ceremony at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. But Zhang also expressed regret the U.S. still places other restrictions on his company. The U.S. imposed the satellite export ban last August after the alleged sale of missiles and technology by China to Pakistan. He hoped the U.S. will issue export permits to other satellites and lift its sanctions on the CGWIC. "By doing so, it will be beneficial to the international satellite customers and it will also protect the benefits of the U.S. satellite manufacturers," he said. Zhang also hoped the Chinese and U.S. Governments will start negotiations on commercial satellite launching and international trade before the current agreement expires at the end of this year. The current satellite agreement was signed in 1989. China will honour all launching contracts signed with overseas customers. They include the Asia Sat-2 communications satellite for the Asia Satellite Telecommunications Co Ltd, the Intelsat-7A telecommunications satellite for the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, the Iridium satellites for the U.S. Motorola Company and two APT satellites this year and next year.
