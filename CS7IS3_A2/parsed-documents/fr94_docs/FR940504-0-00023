FR940504-0-00023 FR940504-0-00009 USEPA Response: The level of control technology that constitutes RACT is a function of technical and economical feasibility, and not emission impacts. Furthermore, excess emissions of 27.89 tons of VOC per year is not a negligible quantity. Comment 2_Infeasibility of Add-on Controls: As a result of USEPA's reliance on the Lake article and the Van Camp study, Heekin commissioned a RACT study by Camp, Dresser, and McKee (CDM). CDM focused on collecting VOCs from the application, conveying, and bagging stages of the end seal lining process. Warehousing areas were disregarded by Lake and CDM as being infeasible to control. CDM performed a complete RACT analysis tailored specifically for Heekin's Hamilton County, Ohio can manufacturing facility. A total of five end seal lining processes (10 applicators) were considered for control. Before discussing the results of CDM's RACT study, it should be noted that CDM disregarded the carbon adsorption control option because of the difficulties encountered with regeneration. Steam regeneration of spent carbon creates a hazardous waste requiring costly disposal. Hot air regeneration requires an incinerator which duplicates the incinerator control technology option. Also, it is believed that hexane, the major solvent in the end seal lining compounds, has a poor adsorption efficiency. Thus, Lake's reporting of a cost effectiveness figure for a carbon adsorption collection system is not supported by CDM. CDM focused on thermal and catalytic incineration as preferable control options and determined that the capital cost for a catalytic incinerator system was $1,854,600, approximately $320,000 higher than the capital cost of a thermal incineration system. The annual operating expense for the catalytic incineration system was estimated to be $1,608,719 per year, $2,008,719 per year for thermal incineration. Dividing the annual cost to operate the control system by the quantity of VOC reduced yields the ``cost effectiveness'' of the control system. CDM's analysis utilized three figures for the quantity of VOC removed per year: (1) The quantity of VOC removed to reach equivalence with the general end seal compound limit of 3.7 pounds of VOC per gallon (i.e., 27.89 tons per year); (2) the quantity of VOC removed assuming a 40 percent capture efficiency (i.e., 87.70 tons per year); and (3) the quantity of VOC removed assuming that Perlis' 80 percent capture efficiency is correct (i.e., 175.4 tons per year). Heekin does not believe that an 80 percent collection efficiency on the system is possible but has calculated the ``cost effectiveness'' for comparison purposes. CDM determined the following ``cost effectiveness'' figures. For scenario one, removal of sufficient VOCs to reach equivalence with the 3.7 pounds per gallon emission rate limitation, the ``cost effectiveness'' is $71,597 per ton of VOC removed for thermal incineration and $57,681 per ton of VOC removed for catalytic incineration. For scenario two, removal of VOCs with a 40 percent capture efficiency, the ``cost effectiveness'' is $23,235 per ton of VOC removed for thermal incineration and $19,310 per ton of VOC removed for catalytic incineration. For scenario three, removal of VOCs with an 80 percent capture efficiency, the ``cost effectiveness'' is $10,853 per ton of VOC removed for thermal incineration and $9,020 per ton of VOC removed for catalytic incineration. It should be noted that the above detailed ``cost effectiveness'' figures were calculated based on can end residence times through the collection system reported by Lake. However, Heekin's actual residence times are much shorter. Lake reported a total residence time for Van Camp of 1.5 minutes. During the Perlis test, a residence time of 3.0 minutes was contrived to gain an 87 percent capture efficiency. Heekin's process lines have a total residence time from lining to stacking/bagging of only 20 to 65 seconds. The discrepancy between Heekin's residence time and the Van Camp/Perlis residence times means that the collection efficiencies for the capture system if it were to be installed at Heekin would be much lower than the collection efficiencies reported by Lake. Thus, the cost effectiveness figures estimated by CDM are on the low side compared to what Heekin could actually attain because the amount of VOCs removed would be much lower. USEPA Response: Add-on control is not used on any end seal compound coating lines. USEPA agrees that add-on control is not feasible for this application.
