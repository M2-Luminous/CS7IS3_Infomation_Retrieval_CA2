The latest episode in the endless dispute on the right took place on the "Mixer" television show when the National Alliance leader yesterday tried to treat the "losing" Bossi superciliously. "He is afraid of the elections, he is envious of those who are taking away his votes. He is almost ridiculous, now that he is spurning the very votes in the south that he previously sought to gain by every means. As for ideologies, we can forget about Bossi; I do not think that he knows what they are." In jest, he played the tower game that he himself suggested: "If I had to choose between [Secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] Occhetto and Bossi, I would throw off the latter. I cannot forget the way in which League members treated the mayor when he talked about solidarity." "When Bossi tried to gain votes in the south they sent him back to the valleys." He added: "I am not worried about the disputes within the [rightist] alliance. If a voter hears Bossi speak, he will not decide to vote for Occhetto, but he could vote for me." What if Bossi became crucial to your accession to government, [show host] Minoli asked? "That is simple. It is enough that he adhere to two essential points -- national unity and solidarity." The insults and attacks that Fini directed at the League leader were almost matched by the respect with which he treated Occhetto and his many reservations about his ally, [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi. In the end Occhetto nearly came out better ("So what if Berlusconi calls them communists? I call them the PDS.") Spurred on by Minoli, Fini told Berlusconi that the television system must be reorganized with new rules that apply to everyone, including Fininvest ("Cutting back the public and private networks and improving the quality of television programs.") What is his criticism of Berlusconi? "His tendency to feel often like the center of the world." One of your proposals, Minoli said, is to grant small- and medium-sized entrepreneurs the same credit treatment reserved for major groups. Does Berlusconi know that? "Certainly he knows it. Within the pole for freedoms we are the component that guarantees social awareness and solidarity." There was also a brusque reminder to [Forza Italia economist] Antonio Martino and Forza Italia on the tax question: "They said that allowances to those earning less will compensate for the single tax rate, but they have not explained how. Martino has a duty to explain these allowances right away and to be clear about the whole issue. He said that a family of four in Rome can live on 18 million lire a year: That is not true; it is not enough. Martino must be clearer." [passage omitted]
