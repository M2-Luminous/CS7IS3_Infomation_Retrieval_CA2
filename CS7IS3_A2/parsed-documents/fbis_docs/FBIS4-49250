Extending his welcome to Bunhei Hara, president of the House of Councillors of the Japanese Diet, and his delegation, Jiang noted that as close neighbors, China and Japan have had friendly contacts for more than 2,000 years. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties more than 20 years ago, great advances have been made in the bilateral friendly cooperation in every field, Jiang noted. Speaking of an unfortunate historical period between the two countries, Jiang said "past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for the future." Leaders of the two countries should take a broad and long-term point of view and look forward to the future, he said, adding that they should further promote the mutually-beneficial cooperation in all fields and contribute to the safeguarding of peace, stability and prosperity in Asia and the world at large. Hara told Jiang that his visit to Beijing, Xian and Shanghai has enabled him to witness the achievements China has made in its reform and opening-up and economic development. Hara expressed his willingness to exert himself to the promotion of the Japan-China ties of friendship and cooperation. Ye Gongqi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, was present at today's meeting.
