We meet here today to summarize the meaning and possible development of a democratic process capable of earning the prestige of being useful and of establishing itself as a feasible method for popular participation in the solution to our economic problems. Above all, we face a promising, encouraging path that categorically confirms that the economic solutions demanded by pressing reality must be identified by the people as their own, based on the greatest possible consensus and in such a way that their reasons are understood, so that the gates can open for collective action on an efficient economy that ensures the preservation and development of our socialist society. In looking at the results of the assembly process, the Parliaments in the Workplaces, which had the participation of approximately 3 million workers throughout the country who debated the economic problems of each center and added to the arsenal of ideas that could be activated to restructure internal finances, we express our profound joy that the workers throughout the entire nation, in all work centers, in the immense majority of their proposals demonstrated patriotism, honor, and the will to do whatever is required to save the Revolution, just as Fidel requested during his intervention in the last special session of the ANPP. The labor union movement can take credit for having organized the workers parliaments, for having interpreted Fidel's thoughts and the conclusions of the fourth plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] regarding the importance of avoiding a technocratic focus in the solutions, beginning from the point that without the understanding and will of the workers and the people, no problems can be solved and no measures can do any good. In the short time between December and today, we prepared our cadres, we summoned the workers to hold the parliaments, and we held meetings with more than 80,000 labor union sectors, which had the support of the party and government, as well as the active participation of our deputies and the presidency of the ANPP. We believe that the administration of the work centers, noticeably advancing with regard to their prior experience, decisively supported this process and became worthy of the workers' recognition, most of whom appreciated the quality of the report to the assembly and their cooperation, for a frank and realistic discussion on the problems of each center. For 45 days, the country became an immense school on economics and politics, in which much was learned and during which it was realized that much remains to be learned, investigated, and renovated in the specific economic sphere of each work center. The press has played a distinctive role, contributing with convincing arguments and with real reflection in the debates to enrich and stimulate the participation of the workers, who in this process came to a greater understanding of the complex situation we face and of the need to continue taking measures with the greatest care, without anxious haste, focusing on reactivating the economy, producing more and better with available resources under conditions of the blockade and special period. Comrades, the work has just begun. Let us take heart in the fact that the workers considered these parliaments worthwhile. Above all, let us think of the long road ahead of us in all senses. An analysis of the innumerable suggestions made by the workers is not a one-day task. Today, we should confine ourselves to synthesis of the people's thought, which is essentially connected in economic terms with a more profound political and ideological culture, but which does not achieve the desired correspondence. Let us make way for this synthesis and let us remember that the assemblies included points that reconfirm the wisdom of the collective intelligence and the provisions of immutable loyalty toward the Revolution and socialism, as well as indications of confusion; reminiscences of an economic mentality that should develop even further; and, in some respects, ideas that have nothing to do with today's efficiency reality. The debates in the workers parliaments expressed a great coincidence that the enterprises should reach profitability based on efficient work and the proper use of materials and financial resources, without elevating prices, and placing emphasis on the reduction of costs. In a great many meetings, the companies have been urged to seek and find alternative formulas to increase their income by means of a secondary, or side, production which, without detriment to the principal production, will result in greater exploitation of material and human resources. The workers have underscored in many meetings the need to reduce subsidies to companies to the point of eliminating all but those that can be fully justified. Another matter that was thoroughly analyzed in the meetings was cost reduction. At the same time, measures have been outlined so that workers will be able to participate in the analysis and control of expenditures, and so that this control will be resolutely carried out in those places where the expenditures are incurred but not the way it is done now, and that this situation be handled by exclusive areas that centralize the information and analyses. We must note that in many places, the workers have learned that their respective companies have not been profitable. They have realized the amount of losses and consequent subsidies. So they voiced their complaints that positive actions must be taken concerning costs and expenditures of both the budgeted units and those conceived to attain revenues and profit. Workers everywhere also noted the need for administrations in the future to provide systematic information on these aspects, to the workers, with the purpose of encouraging the struggle for efficiency and to facilitate the economic analyses in each unit. One of the most often repeated proposals was that of improving human services in all centers. Likewise, there is an overwhelming consensus concerning the need to increase the control of state assets, with the dual purpose of reducing production costs and preventing the main sources from going to the black market and to criminal acts. The workers have repeatedly called for improvement of the labor law in an effort to eliminate its paternalistic content and to adjust it to the needs of production and labor efficiency. The subject of labor and technological and administrative discipline was discussed in several meetings and from differing points of view. The workers especially referred to the lack of administrative exigency and to the pernicious effect of the current system of medical certificates and reports. In many thousands of meetings, the workers stressed the idea that an efficient increase in production and services is the essential way to stabilize internal finances and to achieve an adequate provision to the people. The delicate and complex problem of the reorganization of personnel rosters and reinstatement of personnel was broadly debated. There was an overwhelming consensus on the need to adopt measures to improve worker productivity, to reduce costs, and to efficiently organize production. In many places where there is an obvious excess labor force, the workers themselves, whose posts can be the object of rationalization, have called for the initiation of this process, confident that in the Revolution, they will find just solutions and that no one will be neglected; and that people will always work for the development of economically justifiable job opportunities. Streamlining Internal Finances The issue of streamlining internal finances has gained major impetus in the discussions in the workplace parliaments, to the extent that these discussions developed. The proposals to charge for services that are currently free, to change prices, to impose new taxes, and others, unlike the subjects related to economic efficiency, have prompted various reactions. However, it has been verified that the development of the debates has contributed to clarification and consolidation of the inevitable need to adopt effective measures to streamline internal finances. One fact has been confirmed by this process throughout the country. It has to do with the overwhelming consensus among Cuban workers that education and health care in our society must remain free of charge, arguing that these are achievements of the Revolution and must be maintained. However, in many places, the workers proposed charging for cosmetic surgery and similar services. Some have even proposed charging for dental care services. Others have proposed charging those responsible for traffic accidents and physical aggressions, feeling that they should pay for the medical assistance given to their victims. Others have reaffirmed the proposal to pay for basic school supplies and uniforms, although others proposed the payment only in case of losses. To a lesser extent, workers proposed distribution of expendable material free of charge the first time, but selling it at accessible prices afterwards throughout the year. Some parliaments proposed charging for school supplies at high school and university levels, while other parliaments proposed charging in accordance with the income of the student's family. Some parliaments proposed charging for university and postgraduate studies in languages and others are not considered basic education. Other parliaments proposed charging when the student abandons his studies, or when as a graduate he does not work in the field he studied. Another proposal was that of charging at the semiboarding schools as in the case of childcare centers, as well as other free services in the education area, especially when there is a change in career or in lodging, and also for the food the students eat in boarding schools. The workers also made repeated analyses of the possibility of charging for services which are not considered essential in other aspects of the country's life. In several meetings the workers underscored the idea that the state must consider maintaining some free services that are suitable; in other meetings, but in a lesser extent, the workers considered the possibility of eliminating all free services. Among the free services not considered essential, to which the workers referred in the meetings, in addition to those already discussed and which have to do with health and education, are the following: charging for civil registery office services and for some spraying services; eliminating free delivery of products and foods to workers in certain places; increasing taxes on vehicles; charging modest prices for personal protection means, public bathrooms, and some funeral services; charging drug stores for the distribution of vitamins; charging cyclists for use of roads; charging tolls in tunnels, on highways, etc. In several meetings the workers proposed charging for cultural activities, excepting entrance fees for children. In some parliaments the workers proposed charging tickets at indoor events and with professional artists. Workers also repeated the proposal to charge modest prices for sports events. Very few proposed not charging for these events. Many parliaments also agreed on the need to charge for recreational activities. Workers proposed the need to increase these activities, especially for children and youth, proposing in some cases turning movie theaters into video arcades because the movie theaters are not being used. The workers parliaments have also analyzed the use of prices to reduce excess currency in circulation. They proposed the direct sale to workers of products coming from the worker centers, charging for services such as state transport, including those with red license plates. The workers also proposed the use of vehicles from the different organizations to collect the money, incentivizing the driver with a percentage of revenues. In general, there was consensus concerning the idea of not increasing transport tariffs, although some parliaments have proposed this. Among the proposals made we can mention that of increasing the prices of gasoline, lubricants, and accessories. In many meetings the workers proposed eliminating alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and tobacco in general from the ration book, selling them freely but increasing their prices. However, some meetings were against the increase in prices, or at least they proposed a moderate increase. Some also proposed keeping them in the ration book. In other meetings the workers proposed maintaining the established cigarette quota but eliminating the additional quota and imposing a fixed price for those that are sold freely. Among the analyzed aspects we can also mention the alternative to encourage the formation of accounts for workers' and peasants' funds. The People's Savings Bank has also been urged to pay higher interest rates so as to foment savings. Concerning prices in the foods area, the workers have proposed a revision, saying that prices must be in line with quality. There were also proposals saying that prices of some services are too high and that not all workers have access to those services. Concerning the price of food in the workers' cafeterias, the workers also proposed a revision in order to adjust them in accordance with reasonable costs and the quality of the food, although many parliaments were against a readjustment of prices. There were repeated proposals to charge for water, especially imposing a higher price on those who waste water. But there were many more proposals to raise electricity rates, especially for excessive use above a given quota. Workers also agreed on an increase in telephone rates provided that service is also improved. There were fewer proposals not to charge for water or to increase the electricity rate. There was an overwhelming consensus against the imposition of tax on salaries, although some parliaments were also in favor of a tax on salaries. On several occasions the workers proposed the idea of subsidizing low-income families to protect them from price readjustments. In many parliaments there were proposals to take into consideration the income of self-employed workers at the time of implementing the new tax. Other parliaments have directly proposed that high taxes be imposed on the income of self-employed workers. Some also proposed charging a tax on peasants in accordance with their income. The complex [passage indistinct] in the workers parliaments where there were many proposals to implement them. Fewer proposals were against implementing them, arguing that the country is not prepared for this and that it would not resolve the financial problem. There was almost absolute consensus in the discussions on the confiscation of the money and other resources of doubtful origin from all those who have accrued wealth illegally. During the discussions the workers in different parliaments proposed the revision and amendment of the penal code, while others proposed the implementation of stronger punishments on those citizens who commit crimes, especially economic crimes. We understand that the first duty of the union movement is to urge the workers to strengthen their fighting morale, to prevent them from becoming discouraged, to strengthen their confidence that we will be successful, and to assure that whatever we do will preserve socialism and its essential achievements. We must continue developing our awareness and spirit to understand the sacrifice that is implicit in these measures, which are inevitable to save what is essential. Likewise, we must meditate on the great lines of action awaiting the unions. The Parliaments in the Workplace have demonstrated their validity as a method of rapport on the situation that is in the interest of the workers and administrative leaders for the study of basic problems and the collective quest for solutions, starting from the individual contribution and united with the administrations, the union organizations, and the political leadership. We must learn lessons from all this: the need to be more communicative and to maintain a continuous presence in the centers, to teach and learn, to learn how to establish a closer relationship with our union members, to convey the experience of how to solve the problems that are worrying the workers, to interpret them and help them find a solution. Changing what has been achieved in the workers parliaments into a permanent style and method of union work implies, above all, the revitalization and perfection of the role of the unions which must use the authority bestowed upon them as representatives of the true owners of the means of production, and thereby to wage an ideological war against any way of thinking that could obstruct the country's development and the path to efficiency. To say it in another way: We must tirelessly fight against anything that affects the workers' interests, be it labor or technological indiscipline, lack of control, or the bureacratic web which delays the solutions of problems; favors apathy, idleness, irresponsibility; and does not concern itself when resources are lost or are insufficiently exploited. The battle for economic efficiency is not just a temporary slogan under the difficult Cuban economic situation, but the central aspect for which the unions and our CTC must work. In compliance with the workers' demands in several centers throughout the country, the CTC National Secretariat has decided to give a new profile to the Assemblies of Production and Service, replacing them by the Assemblies for Economic Efficiency which will pay special attention to these decisive objectives of our work. This objective is giving new life to the spirit of the workers parliaments in each task or union activity in which we might be engaged; that frank, critical, and self-critical analysis must prevail everywhere, seeking not justification where there is none but solutions that can be implemented with the presence and active participation of all those interested. After verifying once again the workers' indestructible loyalty to the Revolution, and after verifying in dozens of thousands of meetings that the Cuban workers, above the current sacrifices and deprivations, are willing to fight with all their might to maintain the integrity of the fatherland and the achievements of socialism, we cannot but strengthen our commitment to Fidel and to the people, that the Cuban union movement will be, today and always, a bulwark of the revolutionary spirit, a tireless and tenacious force of the resistance and of the victory our people deserve. Fatherland or death, socialism or death, we will win. [applause] This has been our report, comrade president.
