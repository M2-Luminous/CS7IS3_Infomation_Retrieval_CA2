The results published on Thursday indicated that out of 4.5 million voters casting their ballots in the local plebiscites, over 3.6 million would like the Russian language to become that of work, record-keeping, education and science in the area, mainly populated by ethnic Russians. The same 90 per cent of the voters agreed that the Russian language should be granted the status of a second state language throughout the Republic, which is to be sealed by the Ukrainian Constitution. The overwhelming majority of the voters also spoke in favour of Ukraine's signing the CIS charter and joining, as a full-fledged member, the economic union and the CIS interparliamentary assembly. Thus, Donbass has voiced its opinion. Time will show whether it will be taken into consideration by Ukrainian authorities. The Republican prosecutor general's office intends to press for the resolution by the Donetsk regional council to be declared null and void. But even if the court annuls the decisions of the two regional councils, what can be done about the opinion voiced by one seventh of Ukrainian citizens?
