The announcement was made during Kumagai's meeting with visiting Kazakh Vice-Prime Minister Syzdyk Abishev who is accompanying Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev on his official visit to Japan. The Japanese-Kazakh project to modernise the metallurgic plant in Karaganda will be the first to be insured by Japan. There are also plans to extend state insurance to a new oil pipeline to be built in Kazakhstan. However, this will become possible only if the Kazakh government provides firm guarantees of credit payments to Japanese companies. Abishev called on Japan to double investments in the Kazakh economy, adding that the Republic has only three joint ventures with the participation of Japanese capital. Kumagai expressed the hope that Japanese companies will boost investments in Kazakhstan if it creates favourable conditions for foreign investors.
