He informed Kazakh and foreign journalists about state of developments in political and military ties between Kazakhstan and Russia. Zhukeyev noted in particular that last year the two countries signed at various levels a package of key documents on broadening military cooperation. Touching upon the use of Baykonur, the state advisor stressed that this important strategic object after the forthcoming summit talks would be likely to be let to the Russian military department [defense ministry]. All work connected with the exploration of space will be conducted in future in the interests of Kazakhstan and Russia. A research space company is intended to be set up in future to work for the benefit of both states. A first step has been taken in restructuring the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing site, which has some unique equipment. In addition, the idea of organizing a national nuclear center in Kazakhstan was discussed. Zhukeyev said that between Kazakhstan and Russia a complete mutual understanding has been reached concerning building of military and political ties. This once more vividly shows that our two countries do not have a single problem which it were not possible to tackle on the basis of good will.
