NATO has issued an ultimatum for all heavy weapons to be withdrawn from Serb-besieged Sarajevo by February 21 or its warplanes will destroy the guns. The NATO demand issued last Wednesday does not include infantry or light weapons. Karadzic said the Serb agreement to withdraw its heavy artillery was not in respect of the NATO ultimatum but according to a previous agreement reached with the UN envoy for Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi. "On 5th of February I agreed with Mr. Akashi a settlement for long-lasting ceasefire in Sarajevo and this agreement envisaged on-site control of heavy weaponry of both sides Serbian and Moslem," Karadzic said. "We are not members of NATO. We do not live with NATO. We have agreed this ceasefire with Moslems brokered by Mr. Akashi and this agreement envisaged control of Moslem infantry," Karadzic said.
