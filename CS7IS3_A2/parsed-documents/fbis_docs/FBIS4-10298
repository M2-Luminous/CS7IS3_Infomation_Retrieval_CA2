Government representatives and leaders of the CRS -- a dissident group once under the Marxist Army of National Liberation (ELN) -- today signed an agreement incorporating about 850 members of this organization -- 430 of whom were bearing weapons -- into national political and institutional life. The agreement was signed in Flor del Monte (northern Colombia). On 9 March 1990, the 19th April Movement became the first group to lay down its weapons. It was followed by the Popular Liberation Army (EPL) in March 1991, the People's Revolutionary Party (PRT) in April 1991, and the Quintin Lame Indians Movement in May 1991. The weapons surrender ceremony in Flor del Monte (Sucre) was attended by a dozen ambassadors, politicians from all parties, delegations from domestic and international organizations, and Catholic Church representatives -- all of whom attended as observers. The activities marking this event began on 8 April with the collection and inventory of weapons and ammunition under the supervision of an international oversight group established to monitor compliance with the agreements. The Dutch Government and Socialist International are members of this oversight group. The weapons will be smelted and turned into bells for churches located in the pacified zone. Meanwhile, the ammunition was spent when the rebels fired all of their weapons into the air. In all, some 450 weapons were emptied, including rifles, submachine guns, revolvers, and pistols of various calibers. The last remaining weapons, which are in the hands of some 50 men, will be surrendered in two parts -- today during the main ceremony and, later, when the combatants start to abandon their camp. After the ceremonies, which included cultural activities and a symbolic farewell to arms, the Flor del Monte camp will be dismantled and the former combatants will immediately depart for different regions to establish political headquarters and work places. The Arco Iris Foundation, which was established by the guerrillas, will coordinate the integration process. It will be in charge of channeling funds to various programs, including programs aimed at promoting small businesses and farms. The CRS also will be entitled to two seats in the Chamber of Representatives. Some 430 members of this group are in the camp, and there are another 221 in various prisons. There are also about 200 people who have been giving the CRS political and logistical support. Most of these people have been investigated for subversion. Now, they also will enjoy legal benefits. The negotiations included eight areas: human rights, civic participation, economic consensus, regional development, economic and social integration, political benefits, legal benefits, and the surrender of weapons. The CRS emerged five years ago following a split within the ELN. The ELN is a Marxist guerrilla group led by former Spanish priest Manuel Perez. Some commanders had criticized the philosophy, methods, and procedures used by the group's central leadership. Based on these major differences, a dissident group known initially as "The Patch" [El Parche] emerged. The ELN dissidents mainly disagreed with making the struggle more military than political and focusing it on the countryside and not in urban centers. They also disapproved of the strategy of using terrorism and kidnapping to promote the war against the state. Following the CRS demobilization, there are still some 10,000 active guerrillas, mostly under the Communist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the ELN, and a dissident group of the EPL.
