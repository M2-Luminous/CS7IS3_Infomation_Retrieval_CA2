According to an on-going national conference on cotton production here, the new techniques widely applied include improved strains of seeds that promise high yield and resistance to diseases, plastic film covering in the early period of growth, application of mixed fertilizer, transplantation of cotton seedlings and sowing of de-haired seeds. Over the past five years, nearly ten varieties of improved cotton strains, including Zhongmian 12, Zhongmian 16, Zhongmian 17, Lumian 10 and Emian 18, have been widely applied. The Simian 3 developed by Jiangsu Province boosts per unit cotton yield by about 20 percent as compared with common varieties. The de-haired cotton seeds have been extensively applied in Anhui and Xinjiang. Xinjiang, which reported a good cotton harvest last year despite the widespread drop in output in other areas of the country, uses plastic film covering in 96 percent of its cotton fields and Shandong applied plastic film covering and seedling nursing and transplantation in three-fourths of its cotton growing areas. The photosynthesized trace element fertilizer, which can raise cotton yield by at least 10 percent, is also widely used. China is one of the biggest cotton growers in the world. Its annual output hit a record 6.25 million tons in 1984. But over the past two years, due to infestation of cotton bollworms, adverse weather conditions and reduction in cotton growing acreage, the cotton output has dropped for two successive years to 3.76 million tons in 1993. The central government has made great efforts to boost cotton acreage since the beginning of this year and achieved some results. Reports from various places show that the cotton acreage this year is much more than last and all localities have adopted early preventive measures against cotton bollworms that have eaten up millions of tons of cotton over the past two years.
