This follows negotiations between the two sides of the strike action by Lesotho Police for an increase of 60 percent in salaries and 100 percent increase in allowances. Other features of the understanding between the two sides were that the issue of allowances was already being addressed by the government that vehicles at the Ministry of Home Affairs should be returned to the ministry. The understanding also noted that representations by the police did not accommodate the army and its officials. It was agreed that any outstanding issues should be attended to through the normal government channels. The negotiations between the two sides were held in a very cordial atmosphere.
