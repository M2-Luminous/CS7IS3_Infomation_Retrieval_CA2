Security Council, a panel of some 40 Japanese and U.S. academics, diplomats and U.N. executives said Wednesday [6 April]. This would make up for an increasingly serious shortage of U.N. resources, such as peacemaking personnel, financial resources, and other means needed to keep or enforce peace in conflict-torn areas, it said in a 16-page report. The panel, formed by the United Nations Association of the United States (UNA-USA) and the Asia-Pacific Association of Japan (APA), said U.N. authorization of military force should be a last resort and relatively rare, but once decided should be carried out efficiently, effectively and professionally. "To accomplish this, however, will entail major improvements in command and control procedures, in training, in the preparatory earmarking of troops...and supplies, and in the provision of financial support," it said. Pointing to the need for a further use of U.N. peacekeeping activities, it urged that member states "contribute to the strengthening of that capability." To resolve the problem of financial constraints on the U.N. peacemaking budget, it urged all member states to "explore the possibility of paying the U.N. peacekeeping assessments from their defense budgets." The panel also recommended Japan and the U.S. "maintain close cooperation on all U.N.-related matters, particularly those involving the Security Council." To this end, it recommended that "American and Japanese representatives meet regularly in New York and consult on outstanding U.N. issues." The report acknowledged, however, the U.N. difficulty, due to its financial and personnel limitations, in living up to the expectations from the international community to ensure peace. It expressed understanding of arguments by some U.S. intellectuals that the U.S. forces should keep its independence of command from U.N. peacekeeping operations in enforcing peace. "We fully acknowledge that not all of the suspicion and resistance, if not outright opposition, to U.N.-led multilateralism derives from selfishness and shortsightedness," the report said. "There are genuine dilemmas that we must face up to and resolve," it said, adding that it hopes the report's recommendations will "provide some impetus for overcoming these dilemmas." The report, titled, "Addressing the New Challenge, Regional Crisis Management and the United Nations" and based on two and a half years of research, was drafted under the co-chairmanship of Donald McHenry, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., and Ryukichi Imai, former Japanese ambassador to the U.N. Geneva Disarmament Conference. The UNA-USA urged the U.S. State Department to implement its recommendations to bolster the capability of the U.N. to restore peace in various conflict-marred regions at a time when the U.S. is increasingly loath to police such trouble spots. The institution is a private research group dedicated to strengthening the U.N. and enhancing U.S. participation in it. The APA is a quasigovernmental research group affiliated with the Japanese Foreign Ministry.
