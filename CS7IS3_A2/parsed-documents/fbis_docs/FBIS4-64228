This applies, above all, to the pioneers of reform -- the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary -- but also to Slovenia, Estonia, and, a bit farther behind, also to Slovakia, the Eastern and Central Europe Association (OMV) announced in Hamburg at its members' meeting on Thursday [28 April]. The importance of Eastern Europe for German foreign trade has increased. Foreign trade turnover with this region increased by at least 6 percent in 1993 to 88.2 billion German marks, while foreign trade as a whole decreased by 10 percent, the OMV annual report says. The share of trade with Eastern Europe in Germany's total foreign trade amounted to 7.7 percent. The association is confident that the positive effects of trade and cooperation on economic growth will increasingly benefit also the weaker economies and will thus support the reform process, the report says. This applies to the CIS countries, even though in particular in Russia inflation had declined by the end of 1993. Romaine and Bulgaria, for their part, are orienting themselves toward market economy but do not yet show any real success, the report says. Members of the OMV are all leading German companies which conduct trade with Eastern and Central Europe or produce goods there.
