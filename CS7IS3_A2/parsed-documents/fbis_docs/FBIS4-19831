The demand to split up social security is supported by some 40 percent of the Flemings. This was published by CAMPUSKRANT, the magazine of the Catholic University of Louvain (KUL). The poll results are based on interviews carried out in early 1992 among 2,691 Flemings. Based on this poll, the researchers Bart Maddens, Roeland Beerten, and Jaak Billiet describe 30.8 percent of the Flemings as "Belgian nationalists," 10.8 percent as "Flemish nationalists," and 32.8 percent as "regionalists." The latter identify with Flanders but are not anti-Belgium. Among the respondents, 13.2 percent are "hesitantly Belgians." They are very Belgium-minded, except when it comes to social security. An opposite attitude is found among the "hesitant regionalists" (12.5 percent). A remarkable phenomenon is that one-third of the voters whose party preference goes to the Vlaams Blok [Flemish Bloc], are "Belgian nationalists" and "hesitant Belgians." The Volksunie [The People's Union] has the highest percentage (71.3 percent) of "Flemish nationalists" and "regionalists." Most of the "Belgian nationalists" are found in the SP [Socialist Party] (38.9 percent), followed by Agalev [Green Party] (34.9 percent), and the CVP [Christian People's Party] (32.4 percent). Pro-Flemish people are found more among highly educated and less among noneducated people. The "Belgian nationalists" attach much less importance to community problems than others and consequently form a silent majority. "As is often the case, we are dealing with a fervent minority, whose ideas get the most response from politicians and in the media," Billiet concludes.
