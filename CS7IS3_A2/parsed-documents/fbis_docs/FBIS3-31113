At the close of three-day talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina in Geneva on Saturday, Stoltenberg told newsmen that this plan presumes a union of the three (Serb, Croat, Moslem) republics in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Moslem republic would cover 33.56 per cent of the total territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, while the U.N. and E.U. would take up administration over Sarajevo and Mostar, respectively. Representatives of the three warring sides agreed to meet again in Geneva late February or early March. Bosnian Moslems accepted a two-year U.N. administration of Sarajevo, but only within an integral peace solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina -- not a "separate agreement", Stoltenberg explained. Stoltenberg favourably appraised the fact that a debate was raised about territories as the most delicate question. As was originally planned, the confidence and security build-up measures alone should have been discussed, while the opening of hot-lines amongst the three military commands was agreed. The delegation heads of the three warring sides have not resolved the problems of 15 controversial territories. As Stoloenberg put it, the Moslems and Croats still lacked the common language about seven towns in central Bosnia-Herzegovina, and so did the Serbs and Moslems concerning eight localities in eastern and western Bosnia-Herzegovina. Stoltenberg said it was significant that the latest round of talks at least clarified the general concept of a future Bosnia-Herzegovina so that all the sides had now accepted the idea of a union of three republics. It was also accepted that the Serb-Moslem talks at Sarajevo Airport should resume, while the Croat-Moslem group for Mostar should meet on February 16 to work out the details concerning the E.U. administration of this town. Stoltenberg was confident that the U.S. would favourably act on the outcome of the peace talks when he recalled that he and Lord Owen, as co-chairmen of the conference on ex-Yugoslavia, had long lacked support in their negotiation efforts before the more active inclusion into this process of the E.U. in November and December, and, most recently, of the U.S. and the Russian Federation. Asked whether he feared the U.S. might come out with a proposal that should annull the E.U. action plan, Stoltenberg answered that he only was disturbed by the fact that peace was not yet achieved. He said that he was ready to welcome and accept every solution that might step up this proces, and added that the American administration's stand clearly revealed that the U.S. was upholding the basic ideas in the E.U. peace plan.
