Denktas stated that as long as the Turkish Cypriots' constructive stand continues the Turkish Government will support the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC]. The TRNC delegation comprised of Denktas; Prime Minister Hakki Atun; Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime minister; Atay Ahmet Rasit, foreign affairs and defense minister returned to the island after completing their contacts in Turkey. In a statement at Ercan [Tymbou] Airport, Denktas said that views were exchanged on the Cyprus issue and on the confidence-building measures at the meetings held with the Turkish delegation headed by President Suleyman Demirel. Indicating that the TRNC delegation also submitted its economic demands to the Turkish Government, Denktas said that these requests were received with understanding. Denktas also expressed the wish that the Greek Cypriot administration stop its claim that it is the sole government of Cyprus, thus preventing the perpetuation of the negotiations. Denktas said: I told you prior to my departure that I wish for us to return from Turkey happy and content. We have returned to the island happy and content.
