FR940106-2-00018 FR940106-2-00007 For both companies, in order to avoid overstating financing charges, we applied the interest expense ratio to each month's COM calculated on a historical basis rather than amounts computed under the replacement cost basis. Comment 4: Petitioners maintain that CBCC and Minasligas failed to follow the Department's established practice for allocating G&A expenses. Petitioners make the same allegation with regard to CBCC's selling expenses. Petitioners claim that G&A expenses are period costs that should be allocated based on the ratio of total annual G&A expenses over total annual costs of goods sold. Selling expenses should be allocated similarly. However, petitioners state that CBCC allocated G&A and selling expenses to individual products, using the ratio of each separate product's cost of goods sold. Minasligas allocated POI G&A expenses on a monthly basis. For purposes of the final determination, petitioners believe that the Department should reallocate these expenses following its established practice. CBCC argues that the Department should not use the ratio of expenses to cost of goods sold as an estimate of G&A expenses. CBCC believes that the monthly expenses accurately reflect, on a replacement cost basis, the expenses for the company in that month and are the most appropriate figures to use. CBCC claims that the petitioners are urging the Department to use a methodology that the Court of International Trade specifically invalidated as susceptible to overstating the effects of inflation. Minasligas agrees that G&A expenses are period costs, but maintains that an annual calculation based on cost of sales is problematic because the annual G&A expense and the annual cost of sales are conglomerations of monthly expenses which have not been adjusted for inflation. Minasligas believes the Department should calculate G&A rates based on monthly averages or a simple average G&A rate. DOC Position: We agree with petitioners in part. G&A expenses are period expenses which are normally measured over a fiscal year. As such, the Department calculates G&A on an annual basis. To calculate G&A for a lesser period may exclude certain expenses, which is distortive. Therefore, we recalculated G&A expenses on an annual historical basis for both companies and, in order to avoid overstating G&A expenses and neutralize hyperinflationary effects, we applied the G&A ratio to each month's COM calculated on a historical basis. We also revised CBCC's reported G&A to include a portion of Solvay do Brasil's G&A, which CBCC had failed to include in its reported costs. Moreover, we calculated CBCC's selling expense portion of SG&A based on sales of the same class or kind of merchandise according to our normal practice. Comment 5: Petitioners contend that the Department should include ICMS and IPI taxes in CBCC's and Minasligas' reported materials costs in applying the Department's sales-below-cost test. Petitioners state that Department practice is to perform the sales-below-cost test on a tax-inclusive basis, with the COP and home market prices containing the same absolute amount of taxes. With regard to CV, petitioners contend that the Department has previously determined that ICMS and other domestic taxes are not remitted or refunded upon exportation and consequently have to be included in CV. CBCC submits that the Department should not include the ICMS and IPI taxes in its COP and CV calculations. CBCC states that the Department reviewed CBCC's records at verification showing that CBCC's payments of ICMS offset any amount owed by virtue of its receipts of ICMS. Thus, CBCC claims that the ``cost of materials'' does not include any ICMS or IPI value, because CBCC always receives a tax credit for these payments. Minasligas argues that in determining whether home market sales are above the cost of production, the Department must either include ICMS and IPI in the cost of production and in the sales price to the domestic market or exclude them from both sides to avoid double counting. Minasligas further argues that these taxes should not be included in calculations of CV because they are offset against the amounts collected from the domestic market sales. DOC Position: We agree with petitioners in part. For our test of home market sales below cost we have included the same amount of domestic taxes in the COP and the domestic sales prices. However, when using CV as a surrogate for home market prices we must determine if in fact the entity under investigation is able to recover all of the taxes paid on inputs (raw materials) from its domestic sales of subject merchandise. If domestic sales of subject merchandise fully recover all of the domestic taxes paid on inputs, then these taxes would appropriately be excluded from the margin analysis. However, if the producer is not able to recover all input taxes from its sales of subject merchandise, then these actual costs must be reflected in the CV. (See Camargo Correa Metais, S.A., v. United States , Slip Op. 93&hyph;163, p. 19 (August 13, 1993). We have determined that CBCC's domestic sales of subject merchandise fully recover all input taxes incurred to produce the subject merchandise sold in both the domestic and export markets. We have excluded the domestic tax amounts from CV because the taxes paid are offset against the amounts which are collected on domestic sales which are rebated to the government.
