The participants discussed the draft program of the forthcoming 41st BSP Congress. This is how BSP leader Zhan Videnov assessed today's plenum: [Begin Videnov recording] I am very satisfied with the results of today's open and expanded plenum. The party obviously has a good potential that allows it to generate ideas of a really profound and programmatic essence and discuss them in a calm and civilized manner. I hope that when the drafts, which have already been prepared, are soon published, this style of debate will be transferred to the entire party and society. We are prepared to calmly discuss the results of this plenum at the congress. [end recording] The Alliance for Social Democracy was the only faction within the BSP that presented its own draft program for the forthcoming congress. Chavdar Kyuranov, chairman of the Alliance for Social Democracy, assessed today's plenum in the following manner.: [Begin Kyuranov recording] Something very important took place at today's plenum. The plenum steered itself toward adopting a very democratic decision --to form a commission that will work on the draft programs and produce a uniform proposal for the program. This decision differs from previous decisions on the same matter. As far as our program is concerned, I have a technical explanation. We were able to submit our draft rather late. It was disseminated only this morning, so we could not ask the plenum participants to express their opinions on our draft program. [end recording]
