The uranium and mercury, originating in Russia, were seized by Romanian customs officials as the Moldovans crossed the land frontier at Leuseni, and were to be sold on to one or several unknown customers, they said. Ukrainian authorities and Black Sea security forces on Wednesday arrested six people involved in a plot to smuggle out 300 grammes of a ``highly radioactive material'' worth one million dollars, according to Ukrainian radio monitored by the BBC in London. The report did not say where the arrests were made, what kind of radioactive material was involved, or where it was bound. More than 20 kilogrammes (44 pounds) of red mercury and 20 containers of cesium have been intercepted this year at the frontier between the former Soviet republic of Moldova and the culturally similar republic of Romania, where border controls for nationals of the two countries have in principle been simplified. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991, smugglers carrying nuclear materials from Russia and other former Soviet republics have been arrested in several central and eastern European countries.
