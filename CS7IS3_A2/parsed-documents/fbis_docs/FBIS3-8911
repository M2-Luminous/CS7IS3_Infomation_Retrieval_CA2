Just before 1100 the chetniks opened fierce artillery fire at the town and the surrounding area, unselectively destroying residential quarters. Only at 1400, when NATO bombers appeared and swooped over them, did their guns fall silent. Some 30 destructive shells were fired from multiple rocket launchers at the town, killing one person and inflicting serious wounds on two others. So the suffering of the population of this town is continuing with new brutality every day, and things are only made worse by hunger. There is no sign of the convoy with food that has been announced for today, as Karadzic's mob is still preventing the entry of the aid that is so needed in Maglaj.
