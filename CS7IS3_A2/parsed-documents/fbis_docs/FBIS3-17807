This was reported at a Tuesday briefing in Moscow by the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov. He described the current situation in the Korean peninsula as balancing on the brink of war. In his opinion the recent Russian initiative to convene a conference of six interested countries (China, the USA, Japan, Russia and the two Koreas) and the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency promotes a settlement in that part of the world. The deputy minister stressed that Russia by no means questions the efforts of the UN Security Council or the IAEA. "However, the steps of the two organizations to normalize the situation in the Korean peninsula do not always produce the desired results", he remarked. Panov announced that the Russian initiative is closely studied by all interested sides. "So far there have been no negative answers", he said. In the opinion of the diplomat the conference should concentrate on making the peninsula a nuclear-free zone. He stressed that Russia and the USA agree that the conference should be well-prepared and discuss the membership of North Korea in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the observation of all safety regulations and a joint declaration of the two Koreas on a nuclear-free zone. According to Panov, the conference could begin in Geneva and continue in Pyongyang and Seoul interchangeably. The diplomat said that in the framework of organizing the conference it would be useful to hold preliminary unofficial consultations of all interested sides in Moscow. "It is absolutely unnecessary for everyone to sit at the same table. We understand that some participants would find it hard to communicate directly therefore we do not rule out the possibility of mediators", Panov said. He added that a conference of six countries, representatives of the UN Secretary General and the General Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency is not the final format and the list of participants could be extended.
