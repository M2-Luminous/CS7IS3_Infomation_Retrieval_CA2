FR940921-0-00107 FR940921-0-00016 (A) For gasoline-fuel and diesel-fuel; Density NMHC =16.33 g/ft 3 -carbon atom (0.5768 kg/m 3 -carbon atom), assuming an average carbon to hydrogen ratio of 1:1.85 at 68 ○F (20 ○C) and 760 mm Hg (101.3 kPa) pressure. (B) For natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas-fuel; Density NMHC =1.1771(12.011+H/C (1.008)) g/ft 3 -carbon atom (0.04157(12.011+H/C (1.008))kg/m 3 -carbon atom), where H/C is the hydrogen to carbon ratio of the hydrocarbon components of the test fuel, at 68 ○F (20 ○C) and 760 mm Hg(101.3 kPa) pressure. * * * * * (vi) r CH4 =HC FID response to methane for natural gas-fueled vehicles as measured in §86.121(d). For all other vehicles r CH4 =1. (9)(i) CH 4mass =Methane emissions, in grams per test phase. (ii) Density CH4 =Density of methane is 18.89 g/ft 3 -carbon atom (0.6672 kg/m 3 -carbon atom), at 68 ○F (20 ○C) and 760 mm Hg (101.3 kPa) pressure. * * * * * 65. Section 86.150&hyph;98 of subpart B is amended by revising the section heading and adding a new paragraph (d) to read as follows: §86.150&hyph;98 Refueling test procedure; overview. * * * * * (d) For liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles only. Refueling test procedures for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks operated on liquefied petroleum gas are described in §86.157.
