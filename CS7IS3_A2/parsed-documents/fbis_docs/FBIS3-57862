The winner of the Russian elections had threatened with World War III; he talked about stationing 300,000 troops in Germany and about claims to German compensation payments for damage done in World War II. The chairman of the East Committee of the German Economy, Otto Wolff von Amerongen, said: "The new Zhirinovskiy element will not increase people's willingness to invest." The Bonn-based Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce said that "the climate is deteriorating," and this affects all sectors of industry. The Federal Government reacted to Zhirinovskiy's threat quite calmly. Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt told DIE WELT that German-Russian trade relations have "a sound base founded on mutual interests." They have "proved solid" also in the difficult times of the Cold War. Rexrodt cannot see Zhirinovskiy's positions shaking these foundations: "Yeltsin and the Russian Government still consider a further expansion of trade relations with the West, and especially with Germany, their top priority," Rexrodt pointed out. Moscow is well aware that the industrialized nations and the international financial institutions must be of first importance in the reform process, Rexrodt said. "The economy is not panicking," Karl-Hermann Fink, manager of the East Committee of the German Economy, said. He said that all the long-term projects are continuing. Within the German gas industry, which buys some 30 percent of its supplies from Russia, there is no trace of alarm. Neither the market leader Ruhrgas in Essen, nor Wintershall Erdgas Handelshaus GmbH, the German partner of the Russian Gazprom, are planning any emergency measures.
