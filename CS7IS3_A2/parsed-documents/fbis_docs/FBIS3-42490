Lyubayev; place and date of interview not given: "Postscript to a Seizure"] [Text] Administrative structures of the Ukrainian Navy are continuing their attempts to unilaterally resubordinate units of the Black Sea Fleet's Naval Engineer Services (MIS). The Ukrainian side is using the most diverse assortment of uncivilized methods of influence to this end--persuasion and promises, blackmail and threats, and even demonstrations of force. Recently for example, premises of the Odessa and Nikolayev MIS [Naval Engineer Services] departments were taken under the control of armed representatives of the Ukrainian Navy. How could this have happened before a political solution was found for the Black Sea Fleet? Who specifically made it possible for the provocative acts of seizing MIS subunits in Odessa and Nikolayev to occur? What conclusions follow from an analysis of these events? The editor's office is receiving many such questions today. In order to answer them, our correspondent met with Colonel Vyacheslav Kim, chief of the Naval Engineer Services, and interviewed him. [Lyubayev] Vyacheslav Ilich, when and how did you learn that, for example, the Odessa branch of the OMIS [Department of Naval Engineer Services] snapped and is hanging by thread, if I may put it that way? [Kim] I got a phone call in the evening. It was from Captain A. Sharapov, deputy chief of the OMIS. "What should I do?" was the first question he anxiously asked. The situation was clearly out of the ordinary. As it turns out, OMIS chief Major N. Klyushnikov had quietly transferred his allegiance to Ukraine and then acted unpredictably. I couldn't see the details from by distant vantage point. Therefore I gave Sharapov the textbook instructions. If Klyushnikov did in fact decide to change his place of service, then let him leave for the Ukrainian Navy. And he, Captain Sharapov, should naturally take over his duties until a decision was made by the commander. It didn't seem like there should be any special difficulties. But it became clear from further discussion that everything was much more complex than I thought. The OMIS building was taken under guard by Ukrainian servicemen, and this raiding party (15 well-instructed youths) would not allow Captain Sharapov into his office, and was generally behaving provocatively. Does this mean that someone in Kiev decided to once again test the patience of Black Sea Fleet seamen? The plan, I think, is simple. If the command of the Black Sea Fleet and the Russian side were to confine themselves to restrained condemnation of the predatory act, then the violators of the Massandra agreements could boldly move further in their forcible transfer of the entire infrastructure of the Black Sea Fleet to Ukrainian jurisdiction. Let them carry on with their presidential meetings at the top according to plan, let them seek political solutions to the difficult problems, while we at the level of the Ukrainian Navy will start another process here--that of confiscating another's property and changing the allegiance of the personnel, and the spirit of adventuristic attack and a freebooter's luck will aid us in these efforts. But can a "state" navy be created on such shaky ground? [Lyubayev] The answer to that, Vyacheslav Ilich, is evident in your question. How did events develop in the Nikolayev MIS department? [Kim] Basically along the same mystery-novel line. Lieutenant Colonel Ye. Krichevskiy, chief of the MIS department, renounced his first oath in secret and then took another--the Ukrainian oath--together with his deputy, Captain G. Kotelenets. After that, the story follows the familiar rut. These newly made "officials of the Nikolayev OMIS of the Ukrainian Navy" began summoning the department's civilian associates and demanding their unquestioning obedience to the new department. I don't have anything against those officers and shore-based and seagoing warrant officers who transfer to the Ukrainian Navy in a civilized way. That's the right of each person--to serve wherever he sees fit. But I can't at all understand people who say one thing today and then do quite the opposite tomorrow. After all, no one forced that Major N. Klyushnikov to portray himself as being faithful to his oath forever. When I met him at a conference of MIS department and unit executives I asked him what he would do if Ukrainian "emissaries" asked him to stand beneath the yellow and blue banner. Nikolay Vasilyevich protested with righteous indignation. How could you ask me such a thing, Comrade Commander, I never would, for anything! But then just a few days later he goes and quietly transfers his allegiance and allows the Ukrainian side to seize the OMIS by force. The same hypocritical situation (I simply can't find any other words) essentially repeated itself in a conversation with Lieutenant Colonel Ye. Krichevskiy. He sent his deputy to the conference I mentioned above in his stead, and so I had to telephone Yevgeniy Ruvimovich, who "fell ill" unexpectedly, and ask him point-blank--had he already taken another oath? His answer was no. Krichevskiy was not about to soil his honor as an officer, he was faithful to the Black Sea Fleet, and so on in the same spirit. And then I learned that Yevgeniy Ruvimovich had been toying with me. With the first psychological attack by Ukrainian recruiters, he agreed to carry out a "revolution" in the department. [Lyubayev] The impression is created that the Ukrainian naval department is "snipping away" at the Black Sea Fleet's infrastructure by just one means--from above. They persuade or frighten a subunit chief and force him to change his allegiance, and then it is assumed that all of the administration under his control would transfer to the Ukrainian Navy. [Kim] This is precisely how the Ukrainian side proceeded in "disconnecting" the Odessa and Nikolayev MIS departments from the Black Sea Fleet. You needn't even ask whether such an act is legal. Armed seizure of two of our OMIS sections is a concrete expression of legal tyranny which some local representatives of the Ukrainian Navy are so eager to legalize. But this naturally sounds an alarm: Who is going to answer, and to whom, if material valuables in unilaterally Ukrainianized MIS subunits are squandered? Officially, after all, Major Klyushnikov, Lieutenant Colonel Krichevskiy and his deputy, Captain Kotelenets, have been dismissed from their positions and discharged into the reserves. But in reality they continue to portray themselves as full-fledged chiefs, and no one knows how this will end. [Lyubayev] It is but one step from such confrontation to dangerous conflict. In response to the forcible act by Ukrainian servicemen, Black Sea Fleet seamen might respond with adequate actions, and then the stage would be set for scuttling of the soon to be held Russian-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea Fleet. But could this be something someone in Kiev actually wants? And is patience on the part of the command of the Black Sea Fleet the only reasonable response today to the provocations from the other side? [Kim] Judging from everything, it isn't because things are going so well for it that the Ukrainian Navy is taking such actions against our fleet. When you get right down to it, the organizers of such actions can hardly take joy in their successes in recruiting certain Black Sea Fleet officials to serve in behalf of the idea of Ukrainian self-rule. It wouldn't of course be all that hard to gather together a certain number of managers like Klyushnikov, Krichevskiy and Kotelenets. Except, will this "nucleus of executive personnel" be sufficiently dependable and professionally mature? I hardly think so. Anyone who once transfers his allegiance isn't going to distinguish himself with an exemplary attitude toward his work. Personal interests and unfulfilled ambitions are almost always foremost in the minds of such a person. [Lyubayev] What type of personnel are the glue, in your opinion, holding together the unity of the Black Sea Fleet today? [Kim] It would be the officers and shore-based and seagoing warrant officers who are in no hurry to run from one army to another, to change their convictions and emblems, and their life's reference points. Such people include, for example, Captain Aleksandr Sharapov from the Odessa OMIS, who remained faithful to his oath, and Colonel Sergey Dybovskiy, chief of the Nikolayev UNR, who categorically refused to assist in the resubordination of his collective to Ukrainian will. Nor did Captain 2d Rank Aleksandr Tkach, chief of the Izmail MIS department, give in to blackmail and threats. In order frighten him, they told this officer that if he did not transfer his allegiance, he would never find a place to live in Izmail, and he shouldn't expect anything good to happen in his future. But no matter how hard those wretched recruiters try to win over the real patriots of the fatherland by their ridiculous scare tactics, they can't bring down the unified Black Sea Fleet. It is on this optimistic note that I would like to end our discussion. [Lyubayev] Thank you for the interview.
