China has had power shortages for 20 years, and the people have been waiting 20 years for the electric power industry to lead the takeoff of other industries. But the electric power industry bears heavy burdens, which are keeping it from taking off. An annual increase of 12 million kW in installed generating capacity is insufficient to catch up with the increase in demand, and the annual electricity shortfall is still as great as 20 percent. The electric power industry has been operating at more than full load for 20 years, its equipment continues to be overburdened, and investments are inadequate; it lacks the capability to replace obsolete equipment, and damaged or defective generating sets continue to operate. In addition, a heavy debt of more than 90 billion yuan is making it difficult for state-owned enterprises, which are the mainstay of the power industry, to continue. Western observers say that it would take a miracle for China's economy to achieve a growth rate of 10 percent or more with an 8 percent rate of expansion of the power industry. People in China's electric power industry state that "We are bearing up under every calamity and pressing forward under a heavy burden." Operating at Full Load, Working at More Than Full Load A visitor to the Beijing No. 1 heat and power plant has reason for amazement. Three large generating sets that were commissioned in 1958 have already exceeded their rated service life by 150,000 to 200,000 hours. Starting in the 1970's, the quadrennial major overhaul has had to be replaced by an annual overhaul. Practically every assembly of the boilers, steam turbogenerators and main transformers has had repeated major repairs. When repair is no longer possible, they have been replaced one by one, so that by now all components have been replaced at least once. In this large enterprise, which relies on its superannuated, aging equipment to provide power to a large part of the capital, overuse has caused cracks up to 82mm deep to form in the wall of the boiler steam jacket. The cracks have been patched by welding to keep the equipment operating. Wang Miaocheng, who has been a duty engineer at the plant for 20 years, says that each day's work is done with his heart in his throat. The operation of worn, superannuated equipment is by no means limited to this plant. Many generator sets that were commissioned during the First 5-Year Plan are still in operation. According to statistics from the Ministry of Electric Power, in the current power grid, medium- and low-voltage generating sets representing a total capacity of 33 million kW are in need of thorough renovation or modernization, and, in addition, 7 million kW of severely deficient hydropower generating equipment and 6 million kW of overage heat supply equipment is still in operation. If you take the road north from the Shanhaiguan Pass, you will see the sagging cooling towers of old power plants; if you touch them, you will find that their concrete coating is scaling off. When the head of the Panmian electric power office in Liaoning assumed his duties, he discovered that the tables and chairs used for office work were relics of the Japanese-installed puppet government, and that the first domestically produced main transformer is still in operation. Maintaining reliable output amid a multitude of perils and maintaining a superior record of full-load operation have long been the daily reality in China's electric power industry. In order to alleviate China's electric power shortage, the power industry has always taken full generation and full delivery as its guidelines. For 20 years, the industry and the electric power enterprises, like the Beijing No. 1 heat and power plant, have consistently been operating at full capacity, with no breathing space. The national average annual number of hours of operation of fossil-fired generating sets is 6,000 hours; some newly constructed power plants operate their equipment for 7,000 hours or more a year; and in a few cases, the length of operation reaches 8,000 hours, far above the international standard of 5,000 hours per year. Behind this equipment-risking, exploitative mode of operation, to which there is no alternative, the electric power industry is also afflicted with inadequate equipment maintenance capabilities owing to depreciation rates that are below the national average. As a consequence, equipment overhauls must be extremely stringent and careful: they constitute a succession of intense struggles to gain a little more time and a little more quality. It is common for employees to work round the clock or to be on the job for a week without returning to their homes. A power plant director under the North China electric power office, who had spent several days and nights riveted to the site of a rush repair job, collapsed from exhaustion after the generating set finally rumbled back into operation. An accident resulting from a violation of regulations at the Hefei heat and power plant shocked the Ministry of Electric Power. Four persons were killed. But the comrades of the investigating board could hardly bring themselves to take action. At the time, two generating sets at the plant were being overhauled, and a mass of coal slag suddenly became hung up in the one unit that was still in operation. If the generator had stopped, there would have been a major emergency. As a consequence, the plant directory and the operating crew put themselves in harm's way, trying to prod loose the suspended slag inside the hot furnace. The slag, at a temperature of over 1000 degrees, fell down and crushed them. The situation in the power grid is even more difficult than that in the power plants. The country's urban and rural low-voltage power distribution network is universally outmoded. A considerable fraction of China's old municipal power networks have been in operation for 25 years or more, and some have been operating for 40 years. The bustling city center of Shanghai is still using power distribution equipment left over from the 1920's and 1930's; 30 percent of the utility poles are at or above the maximum rated load, voltages are too low, and breakdowns are frequent. In Dalian, Fushun, Shenyang, and Changchun, power distribution equipment left over from the Japanese puppet regime continues in use. In Beijing, emergency shutdowns caused by the aging power delivery facilities are almost a daily occurrence. The seriously aging power lines in Tian'anmen Square are now carrying five times the load for which they were designed. The insulation is peeling from wires that have been in operation for more than 30 years. Six years ago, the electric power departments proposed a program to replace this equipment, but it was shelved owing to lack of funding. People not in the industry have difficulty in comprehending that every success in the onerous task of power delivery is ultimately the result of "human wave" tactics in which personnel at all levels pitch in together. When the Asian Games were held in Beijing, the electric power departments mobilized a huge "militia," posting one person at each utility pole between the power plant and the site of the games in order to assure timely detection and rectification of malfunctions. Behind the full-load provision of light is an effort at more than full load by the machinery and personnel. A Virtually Insuperable Debt Corresponding to the equipment that cannot be modernized is a mounting debt. At the end of 1992, the major state-owned enterprises of the Ministry of Electric Power had a debt of 96.7 billion yuan. The fixed assets of the Ministry of Electric Power's East China Electric Corporation are the greatest of the country's 500 large enterprises, but the debt of the Northeast China power grid is fully 10.5 billion yuan, with an annual interest of 550 million yuan; the total operating profit of the power grid in 1991 was only 50 million yuan. After decades of struggle and devotion by their employees, well-known large enterprises that provide the power on which other enterprises rely for survival are making insufficient profits to pay even a fraction of the bank interest on their debts; they must wage an agonizing struggle to survive under their crushing indebtedness and its steadily compounding interest. It should be noted that for several decades, the electric power enterprises were well off. But since the policy of replacing allocations by loans was instituted in the 1980's, and especially since the second stage of replacing profit payments by taxes was instituted, the tax rate on the electric power industry has been increased from 15 percent to 25 percent; the combination of a high tax burden, high operating costs, and low prices have made the state-owned electric power enterprises increasingly hard pressed. As of 1990, the ministry's electric power enterprises were able to retain only 8.2 yuan of every 100 yuan of earnings. At the same time, prices for coal, oil, rail haulage and other transport were repeatedly adjusted upwards, and the prices of water, materials, and equipment rose steadily, so that the cost of producing electric power skyrocketed. In 1978, the cost of producing 1000 kWh of electric energy was 31.55 yuan, but by 1992 the cost of producing 1000 kWh in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power system had risen to 96.03 yuan; meanwhile, the prices charged for electric power remained basically unchanged. As a result of high taxes, high costs, and low prices, in the course of a decade the profitability rate of funds in the state-owned electric power enterprises declined steadily, from 12 percent in 1980 to 3.7 percent in 1991. The enterprises' borrowed funds correspondingly lost their ability to generate earnings sufficient to repay principal and interest, and the indebtedness of the large state-owned enterprises mounted rapidly, at a rate of 15 to 20 billion yuan a year, snowballing into a loan that could never be paid off. Since the bad practices of the old enterprises are so difficult to eradicate, can new construction projects bring about a beneficial cycle? The repayment period for Gezhouba is 24 years, with an annual principal and interest payment of 300 to 500 million yuan, but the total profit of the Gezhouba power station since it went into operation has been no more than 200 million yuan. The Dahua hydroelectric station and the Heshan fossil-fired power plant, newly constructed in Guangxi, have made a significant contribution to alleviating the electric power shortage in the area, but the annual loan interest alone for the two plants is 150 million yuan while the annual profit of the entire Guangxi power grid is only 60 million yuan. As the number of construction projects increases and as deliveries of electric power rise, the cost of producing power increases. As the contribution that the electric power enterprises make to the state and localities grows, the debt burden that they carry becomes steadily heavier. The difficulty of achieving a beneficial cycle is casting a dark shadow over the development of the electric power industry. In the first five months of 1993, less than 11 percent of the funds allocated for power construction nationwide were actually disbursed. There are, of course, many reasons, but everyone is calculating economic benefits, and who is willing to pour money into a bottomless pit? The failure to increase construction affects not only the present, but the future as well. We hope for a full supply of electric power as one hopes for rain clouds after a long drought. Electric Power Quality: A Difficult Task The burden of electric power enterprises is not limited to their debt of more than 90 billion yuan: another factor is the heavy sense of responsibility for improving the quality of China's overall supply of electric power. In Japan, interruptions of electric power to users total less than two hours a year. In the United States, they are a maximum of five to eight hours a year, and likewise in Europe. In China, for many years there have been power shortages 15 to 20 percent of the time, and in some provinces even 30 percent of the time. The only way to deal with them is to cut off the power or to cut back the supply. In 1992, as a result of these stoppages, the country lost between 500 and 700 billion yuan of output value. And behind this calculable loss there is another hidden loss. A decline in the quality of the electric power supply as a result of excessive load and below-standard frequency slows down machine tools and causes unevenness of yarn in textile mills and fading of colors in dyeing plants. These phenomena directly affect the quality of China's manufactured goods, and the intermediate hidden loss involved cannot be expressed in numerical terms. One year, a brilliant soccer game was being played in Shenyang. Just as one of the players made a kick toward the goal, the electric power suddenly went off. Shenyang went dark, the live broadcast stopped, and soccer fans all over the country were enraged. In Sheqi County, Henan, on one occasion the peasants left their wheat fields and walked 10 miles to burst into the electric power office and demand electricity. The conflicts of the energy shortage are concentrated in the electric power departments. In Guizhou, in order to maintain the prescribed frequency and to assure grid safety, a scheduler acting under orders from his superiors cut off the power to an enterprise that used excessive amounts of electric power. As a result, he was arrested and charged with "sabotaging production." In response, the electric power departments have done everything possible to resolve conflicts in a realistic spirit of "Don't wait, don't rely on others, don't bear a grudge," and have displayed profound understanding of society's "lack of understanding." From the original Ministry of Energy to the present-day Ministry of Electric Power, they have treated the work of supplying urban and rural dwellers with electric power for their daily needs as a matter of "promoting stability and unity and motivating the masses to build socialism." On two occasions they have issued regulations on maintaining the supply of electricity for daily needs and for lighting to the urban and rural populace. Assuring lighting means putting pressure on industrial production, which is a matter that requires infinitely painstaking planning. A tiny power-management office in the town of Niudu, Linyi County, Shanxi, created an approach that later was widely disseminated. At the time when the populace was making its peak use of electric lights, the office shut off nondomestic power supplies to assure that light would be available, and at the peak period of power consumption for purposes other than lighting, it made all possible efforts to assure that power would be available for production. It signed notarized electric power contracts with the users. The power supply office in Fucheng County, Hebei, made even more detailed regulations and installed meters to keep track of power use in periods when limitations were imposed. The local problem of "having the power go off just when dinner was served and seeing the sign-off when you turned on the television" was set right. The leadership and rank-and-file of many power industry offices in the country not only have a thorough knowledge of the industry, but are conversant with the circumstances of the local enterprises, services, and units. In addition to managing electric power effectively, they cannot avoid becoming involved in arranging social life as a whole. China's electric power industry and its personnel truly are called upon to shoulder too heavy a burden. Don't wait, don't depend on others, don't bear a grudge. Put out all your strength and effort, assure that the existing facilities are used with high efficiency. This spirit is precious and commands respect. It is this spirit of putting up with humiliation to perform one's mission and of continually driving oneself that supports China's ability to use its 8-percent rate of increase in electric power output to provide light and heat for a 10-percent growth rate of the national economy. But we can also see that the call for the power industry to get into a beneficial cycle is essential to assuring the sustained, stable, rapid development of China's economy.
