Ortega Candidacy PA2005204394 Managua Canal Cuatro Television in Spanish 0400 GMT 20 May 94 PA2005204394 Managua Canal Cuatro Television Spanish BFN [Interview with Tomas Borge, president of the Sandinist National Liberation Front, FSLN, Congress, by unidentified reporter on 20 May; place not give; from the "Extravision" newscast -- recorded] [Text] [Borge] Several foreign delegations have arrived. Others will arrive this afternoon, and the remainder will arrive tomorrow. There is a large number of foreign delegations from many nations, from Europe. [Reporter] How many delegations have arrived? [Borge] More than 100. There is an impressive number of observers. Observers are precisely that: They observe. There are also invitees who have a right to speak out, who have been designated by territory. These [words indistinct] are full delegates to the Congress who have a right to speak and to vote. My responsibility as president of the Congress, my obligation, is to be above any differences. That is my main responsibility. I must set aside all my opinions to lead the congress in an aboveboard, [word indistinct], fair, democratic manner, leaving no room for doubt. This is a very important national event. It goes without saying that I am not in favor of any faction. I do not favor factions. I say this before the Congress starts because I will reiterate it once the Congress begins and, if necessary, during the debates. As congress president, I must lead it in due form, but I also have the right to express my opinion. I have the right to express my opinion and, as a matter of fact, I have expressed my opinion on Daniel Ortega's candidacy for FSLN secretary general. It was not an easy decision because I have seen many contradictions over the years. Unlike other comrades, some of whom are now confronting him, I have never flattered him. I have always made things perfectly clear, as Daniel himself can attest. I have been critical of many actions, not just of Daniel's but of other comrades' as well. One such example is the time when the National Directorate decided to concentrate power -- under very special circumstances -- in the government's executive, even though the Directorate always participated in making the most important decisions. From a historical point of view, I have had good, friendly relations with Henry Ruiz. He and I belonged to one of those tendencies. I must confess that I now regret having been a member of one of those tendencies. I would have liked to have been above the tendencies at those times, but such were the circumstances. But, [words indistinct] with Henry Ruiz over all these years I have had a good relationship with him. I could say that I am more of a friend to Henry Ruiz that to Daniel Ortega. When it comes to political decisions, however, one should not consider friendship but what is more suitable for the revolution. I am totally convinced that beyond personal relations and beyond the differences we have had in the past, it is much more advisable for the FSLN to have Daniel Ortega as FSLN secretary general. Mind you, I have had more differences with Daniel Ortega than with Henry Ruiz. My friendship with Henry Ruiz is greater than with Daniel Ortega. Daniel Ortega has a great deal of support in the FSLN. Moreover, he has demonstrated an enormous capacity for work and innovation. In my opinion, and contrary to what others say, he is the candidate for unity because he has the most support. He is the candidate that will bring us together. My common sense tells me this. The candidate of unity is not a candidate who causes too much controversy inside the FSLN, as is the case with my friend Commander Henry Ruiz. The candidate of unity is my comrade Daniel Ortega, about whom I cannot say that I am not his friend and his brother. I am Daniel's friend and his brother, but I have been closer to Henry Ruiz. Nevertheless, when the time comes to make a decision as an FSLN activist and as member of Congress, I favor Comrade Daniel Ortega.
