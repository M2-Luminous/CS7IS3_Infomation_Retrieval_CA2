The condoms will be handed out together with leaflets on AIDS hazards. A round-table discussion on the problems of HIV carriers and their families is due to start next Tuesday. The experts will also discuss the risks to which medics are exposed. There are 121 registered HIV carriers in Bulgaria. The danger of the transmission of the infection through blood transfusion has been eliminated, according to experts of the central AIDS laboratory in Sofia. Only ten people have contracted the disease through homosexual contacts since AIDS tests were introduced. Heterosexual contacts remain the principal way of contracting AIDS and this is an alarming fact, physicians say. Eleven children were born to infected mothers, and one of them is definitively diagnosed as infected. The import of AZT, the only existing medicine for AIDS, is expensive and often unobtainable.
