This announcement was made today by the agency's representative, Antonio Tiro Sanchez. He added that, as has been announced nationally, the PGR plans to intensify its operations throughout the republic, and on the Yucatan Peninsula in particular. Its aim is to cover Campeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo States, where major federal crimes have occurred during recent years: in other words, drug trafficking. He also remarked that the agency in Campeche has explained its needs to the central authorities, and that a response is expected at any moment, with reinforced action to combat the drug traffic and other types of crime of concern to the Campeche authorities. He mentioned that one of the requests is for reinforcement of the surveillance along the state's federal highways being used to transport alkaloids. He admitted that there is, in fact, a highway checkpoint in Santa Adelayda, in the municipality of Paliza, but claimed that it has proven insufficient. He later asserted that the reinforced surveillance will be a reality, adding that the critical sites detected by the PGR and the Army would be covered, so as to arrest those committing federal crimes. He then stressed: "The PGR is continuing its various activities to prevent the commission of federal crimes, and is offering lectures to the citizens in general, and to teachers and professional people, seeking their support for the action being taken in this respect." Finally, he reported that, during 1993, 711 kg of cocaine had been seized, plus another ounce, in Ciudad del Carmen. The Army also succeeded in confiscating 727 kg of cocaine and destroyed two marijuana plantations.
