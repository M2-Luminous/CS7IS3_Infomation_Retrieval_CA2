For the first time, National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] has complied with its promise to present its response to the first proposal, which sought to narrow differences concerning the specific principles that will govern the national reconciliation process. In practice, it turned a blind eye to the protocols and understandings that have already been reached. UNITA wants three of the government's six key ministries; it wants provincial governments to have autonomous powers and their own police forces; it wants participation in all strategic companies, including the National Angolan Fuel Company, Sonangol, and the Angola National Diamond Enterprise, Endiama, which are viewed as preferred targets. It wants public competition for a new symbol of the Republic and a new national anthem. It wants immunity for its men and diplomatic passports, and it wants its property returned. The government team to the talks was called this afternoon to respond to UNITA's position. It admitted that it might make some concessions, but it described the document as contradicting the principles that have already been signed.
