"On the morning of January 10, 1994 armed groups of Zemessargs (Latvian paramilitary units) seized several facilities on the outskirts of Riga. Major-General Nikolay Taylakov, deputy commander of the Northwestern Group of Troops, and Major-General Anatoliy Vodopyanov, assistant to the commander of the Northwestern Group of Troops for work with personnel, arrived at the scene of the incident. In return to their demand to leave the seized facilities, the chairman of the Vidzeme district gave on order to arrest the generals. The Russian generals were handcuffed and put into a car which drove towards the Russian border. Commander of the Northwestern Group of Troops Colonel-General Leonid Mayorov informed the Russian defence minister about the incident. Defence Minister Army General Pavel Grachev issued an order to put Russian troops stationed in Latvia on alert and tighten security at the facilities and premises belonging to the Northwestern Group of Troops. On alert were also placed air-borne troops and military cargo aviation. The commander of the Northwestern Group of Troops informed Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis about the incident. The president expressed bewilderment over the incident, gave orders to free the detained generals and offered his apologies. By 17:00 the Russian generals and all seized facilities were freed. The Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation demands an immediate investigation and punishment of those guilty. Any violent or unlawful acts against the Russian servicemen, military units and facilities of the Russian Army will be checked in the most decisive manner. Responsibility for all possible consequences in this case will rest with the local authorities who must ensure a normal situation around the Russian military units," the statement said. The generals were freed only after the intervention of the Russian Embassy. The Latvian authorities sent their apologies for the incident and assured the Russian Embassy that the facilities were being unlocked. Early on Monday a group of Latvian militants stopped a car of the Russian ambassador and refused to let it pass despite the ambassador's protests. After long deliberations they allowed the car to pass but waived their guns at it. The Russian Embassy issued a protest to the Latvian Foreign Ministry, describing the incident as a potentially dangerous provocation. The embassy expressed the hope that the Latvian authorities will take the necessary measures to prevent such incidents in the future. The note considered the incident as an attempt to thwart the talks on the troop withdrawal.
