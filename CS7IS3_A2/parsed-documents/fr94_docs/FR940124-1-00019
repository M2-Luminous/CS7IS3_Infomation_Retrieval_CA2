FR940124-1-00019 FR940124-1-00005 Since no political subdivision within the state has met the first criterion, EPA believes that no political subdivision is principally responsible for the failure to have an enhanced I/M program. Therefore, EPA is not prohibited from imposing highway sanctions statewide. As noted above, the state legislature bears the ultimate responsibility to adopt the requisite legislative authority and CARB, not the individual air quality districts, must subsequently adopt adequate regulations. Since the state bears ultimate responsibility, EPA believes that it is reasonable and appropriate to impose sanctions on the entire State. The offset requirements apply only to new or modified major stationary sources located in or to be located in areas that are required to have a permit program pursuant to section 173. Thus, the offset sanctions are limited to those areas which are required to have a permit program, i.e., the ozone and CO nonattainment areas. For ozone, those areas are: Monterey, Santa Barbara, San Diego, San Francisco Bay Area, South Coast, Ventura, Sacramento, San Joaquin Valley, and the South East Desert. The offset sanction would apply to all new or modified major stationary sources for VOCs and NOx that are locating to or located in each of these areas and for such sources of CO that are located in or locating to the following CO nonattainment areas: Chico, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, San Joaquin, and South Coast. EPA proposes to impose the offset sanctions in the manner described in the proposed action on the sequencing of sanctions (58 FR 51270, 51275&hyph;51277 (October 1, 1993)). C. Removal of Discretionary Sanctions EPA is proposing to temporarily lift (i.e., toll) 4 the highway and offset sanctions imposed under section 110(m) upon passage by the California legislature and signature by the Governor of legislation which EPA preliminarily determines provides legal authority for an enhanced I/M program meeting the requirements of the CAA and the I/M regulation. EPA proposes to notify the state of this tolling by a letter to the Governor and the public by a notice published in the notice section of the Federal Register . The section 110(m) sanctions would not be completely lifted until the State makes a complete submittal of its enhanced I/M program for the State of California. EPA will take action to completely lift section 110(m) sanctions at the time it determines the State's submittal to be complete or it is deemed complete. A complete submittal is one that contains all the critical elements listed in the I/M regulation as determined through the completeness criteria in section 110(k)(1). 4 As a general rule, an Agency must go through rulemaking to remove or alter a requirement imposed through rulemaking. While U.S. EPA intends to issue a notice tolling the 110(m) sanction upon the occurrence of the events described, U.S. EPA will use the good cause exception to the otherwise applicable requirement for proposed rulemaking. EPA believes there is good cause to toll the sanctions once the state takes the action which cures the defficiency that resulted in the imposition of sanctions. See 5 U.S.C.ยง553(b)(B). Therefore, no proposed action for removal will be issued. Consistent with U.S. EPA's intent to impose discretionary sanctions only on those areas that lack legislative authority, EPA believes that it is in the public interest to remove, at least temporarily, these discretionary sanctions as expeditiously as possible once the State of California has enacted legislative authority. As an alternative, if EPA takes final action disapproving California's committal SIP prior to taking final action imposing sanctions, EPA proposes that such disapproval be the basis for imposing the discretionary sanctions. In such case, the sanctions would be tolled in the same manner; however, if the disapproval is the final basis for imposing the sanctions, such sanctions would not be completely lifted until EPA formally approves an enhanced I/M program for the State of California. In such a case, EPA would take action to lift the sanctions at the same time as EPA took final action approving the State's I/M program. EPA's action imposing or tolling the section 110(m) sanctions will in no manner affect EPA's obligation to impose mandatory sanctions under section 179(a) where one mandatory sanction shall apply 18 months after EPA's finding of incompleteness and the second mandatory sanction shall apply 6 months later. Sanctions under section 179(a) apply to the area for which the deficiency exists. If the State does not adopt and submit to EPA a complete submittal providing for an I/M program within the 18-month and additional 6-month periods, the sanctions will automatically apply to those areas of the state that were required to have but do not have such a complete I/M program under the amended Act. See 58 FR 51270 (October 1, 1993). Moreover, if EPA takes final action disapproving California's I/M committal SIP, a second sanctions clock will be triggered and California must not only submit an I/M program, but EPA must also approve that program within the relevant time frames to stop the mandatory sanctions clock and avoid sanctions on the final disapproval. IV. Regulatory Requirements A. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and, therefore, subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;
