They also sent a strong message of warning to the forces of Western arrogance and vanity through the decision taken by the Libyan Arab people for steadfastness, defiance, and readiness for confrontation and defence for the revolutionary orientations of the Jamahiriyah without any abdication of these orientations or compromise as far as the national sovereignty and laws are concerned. O great leader, at a time when the Arab political map is being dominated by the abandonment of the liberation orientated national civilisational project, the following current policies of reversal, the series of concessions and promotion of the defeatist slogan land for peace, but your principled, sincere and firm nationalist stance will remain the hope of all Arab masses throughout the greater Arab homeland, in adherence to the Arab national cause without any abdication. History will record proudly the dignified stand which you took enabling us, we the generation of Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, to stand tall like the palm trees of our country who strength is well entrenched in the soil and the branches freely extending towards the sky. Certainly the Great Jamahiriyah will remain under your leadership, the heaven on earth in which no one who betrays it would live and its people will remain the freest and kindest of all peoples. Allah endowed us with you as a steadfast and sincere leader accustomed to advocating justice, and repulsing falsehood. So let us go forward under your leadership and we are with you on the path of revolution and defiance. Rely on Allah and you will always remain the conscience of the nation and the teacher of generations to come. Allah willing we rely on you and we will be victorious. Forward and [words indistinct] revolutionary the struggle will continue. Signed: the General People's Congress
