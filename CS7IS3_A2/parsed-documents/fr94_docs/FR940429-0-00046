FR940429-0-00046 FR940429-0-00010 2. A new section, ยง602.5_Notice to accrediting agencies of Federal actions, has been added that provides for the Secretary to notify an accrediting agency if the Secretary takes an action against an institution or program accredited by the agency, if the Secretary learns of an action taken by another Federal agency against the institution or program, or if the institution is referred for review under the State Postsecondary Review Program. 3. Time frames have been added for the designated Department official to provide an accrediting agency with the staff analysis of its application for recognition and for the agency to respond to that analysis, if it so desires. 4. The provision that an accrediting agency may request that the Secretary reconsider a decision to deny recognition or to limit, suspend, or terminate the agency's recognition during the recognition period has been deleted. 5. The requirement that institutional accrediting agencies must conduct unannounced site visits to institutions that offer prebaccalaureate vocational education has been replaced with a requirement that those agencies must conduct unannounced inspections at each institution that offers vocational education for the purpose of determining whether, at a minimum, the institution has the personnel, facilities, and resources it claimed to have either during its most recent on-site review by the accrediting agency or in subsequent reports to the agency. Accrediting agencies are free to determine the procedures for conducting the unannounced inspections. An unannounced inspection does not have to be as comprehensive as an agency's full accreditation or preaccreditation review of an institution or program unless the agency wishes it to be. 6. The substantive change requirement has been revised to clarify the types of changes that require prior approval by an accrediting agency before they can be included in the institution's accreditation. The substantive change requirement applies only to institutional accrediting agencies. 7. The specific language included in the NPRM for each of the 12 required accreditation standards has been deleted. The section now simply repeats the statutory language for each required standard. 8. The requirement that accrediting agencies must have a standard that assesses an institution's practice of making refunds to students has been eliminated. 9. The time limit for institutions or programs to come into compliance with agency standards has been changed. For programs of less than one year in length, the time limit is now 12 months. For programs that are at least one year in length but less than two years, the time limit is 18 months. For programs that are at least two years in length, the time limit is 24 months. 10. A requirement has been added that accrediting agencies must notify the Secretary at the same time they notify an institution or program of a final adverse accrediting action. Analysis of Comments and Changes In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, more than 1800 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM is published as an appendix to these final regulations. Included in this analysis are comments received during several public hearings and other meetings held by the Department throughout the United States for purposes of obtaining comment on the proposed regulations. Executive Order 12866 These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order, the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. The potential costs associated with the final regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for effective and efficient administration. In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 Sections 602.4, 602.10, and 602.27 of these regulations contain information collection requirements. In addition, ยง602.21(b)(7) contains specific record retention requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education has submitted a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h))
