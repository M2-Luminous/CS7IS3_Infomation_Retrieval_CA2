Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind joined ministers from the United States, France, Italy and Holland in issuing a statement after meeting at Aviano air base in northeast Italy to assess the situation in Sarajevo. They also heard air strike contigency plans from NATO commanders. The ministers were told that snow would prevent the Bosnian Serbs from meeting the deadline in full. And Mr Rifkind said it would take time to establish whether there had been compliance, probably after the deadline. "It will not be possible to come to the conclusion until after midnight," he said. "It will up to those on the ground to advise as soon after midnight as is physically possible as to whether they are satisfied compliance has occurred or not occurred." Their statement said: "It is the hope of the ministers that the terms set by the NAC (North Atlantic Council) will be met and that no air strikes will be necessary. However, they are determined to support actions to end the slaughter of innocent civilians in Sarajevo and to reinvigorate the peace negotiations." The statement said the ministers were confident that NATO forces were "ready and able to carry out their mission" in coordination with the UN "should that be necessary." In Sarajevo, meanwhile, a senior UN officer said the Serbs had withdrawn their guns to the extent that they could no longer capture the city. And the UN commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, was optimistic that all the artillery would be removed from the exclusion zone or be under UN control by the deadline. Later today, Mr Rifkind was expected to fly on to Gioia del Colle from where British strike aircraft would be deployed if UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali were to give the go-ahead to bomb. Meanwhile, a unit of 60 British soldiers -- men of the 1st and 3rd Royal Horse Artillery -- was today preparing to take up positions in Sarajevo with their five Cymbeline radars, sophisticated equipment which can pinpoint artillery and missile launch sites to within 10 yards. Major Peter Wright, 32, regiment spokesman, said: "They are good troops, well trained. They have really put their backs into getting ready. The spirit is very good and they're all raring to go. They're delighted to be going out. The situation out there is likely to be quite confused, judging by news leaking back."
