Negotiations with Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria are ending. But negotiations with Malta, which is also a candidate, are a long way from starting. Are you satisfied with the way in which the EU is treating your candidacy? [Adami] We are satisfied with the opinion that the European Commission has given on our candidacy. It stresses Malta's European vocation and indicates in what sphere the Maltese economy will have to be restructured with a view to joining the Union. Since then, we have had technical discussions with the European Commission's offices. The result is very satisfactory. [Riche] In what spheres are there problems? [Adami] There are some overprotected economic spheres which we will have to open and tariff barriers which we are dismantling. We will have to continue the program to liberalize our economy, particularly in the financial sector. In the fiscal sphere, we will have to come into line with the European directives, but I think that Malta will always play a special role as a financial market place in the Mediterranean without being a tax haven. In general, all the provisions which the Commission recommended to us are already planned in my government's program. [Riche] Your country's small size has often been cited as a possible obstacle to membership and to the normal functioning of the institutions. [Adami] I am aware that there is an institutional problem brewing in the Union which relates to small countries. But there is no reason for delaying the membership negotiations if Malta fulfills the necessary conditions. [Riche] Would you agree, for instance, that because of its small size, your country should not be taken into consideration in the Union's rotating presidency? [Adami] I could not accept such discriminatory treatment. [Riche] What benefit could your membership bring to the EU? [Adami] If Malta was a member of the Union, it would bring a new political dimension, as a country occupying a central position in the Mediterranean, on the Union's southern flank. Malta could play an important role as a link between the Union and its southern neighbors. [Riche] At present, the Union is negotiating expansion to four countries which are much richer than the Community average and which will contribute to the budget. Do you think that it will quickly negotiate with poorer countries, like Malta, and all the other declared candidates? [Adami] Malta is such a small country -- 350,000 inhabitants -- that notions of net contributor or net beneficiary from the Community budget lose all relevance. Our economic wealth is comparable to the levels of Greece or Portugal. Our current growth rate is around 4.5 percent. Our inflation is low: Less than 4 percent, as is our foreign debt. And unemployment is 4 percent. Our public deficit is within the Maastricht convergence standards. Indeed, we could be members of the Monetary Union. [Riche] What benefit will Malta derive from accession to the Union? [Adami] Better opportunities for economic expansion. In a way, our economy is already integrated into that of the Union because almost 80 percent of our exports go there. In the political sphere, membership will bring greater stability to Malta and the Mediterranean region. And this stability is bound to benefit everybody. [Riche] Are you not afraid that your case will be paired with that of Cyprus which is also a candidate but which will probably have to await a settlement between Greece and Turkey? [Adami] It emerges from all the recent European summits, that the membership applications of Malta and Cyprus will be taken into consideration on their own merits. It is true that the two questions have been linked in speaking of "Mediterranean candidacies" but since then it has been clearly admitted that they are different. [Riche] What is the Maltese public's feeling with regard to membership? [Adami] Very largely positive. There is not one organized group -- party, trade union, and so forth -- which is opposed to it.
