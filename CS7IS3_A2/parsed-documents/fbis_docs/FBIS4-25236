It is not only a task of the 1990's, but also a transcentury project. 1. Developing high and new technologies, using high and new technologies to transform traditional industries, and carrying out raw materials intensive processing industry is a very essential and urgent task. Liaoning has chiefly developed basic and raw materials industries and its traditional industries have accounted for more than 90 percent of the GNP. This industrial structure has advantages under the planned economic system and contributed greatly to the state. However, after the unfoldment of reform and opening up, all localities across the country have competed with one another to readjust their industrial structure. In order to make up for the shortage of raw materials, some provinces in south China have developed a number of basic industries. During the late 1980's, the situation that south China had to rely on north China in basic industries began to change and Liaoning's raw materials industry has new competitors. On the other hand, south China has also developed a number of high and new technology industries. Some high and new technology industries in Shanghai and Guangdong have reached a fair scale. However, Liaoning's high and new technology industries are still in an initiative stage. This has made our province suffered attacks front and rear during competitions in the domestic markets. Judging from the foreign situation, since the 1980's, some developed countries, while developing high and new technology industries, have also competed with one another to use high and new technologies to transform traditional industries and enhanced the competitive ability on the international markets, thus imposing a severe challenge on some developing countries and regions. They have also exerted their utmost to develop high and new technology industries of their own and used high and new technologies to transform traditional industries. I have conducted inspection tours to the ROK twice and found that it has no natural resources. Before the mid 1960's, nearly all the industries of Liaoning were better than those of the ROK. However, through development, the value of imports and exports of the ROK is now commensurate with our country. The technological levels of some industries, such as ship building, machinery, petrochemical, electronics, textile, iron and steel industries, are far in advance of our country by 10 to 15 years. The key experience of the ROK is that it has paid attention to science and technology, developed industries with a high starting point and high level, followed the path of extensively pooling the strong points of all, and absorbed the advanced science and technology of all countries. In face of the acute competitions on the domestic and foreign markets, if we fail to accelerate the pace of using high and new technologies to transform traditional industries, we will lag far behind at home and abroad. A strong sense of crisis and responsibility has urged us to race against time to grasp this issue. Only by using domestic and foreign advanced high and new technologies to transform the traditional industries can we make the level of our technologies and equipments leap over some development stages and reach the international or domestic advanced level, upgrade and update the product quality, variety, and grades by leaps and bounds, and enhance their competitiveness in the domestic and foreign markets. Only thus, can we leap over backwardness caused by our lagging behind the time, catch up with the developing trends at home and abroad, and rejuvenate the old base. 2. Developing high-and-new tech industries, using high and new technologies to transform traditional industries, and conducting the intensive processing of natural resources and raw materials, represent a fundamental task for making the old industrial base prosperous. It is very important for us to straighten out our thinking in the issue of how to change the old outlook of the old base into a new one. The thinking defined for readjusting the industrial structure of the old base in Liaoning by persistently regarding markets as a guiding orientation and on the basis of summarizing the practice, experience, and lesson; analyzing the development trend of markets at home and abroad; and of studying or understanding again the province's situation; is to develop high-and-new tech industries, to use high and new technologies to transform traditional industries, and to conduct the intensive processing of natural resources and raw materials. Developing high-and-new tech industries should be accurately aimed at markets at home and abroad. Efforts should be made to develop a large number of high-and-new tech industries that have large strength in bringing along the national economy, can exert strong influence, and possess the characteristics of Liaoning. These high-and-new technologies include robots, computers, bar codes, thin coating and coating products, super fine fiber and fabrics, super fine phenolic material, electric and electronic technologies and products, active talcum powder and by-products, neodyimium-iron-boron permanent-magnet material, radiation engineering, biological engineering, and astronautics. In transforming the traditional industries, we should closely follow the principles of developing natural resources and conducting the intensive processing of raw materials and accelerate the technical renovations. Major efforts should be made to successfully encourage the industries of raw materials to conduct intensive processing; to upgrade the rate of final products; and to extend the technical linking among the industries of metallurgy, petroleum, chemicals, and building materials. It is necessary to conduct the second and third processing in the raw material production. At the same time, we should renovate the technologies and equipment to upgrade the quality of products, to lower the cost, to upgrade the labor productivity, and to score best economic results. Equipment industries should enforce the unified project between machinery and electronic production and apply the micro electronic technologies to transforming the machinery industry. Meanwhile, efforts should be made to upgrade the coordinated service between machinery and electronic industries and to develop an integrated project system between them in the fields of research, design, manufacture, installation, readjustment, and experiment. As being the equipment sector in the national economy, the machinery and electronic industries should successfully render a unified service. Industries in charge of general processing should chiefly increase the variety of new products suitable to the demands of markets at home and abroad and uphold high starting point, high level, large scale, and high effect in the development of new products. It is also necessary to conduct the intensive processing of agricultural resources. We should also develop the resources of planting, raising, and maritime undertakings to the operation of intensive processing and bring about a change to the situation in which a truck of potable water (mineral water in the south) has been exchanged with seven trucks of grains. Developing high-and-new tech industries, using high and new technologies to transform traditional industries, and conducting the intensive processing of natural resources and raw materials actually represent the endeavor to bring the strong points into play and to exploit these strong points to avoid shortcomings under the conditions of socialist market economy. Exploiting the strong points means to bring into play the superiority possessed by the basic industries. In the view of far-reaching development, these strong points may be eliminated. However, they are still the superiority of the province in the near future, therefore, we should bring the superiority into play and use the high and new technologies to reform it. For example, the iron and steel industry is still the basic industry of Liaoning and we should still bring it into play. The province's shortcomings include electronic industry and biological engineering as well as the technologies of distribution and automation. We should no longer avoid these shortcomings, but try to make them up. Only by making up these shortcomings in the coming few years can we achieve a better products' mix and economic results. 3. Countermeasures and Measures We should combine long-term and short-term countermeasures and measures, make them realistic and feasible, work out overall plans for them, and carry them out step by step. A. The issue on sources of technology. We should persist in learning from others' strong points extensively, both at home and abroad. We should take advantage of the conditions provided by opening to the outside world and adopt various measures to bring in advanced technology from abroad through various channels, such as direct foreign investment, licensed trade, compensation trade, cooperation in designing and development, establishment of scientific research institutes abroad, and purchases of foreign scientific research institutes. Meanwhile, Liaoning should fully develop its scientific and technological advantages to establish its own scientific research network consisting of scientific research, technological development, and intermediate experiment engineering centers. It should accelerate the transformation of the achievements of scientific research institutes into productive forces. In developing high and new technology, Liaoning should develop the main body and the two wings. Enterprises constitute the main body in the endeavor of high- and new-tech industry development, transformation of traditional industries with high and new technology, and intensive processing of resources and raw materials. This is because enterprises, especially large and medium-sized ones, have fairly complete development, research, and designing systems. Enterprises are also the main body to use productive forces and ultimately to produce new ones. We should also develop the role of the "two wings," one being scientific research institutes and colleges and universities and the other being foreign advanced technology. The main body is the foundation, and the two wings are the important sources providing high and new technology to the main body. Integrating these three parts together, Liaoning will be like a tiger that has grown wings. B. The issue on mechanisms. We should apply the market mechanism to cultivating new growing points of the economy and never return to the old systems. In developing high- and new-tech industries, transforming traditional industries with high and new technology, and expanding intensive processing of resources and raw materials, the system whereby major investors hold the responsibility for risks should be applied to the adjustment of the industrial structure, and a mechanism of competition should take shape. This should be combined with the efforts to deepen reform and establish a modern enterprise system. We should establish a modern enterprise system, transform enterprises into companies, implement the shareholding system, transplant enterprises with foreign capital, develop contracts for scientific and technological tasks, and commercialize technological achievements so that enterprises will become a genuine main body of interests, investment, and market. C. Open up wide sources of funds. As great amounts of funds are needed in transforming the old base, it is impossible to rely entirely on the state. We should pool the idle funds in society through reform, opening up, and the reform of the banking system. We should borrow funds from both the domestic and the world markets, carry out the shareholding system, allow scientific research units to buy shares with their technology, allow enterprise legal persons to invest, and list enterprises on the market. When raising funds from abroad, we may transplant enterprises with foreign capital; sell property right to foreign countries in exchange for ownership of some stocks and sell the stock ownership to raise funds for investment; or use commercial loans. In short, we should broaden our fields of thinking and the sources of funds through reform and opening up. Adopting new ideas, new concepts, and new methods to address problems, we will find our road becoming broader and broader. D. The issue on professionals. In developing high-and-new tech industries, using high and new technologies to transform traditional industries, and conducting the intensive processing of natural resources and raw materials, we must first of all train and bring up scientific and technological professionals, who should be regarded as the foundation. A fine environment and good conditions should be created to train outstanding professionals for Liaoning. This is a major matter that must be solved by the provincial government. Therefore, we should truly distribute income for professionals according to their work in order to manifest the value of science and technology. Wages of scientists and technicians should be linked with their performances. We should let scientists and technicians, high-tech professionals in particular, become rich first. Second, we should relax restrictions imposed on professionals and allow scientists and technicians to flow from one place to another. Third, we should not determine the positions and social status of scientists and technicians according to their seniority. A good condition should be created for young scientists and technicians. Only with the rapid growth of young scientists and technicians, can Liaoning invigorate its scientific, technological, and economic development. Fourth, we should draw professionals from abroad and make foreign professionals serve China. E. We should do a solid job and pay attention to implementation. Developing high-and-new tech industries, using high and new technologies to transform traditional industries, and conducting the intensive processing of natural resources and raw materials represent a huge systems engineering as well as the key content of the "second pioneering program." Therefore, they must be incorporated to the development strategy of the province and various cities. This project should be considered the key point of Liaoning's plan for 2010. The items without using high and new technologies and the items that do not conduct intensive processing should never be initiated. At present, our problem lies in the failure in offering even more and better high-and-new tech items for the reason of lacking a wide field of vision on science and technology. Without the mastery of current economic and technological information and development trends by economic policymakers and senior managers, we cannot define the orientation of scientific and technological development. Only when scientists and technicians master high and new technologies, can we use high and new scientific and technological achievements to transform old technologies, old equipment, and old products. The problems in this aspect must be resolved. The policy of reducing the staff of the organs directly under the provincial authorities by 300 persons should be remained unchanged for the time being. After the transfer of the personnel eliminated by the organizational reform, we should employ a number of young and middle-aged senior scientists and technicians and managers from society to intensify the strength of some important departments. In developing high-and-new tech industries and using new and high technologies to transform traditional industries, we must conscientiously organize implementation, and specific arrangements should be made for each trade and each year. In developing high-and-new tech industries, using high and new technologies to transform traditional industries, conducting the intensive processing of natural resources and raw materials, and conducting structural readjustment, it is hard for Liaoning to achieve remarkable results within 10 years. We should have our eyes on the present, have our feet firmly planted at the next century, do a solid job step by step from now on, and work hard for 10 years. If we do so, it is completely possible for us to replace the old outlook of Liaoning with a new outlook and to fulfill the magnificent goal of the "second pioneering program."
