The first was on Russian-Lithuanian relations. Guoda Salciute reports. [Salciute] Vytautas Landsbergis, Seimas opposition leader, presented a statement to journalists at a news conference today, concerning Russia's responsibility to Lithuania. Vytautas Landsbergis also gave a review of trends in Russian policy toward the Baltic states. According to Professor Landsbergis the case of the independence of the Baltic states is now nearing a critical point. We see the latest statements issued by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in which, under the guise of the Russian issue [of the Russian-speaking population], all the attention is concentrated on the justification of an expansion toward the West, Landsbergis said. Latvia has already been broken down after the big states abandoned the principle, which they themselves formulated, of the unconditional withdrawal of the armed forces; meanwhile Estonia, while coming closer to the zero option -- i.e. giving up the demand for compensation in the negotiations with Russia -- will become the test case, the leader of the opposition maintained. Vytautas Landsbergis stressed that there is no need to appeal once again to the United Nations concerning the recognition of the Russian occupation. This is the main issue in the statement. I quote: Russia has declared itself the successor of the USSR and in some important cases the international community agreed with this, the statement reads. In the treaty of 29 July 1991, Russia recognized the acts of restoration of Lithuania's independence and renounced the annexation carried out by the USSR. The referendum of Lithuanian citizens of 14 June 1992 firmly declared a sovereign conviction that Russia, having declared itself heir to the USSR, has also taken over the responsibility for the damage to Lithuania inflicted by the occupation, the damage which should be compensated for. Therefore, bearing in mind all these circumstances, the reports that the president of Lithuania intends to discuss whether Lithuania and other Baltic states were occupied by the USSR or not at the oncoming summit of the Baltic states look rather surprising -- as does an appeal to the world requesting a reiteration of the recognition of the occupation. Whatever the diplomats of the Baltic states or the Russian lobbyists in Vilnius might propose, the very fact that the existence of the occupation is doubted would mean great harm to the interests of our state and a violation of the main documents of our independence. The Lithuanian president should not be drawn into such dangerous maneuvers, Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the parliamentary opposition, says in his statement on Russia's responsibility to Lithuania.
