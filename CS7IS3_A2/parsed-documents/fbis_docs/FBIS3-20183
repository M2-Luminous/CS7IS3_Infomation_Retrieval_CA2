Those who still hope that one can soon offer a firm construct again, feeling a certain longing for the solid even though hostile world of the past, begin to understand more and more that this will not be the case. The topic of this forum is not only a central one for the armed forces, but for all of German politics. The Federal Government and parliament now have to make difficult basic decisions in order to define the kind and size of the armed forces that Germany wants to have and keep. Basically, it is not so much a quantitative than a far more important qualitative debate about the future of the Bundeswehr. So far, we have largely taken quantitative steps because of the changed international situation -- the Bundeswehr will be reduced to 370,000 men. Now the qualitative changes must be put into the foreground more strongly. With the 1994 white book, the Federal Government has set the necessary conceptional framework for that. When I spoke at this forum last May, the opening of the alliance toward the east was the most important message, and at that time there was no discussion at all in NATO about this issue. Today, the opening up to new members is the declared political strategy of the North Atlantic alliance. For the European Union [EU] this opening up is already a reality. It is deepening and expanding. Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway will become new members -- several East European states have quite definite prospects for membership. This process is a desired one and must not be blocked by egotistical individual interests. The development of the EU is not just an economic event. The issue is a comprehensive political process, during which the things that belong together grow together in Europe. It is not a provocation if one advocates that Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, and Poland, grow together with Europe also in terms of security policy. I gave a speech at Charles University in Prague. There I was welcomed in Latin. Now tell me one German university where I would be welcomed in this way. For me, Prague is just as European as Berlin and Hamburg and Munich and Rome and Paris. Our northern neighbors accept their share of responsibility for the stability of our continent. Opportunities for intensive security policy and defense policy cooperation are opening up, which were not possible during the times of the East-West conflict and the division of Europe. This becomes particularly obvious by the example of Sweden. For more than 90 years, Germany has not held any general staff meetings with Sweden. In the future, this will not only be a regular exercise, but there will also be intensive coordination regarding important questions of the development of our Armed Forces. The decision of the Swedish Government to equip its Armed Forces with German Leopard tanks is or strategic quality and means a new opportunity for cooperation, which would have been completely inconceivable only a short time ago. However, the EU is not just expanding toward the north, but also toward the east. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and the Slovak Republic are making clear political and economic progress. They have meanwhile concluded European agreements and are thus actively participating in European integration. We want to help them with consolidating democratic structures, in implementing a functioning social market economy, and in reorienting their security and defense policy. Therefore, we are willing to accept them as members in to the EU and to bring them close to the European security structures already now. The complicated process of deepening and expanding the EU cannot be separated from the reform of the Atlantic alliance. European and transatlantic developments must not diverge. This was a central message of the NATO summit in Brussels in January 1994. Europe, which is growing together, has been recognized as an equal partner of the United States. The West European Union is strengthened as the European pillar of the alliance. In the future, it can rely on NATO structures and forces so that Europe becomes capable of strategic action and can take over more responsibility for the common tasks. This reduction of the burden on North America at the same time creates the preconditions for lasting involvement in and for Europe. The alliance has accepted the stabilization of Central and East Europe as the main strategic task. As a result, it can fulfill two decisive political and strategic functions today and in the future: -- First, it is the only functioning mechanism that links North America and Europe. -- Second, it is the only institution that can create effective partnership between the Euro-Atlantic community on the one hand and Russia and the other East European states on the other. The instrument for that is a balanced approach of integration and cooperation. NATO's "Partnership for Peace" initiative is a flexible mechanism with which this approach can be made more concrete. We can differentiate without discrimination. Twelve states have already joined the "Partnership for Peace" initiative, others are on the point of doing so, including Russia -- which is a step of strategic importance for Europe's security policy. Over the past 18 months I have held intensive talks with most Central and East European states. One important goal was to create a network of intensive relations of cooperation and to practically implement Europe's opening up toward the East. Another concern was not to fix our neighbors in the East to an exclusive orientation toward the West, but to encourage them to improve their relations with each other. Of particular importance for the regional balance in East Europe and thus for Europe's stability as a whole is an independent, democratic, and economically viable Ukraine. However, Ukraine is in a profound crisis at the moment. We need an internationally coordinated approach so that critical developments do not endanger European stability. This is the task not only of Russia and the United States regarding the issue of nuclear disarmament, but also of neighbor Russia in relations with neighbor Ukraine, of the EU in its relations with East Europe, and of the United States in a differentiated policy toward East Europe, which now sets the correct priorities. The reform process in Russia is and remains the key for a peaceful development in East Europe. It must be successful. Therefore, Germany supports this process with everything it can provide. Just because of its enormous size, Russia will always have a special position. However, no one can and wants to isolate the big power Russia. Stability in Europe can come about only with Russia and not against it. We need and want togetherness and cooperation also on military issues for safeguarding peace. This is the opposite of isolation and marginalization. However, Russia must obtain the trust of its neighbors and partners primarily through its own actions. This includes respecting the neighbors' sovereignty and the inviolability of the orders. We must do everything so that Russia takes the right path in a difficult situation and that the wrong decisions are not made by the wrong forces. Russia links the participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program with the expectation that NATO develops cooperation relations of a special quality with Russia. Russia does not want to be a guest in Europe, as President Yeltsin said. It wants to participate in solving security problems in Europe and wants to be occasionally included in NATO projects for exercises, to which I do not object. In this connection, Defense Minister Grachev suggested explaining the new Russian military doctrine to the Nato defense ministers. I do not see any reason why we should not support this. It is now important to preserve the momentum of cooperation and to implement it in practical steps in such a way that Russia is recognized as a strategic partner of NATO and can also feel like a partner. We must take care that the special quality of partnership between NATO and Russia does not strangle the process of integration of others in the Western institutions. After the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Germany, further development of our defense-policy relations is of special importance. Therefore, together with my Russian colleague, I have decided to hold a joint navy exercise in the Baltic Sea this year, which will be followed in 1995 by a German-Russian command post exercise in Russia and in 1996 by a German-Russian maneuver in western Germany. Our contribution to stability and peace demonstrates that Germany can be relied on as a member of the alliance and that we take over all necessary duties as an equal member in the international community. However, this must also have an effect when it is necessary. We will never agree to opting out of military integration. The Federal Constitutional Court has approved this attitude twice. I am sure that our policy will be definitely confirmed in summer. Apart from that, one just has to imagine what would have happened internationally if we had left the AWACS planes. This is true historic progress that here nations have irrevocably linked their fates with each other, that they have entered a voluntary dependence, that it is not each individual nation that operates its own plane but that one plane is operated by 12 nations. There you have one system that shows the core of political progress, of confidence-building after World War II. However, this plane must then also be flown together when it is necessary. In order to save resources, it will be necessary that not everyone has his universal army, but that one either operates joint systems or puts them together as modules. We are holding talks with the Dutch to put together German and Dutch submarines -- a fascinating idea. However, if my Dutch colleague asks me whether they will also leave port together and I tell him, on principle yes but it may be that I have to go to Karlsruhe first, this shows how untenable German positions are. The international missions of the Bundeswehr are a most profoundly central political issue, which decides on our ability to join Europe and our credibility as an alliance partner. German-French brigade, Eurocorps, German-U.S. corps, German-Dutch corps -- how are all these things going to work if Germany follows a special path all the time? By the way, we have a German commanding general in Strasbourg -- the first commanding general, who leads the Eurocorps, who commands German, French, and Belgian soldiers on French territory. This is one example of progress. And if one talks to the German soldiers in Strasboug, they say: We like walking around in German uniforms here much better than in some large western German cities. Germany needs armed forces for national defense, which can be reduced in their presence and readiness for action because of the improved situation and can become more dependent on mobilization. The structures for collective defense need not be fully fleshed out anymore in Central Europe. The preparation period of several weeks, which can be used militarily in the unlikely case of a major aggression suggests to shift operational training for individual units of the main defense forces to the period of a crisis. At the same time a minimum contingent of present, quickly replaceable, and flexible crisis reaction forces with high professionality is needed, which is capable of multinational cooperation. The requirements of national defense and the ability to react in a crisis under completely different strategic conditions primarily determine the presence and structure of our future armed forces. From that we are now drawing conclusions for the reform of the Bundeswehr. The Bundeswehr's need for adjustment is great and requires mobility. When I see how much trouble the 7,000 Bonn civil servants are making, who are supposed to come to Berlin in the course of 10 years, and I know that in the Bundeswehr 20,000 people must move every year, this shows where the mobile parts of our society are. The Bundeswehr is underfinanced today. This is a sentence that sounds very harmless but that has effects: There is a gap between structure and assignment on the one hand and the finances that are available on the other. This gap must be closed. We have to continue consistently with rationalization. It is necessary to gain financial leeway for the urgently needed investments, which the Bundeswehr needs for new construction. I have ordered corresponding studies and measures. The results are summarized in a conceptional guideline for the development of the Bundeswehr, which I want to present to the Parliament and to the Defense Committee in April and to have it discussed on a broad basis. Only at the end of this process will the overall picture of the future Bundeswehr become visible. Only then will it also be possible to make a final decision on the future size. Usually, something like that is not done during an election year, but I believe that we owe it to the Bundeswehr to look beyond the election date into the future and to come to as much consensus as possible. The Bundeswehr is proving its worth in a difficult time, it is mastering the challenges of the upheavals excellently. The criticism that is voiced occasionally is inappropriate. The report by the defense commissioner, which is justified in showing specific deficiencies, must, however, not be confused with a report on the general condition of the armed forces. I believe that over the past years the Bundeswehr has adjusted to new tasks more quickly than many people expected. I still remember how anxiously some soldiers went on their way to Cambodia. And I am very proud of the achievements that our soldiers complied in Beledweynne in Somalia. I believe that in the future, too, the Bundeswehr will decisively contribute to preserving Germany's ability to act and to function in the alliance. It is not only in Germany's interest that we have efficient armed forces. There is no European defense without appropriate German armed forces. Nor is there a European defense without German armed forces that are basically wiling to do the same as the French, Danish, British, and Polish armed forces. I think that we will be able to close this one open flank, which still exists, in a reasonable way.
