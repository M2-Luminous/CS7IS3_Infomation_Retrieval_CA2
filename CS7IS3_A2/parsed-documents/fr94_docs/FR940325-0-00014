FR940325-0-00014 FR940325-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Secretary 24 CFR Parts 8, 12, 28, 86, 92, 200, 207, 213, 215, 219, 220, 221, 241, 243, 248, 250, 260, 510, 511, 570, 590, 750, 760, 791, 811, 812, 813, 850, 880, 881, 882, 883, 884, 885, 886, 887, 905, 912, 913, 941, 942, 960, 961, 964, 965, 968, 969, 970, and 1800 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1712; FR&hyph;3046&hyph;F&hyph;01] RIN 2502&hyph;AF50 Section 572, Low-Income Term; Miscellaneous Nomenclature Changes AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, HUD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The purpose of this final rule is to make nomenclature changes throughout title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations to remove the term ``lower income'' and insert in its place ``low-income''. These changes will conform HUD terminology to current practice required by recent legislation. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Myra L. Ransick, Assistant General Counsel for Regulations, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410, telephone (202) 708&hyph;3055. A telecommunications device for hearing- or speech-impaired persons (TDD) is available at (202) 708&hyph;3259. (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule will implement section 572 of the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA), Public Law 101&hyph;625 (November 28, 1990), by making nomenclature changes throughout title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations to reflect the new use of the term ``low-income'' instead of the term ``lower income.'' The amendments in section 572 of NAHA changed references in the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq. ) (the 1937 Act) by striking ``lower income families'' and inserting in its place ``low-income families'', and by striking ``lower income housing'' and inserting in its place ``low-income housing.'' This rule will conform the Department of Housing and Urban Development's regulations by removing the term ``lower income'' wherever it appears in a context associated with the 1937 Act, and by inserting in its place the term ``low-income.'' Tables following the Preamble to this rule show in list format the nomenclature changes being made by this rule to the various sections of title 24 of the Department's regulations. The Department has determined that this document need not be published as a proposed rule, as generally required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), since this final rule merely conforms HUD regulations to reflect legislative changes in terminology. As a rule relating to agency practice, it is exempt from the proposed rulemaking requirements of the APA (see section 553(b)(A)). A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment required by the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4347) is unnecessary, since this nomenclature change is categorically excluded under HUD regulations at 24 CFR 50.20(k). As required by section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601), the Undersigned hereby certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it merely makes nomenclature changes to the Department's regulations. This final rule was listed as item 1542 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 56402, 56431) pursuant to Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
