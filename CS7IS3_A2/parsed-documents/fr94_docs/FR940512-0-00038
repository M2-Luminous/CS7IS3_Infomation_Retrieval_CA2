FR940512-0-00038 FR940512-0-00017 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 658 [I.D. 050594A] Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Adjustment of the beginning date of the Texas closure. SUMMARY: NMFS announces an adjustment of the beginning date of the annual closure of the shrimp fishery in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off Texas. The closure is normally from May 15 to July 15 each year. This year the closure will begin on May 13, 1994, because biological data indicate that brown shrimp will be leaving the Texas estuaries earlier than normal. The Texas closure is intended to prohibit the harvest of brown shrimp during their major period of emigration from Texas estuaries to the Gulf of Mexico so the shrimp may reach a larger, more valuable size and to prevent the waste of brown shrimp that would be discarded in fishing operations because of their small size. EFFECTIVE DATES: The EEZ off Texas is closed to trawl fishing from 30 minutes after sunset, May 13, 1994, until 30 minutes after sunset, July 15, 1994, unless otherwise announced through notification in the Federal Register. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael E. Justen, 813&hyph;893&hyph;3161. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 658 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ). The FMP implementing regulations at 50 CFR 658.25 describe the Texas closure and provide for adjustments to the beginning and ending dates by the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, under specified criteria. Available information meeting the criteria specified at 50 CFR 658.25(b)(1) indicates that a closure date earlier than May 15 is warranted and desirable. Biological data collected by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department indicate that beginning the closure on May 13, 1994, is necessary to provide adequate protection of small brown shrimp emigrating from the Texas estuaries. Accordingly, the time and date at 50 CFR 658.25(a) for beginning the Texas closure is changed from 30 minutes after sunset, May 15, 1994, to 30 minutes after sunset on May 13, 1994. During the closure, the area described at 50 CFR 658.25(a) is closed to all trawl fishing, except that a vessel may fish for royal red shrimp beyond the 100-fathom (183-m) depth contour. The waters of Texas are also closed commencing 30 minutes after sunset on May 13, 1994. The termination date of the Texas closure will be adjusted in accordance with the criteria specified at 50 CFR 658.25(b) and to conform to the termination date of the closure in the waters of Texas. The adjusted termination date will be published in the Federal Register . Classification This action is authorized by 50 CFR 658.25 and has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.
