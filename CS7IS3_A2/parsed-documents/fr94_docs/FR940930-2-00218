FR940930-2-00218 FR940930-2-00073 7. Any conversion of shares of one class to shares of another class is subject to the continuing availability of a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of counsel to the effect that the conversion of shares does into constitute a taxable event under federal income tax law. Any such conversion may be suspended if such a ruling or opinion is no longer available. 8. Under the Multiple Distribution System, all expenses incurred by a Fund will be borne proportionately by each class based on the relative net assets attributable to each such class, except for the different: (a) Distribution, service, and shareholder servicing fees, and any other costs relating to implementing the Plans or an amendment to such Plans (including obtaining shareholder approval of a Plan or an amendment to such Plan); (b) Class Expenses; and (c) possibly transfer agency fees (and any other incremental expense properly attributable to a class which the Commission shall approve by amended order) attributable to a class, which will be borne directly by each respective class. 9. LFBDS or shareholder servicing agents may choose to reimburse or waive distribution, service, or shareholder servicing fees on certain classes of a Fund on a voluntary, temporary basis. The amount on such fees waived or reimbursed by LFBDS or shareholder servicing agents may vary from class to class. Such fees are by their nature specific to a given class and may vary from one class to another. Applicants believe that it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder expectations to reimburse or waive such fees at different levels for different classes of the same Fund. 10. In addition, LFBDS, Citibank, or other service contractors may waive or reimburse certain fees or expenses which do not vary from class to class but apply equally to all classes of a given Fund (``Fund expenses'') provided that the same proportionate amount of Fund expenses are waived or reimbursed for each class of a Fund. Any Fund expenses that are waived or reimbursed would be credited to each class of a Fund based on the relative net assets of the classes. 11. To the extent exchanges are permitted, such exchanges will comply with all applicable provisions of rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. 12. Applicants also request relief to permit each of the Funds to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions of certain classes of shares of such Fund, and, from time to time, as described below, to permit such Fund to waive, reduce, or defer the CDSC with respect to certain types of redemptions of such shares. The amount of the CDSC to be imposed will depend on the amount of time since the investor purchased the shares being redeemed, as set forth in each Fund's prospectus. The amount of any applicable CDSC will be based upon the lower of the net asset value at the time of purchase or at the time of redemption as required by proposed rule 6c&hyph;10(a)(1)(i) under the Act. If a shareholder holding shares of more than one class does not specify which class of shares of a Fund are to be redeemed, the following order of redemption will apply: (a) Shares of a Fund not subject to a CDSC and subject to the highest distribution and/or service and/or shareholder servicing fees in effect on the date of redemption will be redeemed first (provided, however, that if such shares of the Fund are subject to the same distribution and/or service and/or shareholder servicing fees then shares of the Fund without a conversion feature will be redeemed before shares of the Fund with a conversion feature), then (b) shares of the Fund subject to the lowest CDSC will be redeemed, provided that if such shares of the Fund are subject to the same CDSC, shares of the Fund with the highest distribution and/or service and/or shareholder servicing fees in effect on the date of redemption will be redeemed first. If such shares of the Fund are subject to the same distribution and/or service and/or shareholder servicing fees, then shares of the Fund without a conversion feature will be redeemed before shares of the Fund with a conversion feature. 13. Applicants also propose to permit LFBDS from time to time to provide a credit (i.e., a reimbursement) for any CDSC paid by a redeeming shareholder in connection with a redemption of shares of a class followed by a reinvestment in any shares of the same class of the same Fund or, as permitted by LFBDS from time to time, the same class of another Fund, effected within such number of days of the redemption as may be specified, from time to time, in a Fund's prospectus (the ``Reinstatement Privilege''). The CDSC credit will be paid by LFBDS. Upon redemption thereafter, when calculating the amount of the CDSC (if any), the shares will be deemed to have been held for one continuous period from purchase through redemption and reinvestment until such shares are finally redeemed. 14. If the Funds waive, defer, or reduce the CDSC for a particular class, such waiver, deferment, or reduction will be uniformly applied to all offerees in a class with similar qualifications. In waiving, deferring, or reducing a CDSC, the Funds will comply with the requirements of rule 22d&hyph;1. If a Fund that has been waiving, deferring, or reducing its CDSC for a particular class discontinues such waiver, deferment, or reduction, (a) such waiver, deferment, or reduction will continue to apply to shares of such Fund then outstanding, and (b) the disclosure in that Fund's prospectus relating to that class will be revised appropriately. No CDSC will be imposed on shares issued prior to the date of the requested order. Applicants' Legal Conclusions 1. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) exempting the Funds' proposed issuance and sale of multiple classes of securities to the extent that such issuance and sale might be deemed to result in a ``senor security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) of the Act and be prohibited by section 18(f)(1), and to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i).
