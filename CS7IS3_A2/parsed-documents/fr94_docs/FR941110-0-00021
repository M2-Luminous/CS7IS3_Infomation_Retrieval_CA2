FR941110-0-00021 FR941110-0-00011 Customs also is of the opinion that the interim rule is, in fact, in keeping with the spirit of the Customs Modernization provisions (Title VI) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the Act), Public Law 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057 (December 8, 1993). Both the language of the Act and its legislative history clearly set forth the concepts of ``shared responsibility'' and ``informed compliance'' as critical to its effectiveness and application. In the instant situation, the interim rule is one of the measures Customs intends to use to address the significant problem of illegal transshipment. The interim rule informs the textile importer that he or she can avoid application of the interim rule by taking adequate measures prior to importation to attempt to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information provided to Customs at the time of entry, including proper marking or other indication of the country of origin of the articles. In light of the problems associated with illegal transshipment, Customs believes that it is not unreasonable to expect textile importers to exert diligence in attempting to verify the source of their goods prior to importation commensurate with the statutory requirement to exercise reasonable care in presenting documentation to Customs during the entry process. If a textile importer can demonstrate that such measures were taken (i.e., the importer was not culpable and acted with reasonable care), then there can be no violation of section 1592 because culpability is a requisite element of such a violation. Put another way, the interim rule does not apply to those textile importers who responsibly take such adequate measures prior to importation. In view of the foregoing, Customs is adopting the text of the interim rule as final without change. The Regulatory Flexibility Act, and Executive Order 12866 Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), it is certified that the amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This document does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in Executive Order 12866. List of Subjects in 19 CFR Part 171 Administrative practice and procedure, Customs duties and inspection, Law enforcement, Penalties, Seizures and forfeitures. Amendment to 19 CFR Chapter I For the reasons stated above, the interim rule amending part 171 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 171), which was published at 59 FR 14745&hyph;14746 on March 30, 1994 (T.D. 94&hyph;29), is adopted as a final rule without change. Michael H. Lane, Acting Commissioner of Customs. Approved: October 24, 1994. Dennis M. O'Connell, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.
