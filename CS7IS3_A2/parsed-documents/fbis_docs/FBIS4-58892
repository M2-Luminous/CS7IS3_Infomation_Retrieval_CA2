Mary Jones, 35, was picked up two weeks ago in the Shemiran neighborhood in northern Tehran allegedly in a drunken state. She was immediately given 80 lashes of the whip after being found guilty in a court of "promoting corruption." JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI daily charged however that new information on Jones had led the authorities to believe that she was also engaged in espionage. She paid visits to the war front during the 1980-1988 conflict with Iraq and made "suspicious remarks" during interrogation after her arrest," it said. However, a revolutionary court contacted by AFP denied there was any evidence of espionage activities against Jones, and that she had been arrested on corruption charges only. The U.S. interests section at the Swiss embassy in Tehran declined to comment on the case. The daily KEYHAN charged on Thursday that Jones, who has been here since 1983, came here "without identity papers and with the aim of corrupting the young in Iran." KEYHAN said that Jones had been ordered to leave the country, but a judiciary official at the court refused to disclose if she had already been deported. Iran banned the sale and consumption of alcoholic drinks after the 1979 Islamic revolution which toppled the late shah.
