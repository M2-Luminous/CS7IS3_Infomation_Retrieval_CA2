Mr. Buthelezi, the first thing we'd like to know from you is comment. We believe that a bomb has exploded at Jan Smuts Airport. We have no further details. It's absolutely not clear what has happened. What is your comment? [Buthelezi] Well, I'm distressed by it, because I think that today should be the dawn of a new South Africa, but I mean, if the new South Africa is born, you know, in the midst of bombings of the kind that we've seen in the last few days, then that doesn't augur well for the future peace and prosperity of this country, and therefore I'm extremely distressed that it's on-going, even now. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] Dr. Buthelezi, what would your comment be on the reports that a bomb has exploded at Jan Smuts? [Buthelezi] I'm very distressed by it, because I think that it is very tragic that the new South Africa should be born amidst the bomb blasts that we have seen in the last few days, and I'm distressed because I believe that that doesn't augur well for the future of this country, because quite clearly those who are doing so mean to destabilize the country, and once the country is destabilized, of course, we are not going to get prosperity and peace, which are the major objectives, and have been major objectives of our struggle. [Correspondent] Do you think the police are doing more to arrest the perpetrators of this latest violence? [Buthelezi] It's very difficult to judge them because I think that, very unwisely, Mr. de Klerk declared a state of emergency in this region, and therefore I think the police as such, and all the security forces, are spread very thinly on top, because some of them are here in Natal and KwaZulu, whereas, in fact, because of the political problems they have really abandoned their ordinary policing work to concentrate on the political problems, and the political violence, and therefore I wouldn't be judgmental and say that they are not doing enough, because I'm a realist. I realize that, you know, human beings, such a number of human beings can do just so much, and no more. [Correspondent] In your opinion, who is responsible for this? [Buthelezi] Well, I really would be a prophet to say so. I wish I knew who did it, in fact. Just like you, I won't know that until one person is arrested, indicating from what group he comes. I've no idea.
