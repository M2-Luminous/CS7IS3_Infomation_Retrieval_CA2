Fadlallah who was delivering his sermons at Imam Reza Mosque in southern Beirut Friday said no one Zionist is innocent in the occupied Palestine since the mere fact of their presence on the occupied land is a criminal act. He said the innocent side in the conflict are the Lebanese and the Palestinians who are targets of regular attacks of the Zionist soldiers. Allameh Fadlallah also criticized the pope for describing the operations of the Palestinian strugglers as some sort of antagonism with non-Arabs, and called on him to support the Palestinians that are being killed daily by the Zionists and demand the Zionist regime to allow Palestinian refugees on their homeland. He said Vatican's recognition of the Zionist regime is in fact an endorsement of the occupation of Palestinians lands by the Zionist regime.
