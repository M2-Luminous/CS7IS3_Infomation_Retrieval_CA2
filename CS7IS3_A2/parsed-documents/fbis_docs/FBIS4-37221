This is part of a draft plan for national salvation which is being debated by the cadres of the two fronts as a prelude to endorsing it within the framework of their unionist plan. This constitutes a step along the road of unity between the Palestinian left and its democratic and revolutionary forces. The program asserts that the two fronts are willing to set up an alliance under this program with all forces in the Palestinian arena. [passage omitted]
