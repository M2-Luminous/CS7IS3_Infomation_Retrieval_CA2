Still, they would like to get familiar with details of the program. Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak met with foreign investors yesterday. "We are united by a common goal--to score success in a market economy and in building democracy," said Pawlak. "Foreign investors who are members of the [industrial-commercial] chamber, as well as their Polish partners, support those political forces that guarantee the development of a market economy open to the world and based on private ownership," replied Chairman Stefan Lewandowski. The businessmen had high praise for the government for having prepared the "Strategy for Poland," which creates the foundation for making business plans based on reliable data. Still, they asked the prime minister to provide more details. Foreign investors asked the prime minister when the government will speed up the privatization process. "More companies may have been sold earlier, but, in general, these were sales for low prices. We are not eager to see privatization at any cost," Pawlak responded. "What about taxes? Can we count on stability in the tax system?" the investors kept asking. "We are eager to see stability. There is the VAT [value-added tax], there are customs duties and income tax, and that should be enough," Pawlak explained.
