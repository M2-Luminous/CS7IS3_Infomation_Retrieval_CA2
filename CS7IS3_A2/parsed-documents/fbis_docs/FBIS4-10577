Commissioner Enrique de Jesus Martinetti, chief of the National Police Intelligence Department, reported that he has received a confidential report confirming this data from the Israeli Intelligence Service. "He (Imadal Mekdav) has again been located in Lebanon, and the Israeli Intelligence Service is on his heels. In any case it has been suggested that we continue the investigation, just in case there are ramifications," Martinetti said. The police chief confirmed that Imadal Mekdav and another person arrived in a South American country--presumably Paraguay or Argentina--some weeks ago with the objective of attacking an Israeli diplomatic seat. "This man and another Shiite came to Paraguay or Argentina. One of them returned immediately to the Middle East, but the other remained," the intelligence chief said. Martinetti indicated that at present it is not known whether the Shiite came to Paraguay or to Argentina. "What is known is that the Israelis warned the Paraguayan and Argentine police forces that two Palestinians had arrived in one of the two countries, with unknown intentions. One of them remained somewhere around here. The report indicates that he came to carry out sabotage actions," Martinetti said. "These people are fundamentalist fanatics that want to expand the struggle, known as the intifadah, against the Israelis in other parts of the world. And one of their ways is to attack diplomatic seats," he added. [passage omitted]
