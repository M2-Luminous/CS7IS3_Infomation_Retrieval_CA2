The last few days Stoltenberg has been in Moscow in an attempt to to put together an international coalition which can bring an end to the long civil war. In an interview with AFTENPOSTEN Stoltenberg said that there is only one word which can describe what has happened in Gorazde: madness. The atrocities make it clear to the whole of the international community that there is not a single day to be lost in the attempts to reach a peaceful solution. "For every day that the war goes on, lives are being lost. At the same time the involvement on behalf of and the desire for peace is greater than it has been for a long time. This is a source of optimism in the midst of the terrible reports from Gorazde," the Norwegian peace mediator said. Stoltenberg said that he is very happy about the last few days' initiatives from both the United States and Russia. ``For the first time in a long time we have real hope that the four international actors -- that is, the United States, the European Union, Russia, and the United Nations -- can arrive at a joint position. If the international community confronts the sides in Bosnia with a united approach and gives them a clear choice between war and peace, there will be a realistic hope that they will choose peace. ``As long as the approaches of the United States, Russia, and the EU have remained so divergent, the sides in the civil war have naturally enough each tried to play on their own superpower,'' Stoltenberg continued. ``The United States has been linked to the Muslims, the Russians to the Serbs, and the Germans to the Croats. Each of the sides has believed that it could win more by betting on `its' superpower than by seeking peace. This has done nothing to promote peace.'' If developments over the next few days go as people hope, representatives of the superpowers and the UN will hopefully soon come together for a joint conference on Bosnia. It is also perhaps possible to hope for a summit between Boris Yeltsin, Bill Clinton, European leaders, and the UN secretary general. More than one meeting will be needed to sketch a final peace treaty for Bosnia. But if the will is there among the international actors, a proposal for a peace agreement ought not to be so far away, the Norwegian mediator said. "I think that there are a couple of things of which people should be fully aware in the future: First the fact that anything is better than continued war. It goes without saying that we prefer a just peace agreement under which each ethnic group in Bosnia is given the land areas which are their due. But we may have to settle for less. If in the next few weeks it proves impossible to achieve anything other than a cease-fire -- that is, a Cyprus solution where the sides are left standing where they are now -- the Muslims will remain the losing side. But this is greatly preferable to new victims and new massacres," Stoltenberg said. The second point he wanted to make was a warning against believing that air strikes against Serb positions is an abracadabra solution which can bring peace in Bosnia closer. "The EU's peace mediator, Lord Owen, and I have continually backed the possibility of the UN being able to give orders for air strikes against one or more sides in the conflict. But such attacks are not without their problems. You have to be aware that the Bosnian Serbs have very good antiaircraft defenses. If more NATO aircraft take to the air over Bosnia, we have to face the fact that some of them will be shot down," Stoltenberg stressed.
