At a seminar on banking in Johannesburg yesterday, Standard Bank group economist Nico Czypionka said the proposals had "made my hair stand on end" and called on fellow bankers to contact the ANC to express concern. Cyzpionka was referring to suggestions that banks be required to lend a rising share of their assets to small, black-owned enterprises and be forced to provide reasons for turning down loan applications. He said the ANC should be told that the NP [National Party] government had tried the route of controls over banks, with "messy" results for the economy. "To be blunt, the proposals are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how the financial sector works." The programme was "a shopping list that, if added up, would blow the country's financial resources out of the water." To the extent that it was financially and physical feasible, banks would push hard to address under development problems and play a part in dealing with apartheid legacies. They had to do this without deviating from the principles of sound business practice, he said. At this time of change, when new economic and other policies were being sought, banks had to make their voices heard. "I am not sure that we as bankers are doing this adequately and effectively. I getthe strong feeling that this country's banks have sold themselves short -- we are doing far more than we are being given credit for." Banks had a vested interest in the long-term prosperity of the country, and had taken active measures to support this with concrete actions. He cited the growing momentum of community banking operations within a number of banks, the Community Banking Project, the negotiations between the Association of Mortgage Lenders and civic organisations, and involvement in the National Housing Forum. Council of Southern African banks CE [chief executive] Piet Liebenberg said the industry was in the process of formulating a response to the ANC's policy statement. "The ANC's statement was issued without consultation. We will not be able to change much, if anything, in the reconstruction and development programme. But we intend to lobby, inform and debate the issues. We are pulling out all the stops," he said. He did not, however, believe nationalisation was a real threat to the industry. Community Banking Project CE Archie Hurst said the most optimistic projections indicated that by the year 2000, the bank's total advances would not exceed R[rand]3bn[billion]. He urged commercial banks to keep exploring ways of being active at the bottom end of the market, while government involvement was also important. "It is our hope that through its efforts, the Community Bank will pave the way for commercial banks to become involved in this market."
