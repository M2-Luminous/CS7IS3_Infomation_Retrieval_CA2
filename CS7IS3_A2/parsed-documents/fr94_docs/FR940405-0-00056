FR940405-0-00056 FR940405-0-00009 Mr. Sebring commented on the NPRM after reviewing what he said was a video animation of Century's new restraint exhibited at a juvenile products show. Mr. Sebring was concerned that a child in a restraint that changes adjustment position can experience acceleration levels on its chest cavity that are not experienced with current restraints. The commenter suggested NHTSA adopt a rule that permits motion only after analyzing data from a test dummy that measures G forces, and specify limits on the G forces that are imposed on a dummy placed in the restraint. Agency Decision NHTSA is amending S5.1.1(b) of Standard 213 to remove the restriction against an infant restraint's changing adjustment position during testing. The agency believes safety will not be degraded by this amendment, since a provision has been adopted to minimize possible safety risks resulting from a restraint's changing adjustment positions in a crash. That provision relates to the closing of exposed openings. The agency will examine infant restraint accident data and consider appropriate action if changing the position of an infant restraint's seating surface has any adverse effect on safety. At present, NHTSA does not know of any information indicating the possibility of a negative safety impact. In fact, NHTSA believes there are several potential positive impacts. Those positive impacts were discussed in the NPRM as reasons why the agency was reexamining the prohibition against change of adjustment position during testing. Since the 1970's, when the prohibition was adopted, more has been learned about the proper positioning of apnea-prone children in car seats. Century documented the need for infant restraints that position apnea-prone infants in a more horizontal position. The agency concludes S5.1.1(b) should be amended so that it does not impede the development of new child seat designs for apnea-prone infants. NHTSA recognizes that the market for infant restraints that change adjustment positions may extend beyond the parents of apnea-prone children, and that this may result in a greater number of infants being exposed to the effects of the new type of infant restraint with its changing adjustment position. However, the agency is unable to estimate the extent of the possible appeal to the greater population of parents. Advocates requested information about ``the number of premature and low-birth weight infants who are at risk because they are being transported in currently marketed child restraints.'' According to the Vital and Health Statistics Report of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 6.9 percent of the 3,910,000 births in 1988 were of low birth weight (``low birth weight'' is defined as a birth weight of less than 2,500 grams (5 pounds, 8 ounces)). That is a total of 267,790 babies. In 1989, the low birth rate increased to 7 percent, resulting in 282,868 low-birth weight babies out of 4,040,972 babies. 2 2 NHTSA submitted this information to Docket No. PRM&hyph;213&hyph;022&hyph;01 on September 4, 1992 as an addendum to Century's rulemaking petition. Another factor that changed since the 1970's is the change in vehicle seat designs that have occurred in recent years. As explained above and in the NPRM, vehicle seat designs have changed such that infants typically are positioned more upright in infant restraints placed in current model vehicles than in vehicles of the late 1970's and early 1980's. A restraint that enables the child to ride in a more reclined position than a conventional infant restraint could enhance the transportation of infants generally, and could benefit apnea-prone children in particular. The agency also considered the interaction of infant restraints with air bags in deciding to issue this rule. Ford stated that it is possible that an infant restraint could be developed that would reduce the risk of interaction with an air bag, if the restraint could keep the infant in a supine position below the level of air bag inflation, prior to movement to a more vertical position. However, Ford also noted it is possible that an air bag would likely begin to inflate before or shortly after a movable rear-facing infant restraint would begin to move into a more vertical position. ``Movement of the infant seat to a vertical position would likely be somewhat limited by the inflating air bag.*␣*␣*'' The American Academy of Pediatrics expressed its desire to see an infant restraint that can be safely used with an air bag. ``If the opportunity to develop a child restraint that utilizes movement proves to improve this serious incompatibility problem, we certainly would be in favor of such a device.''
