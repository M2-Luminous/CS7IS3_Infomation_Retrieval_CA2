The Tanga zonal customs controller, Ndugu Chris Koroso, told reporters that the driver, believed to have links with the consignment, ran away leaving their [as heard] car and passports behind. The driver told the Horohoro customs official that they had run short of money and requested to go to neighboring Lunga Lunga border post on the Kenyan side to make a telephone call to someone in Mombasa to seek assistance. Ndugu Koroso said that the two were allowed to go, on condition that they should leave behind their passports. But they never turned up and the car was towed to Tanga. The Tanga regional commissioner, Honorable Azzan Aljabri, who witnessed the hoardings of the consignment, commended the customs officials for the job and called on them to enhance the campaign.
