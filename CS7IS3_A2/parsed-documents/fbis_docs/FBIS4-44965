This has occurred within the framework of an unfamiliar experience. Within this experience, opposition members leave their countries in numbers amounting to millions to use countries in the diaspora as new working arenas for their political activity in an endeavor to perpetuate the bridges of communication with their peoples inside the homeland and to mobilize these peoples in the direction of the goals that these opposition movements seek. An exception is the Turkish condition and the early Kurdish mass emigration resulting from the national fusion policy embraced by the new state in the wake of the fall of the Ottoman caliphate. Mass emigration to flee the homeland under the pressure of various factors is something that was experienced by the people of East Europe during the Stalinist era prior to and after World War II. Despite the curtain lowered around those countries, they witnessed numerous mass escape attempts throughout nearly one-half century. Border stations surrounding those countries saw a flood of refugees who, with the passage of time, came to form ethnic minorities exceeding hundreds of thousands in their new homelands. Prior to the sixth and seventh decades [of the 1900s], the Middle East did not see the rise of totalitarian regimes similar to the regimes seen now. This does not mean that the area's countries have not tried their luck with certain despotic regimes. Rather, these countries have perhaps abounded with examples of military and non-military individualistic and despotic regimes. But more often than not, they were temperamental and superficial regimes. Opposition to those regimes emerged and was often conducted peacefully, despite the persecution and oppression that accompanied that opposition. But that persecution and oppression were within the bounds of the bearable and one could withstand them. This is why opposition movements and their supporters, and even ordinary citizens, did not consider emigration to the outside world. Many of those movements were known for their attachment to their homelands and for not having a prior history of emigration and expatriation, excluding some individual cases of banishment, which was used as a maximum punishment against some active opposition elements who were deported from their countries. Many are the stories about the handfuls of soil that those deportees took with them as a reminder keeping them company in their exile. But at a time when most of the world's political regimes moved in the direction of openness, of spreading a democratic climate, and of respect for man's freedom and rights, the tendencies toward totalitarian rule have grown stronger in the past two decades in the Middle East region and the Arab homeland. It is as if these two regions want to establish themselves as the alternative to the failed [totalitarian] experience in East Europe. This is why contentment with power from above is no longer the distinguishing mark of these regimes' activity. Rather, some of these regimes have turned into brutally suppressive regimes that are not reluctant to embrace the scorched land policy at the first confrontation with their peoples. Since 1968 and under the shadow of this tendency and of the death machine that has been hysterically devouring any citizen who stands in its way, Iraq's politicized and unpoliticized citizens have been compelled to wage a bloody and rarely-matched struggle in the region in an attempt to confront the barbaric tide coming from within. They have made thousands of sacrifices. But with every sacrifice made, the regime's lust for predation grew stronger and stronger. In the face of this unbearable pressure, a way had to be found to deal with this regime. Thus, mass emigration and escape, plus the coercive expulsions practiced by the regime itself, became some sort of self-defense against total and inevitable annihilation. For nearly 20 years, new numbers have been added daily to an emigration that the Iraqis have not wanted and that they have never before experienced in their lives. The Iraqi people have been divided into those who are exiled inside their homeland and those exiled outside it, shedding hot tears for kinsmen who have survived. From exile, the crowds are trying to organize themselves within political frameworks, some of which are an extension of what has existed at home, and to coordinate joint efforts with the movement at home in order to besiege and shatter the regime. But a positive circumstance has developed in the Iraqi opposition's political and field reality through the deliverance of that part of the homeland that has been liberated from the regime's control. This part has turned into a base that embraces the opposition movement's new political framework, which bears the name of the Iraqi National Congress [INC] and which includes influential Arab and Kurdish organizations and cadres. Thus, the beginning of the process of a counter political emigration to this part of the homeland has been created. With the new experiment gaining more strength day after day despite all obstacles placed in its way, the justifications for continued dealing with opposition action from abroad are weakening day after day and may reach the point where all excuses cited for staying away from home will be poor excuses lacking all objective foundations. However, there is no harm in reviewing some perils, which some forces cite to justify this position [of staying away from the liberated Kurdistan]: First, the incompatibility of these forces' positions with the INC program and plan and, consequently, these forces' development of a different political position that reaches the point of condemnation at times. Assuming that this faction's position is sound, this should not be a reason for these forces to refrain from going to a part of the homeland that is not under the regime's control. If they believe that there are foreign forces that have a role in creating this reality, then do they prefer that this reality melt away and that, consequently, the province return to the regime's control? Or is it better to move to this base and to try to contribute to correcting any correctable negative tendencies and pitfalls? Second, some influential figures justify the presence of this vast number of leaders and cadres outside the homeland by saying that they have inside the homeland enough leaders and cadres to meet the needs of the action according to the circumstances of the phase. It is very difficult to prove the soundness of these statements for a very simple reason, namely that the indicator of qualitative movement against the regime was at its peak at the end of the Iraq-Iran war. This shows that numerous factions preferred at the time to cling to the land, to seek its protection, and to face dangers rather than emigrate to move beyond the regime's reach. Thus, we have seen the emergence of a strange condition in the struggle against the regime. When the regime was strong and supported by several regional and international forces, resistance by these factions was stiffer and more effective. The numerous qualitative and distinctive operations that were staged in Baghdad and its suburbs at the time are an indication that it was possible to penetrate the regime's red lines, despite this regime's brutality and strength. But for the past three years, and excluding the major uprising of March 1991--an uprising which nobody may claim as his own--we have seen clearly how this kind of operation has diminished and how it has retreated deep into the marshlands and to the surrounding areas in the south. The qualitative operations have turned into hit-and-run operations to which the regime has become accustomed. These operations pose no strategic threat to this regime, considering that they have turned into intermittent and disorganized diversionary operations lacking a unified command and a precise strategic goal. However, this fact does not negate the unique spirit of heroism displayed by those unknown fighters in the south's marshlands and cities. Third, there is a fact whose revelation will change nothing about it, namely that the regime prefers, perhaps even encourages, the presence and continuation of some sort of limited and calculated resistance in the southern and southeastern sectors of Iraq, i.e., those sectors whose extensions spill into Iran in some cases. The regime's objective is to continue to disseminate the allegations it has been making, and it continues to make, namely that the post-revolution Iran is responsible for nurturing and fanning the fires of this condition. I have cited these justifications regarding the reservations expressed on operating from the liberated areas of the Iraqi Kurdistan so as to get to the common problems that the opposition movement in exile generally encounters and which can be summed as follows: 1. In today's word, talk about total independence, whether political or economic, and at times even cultural, has become a figment of the imagination. If regimes themselves cannot establish for themselves in today's word an independent entity in the true, not the propaganda, sense of the word, then it behooves political opposition movements not to envision themselves in a position that allows them complete freedom of movement and decisionmaking. The Iraqi opposition, which is pressured and besieged, is certainly compelled to soften its political rhetoric and vision in a way that befits this or that regional or international party, depending on the intellectual, operational, and geographic background from which the organization concerned proceeds. This dilemma from which the Iraqi opposition suffers is nothing new. A party seeking asylum is always supposed to observe the rules of asylum. However, the problem arises when the objectives of the regional or international power clash with the legitimate national aspirations of this or that opposition faction. This problem influences the momentum and efficiency of the joint and unified action of the entire movement negatively. But when the possibilities of action from a liberated part of the homeland materialize, action under the umbrella of this or that foreign party is not so much a must as it is insistence on tying affairs in a way that serves the interests of those foreign parties. 2. What has become known about opposition from exile is that leaders well known to the masses assume leadership of this opposition's struggle and direct it according to the given facts of the domestic situation because it is impossible for such leaders to perform this role from inside the homeland. Because of the black fascist situation prevailing in Iraq, those who lead the political and organizational action are not the only ones who have emigrated. Rather, they have been accompanied by an immense mass exodus. The problem is that many of the emigrants have been turned by their new circumstances and by the activities of the parties and movements surrounding them into politicized cadres that burden the leaderships and block their path to deliberate, calm, and responsible consideration. This condition has forced many of these leaders into confused and hesitant positions whose aim is to please and appease these cadres. Consequently, political action in exile has largely turned into confused and distorted action. 3. The more positive and important aspect in the exiled opposition's movements and activities is the role they play to expose the regime and show its ugly face through information confirmed with figures and facts received from home. This aspect is then embodied in the political moves they make to reap the fruits of the impact of this information on the positions of the world's various governments and peoples toward the struggle. This is why a unified rhetoric in the external propaganda is necessary, even a must. But because of the political positions of some opposition elements abroad, this propaganda rhetoric has become pale and contradictory, and it has begun to undermine the results sought from it. 4. Despite the displays put up by some of those who are abroad, the opposition in exile continues to be a ghost opposition in which the serious mixes with the farcical, the true with the false, thus making it easy for the enemy to infiltrate it and, at times, to change its direction in ways that serve his purposes. Opposition at home is the sincere, serious, and real opposition. 5. Prolonged years in exile often transform opposition gradually into a state of addiction. Consequently, affairs are tackled with chatter, oneupmanship, and competition for social status. The longer the regime survives, the more duped some opposition elements become. Such a condition constitutes a negative phenomenon for Iraq's future, because the phase that will follow the regime's fall needs a positive modern mentality. 6. An opposition in exile that is aware of its responsibility is an opposition capable of establishing definite and organized daily operational contact with its people at home, constantly supplying them with all the requirements of military resistance, both mobilizational and financial. This opposition is never contented with the strategy of selling words. The experience of the March 1991 uprising proved the complete opposite of the above. All sectors at home moved forth. But the distance between them and the leaders in exile was very great and the latter could not catch up with the uprising in order to perform the role they had drafted. Finally, if the opposition in exile enjoys its stay, and if it stays where it is for a lengthy time, it turns into a desperate opposition. Fascist regimes do not care if all their adversaries emigrate, as long as they remain safe from these adversaries. These regimes do not care what names these organizations give themselves. Totalitarian regimes have contributed to creating opposition-in-exile movements and, consequently, peoples in exile. The process of devoiding homelands can be stopped only if democracy and respect for the citizen are followed as a path to achieve political and social justice.
