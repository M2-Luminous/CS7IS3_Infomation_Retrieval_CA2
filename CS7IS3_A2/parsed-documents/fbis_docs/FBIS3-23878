This was possible largely thanks to the new Russian Constitution, which, unfortunately, does not create a full-fledged federation but affords an opportunity for more flexible relations between the center and the components of the Russian Federation. To what extent such a form as a treaty is at all acceptable in a normal federation is another matter. It is hard to imagine a treaty between, say, the U.S. Government and the state of Massachusetts. But we are in transition as yet from a unitary state to a federative state, from the old concept of national-state arrangement to the idea of a symmetrical federation. And from this viewpoint the conclusion of the treaty is an entirely permissible act. The treaty does not, in my view, alter the status of the Republic of Tatarstan and does not add sovereignty to it, it contains altogether no mention of sovereignty, although it says that Tatarstan is entitled to pursue international relations independently. This may be interpreted both as the fact that it is a subject of international law and as the fact that it is not such. The treaty has not, in principle, cleared up this problem but, once again, if we take some other federations--the United States again--we see that in each state there is a state secretary, essentially a minister of foreign affairs, and that the state pursues an original foreign policy, which is confined, it is true, to a very narrow range of issues. That is, there is nothing so terrible in this either. The treaty draws quite strict terms of reference between Tatarstan and the Federation and determines quite a wide range of joint powers. The list of issues that remain within the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation is quite voluminous, and Tatarstan, naturally, has an interest in these matters being decided at Federation level. Consequently, it now has a direct interest in participating in the work of the federal authorities. The treaty delicately and competently skirts the problem of contradictions between the constitutions of the Russian Federation and Tatarstan. In my view, the best way of delineating authority between the center and the components is when the prerogatives of the center are simply determined, and everything else remains "local." It is good, therefore, that the parties to the treaty did not become obsessed with whose constitution--that of Russia or Tatarstan--is "higher" but established that there is a sphere of activity within the competence of the federal government, there is a sphere of joint competence, and so forth. We do not currently have equality of the components of the Federation. And there is, of course, a certain danger that the treaty with Tatarstan will serve as an incentive to a further "parade of treaties" for the center and the republics. It may be anticipated that at some stage the krays and oblasts also will want to formalize treaty relations with the central power. But I would not be inclined to dramatize the situation. The fears in connection with the collapse of Russia are altogether exaggerated, and a gravitation toward reintegration has manifestly been revealed today. It seems to me, for example, that Tatarstan displayed in the conclusion of the treaty greater flexibility than the central power. It dropped certain of its demands in the sphere of political sovereignization and division of the economic space, Kazan has agreed to pay taxes to the federal treasury, the creation of joint regional development funds is contemplated, and so forth. Nikolay Sorokin, ITAR-TASS correspondent for OBSHCHAYA GAZETA The news of the signing of the treaty with Russia has been greeted in restrained fashion in Tatarstan. To rejoice or wait and see? I have been calling acquaintances and asking them to comment on a document, the like of which Tatarstan has never signed throughout its history. But all have been politely refusing, referring to the fact that they are not familiar with the text as yet. The treaty was born in difficult labor and in argument and doubt. Progress toward it was made perseveringly, step by step, at the price of mutual compromise over a period of almost three years. There were in Tatarstan not only supporters but also opponents of a normalization of relations with Moscow, about which President Mintimer Shaymiyev said heatedly on the eve of the signing of the treaty: "There are politicians, who are guided by the principle: 'the worse, the better', who are opposed to all negotiations with Russia, which they call a neighboring state." At one demonstration, incidentally, the crowd sentenced Shaymiyev for participation in the negotiations to... death, notifying him of this by telegram. Defeating the Kazan "ultras" by argument is impossible, but their "trump" arguments are not now seen as being that substantial. The treaty affords Tatarstan complete freedom in foreign economic relations. Without waiting for the signing of this document, incidentally, the republic had already formed a Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and a Department for Foreign Affairs. Business contacts have been established with companies, banks, and cultural and social organizations of the United States, Turkey, Hungary, and South Korea, and treaties have been concluded with almost all "natives" of the former Union. Thus cellular communications, which will enable Tatarstan in three years to move in terms of level of individual telephone subscribers from 66th place in Russia into the top 10, are being introduced in the republic in conjunction with the American Hughes Network Systems. The particular value of the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan is that an instrument of its realization--intergovernmental agreements--is proposed simultaneously. Eleven such agreements have been adopted thus far--on the budget, property, customs, the environment, the defense sectors, transport, communications, and others. The Tatar National Bank, for example, although remaining a structural subdivision of the Central Bank of Russia, has acquired great operating scope: It may now, at its own discretion, restructure the network of its branches and allocate credit independently, without Central Bank involvement, for priority programs for the republic. The treaty that has been adopted is, in Mintimer Shaymiyev's opinion, only the first step. Having declared in the Kremlin: "We shall not stop here," he made his Moscow colleagues quite wary, but hereupon reassured them: Tatarstan, having initiated the treaty relationship, will shortly propose the next program--for decentralization of the Russian economy. And the people of Tatarstan will make their evaluation of the treaty at the repeat Federal Assembly elections, which are scheduled for 13 March. The candidates for deputy, among whom is President Mintimer Shaymiyev, were registered on 16 February, incidentally.
