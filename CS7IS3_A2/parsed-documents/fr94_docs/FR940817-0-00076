ACTION: Extension of Phase-In Period for §240.16b&hyph;3. SUMMARY: The Commission today is extending the phase-in period for compliance with the substantive conditions of new Rule 16b&hyph;3 regarding employee benefit plan transactions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 pending further notice and rulemaking under the provision. DATES: Effective August 17, 1994. The phase-in period for compliance with new §240.16b&hyph;3, which previously has been extended to September 1, 1994, is extended until September 1, 1995, or such different date as set in further rulemaking under Section 16. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anne M. Krauskopf, Office of the Chief Counsel, Division of Corporation Finance, at (202) 942&hyph;2900. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 8, 1991, the Commission adopted comprehensive revisions to the rules under Section 16 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''). 2 The new regulatory scheme generally became effective on May 1, 1991, but a 16 month phase-in period was provided with respect to specified rules affecting employee benefit plans, in order to give registrants ample time to review the rule changes and amend their plans accordingly. 3 The Adopting Release provided that registrants could continue to rely on the exemptions from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act 4 afforded by former Rules 16a&hyph;8(b), 5 16a&hyph;8(g)(3), 6 and 16b&hyph;3 7 after May 1, 1991, but would be required to adopt the substantive conditions of new Rule 16b&hyph;3 8 by September 1, 1992. 9 1 15 U.S.C. 78p (1988). 2 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.

The Rule 16b&hyph;3 phase-in period was extended until September 1, 1994, in contemplation of further rulemaking under Section 16 with regard to employee benefit plans. 10 Because the Commission currently is engaging in such rulemaking, 11 the Commission is extending the phase-in period for new Rule 16b&hyph;3 until September 1, 1995, or such different date as is set by the Commission. 10 See Exchange Act Release No. 32574 (July 2, 1993) [58 FR 36866]. 11 See Exchange Act Release No. 34514 (August 10, 1994).
