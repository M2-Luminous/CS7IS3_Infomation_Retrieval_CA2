Slovakia needs the help of foreign investors because it lacks sufficient resources of its own to revive the economy, Moravcik said after meeting with the mission, headed by OPIC Vice President Christopher Finn and made up of 25 business leaders. U.S. investment in Slovakia remains low, said Moravcik, noting that the government would like individual countries to have adequate shares. He added that Slovakia was mainly interested in investment in the manufacturing sector. U.S. investors have expressed interest mainly in the energy industry, production of goods important for environmental protection, and tourism, Moravcik noted. Moravcik said Slovakia offered good conditions for investment, though some changes to the legal system are needed, as is the creation of a stable political situation. OPIC is an independent U.S. Government agency focused on supporting economic growth in countries with developing market economies by stimulating private U.S. investment activities.
