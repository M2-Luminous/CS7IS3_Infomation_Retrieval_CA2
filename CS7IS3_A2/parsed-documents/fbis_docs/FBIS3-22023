According to Helio Vigio, chief of the DAS [Counter-Kidnapping Headquarters], the main drug traffickers from the Red Command and Third Command gangs have established illegal enterprises to supply men and weapons and plan the collection of ransom, and they even have experts to negotiate with the kidnapped victims' families. According to police, Flavio Negao, from the Vigario Geral slum, and Orlando Jogador, from the Alemao and Marcelo Xara slums on Varginha Hill, besides being drug traffickers also kidnapped people and robbed bullion in the past four months. "The news now is that smaller gangs are kidnapping minor businessmen to raise money to buy drugs," said Inspector Placidio Guimaraes, DAS operations chief. Other gangs, like that of drug trafficker Robertinho from Parada de Lucas slum, which is linked to the Third Command, rent sophisticated weapons for kidnapping and bullion robbery operations. They also provide men for operations in exchange for a percentage of the ransom. Joel de Oliveira Carvalho says he is "an expert in negotiating with the victims' families" and also provides other services to kidnappers. Vigio says drug traffickers usually buy drugs in return. "If police discover one of their drug caches, they need to find money quickly to buy more drugs and not lose their supplier," he said. According to DAS, there currently are seven kidnapped people in Rio de Janeiro.
