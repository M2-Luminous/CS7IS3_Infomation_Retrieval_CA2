This is the first time in years that the bank's management has offered such a revealing review of its situation and performance in various fields, because the general budget for 1991-92 was not published in any detail or, at least, did not receive a sufficient amount of attention and absorption at that time. In view of the choice and scope of publication, attributable to the bank being a private noncorporate company, providing financial data in this detail to the public is, of itself, the most important indicator of changes that have suddenly occurred in the situation of this important national institution. After the difficult circumstances to which it was subjected in 1991, the National Bank weathered the crisis in 1992, and entered into unprecedented activity under the circumstances by exposing its total performance to market pressures and the scrutiny of overseers. This in itself is the most important factor of future strength and the biggest incentive for the bank's progress, so that it may reclaim its natural position as the kingdom's most deep-rooted and strongest bank. Because numbers are just numbers, we are taking this occasion to publish this report so that its numbers can be quickly read, while pointing out the most important aspects that will especially interest the ordinary citizen. Status of Deposits The National Bank is keen on repeatedly making sure that the developments to which it was subjected have not affected its base of depositors, which clearly has been loyal to the bank. This fact is revealed by the stability of clients' deposits of nearly 49 billion Saudi riyals [R], which remain virtually unchanged from 1992. On the contrary, one could say that customer deposits increased "slightly" in 1993. However, this increase was not obvious, because the bank's clients kept an increasing part of their deposits in government bonds, since these bonds had a greater return than interest on deposits and, at the same time, had convenient incentives. As an example, the volume of customer investments of this type of financial instrument increased from R5.7 billion in 1992 to R7 billion in 1993. However, total deposits in the National Bank were affected in 1992 (in comparison with 1991) because the bank's operations in New York and London were halted. The suspension of the bank's two international branches resulted in transferring a major part of foreign operations to other banks and, consequently, the removal of deposits connected with those activities. The New York branch alone represented $4 billion which, for the most part, were deposits of institutions and banks. Moreover, the budget of the London branch ranged between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. It was no surprise, therefore, that customer deposits dropped in 1992 to R48.7 billion from the approximately R65.5 billion at the end of 1991. However, the largest portion of the decrease in this area stemmed from the removal of deposits of organizations and groups doing business abroad and not from the removal of deposits of individuals and traditional clients. At the same time, the deposits of banks do not represent an important source of the National Bank's funds, which has always been a net creditor of the Interbank market. This explains the lack of important deposits from international banks in the National Bank, while the deposits of Saudi banks in 1993 totalled R5.1 billion. This is a modest figure as a percentage of the budget and of the total deposits in the bank. As a result of the drop in total deposits, the size of the general budget report declined from R78 billion in 1991 to R63.7 billion in 1992. The 1993 statement has slightly improved, as it has again risen to R66.8 billion, an increase of nearly 5 percent. Investments The drop in deposits for 1992, as a result of the decrease in the bank's foreign operations, was accompanied by a comparable drop with regard to assets. The most prominent indicator of that was the bank's reduction of its portfolio of deposits with banks (which ranged from R24.4 billion in 1991 to R15.8 billion in 1992). There was also a reduction of the bank's portfolio of stocks, bonds, and securities by about R4.4 billion. [sentence as published] This is the equivalent of approximately R13 billion. The National Bank had to liquidate its operations in New York within a 90-day period, as set forth by American authorities, which was by the end of October of that year. This explains why the 1992 budget carries the full brunt of the closure of the branches. In contrast to that, it should be noted that the bank's credit activities in Saudi Arabia remained stable and were unaffected by events abroad. The net from loans and credit totaled R25.9 billion in 1991 and 25.1 billion in 1992, rising to R27.5 billion in 1993. One of the most important developments vis-a-vis the National Commercial Bank, which is clearly evident in its report, is the continual decrease over the past two years in the volume of letters of credit and, consequently, the financing of imports. These documentary credit activities in the 1993 budget totaled R3.6 billion, which is 33 percent less than the 1992 figure (which was R5.4 billion) and 40 percent less than 1991, which totaled R6 billion. We believe that this aspect is one of the most important factors preoccupying the bank's management, because it pertains to its traditional share of the commercial money market and importing activities by commercial groups and houses and, consequently, income from brokerage commissions. This is assumed to be an important source of net income. It is probable that the loss of the New York and London branches will have an impact on financing trade and imports. These activities have also been affected by the position of certain international banks (especially in Japan) with regard to cooperation in assuming credits. In 1993, they may also have been affected by the drop in financing imports by the private sector, the guiding of governmental expenditures, and the decrease in financing of oil operations because of the drop in crude oil prices. However, it is certain that the percentage of decrease in documentary credits in the National Bank is higher than the rate of decrease in the market, because of other reasons that we have mentioned. However, the bank is clearly determined to regain its role and its share in this filed, within the framework of a comprehensive plan to reestablish its presence and operations in the market, especially after the major increase in its capital to R6 billion. Strengthening the Conservative Trend The 1993 statement clearly shows a shift in the bank's policy regarding currency circulation in future contracts, especially in the currency market, because the decline of this item in the chapter of regular accounts (i.e., those outside the budget) has continued. The total future contracts to buy and sell foreign operations was R34.2 billion in 1993, compared with 39.3 billion in 1992, and approximately R89 billion in 1991. Hard Debts The National Bank's 1993 statement contained further evidence of increased conservatism in evaluating its budget and assets, since the total allocation for debt losses was R293.4 million, compared with R81 million in 1992, and R470 million in 1991. At present, the best evidence for this development is the re-addition of major allocations for the decline in value of the real estate portfolio, totaling R393.1 million, and other allocations for the decline in value of other investments. This totaled R170 million, which raises the total allocations for 1993 to R856.5 million. It is worth pointing out that the real estate allocations resulted from the bank's portfolio of real estate obtained as part of debt settlements. This portfolio has decreased in value as a result of the drop in real estate prices in 1993, and because of the possibility that the sale price would be affected by the size of the offer, particularly since the bank cannot hold on to real estate for more than two years. In any event, the belief is that the allocations are larger than what may be required. However, they reflect the bank's desire for more conservative policies with regard to evaluation of assets. Restructuring and Operating Costs The 1993 National Commercial Bank Report included evidence of the stability of the bank's operating expenditures which, in that year, totaled R1.432 billion, compared to R1.435 billion in 1992. Despite the fact that the National Bank has taken actions to reduce staff and restructure operations, with the goal of increasing efficiency and strengthening management, this process did not begin until the latter part of 1993. Consequently, not enough time has elapsed for this process' results to be reflected in this report. It is expected, therefore, that the bank will clearly show stronger developments with regard to guiding expenses during 1994, especially with regard to salaries. However, the possibility of increased reliance on modern technology, and the development of other branches for capital investments, means that total cost of operations could rise next year, despite possible reductions in salaries. One may view the 1993 budget report as the first one of the National Bank's new stage of guidance and centralization. However, this bank--conservative by nature--will avoid any implementation cost, i.e., making a desired change by shock methods. As is clearly shown by the bank's performance in 1993, this next phase could be called: searching for beneficial ways to restore the bank to its natural position. However, it is important to implement it now, given the lack of anticipated profit from international branches abroad. Here is the challenge, because it is difficult to visualize a bank the size of the National Bank without international branches. This matter will raise a question sooner or later and, in any event, rumors are strong in this regard.
