General Tagliaferro de Lima is the first member of the military High Command to leave his post. It is expected that the other members, including Defense Minister Vice Admiral Radames Munoz will make their resignations official today or Tuesday. After learning of Caldera's decision to remove them from their posts, the members of the High Command announced they would resign and request their retirement from the Armed Forces prior to the presidential inauguration on Wednesday. Caldera, a 78-year-old Christian Democrat, should announce his new cabinet in the next few hours. Caldera will be in office from 1994 to 1999. He had previously been president from 1969 to 1974.
