On the other hand, if the ANC [African National Congress] and the Government signal a positive response, the Freedom Alliance's parties could go ahead and register before midnight tomorrow and tighten up on the nuts and bolts of mediation over several days. There is a slim possibility that the registration deadline could be amended, but even this won't afford them much time. Candidates' lists need to be submitted in six days' time. [passage omitted]
