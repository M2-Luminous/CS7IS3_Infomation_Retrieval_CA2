FBIS4-55976 "dreeu101_p_94009" FBIS-EEU-94-101 Daily Report 25 May 1994 POLAND Design of New Military Vehicles Presented Design of New Military Vehicles Presented WS2505110094 Warsaw POLSKA ZBROJNA in Polish 20-22 May 94 pp 1, 5 WS2505110094 Warsaw POLSKA ZBROJNA Polish BFN [Report by (APW): "New Offer of Designers from Gliwice; To Help the Infantry"] [Text] The prototype is supposed to be ready at the end of this year. For the time being, it remains only an offer from the Development and Research Center of Mechanical Devices [OBRUM] in Gliwice. What is important, however, is that it will not be simply art for art's sake. At the third conference devoted to the problems of armament, held in Rydzyna, Wojciech Zajler, one of the designers of the new Polish infantry vehicle, pointed out that the vehicle is being prepared in close cooperation with "a military decision- maker." At the request of the Army, the new combat armored vehicle [BWP] is supposed to resemble the T-72 tank. Even though the Gliwice designers believe that it will not be an "optimum structure" as a result, they take the Army's opinion into account. This compromise has very real economic dimensions, both in the present difficult financial situation and in the immediate future, which will probably be equally difficult. The same spare parts as in the tank as well as similar crew training will certainly have tremendous influence on the price of the entire undertaking. It is clear that the Army would like to have something new, something that would be in line with the present development trends; however, they would like to achieve that for the lowest possible price. The offer of OBRUM may make that possible. However, there is one snag in the entire affair. As a matter of fact, the Army would like to have a BWP with an armour thickness of between 10 and 60 millimeters; in addition, the military would like it to be amphibious as well. This is not possible, said the designers in Gliwice and therefore, their new proposal consists of... two offers. BWP-94 This is the one that should meet the requirement of strong armor and strong power in general. The engine and the transmission are identical to those in the T-72 tank; however, the mechanisms were moved to the front. Two gearboxes (the same that are found in the tank) were located on both sides and linked coaxially to the drive wheels of the track system. Between the engine and the gearbox there is supposed to be generator starter, also of the T-72 tank type. The designers changed the indirect transmission crankcase, due to the necessity of adjusting it to front-wheel drive. On the left side behind the engine there is room for the driver. On the right side are the radiators and the fans. The exhaust system is connected into the outlet radiator air channel. On the central part of the frame is mounted a turret with the main armament. In the rear there is room for eight soldiers, sitting back-to-back in two rows. In front of each soldier, in the side panels, is a narrow firing slot. On the rear there is a loading platform. It opens hydraulically and contains two smaller hatches for soldiers. The drive mechanism consists of six geared wheels, fixed on cranks. All this, including the tracks, are just as on the tank. The vehicle's suspension consists of coiled torsion bars. The armament of the BWP-94 is supposed to be made up of a 35- millimeter gun ("Oerlikona") located in a two-man tower. Placed coaxially to it is a 7.62-millimeter gun and 12.7-millimeter NSW plot above the tower. The design also provides for PPK launchers above the tower. The combat weight of this 11-person vehicle is supposed to be approximately 30 tons. It is anticipated that its range will be 500 kilometers and with a maximum speed of 65 kilometers per hour. It will be 6.7 meters long and 2.3 meters high. The width between the tracks is supposed to be 3.37 meters, and ground clearance -- 0.45 meter. It is planned that it will be equipped with a fire-fighting and anti-explosion Deugra system. Communications is supposed to be maintained by means of: an R-173 radio transmitter, an R-173 radio receiver, and an R-124 radio telephone. BWP Amphibian Due to the requirement of floatability, the parameters of this offer of OBRUM are entirely different. The combat weight of the vehicle is "only" 17.3 tons; the thickness of the armor -- from 6 to 10 millimeters. It has room for nine soldiers. In order to achieve the location of the center of weight on the axis of the center of the uplift pressure, the designers had to place the greatest burdens symmetrically, along the lengthwise axis of the frame. The drive of the vehicle, which is a 800-horsepower MTU V 6 engine, is at the front, behind the driver. In the central part there is an armament turret; in the rear part -- there is room for six soldiers. The front was designed to enable smooth ride on the water and to achieve a positive dynamic uplift pressure. Above this board there is a suspendible breakwater. The drive mechanism consists of six special drive wheels of 6 centimeters in diameter. Above the landing-troops part two tight hatches were designed. The rear, more specifically, the loading platform which is lifted hydraulically, has two hatches as well. The armament of this vehicle is supposed to be the same as the armament in the other vehicle. Will the Army Buy It? It is too early for the final answer. It cannot be said today whether the Army will be interested in one or both offers. However, it is good that there is something going on in our arms industry. At any rate, it seems that the above-described constructions of OBRUM may be some supplement to the cooperative offer (with the Swedish Bofors) of the factory in Stalowa Wola.
