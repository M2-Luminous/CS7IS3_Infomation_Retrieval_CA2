Speaking with Japanese correspondents in Rome this evening, Hata ruled out holding general elections once the House of Representatives is dissolved, asserting that the next general elections should be held under the new electoral system. In this way, the prime minister ruled out holding the general elections under the present multi-seat constituency system once the House of Representatives is dissolved. While speaking with Japanese correspondents, Hata stated that generally speaking the Japanese prime minister possesses the right to dissolve the House of Representatives as his sole right, and the exercise of his right cannot be denied. The prime minister went on to say: Now that a new electoral system has been adopted, I believe the people hope the next general elections will be held under that new system. However, some politicians feel that if the next general elections are held under the current electoral system, it will be easier for their parties to increase their seats. Touching on the need to make the people fully understand the changes in the current demarcation of constituencies that will occur after a bill on the demarcation of single-seat constituencies is enacted in the Diet, the prime minister stated: Most of the people already understand the need to change the current demarcation of constituencies. The present situation is somewhat different from that of five or six years ago. A certain period of time is needed to make the people understand the new electoral system. While speaking with Japanese correspondents, the prime minister stressed he will call on the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to return to the coalition to secure a majority in the Diet, stating: I intend to seek cooperation from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] on our policies, and I cannot deny the possibility of creating a new framework as a result of policy cooperation with the LDP. The realignment of political parties is under way, and there is a possibility a grand coalition will be formed in the future. [passage omitted on Hata's itinerary in Italy]
