FR940318-0-00247 FR940318-0-00024 IV. Response to Comments EPA received comments to the proposed rule covering a broad range of subjects and concerns relating to the proficiency programs, the fees proposed and the impact of the fees on various segments of the industry. Comments also focused on the effects of fees on the availability of quality radon services to consumers. The following section summarizes the major comments received and discusses the changes, where applicable, in the final rule in response to those comments. A. Industry Impacts 1. Impact of Fees on Demand for Radon Services Most of the comments received focused on the impact of fees on the radon industry. Comments suggested that all government-imposed fees will likely be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices for services, thus leading to a decrease in radon testing and mitigation. These comments suggested that a decrease in the number of tests and mitigations will undermine the Agency's desired goal of reducing radon-related health risks. Response: The Agency recognizes that all or some of the costs to firms of radon user fees may be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for radon services. However, since firms would spread out the costs of compliance across the total number of measurements, any potential increases in service costs are likely to be only a small portion of the total costs of the service. Further, as a result of comments received on the proposed rule and EPA's analysis of the economic impacts of the fees, this final rule establishes fees for the RMP program that are significantly lower than those in the proposed rule. EPA does not believe that the imposition of the user fees in this final rule will have a significant deleterious effect on the number of radon tests or mitigations conducted. 2. Impact of Fees on Participation Several comments indicated that imposing fees will reduce participation in EPA's voluntary proficiency programs. Some comments suggested that the proposed fee structure would lead to a greater reduction in participation than predicted in the economic analysis prepared for the proposed rule. Several comments suggested that organizations will only participate in the RMP program with one device to minimize their fees, although they will continue to provide measurement services with a number of devices. Comments further suggested that firms might continue to provide radon services without the benefit of an EPA listing. Still other comments suggested that the proposed fees would lead them to discontinue their radon business altogether. Response: EPA is sensitive to the concern that user fees could reduce participation in its proficiency programs. The Agency conducted additional economic analyses in the development of this final rule to address this concern. As a result of its analysis, EPA has selected a fee level substantially lower than the proposed rule so as not to discourage participation in the program. Drop off rates for participation in the RMP program are predicted to range between 10 and 15% for the final rule in contrast to the drop off rates with the proposed rule of between 25 and 50%. While the Agency cannot directly address the potential for an organization to misrepresent the number or types of RMP-listed devices it offers, EPA will take a strong role in working with the States to communicate to consumers the importance of verifying an organization's listing status before using its services. EPA will certainly take action to delist an organization if the Agency confirms a case of misrepresentation. State certification programs provide consumers further assurance that the services they use are RMP listed or have met equivalent standards as outlined in the Strategy on Federal/State Cooperation for Radon Certification Program Development, EPA 22A&hyph;5000, January 1992. 3. Device Bias Comments suggested that the fees will drive firms away from the electret measurement method and toward other less accurate devices. Many organizations provide primary services with different types of electret devices (e.g., short-term, long-term, etc.). These comments expressed concern that the device-specific fees included in the proposed rule would provide an incentive for them to switch to participation with a single charcoal canister device in order to reduce their fee. Response: The Agency evaluates participants in the RMP program with each device type separately to ensure that they are capable of making accurate measurements with that specific device. EPA's costs to process a primary device through the RMP program are similar, regardless of whether electret or charcoal canister devices are used. Furthermore, the reduced fees being promulgated in this final rule will probably minimize any potential incentives to switch devices as a result of the imposition of fees. The Agency is currently reviewing the way it evaluates electret and other devices that are used to provide measurement services to the home. If this review yields changes in the RMP program and thus, in its costs, EPA will reconsider its fee structure. With regard to variations in device accuracy, all devices that have met the requirements of EPA's RMP program are capable of accurately measuring radon and/or its decay products. Both charcoal canister and electret measurement devices have been used successfully in the RMP program on numerous occasions. 4. Private Sector Certification Some comments suggested that the imposition of fees on the radon industry will provide an incentive for private trade associations to develop their own certification and accreditation programs with potentially lower standards than EPA's RMP and RCP programs. These comments further suggest that organizations will be driven away from EPA's proficiency programs in favor of private sector certification or accreditation programs. This approach was supported by comments identifying other industries that successfully self-certify and test themselves. Response: Private sector certification programs do not currently exist within the radon industry. There is reason to believe that even in States where an EPA listing is not required, firms will gain a benefit from participating in the EPA programs due to the public service messages and guidance documents which suggest that consumers look for the EPA-listed firm or individual when deciding on radon measurements or mitigations. However, if the private sector were to develop a self-certification program, the Agency would support industry efforts to establish requirements that supplement and re-enforce existing Federal and State quality assurance programs. B. Fairness Issues 1. State and Local Government Exemption for Fees Comments suggested that government and private sectors should pay equal fees. The comments suggested that exempted government agencies will use the subsidized proficiency program participation to take business away from the private sector.
