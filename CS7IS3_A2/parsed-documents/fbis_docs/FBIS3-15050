Kiselev begins his report by saying that a plan for restructuring the presidential staff was submitted to Yeltsin and, according to Kiselev, was approved by the president on 18 February. Rumor has it that two conflicting plans were drawn up by Filatov and by Ilyushin, Kiselev say. Did this mean that the presidential entourage was split into two conflicting groupings led by these two people? The joint interview by Filatov and Ilyushin was given specially to clarify the situation. Kiselev asks them which of their two plans Yeltsin had given preference to. Filatov says: "We have a joint, agreed version on which we worked together. We are in fact continuing to form the presidential administration -- a process started last year. It has two aspects. The president's aides are in charge of one aspect that involves day-to-day organization of work and operational assistance. The other is the bureaucratic aspect that deals with the purely administrative facilities for implementing this work." When Kiselev asks again whose plan Yeltsin had chosen, Ilyushin answers: "I would like to say that there is only one leader in the administration, Sergey Aleksandrovich Filatov. I would like to stress that all presidential aides are members of the presidential administration, and that all structures within the administration are working for the president. It is simply that a certain part of it, the president's cabinet as we call it, or his aides, is working in a slightly closer contact with the president than some other structures." Filatov and Ilyushin both say there were no disagreements between them. Ilyushin then says: "An episode comes to my mind that occurred about a month ago. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin invited me to his office and asked: `Viktor Vasilyevich, is it true that you are preparing a plan for the presidential administration where the president's aides would play the decisive role in all organizational matters?' This question surprised me because there had been many different plans." Kiselev then asks if the current reorganization of the president's staff meant its expansion. Filatov says that the overall number of people employed in the administration will remain the same, about 2,000, including technical personnel. Ilyushin adds that the aides' department consisted of 38 people and that the aide for national security issues was soon to have his own staff. The conversation than switches to President Yeltsin's state of health. Kiselev asks if Yeltsin really had a severe cold or if there were political reasons behind his illness. Ilyushin replies: "I have known Boris Nikolayevich long enough to be able to say that he does not fall ill easily, but if it does happen, it takes him a long time to get over it. I think this is a typical feature of strong people. As for the present situation -- yes, he is a bit unwell but of course we must take his age into consideration, and anyway, if all invalids worked as he is working now, things would be moving much faster in Russia." Kiselev says that Yeltsin has a tendency to withdraw from public at times of serious crises and recalled several occasions from the past three years when this happened. Ilyushin disagrees: "True, our president sometimes reserves his judgment but eventually he always states his opinion. And it seems to me that he always does it at the right moment. It is characteristic of Boris Nikolayevich to know when it is the right time to state his views." Kiselev and Ilyushin then discuss the question whether Yeltsin's personal life should be in the focus of public attention as much as that of U.S. presidents. Ilyushin says it was a foreign tradition alien to Russia and moreover, that Yeltsin disliked being in the public eye. However, they agreed that he ought to be warned that a greater openness was expected of him. Filatov says: "Such matters usually get whipped up before some very serious political events. Apparently, preparations for another period of tension and confrontation are under way. God save us from this," to which Kiselev replies: "Well, in that case a greater openness to the press on the part of the president could knock the trump cards from the hands of his opponents."
