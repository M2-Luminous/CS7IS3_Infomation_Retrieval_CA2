Good day. [Arrieta] Good morning, Dario. How are you? [Arizmendi] In the last few hours you reiterated the thesis you maintained in Congress during discussion of the new Penal Procedure Code, in the sense the approved provisions were going to create confusion, ambiguity, and would lend themselves to criticism from national and international public opinion. Have your statements been corroborated in practice? [Arrieta] You know the Attorney General's Office has maintained a position in this regard for a long time. We believe if this country wants to develop a serious and coherent criminal policy on the drug struggle, it must have solid and strong regulations that permit it to advance in this matter. I think this does not exist. The Attorney General's Office has stated on several occasions the Penal Code is weak and does not establish appropriate sentences for drug trafficking crimes, and the Penal Procedure Code is a confused and profuse regulation. It does not establish clear procedures, and if it is handled inappropriately, it could lead to impunity. [Arizmendi] What would have to be done to strengthen this Penal Code and establish appropriate sentences to avoid what is happening? [Arrieta] I believe the country must definitely undertake an integral project to reform the Penal Code and the Penal Procedure Code. I am not aiming at a large project to modify all the provisions, but coherent legislation should be issued regarding drug trafficking. Something very worrisome is taking place. As violence increased during the last six or seven years, occasional legislative reactions have sprung up, and new and different provisions have been issued. A judge or attorney must now apply 60 or 70 different provisions concerning drug trafficking in order to understand the norm or applicable situation in a particular case; this creates confusion and does not produce the necessary clarity in dealing with this matter. Naturally, the country's problem is not related to regulations only, but it has many additional aspects. One of the first steps that would have to be taken is a definite integration, coherently and systematically, with existing legislation so as to tighten sentences and clarify procedures. [Arizmendi] A desire and unanimous decision by the various organizations would be required, namely, from the Justice Ministry, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Attorney General's Office; this agreement does not exist. [Arrieta] I think this requires an effort by all concerned organizations, not only the government, judiciary, or Attorney General's Office but also Congress, which is ultimately responsible for issuing the codes. I believe the gravity of the circumstances and the questioning of Colombia justify an unvarying and strong reaction from all Colombians to show that this country is not a narcodemocracy. We must demonstrate this is a country that is indeed ready to fight drug trafficking. [passage omitted] [Arizmendi] Colombia at this moment is in the eye of the U.S. media and many U.S. congressmen. The country is well aware of the letter exchanges between the Prosecutor General's Office and the U.S. attorney general, the response of the Colombian ambassador to THE WASHINGTON POST's [6 April] article by Senator Kerry. In sum, does this confusion and confrontation originate in the verbal recklessness of the prosecutor or existing regulations? [Arrieta] I think there are many factors that come into play here. I think we are facing a problem that has evolved for no reason. From basic discussions on legalization issues we have gone to such expressions as narcodemocracy or the questioning of Colombian justice. I think this is the right time to end this. I do not know what is the cause and cannot offer a specific solution. The cause may be a combination of the factors you mentioned. The absolute truth is I, as attorney general and a Colombian citizen, cannot allow this to continue. We have reached such harsh terms as the ones we have seen in recent days without any justification. The [word indistinct] has snowballed into such dimensions I believe we must put a definitive end to this, because this is affecting not only the functioning of Colombian institutions but relations with the United States. This may have more serious effects we cannot foresee at this moment. Our responsibility is to end this problem. We must not act separately, but we must act in a coordinated manner. [Arizmendi] How can we end this problem, and how can we act in a coordinated manner? Who is the one out of line? [Arrieta] I told you earlier I will issue a communique today on that issue. In it, we will adopt a position on this matter. We will provide a complete picture of what has happened, but at this moment I believe it is fundamental for us to make an effort so that the situation will not continue to intensify and does not affect all Colombians. [passage omitted] [Arizmendi] Mr. Attorney General, turning to another topic, and going back somewhat to what we were talking about at the beginning of our conversation, you said on television last night that at this time you do not think the conditions or circumstances exist for new surrenders of Cali Cartel drug traffickers. On what basis did you make this statement? [Arrieta] I think what we discussed a short while ago sufficiently supports this. I do not think the conditions exist at this specific time. The environment is not the appropriate one. There is a great distrust and prejudice; there is great concern about the whole topic. I think the most important thing is to calm the waters again, to have the authorities sit down and agree on policy and then proceed with the surrender to justice program. In these days, at this particular moment, I think the atmosphere is too heated to make a surrender to justice process feasible. I am not setting a time limit; this might be solved in eight, 10, 15 days or in one or two months. What I have always said is that the surrender to justice policy is important for the country. It is useful. I think that as Colombians we should try to move forward with it, with clear and firm rules, but as circumstances stand at this time, with the level of debates taking place both nationally and internationally, I think there should be at least a halt, a temporary halt, which might last a few days or somewhat longer, according to [words indistinct]. [Arizmendi] In other words, we might say the attorney general is proposing the process of surrender to justice by the drug traffickers be frozen until there is an agreement, juridical or political, to make the sentences against these drug traffickers harsher or more rigorous? [Arrieta] I cannot propose that it be frozen, among other things, simply because the legal provisions exist and they establish the possibilities of surrender; therefore, if tomorrow an individual presents himself before a prosecutor or judge of the country, there is no other alternative but to receive him. What I think is that regarding a broad case, such as that of the Cali Cartel, which has political and juridical [word indistinct] and which requires full coordination among all the authorities, I do not think it would be appropriate to advance with this process until we reach agreement on all the parameters under which we should act. As soon as that occurs, something which might be done very rapidly, then we could--if this is what is desired--continue with that process. At this time, at a time of debate, when the atmosphere is heated, and when positions are not entirely clear, I think, however, it would not be appropriate, because the country would simply not understand it, precisely because of the prevailing climate of distrust and confusion. [Arizmendi] You said the legal provisions exist, evidently in the Penal Code and the Penal Procedures Code. You also said in the past the surrender to justice policy has ended, replaced by the codes. If the sentences are evidently so minimal, ridiculous, and short as certain U.S. authorities assert, one might then think this is exactly the best time for the Cali Cartel drug traffickers to surrender massively before the codes are reformed and made harsher. [Arrieta] Of course, of course. That is the position they [not further identified] might want. I think our position, as a state, is precisely to try to design all the mechanisms so there will be a surrender process, but one that will not create any feeling of impunity under any viewpoint. Of course, what you mentioned is part of the dilemma that always arises. On the one hand, there are a number of people who want to take advantage of the law for their own benefit; this is inevitable and is the reason why lawyers, procedures, and legal provisions exist. On the other hand, there is the state, which has the responsibility to fulfill its social function and to ensure those legal provisions are applied the best way possible. What I am suggesting is that there be a review of the overall reform of the legal provisions so that we can have a Penal Code, procedural provisions, and a surrender to justice policy which are clear and which do not produce any kind of impunity. [passage omitted] [Arizmendi] Why is the prosecutor general the only one taking all the flak when all he is really doing is interpreting and applying code provisions. In Congress you courageously warned the country about what was coming, and unfortunately time has shown you were right. But the prosecutor general was not the one who drew up the codes. It was Congress, and in Congress Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez even changed the meaning of certain bills, and he defended what was finally approved in Congress. Now the prosecutor general is the one being criticized when the government was also involved in what was finally approved. The government signed the law. [Arrieta] I think one has to put this issue back into perspective. If one looks at what has been taking place in the past two or three months, there have not really been new actions in the application of the Penal and Penal Procedures Codes. There has been debate, and it has been growing, but only based on topics that are not directly linked to the Penal Procedures Code, such as the issue of legalization and the issue of whether the struggle against drug trafficking has worked. All of this has led us to a debate what not only involves thinking about aspects of policy but also aspects of norms. I agree with you in part that a portion of the problem is not only caused by isolated actions but also by the very existence of legal provisions which are not clear and are inappropriate; therefore, what we propose is that we halt a debate that is not taking us anywhere. With the increase in crime, what we Colombians must do is form a barrier, a united front, with everyone confronting the problem. Facing the problem entails a review of legal provisions to resolve all those vacuums, all those weaknesses that might exist in the codes. It entails acting in a coordinated way, because it is a problem of national interest, which not only involves one institution but all Colombians. [Arizmendi] Lastly, Mr. Attorney General, and thank you for your willingness to speak with Caracol network so extensively about such relevant topics, I would like to know whether the Attorney General's Office knows the names of the infiltrator in the Prosecutor General's Office, who the State Department says belongs to the Cali Cartel, and four high-ranking government officials, who the State Department said last night also work for the Cali Cartel? [Arrieta] I want to make a comment regarding the question. In the State Department report, it is said the Colombian Government is studying the fourth-ranking person in the office of what they call the Attorney General [preceding two words in English]. The Americans make a distinction between the office of the Attorney General [preceding two words in English], which is the Attorney General's Office [Procuraduria General de la Nacion], and the office of the Prosecutor General [preceding two words in English], which is the Prosecutor General's Office [Fiscal General de la Nacion]. When they said the fourth-ranking person in the office of the Attorney General [preceding two words in English] was being investigated, they were referring to what they called the fourth-ranking person in the Attorney General's Office. It is a case that for us has been extremely mortifying and painful. It is the case of Dr. (Guillermo Villa). They were not referring to a person in the Prosecutor General's Office but to a person in the Attorney General's Office. It is a case that is well known and has been sufficiently debated by public opinion. I think it is important that this be clarified, because shadows of doubt should not be cast over other people. Regarding the other four people who might be investigated, I do not have information about them. [Arizmendi] In the case of Dr. (Guillermo Villa Alzate), who you just mentioned, what is happening? [Arrieta] I think the process is about to conclude. The final phases of the evidence period are being carried out, and, as far as the Attorney General's Office is concerned, I hope that in the course of the next few weeks, at the latest in one or two months, a definitive decision is going to be made.
