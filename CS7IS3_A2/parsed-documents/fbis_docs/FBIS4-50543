Because China's raw materials and labor are inexpensive, the costs of its export goods are accordingly low. Chief Zhang Yuqing also disclosed that the practice of certain foreign-trade businesses which compete to sell goods by cutting prices have seriously hurt the overall interests and [word indistinct] of China's exports. Here is a report filed yesterday by station reporter Ji Yuping: [Begin recording] [Ji] The market economy is an economy based on the law. While this seems easy to understand, it is not so simple in practice. Zhang Yuqing, an official of the MOFTEC's Treaty and Law Department, maintains that many Chinese export businesses, in knowing very little about the trade laws of European countries and the United States, have been selling their goods by cutting prices unrealistically. When they are fined, they still do not know what they have done wrong. [Zhang] Many factories and trade companies do not know that dumping is not permitted abroad. They do not understand why it is wrong to sell their goods very cheaply. They ask: Is it a mistake to sell our goods cheaply and that shoppers have benefited from low prices? They do not know that this is wrong. While the importing countries cannot stop our increasing exports, all they can do is label it as dumping and fight it accordingly. [Ji] Most of the countries in the West are GATT members. According to GATT regulations, GATT members cannot control imports by increasing tariffs or the amount of required licenses, but they are allowed to fight dumping. According to statistics, in 1993 there were 37 cases in which foreign countries accused China of dumping. A large percentage of such goods are machinery, electronics goods, and textile products -- sectors which China has given priority to developing. Antidumping has seriously affected the growth of Chinese exports. According to Zhang Yuqing, when Chinese businesses in U.S. and European markets are accused of dumping, they often do not know what to do. Instead of contesting the charge, some simply withdraw from the markets. More often than not, antidumping accusations have side effects. They often hurt other Chinese businesses which operate according to regulations. [Zhang] Ordinarily when we deal with an international trade dispute, we follow the rule that whoever violates the contract should bear the responsibilities. Rules for combating dumping are not identical. For example, once we have been accused of selling cups at dumping prices, other exporters which have never exported any cups will still be subjected to antidumping tariffs for many years when they want to export cups. [Ji] In other words, when one business sells products inexpensively, it will also hurt many other exporters. In short, Chinese enterprises, both large and small, have very little understanding of European countries' and U.S. antidumping laws. It has been reported that once a Chinese business has been accused of dumping its goods in the United States, Japan and EC countries will also resort to the same sanctions measures, and the markets for Chinese exports thus will become smaller. MOFTEC data shows that some countries have time and again investigated whether China was dumping its traditional goods -- such as silicon carbide, bicycles, shoes -- in those countries; that antidumping tariffs have been imposed on these products; and that certain markets for China's export goods have been lost. The MOFTEC official maintains that antidumping will become a major international trade issue in the future and that Chinese exporting businesses must do several things. First, they must thoroughly study relevant international regulations and rules. Second, they must stop competing between themselves by cutting prices. Third, they must export goods of a higher grade and better quality -- goods that they can sell profitably. [end recording]
