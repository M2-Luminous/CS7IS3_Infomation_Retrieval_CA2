FR940930-2-00245 FR940930-2-00085 A. Sponsor Responsibilities Pursuant to Executive Order 12138 of May 18, 1979, 3 CFR, 1979 Comp., p. 393, as amended, and Executive Order 12432 of July 14, 1983, 3 CFR, 1983 Comp., p. 198, GNMA anticipates meaningful participation by minority and women-owned businesses (``MWOBs'') and minority and women-owned law firms (``MWOLFs'') in the GNMA multiclass securities program. Sponsors are required to develop and implement a plan that sets goals for meaningful participation by MWOBs as Co-sponsors. Also, Sponsors are required to ensure that the trust counsel they engage for transactions develop and implement a plan that sets goals for meaningful participation by MWOLFs. 1. Co-sponsor Participation GNMA considers meaningful participation for MWOB Co-sponsors to be the use of one of the following two options. Sponsors may increase the level of participation by Co-sponsors. a. Best Efforts Option. Under the Best Efforts Option, the Co-sponsor is provided the opportunity to sell at least 10 percent of the transaction, computed on the basis of the original principal balance, for a 24-hour period, prior to the Sponsor's or other's marketing of the allocated percentage of the transaction. b. Underwriting Option. Under the Underwriting Option, the Co-sponsor is provided the opportunity to acquire, at the option of the Co-sponsor, at least 10 percent of the transaction, at prices negotiated between the Sponsor and the Co-sponsor. In addition to the sales price, and in lieu of a schedule of discounts, the Sponsor pays the Co-sponsor an amount equal to 1/8th of 1 percent of the principal amount purchased. 2. Trust Counsel Participation GNMA considers meaningful participation of MWOLFs to be at least ten percent of the billing for the work completed for each transaction. B. Minority and Women-Owned Businesses as Sponsors GNMA encourages MWOBs to become Sponsors, either individually or as joint venturers, by providing a 15 percent reduction in the GNMA guaranty fee for transactions closed and securities sold solely by MWOB Sponsors and Co-sponsors. C. Certification Sponsors are required to provide GNMA with two annual certifications: 1. With respect to Co-sponsors: a. Certification that the Sponsor has developed and implemented a plan that sets goals for meaningful participation by Co-sponsors, and b. Certification of the extent to which MWOBs have been participants in the Sponsor's transactions as Co-sponsors. 2. With respect to Co-trust Counsel: a. Certification from trust counsel used for transactions by the Sponsor that the trust counsel has developed and implemented a plan that sets goals for meaningful participation by MWOLFs, and b. Certification from such trust counsel of the extent to which MWOLFs have been participants in the transactions for the Sponsor.
