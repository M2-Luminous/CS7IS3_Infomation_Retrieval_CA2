(SHP), is getting increasingly impatient these days with the Seoul government's ban on laser printer imports. Toppel feels that it is time the Korean government lifted the ban as it is staging a campaign to make the nation "the world's most convenient place to do business in." "I hear that the government is seeking to globalize its economy. Then, it should begin with allowing foreign firms operating in Korea to compete with local firms on an equal footing," Toppel asserted. The ban, according to Toppel, is forcing SHP to compete with local firms "with its hands tied." Toppel's firm, a 10-year-old joint venture between Samsung Electronics and Hewlett-Packard (HP) of the United States, is in a dominant position in the domestic printer market. Backed by HP, the world's unrivaled printer powerhouse, SHP enjoys a more than 40 percent share of the total domestic demand valued at about $360 million last year. SHP's market share is expected to shoot up further as demand is rapidly shifting from old-fashioned dot matrix printers to more sophisticated ink-jet products, currently the firm's mainstay. What makes Toppel uncomfortable, however, is the fact that a local printer maker, Samsung Electronics, has recently launched an attack against its ink-jet printers with self-developed laser printers. Samsung has recently announced a 42 percent price cut on its low-end laser model, making it clear that its target is ink-jet printers, which are mostly imported from abroad. Last year, Samsung exported some 100,000 units of the model, a fact indicating that the firm has secured some competitiveness in the low-end segment of the world laser printer market. "Under this situation, it is unfair that we still cannot compete with Samsung with the same laser printers, not ink-jet printers," Toppel said. Toppel's point cannot be refuted. But to government officials, policy priority still lies not with creating an environment for equal competition but with fostering the domestic laser printer industry. Officials at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) said that they still have no plan to open the laser printer market. "We think the need still exists for us to foster the domestic laser printer industry," a MOTIE official said, adding that as laser printer technology is important, the import ban will stay for a "considerably long" period of time. Toppel argued that Korea will have more to gain than lose by opening the market. For one thing, it will stimulate efforts on the part of Korean printer makers to upgrade their technology and sharpen competitiveness. At the moment, Samsung is the only domestic firm which is mass producing laser printers. Although Samsung may be competitive in the low-end segment, it is still not in fighting shape in the high-end market. The same is true of Goldstar Co. which, following Samsung, is seeking to explore overseas markets. According to company officials, they are ready to introduce a low-end laser printer model in the latter half of this year for both domestic and foreign markets. The new model, they said, will be competitive in the international market in terms of both price and quality. But they admitted that other models they are producing now are not as competitive as the planned new one. This may imply that it is still too early for the government to open the laser printer market entirely. It may instead open the market on a step-by-step basis, which will not only stimulate catch-up efforts by domestic products but also diffuse pressure for market opening from foreign firms. Toppel expects the market will open in due course. At the same time, he wants to see the import ban lifted soon. But the SHP president emphasized that he will not loudly call for a removal of the ban. SHP, he noted, has been very cooperative with the Korean government while being a respectable corporate citizen in the Korean business community.
