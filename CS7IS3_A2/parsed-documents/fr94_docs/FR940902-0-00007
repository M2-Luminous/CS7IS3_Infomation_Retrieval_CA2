FR940902-0-00007 FR940902-0-00002 SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION 13 CFR Part 121 Small Business Size Regulations AGENCY: Small Business Administration. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Small Business Administration (SBA) amends its regulations governing who will decide appeals of formal size determinations and appeals of Standard Industrial Classification code designations authorized under its regulations. Instead of a three-judge panel at SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), these appeals will now be decided by a single administrative judge at OHA. DATES: Effective Date : This rule is effective as of September 2, 1994. Applicability Date : Any size or Standard Industrial Classification code appeal that has not been decided by a three judge panel as of September 2, 1994 shall be assigned to a single administrative judge for decision. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to John H. Barnett, Assistant Administrator for Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 3rd Street SW., Washington, DC 20416. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John W. Klein, Chief Counsel for Special Programs, Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Small Business Administration, (202) 205&hyph;6645. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: SBA is committed to enhancing its delivery of services to the small business community which it serves. SBA is in the process of changing its structure to move resources to SBA's various district offices to better serve small businesses. This restructuring includes SBA's OHA, which has lost several administrative judges to other offices within SBA or to retirement. Currently, SBA's size regulations authorize a three-judge panel within OHA to decide appeals of formal size determinations and appeals of Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code designations assigned to certain Government contracts. The assignment of a three judge panel to hear and decide these appeals is no longer feasible with the reduction in the number of judges at OHA. This final regulation will change the requirement that a three-judge panel decide size and SIC code appeals to a single administrative judge. It will also change other references to such a ``panel'' in 13 CFR 121.1701 through 121.1722 to an administrative judge or the Presiding Judge instead. Because this provision is a procedural rule, it is adopted as a final rule without the necessity of a proposed rule and an opportunity for public comment. Compliance With Executive Orders 12612, 12778, and 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.), and the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Ch. 35) SBA certifies that this final rule will not be considered a significant rule within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 and will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq . This rule merely changes who will resolve size and SIC code appeals under SBA's regulations. It does not otherwise affect these appeals, and has no bearing on the number of appeals brought or the contracting actions underlying the appeals. It will have no effect on the amount or dollar value of any Government contract requirement or the number of requirements that are subject to SBA's size and SIC code regulations. As such, it is not likely to have an annual economic effect of $100 million or more, result in a major increase in costs or prices, or have a significant adverse effect on competition or the United States economy. For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Ch. 35, SBA certifies that this final rule contains no new reporting or recordkeeping requirements. For purposes of Executive Order 12612, SBA certifies that this rule does not have any federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For purposes of Executive Order 12778, SBA certifies that this rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 2 of that Order.
