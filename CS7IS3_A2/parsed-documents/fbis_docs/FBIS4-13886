The plan was part of a new regional spread for Iraqi intelligence. The sources said that the intelligence deputy chief, who is the Iraqi president's cousin, received an order from Saddam Husayn to watch al-Suhayl's movements once he is notified by the Iraqi Embassy in Lebanon of al-Suhayl's presence in Beirut, and to draw up a plan to assassinate him, whatever the political and diplomatic consequences. The intention was to use some Palestinian agents linked to Iraqi organs in Lebanon, but the speed with which the Iraqi president's order was issued prompted reliance on Iraqi intelligence elements who have diplomatic capacities. Iraqi intelligence elements had been watching al-Suhayl's movements for nine months, since the uncovering of an attempt to overthrow the regime in Baghdad. [passage omitted] The sources believe that al-Suhayl's assassination is a message to Jordanian authorities on the one hand and Lebanese authorities and the Syrian Government on the other. Al-Suhayl had enjoyed Jordan's protection since 1970. He left Jordan after receiving murder threats from Iraqi intelligence. The Iraqi Government wanted also to ridicule the Lebanese authorities' attempts to restore security to Lebanon in cooperation with the Syrian Government. Its intention was to carry out an operation such that it would be difficult to uncover Iraqi diplomats' implication in it. But chance and mistakes in implementation led to the exposure of Iraqi organs' implication in this operation. [passage omitted] The sources revealed that their information from inside Iraqi organs confirms that al-Suhayl's assassination is the start of a large-scale plan which exploits the relaxation in relations between Iraq and a number of states and the increase in the number of Iraqi diplomats present in diplomatic capacities primarily in Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar, Yemen, Tunisia, Turkey, Morocco, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Russia, France, and Italy. The number of these has doubled over the past year. Diplomatic missions have been supplied with elements from the intelligence and the special security organ or relatives of the Iraqi president, as is the case in Jordan, Yemen, Italy, Turkey, Libya, Morocco, Qatar, Sudan, and the Iraqi mission in Cairo. The sources revealed that the planned assassination operations in Lebanon include the targeting of the embassies of a number of states hostile to Iraq. There is also coordination in Jordan to carry out similar operations in cooperation with pro-Iraqi Palestinian organizations, in addition to planning kidnapping operations using Iraqi embassy cars, which enjoy diplomatic immunity at land border points. The sources said that the Iraqi Airlines and trade missions have accommodated a number of intelligence officers posing as technicians and commercial employees, as is the case in Tunisia, Mauritania, and Jordan. In Jordan, the Land Transporation Company, the Iraqi Trade Coordination Establishment in al-'Aqabah, and the Trade Section in Amman are used to this end. The sources believe that part of the political and military onslaught which the Iraqi president has been threatening since Ramadan [February/March] is devoted to the assassination of Iraqi oppositionists and diplomats belonging to states that have no relations with the Iraqi Government at present -- Arab and foreign states. The sources confirmed that they obtained their information from elements working in Iraqi organs and Iraqi embassies abroad. They declined to reveal another aspect of their information at present for practical and security reasons.
