Introduction Attempts to use ceramics as high-temperature structural materials were accelerated by the oil crises of the 1970s. Government projects in the United States and West Germany began one after the other with the goal of developing a ceramic gas turbine engine. In Japan as well, the Fine Ceramics Project was initiated in 1981 under the system of R&D Projects of Basic Technologies for Future Industries in order to establish R&D technology for the manufacture and processing, evaluation, design, and use of silicon nitride and silicon carbide ceramics. Although projects overseas placed their emphasis on the development of systems, the major feature of the project in Japan was that its chief objective was material development. We clearly remember that this not only had a major impact on foreign R&D thereafter, but it was also the impetus behind the development of ceramic fibers in Japan. In March 1993, after 12 years, R&D on the Fine Ceramics Project drew to a close. During the course of this project steady advances were made in technical development of ceramics for structural use. Material properties were dramatically improved through advances in the development of highly pure raw material powders, forming and sintering technology, and technology for controlling the microstructure of sintered bodies. For example, silicon nitride material was realized with a compressive strength surpassing 1 GPa or fracture toughness surpassing 10 MPa m[.sup]1/2[/]. Moreover, Weibull strength coefficients greater than 20 have become commonplace. Recently, however, it has become clear that we are facing energy and environmental problems on a global scale, and when we look at prospects for technological development in the 21st Century, the most important challenge we will face is the transition from the environmentally destructive technologies of the past and their consumption of mass quantities of natural resources to sophisticated, energy-saving, clean technologies of the future that will enable the conservation and effective utilization of natural resources. The materials used in these new systems must be especially safe and reliable, both in terms of thermal and mechanical properties and in terms of functionality, under much harsher environments than in the past. We believe previous methods of developing ceramics, which mostly set out to enhance a single function, are severely limited if we are to satisfy these high-level demands on materials in terms of mechanical and other functions. Several years ago, after considerable discussion Japan's universities, national research institutes and ceramics-related companies decided to pursue a new concept in materials development that would enable researchers to create multiple functions in the same material. Thus, preliminary research on ``Hierarchical Structure Controlled Fused Inorganic Materials'' was initiated under the system of R&D Projects of Basic Technologies for Future Industries to study the potential for creating future projects through experimental verification of this new concept of Hierarchical Structure Control. In this article we will introduce this concept and details of research, as well as discuss the direction of research projects in the future. 2. Structure Control of Ceramics 2.1 Classification of Structure We can say that all materials, not just ceramics, have something in common: their unique functions (properties) are intimately related to their structures (organization). Therefore, we can say that the true course of materials development research is to express stable functions and new functions as well by meticulously controlling the structure of the material. Therefore, we will begin our discussion with the question of how to look at the structure of ceramics. Generally when we think about the structure of inorganic materials like ceramics, we consider electron orbitals, chemical bonds, crystal structure, lattice defects, particle boundaries, dispersed particles, porosity, fibers, crystal grains, layers, and so on. These are referred to as structural elements. To actually describe material structure, it is necessary to talk about the state of these structural elements. However, the methods of expression are quite varied, depending on the structural elements themselves and on the researchers, so definitive descriptions are not easily obtained. Therefore, one method we can employ for clarity is to classify the structural elements using a kind of measuring scale; in other words, to arrange the structural elements in a hierarchy. Figure 1 shows one way of classifying structures in ceramics and their control methods. As ways of classifying the structural elements (arranging them in a hierarchy) we have chosen size, shape, distribution, arrangement, and orientation. We believe the easiest measure to understand in this hierarchical arrangement of material structure is size. However, when it comes to the problem of ``controlling ceramics structure,'' elements of electron theory such as electron orbitals and chemical bonds do not come into play. Therefore, when we look at ceramics structure in terms of control and what is controllable, we are dealing with the atomic/molecular level or larger. As a result, we decided to classify size into four levels or hierarchies--(1) ultra-ultra-micro, (2) ultra-micro, (3) micro, and (4) macro--to clarify structure. In this diagram we have expressed schematically which levels the various structural elements belong to. We have also placed the various structure control methods on the levels at which they are mainly performed, and we have indicated with arrows where the other measures such as shape and distribution must be taken into account in the size hierarchy. Figure 1. Classification of Ceramics Structure and Control 2.2 Structure Control in the Past Let us look at previous types of ceramics from the standpoint of structure control. First, in the case of single unit (monolithic) ceramics for structural use, we have been able to create sophisticated materials with quite uniform crystal grain microstructures at the micro level by experimenting with sintering conditions and minute amounts of additives. Moreover, research has been conducted recently on composite ceramics using dispersed particles, whiskers and long fibers, and we are discovering that these are promising materials in terms of strength and toughness. In the case of functional ceramics, structural control such as expression of functions inherent in the characteristic crystal and electron structures of materials, and control of grain boundary structure is being performed on a lower hierarchical level than with structural materials. Regardless of whether they are structural or functional, however, we can say that with previous types of ceramics we have mainly controlled structure on a single level. The outstanding feature of structure control on a single level is that a specific function can be expressed to the greatest extent possible. Structure control on a single level is limited, however, because it is extremely difficult to express multiple functions simultaneously. Materials that can withstand use in harsh environments must be heat resistant, corrosion resistant, and strong, as well as reliable and durable. Furthermore, these properties must all be in balance (harmony). It is extremely difficult to obtain both balance and high-level properties with structure control at a single level, so to overcome this we must perform structure control across multiple levels simultaneously. 3. Hierarchical Structure Control 3.1 Concept If we attempt to describe hierarchical structure control as simply as possible, we can say that it is ``controlling the structures (structural elements) at two or more levels in the same material.'' Figure 2 shows an example of hierarchical structure control. Here, if we describe the desired structure control beginning with the level of greatest size, the material's interior is reinforced by short fibers (orientation is also controlled) and long fibers, and a structure control layer is formed on the surface of the material (micro-/macro-level). In addition, particles are dispersed at the matrix grain boundaries and within the grains (ultra-ultra-micro level), and distribution control on the atomic level (ultra-ultra-micro level) is carried out in the matrix. Figure 2. Model of Hierarchical Structure Control We will explain functions that are expressed by hierarchical structure control using the schematic drawing in Figure 3. If we look at strength and toughness as examples, because structural uniformity is required to increase strength, and structural non-uniformity is required to increase toughness, it has been very difficult to obtain both of these properties using the single level structure control of the past. Recently, however, a control technique called nanocomposite has been created in which nanoparticles are dispersed inside microparticles as in (b). Related research has begun on techniques to control crystal grain orientation as in (a). As a result, the possibility has emerged for a material like (d) that is both strong and tough through hierarchical structure control that is performed by employing these two control techniques simultaneously. In addition, it will also be possible to realize mechanical and other properties at the same time. For example, we can express magnetic properties as in (c) by structure control on the ultra-ultra-micro level. With past methods in which magnetic particles were dispersed that were the same size or larger than the matrix particles, strength dropped considerably (due to increase in defect size). However, if we use the control technique of nanoparticle dispersion as in (b), we can expect a very strong, magnetic material with a structure like (e). Figure 3 Schematic Diagram of Hierarchical Structure 3.2 Examples of Hierarchical Structure Control Research Recently, there have been several examples of research conducted both in Japan and overseas that could be called the beginnings of hierarchical structure control. Here we would like to show some examples of the preliminary research mentioned above. Figure 4 shows an example of a material using Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], a typical oxide ceramic, as a base. When highly pure alumina is sintered, a material is obtained with the fine, uniform structure shown in (a). As shown in (c), for alumina this sintered body is very strong, but it has a low fracture toughness. On the other hand, structure control can be performed to obtain the material shown in (b) by adding a trace amount of SiO[.sub]2[/] (ultra-ultra-micro level) to highly pure alumina under a gel-sol process and growing the Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] grains in plates while precipitating La[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-11Al[.sub]2[/]O3 (micro level) in the plate phase at the same time. As a result, a material that is both very strong and very tough is obtained. Figure 4 Example of Hierarchical Structure Control of In previous Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] materials, those with microparticles were very strong but not very tough, whereas coarser materials were ordinarily very tough but not very strong. As shown in Figure 5, however, if we synthesize short, thick, rod-shaped monocrystalline _b_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] particles beforehand and add them in trace amounts, the sintered material has very small maximum defect dimensions, is very strong, and also has excellent toughness. Figure. 5 Example of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Figure 6 shows an example of SiC material. In the structure in (a), TiC grains were dispersed (micro level), and some of the dispersed Ti grains were replaced with W (ultra-micro level). As we can see from the comparison of the mechanical properties of various SiC-based materials shown in (b), with SiC-(Ti,W)C a harmony of mechanical properties is present that cannot be obtained in other materials. Figure 6 Example of Hierarchical Structure Control of SiC Naturally, these cases are results of initial or preliminary research on the concept of developing materials using hierarchical structure control. Unless we plan for wider-ranging, more sophisticated developments in the future in terms of structures and materials, material design must be based only on structure, function, or process. Below, we would like to consider the material design techniques where hierarchical structure control is likely to be most effective. First calculations that predict the crystal structure and basic properties of chemical compounds are important. More specifically, these are calculations from basic formulas on the atomic/molecular or electron level that use molecular dynamics, molecular orbital theory and so on. Moreover, when we investigate new or complex series of materials, there are many instances in which we cannot come up with an experimental phase diagram, so a technique to predict the experimental phase diagram is needed. As far as the synthetic process is concerned, there are also many phenomena on which it would be useful to conduct computation experiments. If we take the sintering process for example, this can be done with the process of cavity elimination, movement of particle boundaries, particle growth and so on. Figure 7 shows a multiple phase particle growth simulation by the Monte Carlo method that includes a single phase and particle dispersion. It clearly shows that particle growth is suppressed by particle dispersion. If these kinds of methods can be developed further, it will be possible to predict controls for particle arrangement, crystal orientation and so on. Simulation techniques are related as well to evaluation and analysis techniques, and they can be used to predict fracturing, deformation, environmental degradation and so on. In addition, it is possible to anticipate optimal material structures for various properties by the analysis of computational results. nnot> Figure 7. Monte Carlo Simulation of Particle Growth Needless to say, to make these prediction techniques effective for hierarchical structural control, we need holistic associations among the various simulation techniques and verification by model experiments. 4.2 Evaluation and Analysis Techniques Support technology for hierarchical structure control must be approached from the standpoint of evaluation techniques. What we need is not the evaluation techniques of the past that were created for evaluation in general, but evaluation and analysis techniques that are directly connected to materials development. One important initiative is a technique for evaluating and analyzing dynamic behavior and mechanisms such as fracturing and structure formation. In-situ evaluation techniques that can capture constantly changing structures or properties will be extremely effective as support technologies for hierarchical structure control. Another important initiative is evaluation and analysis technology that is closely related to material design. Figure 8 shows an example of such research. First, in (a) a material was designed in which the Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] matrix is reinforced by the SiC-series fibers, and at the same time, some of the fibers or matrix phase is replaced by an electrically conductive ceramic. In (b) we see the results of material when some of the fibers are replaced by graphite fibers, and in (c) we see results when part of the matrix is replaced by a Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]-TiN continuous phase. Thanks to the reinforcement by long fibers, we can see that these materials not only exhibit non-linear fracturing, but also a change in electrical resistance in response to localized fractures. More specifically, with the material in (c) we can detect a major change in electrical resistance at relatively early stages of deformation. By measuring the residual resistance in the material after adding and removing an electric charge, we can detect the extent of cumulative deformation (damage). Thus, the design and development of materials that are easy to evaluate or whose degradation behavior can be predicted and detected as needed will be very effective in improving the reliability of ceramics. The wide variety of properties of ceramics--electrical, magnetic, piezoelectric, dielectric, acoustic, optical, and chemical--can be widely utilized for detecting material fracturing, damage, wear, property degradation, corrosion by the environment and so on. Figure 8. Design and Evaluation of Fracture-Detection 5. Spread of Hierarchical Structure Control Techniques Compared with materials such as metals and polymers, ceramics have a diversity of bonding forms, crystal structures, microstructures and so on, so the functions that each substance or material exhibits are also quite diverse. With hierarchical structure controlled ceramics we can expect effects such as presence of multiple functions (coexistence), which is difficult to achieve with other materials, and mutual enhancement of functions (synergy). Therefore, we would like to use the expression ``synergy ceramics'' to describe the image of materials that have undergone hierarchical structure control (hierarchical structure controlled fused inorganic materials). In so doing, we include the idea that we would like to see more material development that breaks down previous barriers and boundaries between structural and functional materials. Figure 9 (not reproduced) is a conceptual drawing of the spread of synergy ceramics. Properties such as strength, toughness, heat resistance and the like are balanced with sophistication by hierarchical structure control. Moreover, materials that realize multiple functionality such as combined electromagnetic and chemical functions can be expected to find a wide range of applications in many fields. We can expect them to solve major energy and environmental problems as materials with the kind of high reliability not normally found in functional materials. 6. Conclusion Recent R&D in ceramics has developed a reputation both at home and abroad as having become rather lethargic. However, that does not alter the basic fact that ceramics hold tremendous potential as advanced materials. As is the case with all materials, in charting a course in ceramics material development it is important to consider diverse phenomena and events from new points of view and break new ground. The preliminary research to present experimental verification of the potential of hierarchical structure control draws to a close this year, and the ``Synergy Ceramics'' Project is scheduled to start anew in 1994. Based on the unique concept of hierarchical structure control, this will correspond to a national ceramics project involving the cooperation of industry, government and academia as we move toward the 21st Century. We must recognize once more the importance of the role Japan will play in the future. The details presented in this article are not necessarily complete and certainly will be widely discussed in the future. We welcome the opinions and comments of our coworkers in this field.
