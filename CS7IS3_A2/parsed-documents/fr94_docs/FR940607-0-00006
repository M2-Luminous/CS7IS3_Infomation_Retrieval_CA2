FR940607-0-00006 FR940607-0-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;226&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8926; AD 94&hyph;11&hyph;10] Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Industrie Model A300 Series Airplanes Equipped With BFGoodrich Evacuation Door Slides AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Airbus Model A300 series airplanes, that requires modification of certain evacuation door slides. This amendment is prompted by a report that, during flight crew training, the toe end of the slide lane tore. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent damage to the slide, which could render the slide unusable, contribute to injury of passengers on the slide, and delay or impede the evacuation of passengers during an emergency. DATES: Effective July 7, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from BFGoodrich Company, Aircraft Evacuation Systems, Sustaining Engineering, Department 7916, Phoenix, Arizona 85040. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew Gfrerer, Aerospace Engineer, Systems and Equipment Branch, ANM&hyph;131L, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California 90806&hyph;2425; telephone (310) 988&hyph;5338; fax (310) 988&hyph;5210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Industrie Model A300 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 5964). That action proposed to require modification of certain evacuation door slides. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the two comments received. Both commenters support the proposed rule. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. Currently there are no Airbus Industrie Model A300 series airplanes equipped with BFGoodrich evacuation door slides on the U.S. register. However, should an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, the FAA estimates that it will take approximately 6.2 work hours per slide to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be provided by BFGoodrich at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD would be $341 per slide. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .

Note 1: The requirements of this AD are not applicable to Airbus Model A310, A300&hyph;600, or A320 series airplanes. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent tearing of the toe end of the slide, which could render the slide unusable, contribute to injury of passengers on the slide, and could delay or impede the evacuation of passengers during an emergency, accomplish the following: (a) Within 3 months after the effective date of this AD, modify the evacuation door slides having P/N's 7A1299&hyph;001 and 7A1299&hyph;002, in accordance with BFGoodrich Alert Service Bulletin 7A1299&hyph;25A274, dated December 15, 1993. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), ANM&hyph;100L, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Los Angeles ACO. Note 2: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Los Angeles ACO. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (d) The modification shall be done in accordance with BFGoodrich Alert Service Bulletin 7A1299&hyph;25A274, dated December 15, 1993.
