This is a view shared by the chief representatives and managers of the Beijing offices of ROK's Daewoo, Hyundai, Lucky-Goldstar and Samsung corporations. In a recent interview with XINHUA before ROK President Kim Yong-sam's China visit, they said that the two countries are mutually supplementary in terms of natural resources, technology and economic structure. If the two sides can combine their advantages, their enterprises will develop rapidly. Chung Chae-kwan, chief representative of Hyundai Corporation's Beijing office, said that as the ROK and China are neighbors with a long history of culture exchanges and economic and trade contacts, there is a solid foundation for the cooperation of the companies of two countries. Since the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties in 1992, he said, many Korean enterprises have come to invest in and conduct trade with China, and many Chinese companies have entered Korean markets. As a result, Chung noted, the Sino-ROK trade ties have enjoyed tremendous development. Last year, the bilateral trade volume stood at 8.2 billion U.S. dollars, and ROK investment in China reached 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. S.C. Yi, representative of the Beijing office of Daewoo, said that since China has rich natural resources and labor, while the ROK has accumulated useful experience in its 40-year economic development and possesses advanced technology suitable for China, the effective cooperation between the two sides will create development chances for both sides. Since the late 1980s, Daewoo began to invest mainly in China's fields of machinery, chemicals, electrical appliances and automobiles. By the end of last year, its investment in China had reached 300 million U.S. dollars. Its trade volume with China in 1993 was one billion U.S. dollars. Daewoo has also set up a joint venture with Chinese companies in the ROK. Business in China has also developed smoothly for Samsung. With 10 offices in China, its trade volume with China surpassed 1.1 billion U.S. dollars last year, ranking first among all ROK companies. It has invested more than 100 million U.S. dollars to set up an ROK-China joint venture to manufacture electronic products and telecommunications equipment. Chun Sung-chin, chief representative of Lucky-Goldstar's Beijing office, said that since the enterprises of both countries all are facing tense competition in the world, they must introduce new technology and expand their production scope. The industrial circle of the two countries should strengthen their cooperation in this regard. All of the ROK entrepreneurs interviewed stressed that their companies have made long-term plans to cooperate with China, some of which have been carried out. Daewoo has signed an agreement with China to jointly produce automobile parts. The Lucky-Goldstar Group has just reached agreements with China to invest 400 million U.S. dollars to manufacture electronic products. It also plans to move its Asian sub-headquarters from Hong Kong to Beijing.
