When Qatari forces had the honor to confront the Iraqi aggression, this was no coincidence but was part of the principled and honorable position of sisterly Qatar. In this, its singular position toward its oppressed brother during the ordeal of the invasion of Kuwait, Qatar clearly expressed its stand in a manner that showed noble and pure fraternity and deep and strong relations. Qatar offered all it could to support justice. Toward that objective, Qatar extended everything it had in order to defeat the aggression and restore Kuwaiti rights. Kuwait's ordeal demonstrated the status of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] and reflected the closeness of relations among its states. Now, three years after the liberation of Kuwait and the restoration of legitimacy, much of the credit for which goes to the GCC states, and with our national celebrations, which are also celebrations for all those who contributed to the liberation of our country, it is difficult to see sisterly Qatar opening its windows to the aggressor so that the aggressor can spread its poisons and use these windows as a means to improve its image and win the sympathy of others. If the brothers in Qatar are hurt by the suffering of the Iraqi people, our hurt in Kuwait is no less than theirs. Our sufferings increase with the continuation of this regime because we knew that regime and lived with it for seven months. We also know that a human being is worthless according to its hateful Ba'thist ideology. This regime is still practicing its oppression despite all the international sanctions imposed on it after its sinful aggression. Instead of receiving Qatar's help against the oppressor, as we used to expect from Qatar, we were surprised to see the sinful aggressor appear in the brothers' media, as if he is mocking us, our solidarity, the pure blood that had been spilled, and the international resolutions that have been adopted. Our love for Qatar and appreciation of its principled positions toward us allow us to reproach it in the spirit of family -- a family that we are both part of and of which we are proud to be a member. This reproach is a friendly one that expresses our hope that the brothers will reconsider their positions toward the one who has harmed and suppressed his own people, as well as our people, and continues to do so. It is a friendly reproach from a wounded heart that can bear no more injuries.
