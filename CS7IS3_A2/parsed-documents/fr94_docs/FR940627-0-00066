FR940627-0-00066 FR940627-0-00012 In general, comments received on the changes included in the proposed regulations were favorable. Accordingly, these final regulations incorporate those changes. In addition, in response to comments, certain further modifications have been made to the regulations. The more significant modifications are discussed below. 2. Residual Shared employees Most of the comments received on the September 1993 proposed regulations pertained to the allocation of residual shared employees, that is, employees who provide services to more than one qualified separate line of business and who are not substantial-service employees with respect to any line of business. The December 1991 regulations provide three alternative allocation methods for residual shared employees, which are intended to assure that, as a group, residual shared employees receive benefits representative of the benefits provided to the workforce generally. Under the dominant line of business method, all residual shared employees are allocated to the employer's dominant line of business. Generally, a qualified separate line of business is dominant if at least 50 percent of the employer's substantial-service employees are assigned to that line. Alternatively, a line of business may be dominant if at least 35 percent of the employer's substantial-service employees are assigned to that line and the line satisfies any one of four possible conditions, such as a certain level of revenue or a certain size compared with the employer's other lines. The other two allocation methods, the pro-rata method and the highly compensated employee (HCE) percentage ratio method, provide formulas under which residual shared employees are allocated among the employer's various qualified separate lines of business. Employers have commented that the allocation rules do not adequately accommodate current benefit arrangements for employees who provide services to more than one qualified separate line of business. For example, the employer might cover residual shared employees in the plan maintained for a line that the employer considers its core business, even though that line does not satisfy the dominant line of business standard. Residual shared employees therefore cannot all be allocated to that line, potentially causing a change in their benefits. Employers also have commented that the pro-rata and HCE percentage ratio methods may require employees in the same department to be allocated to different qualified separate lines of business, which in turn may require different benefits to be provided to employees who work together. In response to comments, these final regulations change the allocation rules in two ways. First, the standard for the alternative test of dominance is lowered from 35 percent to 25 percent, giving employers more flexibility in establishing a dominant line. Second, the regulations provide an additional allocation alternative, the small group method. Under the small group method, with respect to each residual shared employee, the employer chooses a qualified separate line of business to which the employee is allocated. The residual shared employees need not all be allocated to the same qualified separate line of business; the employer thus has great flexibility in selecting the plans under which residual shared employees benefit. In order to prevent this new allocation method from being used to provide highly compensated employees with excessive benefits relative to the nonhighly compensated employees, its use is subject to three requirements. First, the entire group of the employer's residual shared employees cannot exceed three percent of the employees taken into account in applying section 410(b). In addition, the qualified separate line of business to which the employer allocates a residual shared employee must include at least 10 percent of the employer's substantial-service employees and must satisfy the administrative scrutiny statutory safe harbor after the allocation, that is, the concentration of highly compensated employees in the line of business must be between 50 and 200 percent of the concentration of highly compensated employees in the workforce generally. Finally, the allocation of residual shared employees must be reasonable; criteria for determining whether an allocation is reasonable are set forth in the regulations. 3. Gateway Section 410(b)(5)(B) provides that separate-line-of-business testing does not apply to a plan unless the plan benefits such employees as qualify under a classification that is set up by the employer and is found not to discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. Because the employer-wide nondiscriminatory classification test of section 410(b)(5)(B) is a prerequisite to separate-line-of-business testing, it is sometimes referred to as the ``Gateway.''
