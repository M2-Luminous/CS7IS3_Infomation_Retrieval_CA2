Colonel Ekrem Advic said the convoy, with 200 tonnes of food supplies, had been heading to the hard-hit Tuzla region in northeastern Bosnia. He said the assailants holding it up near Grude, south of Sarajevo, were Mafia-like "criminals" and said Croatian President Franjo Tudjman "should get rid of them." The Grude region is a stronghold of Croat extremists who back Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban. The spokesman said should the recent accord for a federation between Croatia and Bosnia be applied, the assailants "would face execution." He was referring to an agreement reached this month in Washington planning for a federation to end conflict between Bosnians and Croats, erstwhile allies in Bosnia against the Serbs. The accord in time calls for a joint army.
