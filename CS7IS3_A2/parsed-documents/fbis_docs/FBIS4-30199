The 18-member multinational framework is arguably Asean's most ambitious effort in its 27-year history to engage the major powers in a security dialogue. No region in the world has used its dividend from the thawing of the Cold War more wisely than East Asia. According to the latest figures from the Economic and Social Commission in Asia-Pacific (Escap) in Bangkok, the region has just had another banner year. It grew more than six times faster than the global economy did in 1993. Regional stability is founded on the emergence regionwide of a open market system; the recognition by all Asean countries of the need for regional peace to ensure the continuation of internal economic developments; and the capping of the Indochina crisis -- in no small degree through the efforts of Asean. Economic gravity For the moment, the United States' withdrawal from some naval and air bases in the region may have generated some anxiety in Asean. But as Apec [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] makes it clear, America's centre of economic gravity has shifted from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific. A testimony to the changing times is the constitution of the ARF's membership which is drawn from both sides of the Cold War divide -- the six Asean countries, the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Papua New Guinea, China, Russia, Vietnam and Laos. Considering that some of these countries were at war with each other not so long ago, their coming together in the ARF shows their commitment to global peace and prosperity. But serious differences remain because of the long history of conflicts and rivalries in the region. For one, the South China Sea issue may soon come to a boil. China is running out of oil resources close to home, at a time when its own energy needs are growing exponentially. The strategic sealanes passing through the Spratlys are so widely used -- increasingly also by China -- that a conflict there could be injurious to the entire Asia-Pacific community. A viable way urgently needs to be found to allow Vietnam and China to cool down the temperature in the Spratlys -- which can then become congenial to confidence-building measures among all claimant countries. Also, the dispute between Malaysia and the Philippines over Sabah is the most salient and serious intra-Asean territorial dispute. This contentious issue has often created serious tension and caused a deterioration in relations between Kuala Lumpur and Manila which adversely affected Asean regional cooperation. To be effective, the ARF has to serve its members, keeping in mind that the primary purpose is preventive diplomacy -- to preserve regional peace and prevent disputes from escalating into armed conflicts. In all circumstances, one thing should be remembered: the ARF is not a forum of the likeminded, therefore a spirit of give and take will be crucial to building mutual trust and confidence. A current phenomenon in the region is the drive by several Asean governments to build up and modernize their weapons inventories. The simplest reason for this is that the end of the Cold War has brought down prices for modern weaponry -- and some East Asian countries are simply taking the opportunity to grab some "fire-sale" bargains while they are available. Asean needs to agree on whether an arms race is taking place in its midst -- and if it is, then the member countries through the ARF must consult on how to contain it. Arms register Various proposals have been made by think-tanks. These include the creation of a Southeast Asian arms register, regional cooperation in arms purchases, exchange of intelligence data, observers at military exercises, transparency about military strength, more contacts between military officers and even the creation of an Asean peacekeeping centre. Recently some of the confidence-building measures were implemented. Singapore was invited for the first time as an observer at the just concluded U.S.-Thai Cobra Gold war games. This invitation could eventually be extended to other ARF members. It, however, should be borne in mind that Asean countries have varied approaches to security and it is necessary that, through the ARF, they define the appropriate extent of transparency expected regarding military strength in the region. From dialogue, the ARF must move gradually to seek a consensus about developing the mechanisms to maintain peace and stability. Only then can the Asia-Pacific region be a safer region, as the ARF promotes trust, eases tensions and heads off confrontations.
