Kinkel sees a slight ray of hope, but does not want to demonstrate too much optimism, because, Kinkel says, we have been bitterly disappointed too often. In the scope of a comprehensive foreign policy tour d'horizon, Kinkel viewed the situation in the Balkans and stressed that the patience of the United Nations, the Europeans, and above all the French and British is not inexhaustible. We have arrived at a certain turning point, he said, adding that a mood is spreading showing that if the parties to the conflict do not really demonstrate their readiness to find a solution, they must consider that the troops will be withdrawn; this would mean, among other things, that no humanitarian relief can be provided for the needy any more. There is no doubt that the federal foreign minister will inform the opponents about this assessment before their closed meeting begins tomorrow afternoon. The participants in the negotiations, led by Presidents Alija Izetbegovic and Franjo Tudjman, will be alone. Possibly, the two mediators, David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, will be called in. But this is a matter to be decided by the chief negotiators. Kinkel does not see himself as a mediator. He said that Bonn will only host the meeting. The foreign minister will be in Berlin tomorrow evening, but his plane is ready to take off at any time in case he is needed on the Rhine. Kinkel, who in his own words was surprised by his role as a host -- the news reached him at his party's Epiphany meeting in Stuttgart -- believes the summit will, in any case, last until Sunday [9 January]. The main issues in his view will be an end to the fighting, the future of Mostar, and access to the sea. He is convinced that the Muslims will only be ready to sign any agreement on the Balkans under one condition, namely, that the Europeans guarantee its observance. In his foreign policy tour d'horizon, Kinkel also commented extensively on the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels and the extension of NATO to the East, which will be discussed there. He predicted that there will be no guarantees of assistance for the East European states, and he also expressed understanding for the fact that Poland and other East European states are not satisfied with this development.
