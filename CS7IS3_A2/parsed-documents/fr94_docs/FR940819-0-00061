FR940819-0-00061 FR940819-0-00017 Appendix B to Subpart F_Performance of Refrigerant Recovery, Recycling and/or Reclaim Equipment was mistakenly referred to in the introduction of appendix B as ARI Standard 740&hyph;1991. However, this is incorrect. Appendix B is based upon ARI Standard 740&hyph;1993. Through this action EPA will correct the reference in the introduction to appendix B. I. Appendix D Appendix D to subpart F_Standards for Becoming a Certifying Program for Technicians includes reporting requirements for approved programs. Certifying programs are required to submit to EPA activity reports every six months, the first to be submitted six months following the date the program was approved. Since EPA has been approving programs on a continual basis, these reports are due at various times, instead of being submitted simultaneously. In order to maximize EPA's ability to review and respond to the information supplied by the programs, EPA is standardizing the reporting dates. Certifying programs will submit reports to EPA on January 30 and June 30, beginning with the first full six-month period for which the program has been approved. This means that if a program is approved on March 31, that program is required to submit its first activity report to EPA on the following January 30. J. Removal of Parenthetical Statements EPA is deleting the parenthetical notes in the individual sections of 40 CFR part 82, subpart F. The Agency consolidated its display of OMB control numbers in 40 CFR part 9 (see 58 FR 18014, 58 FR 24724, 58 FR 34198 and 58 FR 34369) including the control number for 40 CFR part 82, subpart F; this consolidated display makes the parenthetical statements in the individual sections of Subpart F duplicative. The information collection request (ICR) was previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB approval. III. Effective Dates This final action will become effective on October 18, 1994 unless EPA is notified by September 19, 1994 that any person wishes to submit adverse comment. Should EPA receive such notice, EPA will publish one subsequent action in the Federal Register to withdraw this final action and another action proposing this action and requesting comments. In such a case, following a public comment period, the Agency will draft the final regulation to be published in the Federal Register . IV. Summary of Supporting Analysis A. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether this regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affect a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. It has been determined by OMB and EPA that this amendment to the final rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review under the Executive Order. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;602, requires that Federal agencies examine the impacts of their regulations on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking, it must prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). Such an analysis is not required if the head of an agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b).
