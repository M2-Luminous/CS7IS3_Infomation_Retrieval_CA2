"We should remember that in whatever we do in this country, this nation is more than any one of us," Planning Minister Silas Daniyan said, according to the daily GUARDIAN newspaper on Monday [20 June]. "If Chief Abiola thinks that he can attain his political objectives through his present stand, we will be proud of him too," the minister said. [passage omitted] "We cannot easily forget June 12, it will serve as a constant reminder of what happened and which should not be repeated," Daniyan said. "I am not against June 12, it has taught us a lesson that we should never again in this country cancel a well-conducted and accepted election". [passage omitted] Daniyan had been a member of Abiola's Social Democratic Party (SDP), which was abolished like all the other democratic institutions in Nigeria when Abacha seized power. He qualified his support for the June 12 election by saying that he opposed any move that could lead to the disintegration of the nation of some 89 million, which has already seen a bloody civil war.
