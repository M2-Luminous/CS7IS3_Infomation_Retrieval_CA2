[Al-Najjab] Good evening. [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab, the PLO leadership is holding intensive consultations and contacts in light of political developments. What is the PLO's position on these developments? [Al-Najjab] If you mean the negotiations held with the Israeli side within the framework of the joint Liaison Committee, we are actually interested in reaching a solution to the issues this committee discussed in Oslo, at Versailles, and in Cairo recently. Regrettably, however, and as you know, the Cairo talks ended in nothing. To say that an agreement was reached is totally untrue. What really happened is that the Israeli side presented its viewpoint on the three issues; namely, the control of the crossing points, the Jericho area, and the settlements in Gaza and the security area required for them. We replied to this Israeli position by submitting clear proposals to which we have committed ourselves since the Versailles meeting. Regrettably, we noted that in Cairo the Israeli position retreated from the approach on which we agreed in Paris, France. Still pending is the issue of full Palestinian control of the crossing points leading to Gaza and Jericho in harmony with our control of these territories, from which the Israeli Army will withdraw. [Mu'addi] What are the amendments requested by the Palestinian side concerning the agreement reached? [Al-Najjab] No agreement was reached. As I told you, it was only an Israeli viewpoint that we regarded as an incomplete viewpoint. We still insist on controlling the crossing points leading to Gaza and Jericho. The Israeli Army's control of these territories, including the crossing points, will end when it withdraws from them. We also demanded that the Jericho area be expanded, so it would include the Maqam al-Nabi Musa, which is a holy site for Muslims, and the site of al-Maghtas [the place where Jesus Christ was baptized in the River Jordan], which is, as you know, a holy site for Christians. We also demanded access to the Dead Sea coast and full control of the crossing point between the bridge [on the River Jordan] and the Jericho area. We adhere to this stand, and we believe that it is possible to reach practical solutions that can balance the [Israeli] principle of external security and the principle of no encroachment on the Palestinian control of these territories. [Mu'addi] Will this new situation return us to square one? [Al-Najjab] The new situation is supposed to return us to the path we began to follow at Versailles where viewpoints were close and where it was agreed to balance the two principles as I told you; namely, the control of the crossing points by the Palestinian side, and safeguarding the principle that external security will be in the hands of Israel. The crossing points are directly linked to internal security. As is stipulated in the agreement, this kind of security will be the responsibility of the Palestinian side, whether in Gaza, Jericho, or elsewhere in our occupied territories. [Mu'addi] So, where are matters heading now? What are the coming steps? [Al-Najjab] We indeed regard the Israeli position as a strange one. As I said, there is a clear retreat in this position. There is also an attempt to impose conditions on us. Of course, to resume negotiations based on the Israeli position defined in Cairo will not happen. Rabin said: Let the Palestinians sweat a little. We tell Rabin: We may sweat if we are in Jericho where the weather is warm now, but in Tunis the weather is cold and no one will sweat. [Mu'addi] Sulayman al-Najjab, do you believe that the obstacles can be removed in the next few days and that the negotiations will resume in Taba? [Al-Najjab] For our part, we are making every possible effort to remove these obstacles in a way that will grant us control of the crossing points to Gaza and Jericho. We are really interested in advancing the negotiations, so the Palestinian side will not be held responsible for wasting this historic opportunity. It all depends on the conduct of the Israeli side. [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab, PLO Executive Committee member, thank you very much. [Al-Najjab] Thank you.
