The government, in turn, accused the Sandinists of having "mortgaged the country." According to the government, the agreement with the IMF will give the country access to some $600 million to be used in structural adjustments and economic expansion over the next three years. Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said in a news conference that "it can never harm national sovereignty to try to relieve the burden of foreign debt," estimated by several sources at more than $11 billion. Lacayo, who is the son-in-law of President Chamorro and heads the economic and social cabinet, said the only government that has harmed national sovereignty "is the one that mortgaged the country," referring to the Sandinists, who governed the country from 1979 to 1990. Lacayo added that Chamorro's ministers have had to travel abroad to "rescue this sovereignty" by having the United States write off Nicaragua's foreign debt. He "categorically" rejected the Sandinists' accusations that the contents of the agreement with the IMF "were harmful to the country's sovereignty." Lacayo added: "We have also gone to rescue the sovereignty that was pawned to Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Spain, the Nordic countries, and other Paris Club member nations. Each child born in Nicaragua wears an identification bracelet on one of his arms and a label saying that he owes $3,000 in foreign debt on the other arm." The head of the Presidency Ministry confirmed that the agreement with the IMF was signed on Saturday and amounts to $140 million to be disbursed over a three-year period. This will allow the procurement of another $150 million, which the World Bank will lend to Nicaragua, co-financed by the Governments of Japan, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland and which will be disbursed over the next 18 months. In addition, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) will grant other credits for health, education, and small enterprise, funds that would not have reached the country if the agreement with the IMF were not signed. As for the other Sandinist charge that the agreement with the IMF violates the current Constitution, Lacayo said those who believe this may file constitutional appeals before the Supreme Court. The minister, who is sort of a coordinator for the Chamorro government, added: "We are not going to judge that because the government is not a judge in this matter." Lacayo, as well as Finance Minister Emilio Pereira, Foreign Cooperation Minister Erwin Kruger, and Economy and Development Minister Pablo Pereira, among others, said that the $660 million that will reach the country this year will contribute to a reduction of the high interest rates in the production sector. They said that, although 13,500 bureaucrats will be dismissed in the next three years, public investment and producer credit will permit the creation of 84,675 new jobs in this country, where the unemployment rate is estimated at 60 percent. The ministers said that this year monthly devaluations will be 1 percent, economic growth of 2 to 3 percent is expected, and 7,500 housing units will be built nationwide. They also pointed out that signing the IMF agreement has led the Paris Club to plan a trip to Nicaragua in the first week of June to renegotiate the nation's foreign debt, the equivalent of more than 36 years of exports. Lacayo, on the other hand, warned that the government "is prepared to respond to violent protests by those who reject the agreement, noting "that this path is the wrong one." [Paris AFP in Spanish at 2310 GMT on 18 April in a Managua-datelined report adds: "The Nicaraguan Government will not pay the debt incurred by the Sandinist authorities to finance the war of the last decade and holds them responsible for the serious economic crisis that hinders the country, Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo announced on Monday. He said that `the government will not pay' the war debt, without specifying the amount of the debt. He made the announcement during a news conference offered by the economic cabinet to explain the scope of an agreement signed with the IMF this weekend."]
