FR940825-2-00053 FR940825-2-00030 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;364&hyph;000] Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America; Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff August 19, 1994 Take notice that on August 17, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, Eighth Revised Sheet No. 14 and Seventh Revised Sheet No. 25, to be effective September 1, 1994. Natural states that the filing is submitted to commence recovering effective September 1, 1994, approximately $37.7 million in gas supply realignment (GSR) costs, including the net premium paid for coal gasification supplies. Natural states that, for settling customers, the filing reflects the rates agreed upon in the GSR settlements approved by the Commission on May 12, 1994, in Docket No. RP94&hyph;346. Natural's compliance filing of July 19, 1994, in that docket is pending Commission action. Natural states that settling customers may preserve their rights by filing an abbreviated protest which may be supplemented if the compliance filing is not accepted. Natural requests whatever waivers may be necessary to permit the tariff sheets submitted to become effective September 1, 1994. Natural states that copies of the filing are being mailed to Natural's jurisdictional customers and interested state regulatory agencies. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before August 26, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of the filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
