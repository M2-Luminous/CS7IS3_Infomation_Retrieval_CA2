These talks, which were held at the initiative of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, began yesterday afternoon. Following the talks, President Milosevic made a brief statement: [Begin recording] [Milosevic] I am very glad that the talks between representatives of the United Nations and the Serbian Republic were successful. I think that a major step toward peace has been made. In the future as well, Serbia will continue to support a peaceful solution of the Yugoslav crisis through negotiations, because we think that there is no alternative and that this is the only way to achieve such a solution. Thank you very much. [Correspondent Jelena Radovanov] Yasushi Akashi also addressed the correspondents. [Akashi, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian report] I think that through cooperation among all participants in these long talks, we managed to avoid an even bigger crisis, said UN Yasushi Akashi. I am very satisfied with the results. I am grateful to President Milosevic for his initiative to hold such a meeting. I am also very pleased by the cooperativeness that representatives of the Bosnian Serbs, beginning with Radovan Karadzic, have shown, Yasushi Akashi said, and added that it was agreed that the Serbs would withdraw 3 km away from Gorazde by midnight and for heavy weaponry to be withdrawn by Tuesday [26 April] at midnight. It is our intention, Yasushi Akashi went on to say, that the first United Nations Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] units be deployed this afternoon. I have received assurances that full cooperation will be ensured regarding the peace forces' free passage to Gorazde as soon as possible, but before the end of the day. Yasushi Akashi added that other protected zones were also discussed. However, being confronted with the crisis around Gorazde, we have done all that was in our power to solve it. The result should be satisfactory to all interested sides, special envoy Yasushi Akashi concluded after the talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Republic of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic held this morning. [Radovanov] Here is what republic of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic told the correspondents: [Karadzic] Today's round was in fact held only to establish more precisely the things that we achieved yesterday. I am pleased that we and Akashi are on the road to success again. I hope that we are going to continue along that road until we completely conclude a cessation of hostilities. In this respect, Akashi is very spirited and very capable, and I think we are going to achieve good....[pauses] We set certain stipulations today regarding this 3-km zone in Gorazde. [Unidentified correspondent] Can you tell us some things [words indistinct]? [Karadzic] I beg your pardon? [Unidentified correspondent] Will relations with UNPROFOR be (?resumed)? [Karadzic] Yes, relations with UNPROFOR have been normalized as we need them if we want to establish peace, especially since both sides have realized that it is impossible to do anything with interrupted relations. [Correspondent] Could you tell us something about the modalities of yesterday's agreement? [Karadzic] Yesterday's agreement envisages something that we discussed on several occasions within the past 10 days, and that is how to establish a criterion for the 3-km zone. In the center of Gorazde, since there are both Serbs and Muslims there, UNPROFOR will be responsible for taking care of the Serbs. It will take care of the Muslims as well, and according to the Security Council resolution, they must not provoke or shoot at the Serbian side. If peace and the United Nations will be there -- if this is a model that is not identical to the Sarajevo one but similar to it -- we may hope for a complete peace in the Gorazde zone. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] that model be applied to other protected zones. What do you think? [Karadzic] If the zones are demilitarized -- that is, if any possibility of provocations and offensives from protected zones is prevented -- then we are then ready to accept this. Had Gorazde been demilitarized, there would have been no Muslim offensive and there would have been no Serbian counteroffensive. Why did we not attack Srebrenica? Because, from Srebrenica, we are exposed to provocations alone and not an offensive. If the Muslims launched an offensive from Srebrenica, then naturally a Serbian offensive would result. We have to ensure that it is established who is to be blamed for the war -- that is, who started the offensives. Counteroffensives are a legitimate reply to offensives. [Radovanov] Yesterday's first round of marathon talks, which lasted almost 10 hours, ended with a complete agreement of the representatives of the United Nations and the republic of Srpska on the most important points that were proposed by Slobodan Milosevic, the host of the meeting. What is involved is above all an agreement on the momentary and complete cease-fire in and around Gorazde, which comes into force at noon today. One UNPROFOR battalion will be deployed in the region 3 km away from the center of Gorazde on both banks of the Drina River. It has also been agreed that heavy weaponry be withdrawn from that area or be placed under UNPROFOR's control. A very important segment of yesterday's agreement is the complete normalization of relations between UNPROFOR and the republic of Srpska. [end recording]
