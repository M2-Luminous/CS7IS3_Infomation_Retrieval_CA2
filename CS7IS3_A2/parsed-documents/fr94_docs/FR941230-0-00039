FR941230-0-00039 FR941230-0-00008 The Commission recognizes that interim regulations should not respond to anything more than the exigencies created by the new legislation. Having been promulgated in response to exigencies created by the new legislation, each interim rule accordingly comes under one or more of the following categories: (1) Revision of a pre-existing rule that conflicted with the new legislation; (2) a technical amendment to make a pre-existing rule conform to the language of the new legislation; (3) rewording of a pre-existing rule to avoid confusion about how the rule is to be applied in light of the new legislation; or (4) a new rule covering a matter provided for in the new legislation but not covered by a pre-existing rule. More comprehensive final rules will be issued at a later date in accordance with the usual notice, public comment, and advance publication procedure. Because the interim regulations merely respond to exigencies created by the new legislation, the Commission has further determined that they do not meet the criteria described in section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), and thus do not constitute a significant regulatory action for purposes of the EO. In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 note), the Commission hereby certifies pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that the rules set forth in this notice are not likely to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small business entities. In any event, the Regulatory Flexibility Act is inapplicable to this rulemaking because it is not one in which a notice of proposed rulemaking is required under 5 U.S.C. 553(b). Section-By-Section Analysis of the Interim Rules Subpart A_Rules of General Applicability Section 210.3 The definition of ``investigation'' is revised to eliminate a reference to designating the permanent relief phase of an investigation ``more complicated.'' See discussion of ยง210.22 below. Section 210.4 Paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) has been revised to indicate that a termination based on an arbitration agreement joins terminations based on settlement agreements and consent order agreements in a category of cases in which monetary sanctions may be imposed on the initiative of the administrative law judge or the Commission. Section 210.5 Paragraph (b) is revised to conform to amended 19 U.S.C. 1337(n)(2), which clarifies the list of government officers and employees who may have access to confidential business information. A new paragraph (c) is added to alert the reader to the possibility that confidential business information may be transmitted to a federal district court, subject to such protective order as the district court determines necessary. This result might occur in a limited class of cases because of newly-enacted 28 U.S.C. 1659. Past Commission practice has been to permit the transfer of confidential business information to another court only with permission of the supplier of the information. Particularly where the supplier is a third party who is involved in neither the Commission investigation nor the district court case, it is important that the supplier be made aware that treatment of confidential information would be governed by the district court's protective order and not that of the Commission following transmittal of the record under this provision. It is expected that future protective orders will refer to this rule and the similar provision in ยง210.39(b) to assure that all suppliers of confidential business information are aware of this possibility. The remaining two paragraphs of this section are redesignated (d) and (e). Subpart C_Pleadings Section 210.14
