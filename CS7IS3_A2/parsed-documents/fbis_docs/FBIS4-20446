Some 94.7 percent and 75.4 percent of WBCs from the patients' blood of vivax malaria and the mice blood infected with P. berghei respectively were removed with no alteration of the parasite density and the malaria stage ratio after the cellulose filtration. The densities of the uninfected and the infected erythrocytes with different stages of three species of malaria parasites were determined by isopycnic centrifugation on multi-continuous gradients of Percoll. The mean densities (kg/L) of schizonts, trophozoites, ring form and uninfected cells were approximately 1.059, 1.072, 1.096 and 1.099 in P. vivax; 1.070, 1.079, 1.10 and 1.10, gametocytes 1.085 in P. falciparum; 1.059, 1.062, 1.103 and 1.104 in P. berghei, respectively. Based on these values, three different density gradients of Percoll were devised to separate erythrocytes infected with the more mature stages (trophozoites and schizonts) from ring forms and uninfected cells. By these methods, it is possible to obtain high purified parasites of 93.5 percent from blood with starting parasitaemias of 0.8 percent in P. vivax, 100 percent from 2.3 percent in P. falciparum and 93.0 percent from 30.6 percent in P. berghei, being raised by 113.8, 43.4 and 2.0 times respectively.
