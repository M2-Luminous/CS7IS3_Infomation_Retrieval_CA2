The Social Democratic Party (SDP) the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the new party Sakigake [Harbinger] are strengthening unity against the coalition's majority group comprising Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito and the Japan New Party (JNP). Meanwhile, the main opposition group, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), continues to watch and wait, putting priority on keeping its own unity and preventing defections as the two coalition groups woo its members, they said. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, the head of the coalition's largest party, Sunday proposed holding a meeting of the heads of all the coalition parties at noon Monday to discuss who should succeed Hosokawa as prime minister. Murayama's proposal aims at leveling up to the top leaders of coalition parties from the present level of secretaries general to discuss the choice of a successor to Hosokawa. DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi and Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura supported the idea but Shinseito and Komeito rejected the proposal. Hosokawa, the JNP head, also responded coolly to Murayama's proposal. On Sunday, the secretaries general of the coalition parties began discussions on how to choose the next premier but the meeting broke up after only 20 minutes because of differences between the two groups. Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, regarded as the coalition's chief strategist during the eight months of Hosokawa's government, said, "there was a consensus that the caucus of the ruling parties (at the level of secretaries general) is to discuss" the choice of a successor. Ozawa told reporters that if the heads of the SDPJ, the DSP and Sakigake attend the proposed leaders' meeting it would constitute "a private talk." Koji Morimoto, chairman of Komeito's Diet Affairs Committee, also told a news conference Sunday that his party will not accept Murayama's proposal for a meeting of the coalition party heads. Shinseito and Komeito are considering throwing their support behind the LDP's Michio Watanabe, a former foreign minister, as a candidate for the premiership if he defects from the LDP, the sources said. On Sunday, Watanabe signaled his readiness to bolt from the LDP and join hands with all or portions of the coalition if a comfortable number of LDP members to leave the party with him. Sakigake is scheduled to announce an outline on forming the next government Monday and is likely to begin seeking a tie-up with reformers within the LDP, the sources said.
