According to Dr. Abdorrahman, member of the peace commission of western Kabul, the sporadic firing occurring in the west of Kabul sometimes is the act of irresponsible people, and is not to be concerned about. Answering a question, he said that the peace commission reassures all residents of Kabul that, as in the past, the permanent cease-fire continues to be observed in the western areas of Kabul. Dr. Abdorrahman says that four saboteurs have been captured by the commission and their warmongering action has been prevented. The peace commission of the western areas of Kabul was set up last year by Jami'at-e Eslami, Hezb-e Wahdat Eslami, Ettehad-e Eslami and Harakat-e Eslami, and on top of preventing armed clashes, it makes efforts in the field of social services too.
