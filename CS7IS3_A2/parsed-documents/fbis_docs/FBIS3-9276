Kwidzyn workers used the money from the sale of their shares to take final leave of the old realities of People's Poland: They bought apartments, cars, and furniture. The crew of the Rafako manufacturing plant was slightly less ecstatic in the last stages of the sale of its enterprise because its shares did not make a profit as high as those of the BSK. In this context, what can the remaining 80 percent of the Polish population say? So far, it has not had a chance to snatch for itself even a tiny part of the privatization profits. At the same time, certain groups of politicians intend to capitalize on the prevailing public mood and hamper the progress of privatization while invoking the following maxim: "It is preferable to carry it out slowly--but methodically and fairly." Consequently, we will not see the issue of share certificates as early as promised by the National Investment Funds Act. If we did, might not pensioners and employees of the budget-funded sector, who were supposed to be the first in line to participate in and benefit from the Polish mass privatization program, get too rich for someone's liking? A new problem, which was demonstrated clearly by new in-depth social research studies carried out in 1993, is posed by employees' growing discontent with working conditions provided by private enterprise owners. There is also evidence of increasing criticism of private owners based on dissatisfaction with other factors besides poor working conditions, such as management methods that undermine employers' dignity and irrational economic and organizational decisions. The traditional mistrust of foreign capital and prejudice against foreign investors still persist, although, in practice, firms that have accepted foreign capital tend to reserve higher praise for it than for our own, domestic capital. Recently, it has been recommended that a system of public monitoring and control of the implementation of the privatization program be introduced on a regular basis. To begin with, the Mass Privatization Program [PPP] was launched with a considerable degree of public approval (with a mean value of 70 percent, obtained in a number of separate surveys). It generated associated expectations of an economic miracle and elevation of wide circles of society into the elite realm of private property owners. Even after a notable fall in share values in 1993, the level of public acceptance of the privatization program was still relatively high. Consequently, the minister for ownership transformations continued to enjoy considerable public support. And so, once the Privatization Act was passed by parliament in April 1993, the PPP could have confidently "kicked off" on schedule. By now we would have been approaching the stage leading to mass distribution of and trading in share certificates. First, the level of the PPP's public acceptance declined as a result of the election campaign. Even so, during Prime Minister Pawlak's "honeymoon" period, public approval for privatization still reached some 50 percent. At the same time, however, the proportion of advocates of the view that privatization should be carried out at a much slower pace than previously increased sharply (to 47 percent). Representatives of opinions that deny the sense of accelerating the privatization process do not expect to get rich themselves. In their view, enterprises should be sold exclusively to those buyers who will undertake to maintain employment levels (60 percent). In addition, the predominant view is that privatization should start with enterprises that are in debt rather than with those in sound financial condition. Recent opinions stressing a growing degree of discontent with the effects of privatization to date influence politicians in their negative view on the PPP program as a whole. It is true that the recently appointed Selection Committee, whose creation already involved considerable difficulties, has set out on a course of talks with the firms that took part in the initial sales tender, but it has scheduled the completion of the selection process aimed at identification of parent companies and candidates to the position of members of National Investment Fund supervisory boards for the second quarter of this year. Meanwhile, enterprises that may even want to participate in the program and that would regard it as a move in their own economic interest, tend to attend more closely to matters of immediate importance, such as local and employee interests. At the same time, many of them suffer the consequences of a deteriorating financial condition. It seems that the PPP program has become a scapegoat here, as a victim of political maneuvering. Those who are responsible for decisions in this area are probably hoping that someone else will eventually pay for the consequences of the delay in the introduction of the privatization program.
