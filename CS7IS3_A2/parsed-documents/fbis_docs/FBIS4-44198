Juppe, who is attending a seminar here on the devaluation of the CFA franc earlier this year, said the "first objective of Operation Turquoise in Rwanda has already been attained because we have reassured threatened populations and restored security to threatened populations." The foreign minister said opposition to the French operation was waning, in particular that of the Tutsi-dominated rebel movement, Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), "because we explained that our objectives were exclusively humanitarian." Juppe also said the international community was mobilising in support of Operation Turquoise. "Most of our European partners are with us," Juppe said, referring to European Union support given at last week's summit in Corfu, Greece. "The priority is to ensure that United Nations troops are on the ground as soon as possible," Juppe said. In Paris, assistant chief of staff General Raymond Germanos said Monday that French troop strength between the two staging posts of Goma and Bukavu, in Zaire on the Rwandan border, would be up to 1,300 men by Monday evening. Germanos said no incidents had been reported, but that the troops had noted tensions when they made forays into western Rwanda. "People are frightened and don't always show it," Germanos said, "The atmosphere is very tense." The town of Kibuye on the shores of Lake Kivu was the main seat of inter-ethnic tension between Tutsis and members of the majority Hutu tribe, another military source said. The source said several hundred Tutsis had taken refuge around the town under the protection of nuns and were being threatened by Hutu extremists. Germanos said the French force was being progressively expanded to its full strength of 2,500, and would reach 1,300 by Monday evening compared with 1,150 on Sunday. Operation Turquoise was delayed in its early stages by the inability of 25 chartered Russian-built Antonov transport planes to land at Goma airport, which has only one runway and no modern equipment, Germanos said, but now the Antonovs were landing there normally. He added that two field hospitals were being set up near Goma and Bukavu and that an operating theatre would be established at another site. Meanwhile, in Libreville, Gabon, a central African economic cooperation group declared "full support" for the French operation. The general secretariat of the Economic Community of Central African States (CEEAC), one of whose 10 members is Rwanda, called on members to send either troops or food and medical aid. Other members of the CEEAC are Burundi, Cameroun, the Central African Republic, Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome, Chad, and Zaire.
