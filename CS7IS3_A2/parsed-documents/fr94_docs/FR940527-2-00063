FR940527-2-00063 FR940527-2-00055 Analysis of Consent Order to Aid Public Comment The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from respondents Amoco Chemical Company and Amoco Foam Products Company, Delaware corporations. The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement and take other appropriate action, or make final the agreement's proposed order. This matter concerns the labeling and advertising of Amoco polystyrene cups, plates and other food service products. The Commission's complaint in this matter alleges that Amoco falsely represented that the polystyrene cups, plates and other food service products are recyclable. In fact, the complaint alleges, the polystyrene food service products are not recyclable because there are only a few collection facilities nationwide that will accept them for recycling. The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future. Part I of the proposed order requires that respondents cease and desist from misrepresenting, in any manner, directly or by implication, with respect to any polystyrene food service product or packaging material the extent to which it is capable of being recycled or to which recycling collection programs are available. Part II of the proposed order provides that if the respondents represent in advertising or labeling that any plastic food service product or packaging material offers any environmental benefit, they must have a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence, that substantiates the claims. The proposed order also requires respondents to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate the claims covered by the order, to distribute copies of the order to certain company officials, to notify the Commission of any changes in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order, and to file one or more reports detailing compliance with the order. The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms. Benjamin I. Berman, Acting Secretary.
