FR941004-1-00033 FR941004-1-00008 40 CFR Part 52 [TX41&hyph;01&hyph;6273b; FRL&hyph;5083&hyph;6] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Texas; Revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) Addressing Ozone Monitoring AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The EPA is proposing to approve a revision to Texas' SIP for ozone. This action is based upon a revision request which was submitted by the State to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended November 15, 1990, and the Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) regulations. The PAMS regulation requires the State to provide for the establishment and maintenance of an enhanced ambient air quality monitoring network in the form of PAMS by November 12, 1993. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn, and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received in writing by November 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments on this action should be addressed to Mr. Thomas H. Diggs, Chief, Planning Section, at the EPA Regional Office listed below. Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following locations. The interested persons wanting to examine these documents should make an appointment with the appropriate office at least 24 hours before the visiting day.
