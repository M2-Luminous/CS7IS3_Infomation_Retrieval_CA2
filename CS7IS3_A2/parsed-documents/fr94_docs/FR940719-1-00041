FR940719-1-00041 FR940719-1-00013 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 48 CFR Part 245 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Contractor Inventory AGENCY: Department of Defense (DoD). ACTION: Proposed rule with request for public comments. SUMMARY: The Defense Acquisition Regulations Council is proposing changes to the Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) to raise the threshold for screening certain contractor inventory items through the Contractor Inventory Redistribution System (CIRS) before disposal. DATES: Comments on the proposed rule should be submitted to the address shown below on or before July 18, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: Defense Acquisition Regulations Directorate, ATTN: IMD 3D139, OUSD (A), 3062 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301&hyph;3062. FAX (703) 604&hyph;5971. Please cite DFARS Case 93&hyph;D008 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Owen Green; (703) 604&hyph;5929. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background This proposed rule amends DFARS 245.608&hyph;70(a)(3) by raising the threshold for screening serviceable and usable contractor inventory with no national stock number through the Contractor Inventory Redistribution system. The threshold is raised from $500 to $1,000 to coincide with the $1,000 threshold in FAR 45.608&hyph;2. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply because the proposed rule is not considered to be a significant revision within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. It does not have a significant impact beyond the internal operating procedures of the Department of Defense. An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has therefore not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The proposed rule does not impose any reporting or recordkeeping requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.
