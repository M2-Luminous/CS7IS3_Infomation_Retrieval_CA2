The overall Wholesale Price Index (WPI) was 93.3 against the base of 100 for 1990. In February, the WPI fell 0.5 percent on a monthly basis. The wholesale price index also fell 3.2 percent in the business year ended March 31, 1994, for the third consecutive yearly decline. Domestic wholesale prices in March inched down 0.2 percent from February and declined 2.0 percent from the year before. Export prices gained 0.1 percent from February on a contract currency basis, falling 0.4 percent in terms of yen. Import prices rose 0.6 percent from the month before on a contract currency basis but decreased 0.3 percent in terms of yen. The U.S. dollar averaged 105.13 yen against the Japanese currency, down 1.1 yen from February and down 10.2 yen from the same month a year before. A Bank of Japan official said lower iron and steel prices accounted for about a third of the monthly drop of the domestic WPI. Sluggish demand in the construction and auto industries and inventory liquidation at the fiscal year-end helped push down iron and steel prices, he said. Lower prices for oil products amid softer crude oil value and a price drop in electric appliances also led to softening the domestic WPI, he said. Nevertheless, the stability of domestic WPI remains unchanged, he said. Export WPI gained on a contract currency basis on higher prices in machineries, but dropped in terms of yen, reflecting the appreciation of the yen against major currencies. Import WPI gained ground on higher metal and textile prices on a contract currency basis despite lower crude oil values. Rice prices gained 0.1 percent from February, the official said. Domestic WPI for fiscal 1993 shed 1.8 percent, slipping for the second successive year. The Bank of Japan said it was due to lower prices of iron and steel, oil products and electric appliances. Export WPI in terms of yen retreated 8.1 percent to mark the biggest drop since the 13.3 percent of fiscal 1986. On a contract currency basis, the stronger yen and the resultant rise of automobile prices boosted the index by 2.9 percent. In fiscal 1993, the dollar averaged at 107.85 yen, jumping 13.6 percent from the year before. Import WPI in terms of yen fell 12.4 percent, posting the largest decline since 37.3 percent of fiscal 1986. On a contract currency basis, lower oil and natural gas prices contributed to bringing down the index by 1.0 percent.
