As has already been reported, Japanese-U.S. military officials concerned recently discussed the so-called Japanese-U.S. cooperative system in Tokyo to cope with the situation when conflicts break out on the Korean peninsula [choson pandoesoui punjaeng palsaenge taeunghan]. Japan's KYODO News Agency reported that Japan and the United States considered plans to sign a Japanese-U.S. agreement for the supply of military materials in order for the U.S. Forces stationed in Japan and the Japanese Self-Defense Army to support each other, in areas of munition and fuel, in case of an emergency situation on the Korean peninsula. This clearly shows that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have openly pursued their ambition to invade our country in collusion with each other. In particular, what we cannot overlook is that the Japanese reactionaries have disclosed their attempt to invade Korea by talking about the nuclear development or missile threat by someone at the same time when the United States' plot of crushing the Republic has been unprecedentedly strengthened. They have publicly said that in the event of an emergency situation on the Korean peninsula, Japan's dispatch of arms to the Korean frontlines and its joint military action with the U.S. Forces would be constitutional. According to the Japanese reactionaries' plan to reinvade Korea, the basic strike forces of the Japanese Self-Defense Army have been mobilized and deployed into the western areas of Japan and, thus, are on alert status. The Japanese Self-Defense Army is frequently conducting the military exercise geared towards a simulated Korean war [choson chonjaengul kasanghan] and the large-scale Japanese-U.S. joint military exercise. Furthermore, the Japanese Foreign Ministry officials concerned have greatly maintained that in case the United States carries out a sea blockade against the DPRK, Japan should reorganize the supply service system to participate in it. As disclosed, the Japanese reactionaries have removed articles from its constitution that prohibit the exercise of collective self-defense rights under the pretext of so-called international cooperation, thus availing themselves of an opportunity in which tensions on the Korean peninsula are aggravated. As a result, they have attempted to achieve their hidden ambition for overseas expansion, by more actively participating in a U.S. war plot against the Republic. In a 6 April meeting to revise the defense plan, the members of the Council of Defense Affairs, an advisory organization to the Japanese prime minister, talked about the concrete study of joint action which Japan would take with the U.S. Forces stationed in Japan under the pretext of our nuclear issue. Even the Defense Office has supported it. Regarding this, Japan's YOMIURI SHIMBUM reported on 6 April: Japan should take advantage of U.S. war plots to immediately formulate a crisis management system [wigikwanri chegye]. Also, the paper reported that the Japanese Self-Defense laws and other laws concerned should be revised in order to support the U.S. Forces in case they carry out the sea blockade against our country. Japan's KYODO News Agency reported on 6 April: A Japanese Foreign Ministry high-level official said that in case a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, not only the Japanese Self-Defense Army's transport planes but also warships [hamson] should be mobilized to evacuate the Japanese people from foreign countries, including South Korea, and that, for this end, the law on Japan's Self Defense Army should be revised as soon as possible. Thus, he referred to the emergency situation on the Korean peninsula. All these facts show that if the United States were to provoke a new war on the Korean peninsula, Japan intends to carry out supply service support [hubang chiwon] for the U.S. Forces, and that it intends to directly participate in a war against our country. The Japanese reactionaries should be hold totally responsible for the consequences arising from their act of positively participating in the U.S. plot for war provocation. Also, they should clearly look at the trends of the times and act with discretion.
