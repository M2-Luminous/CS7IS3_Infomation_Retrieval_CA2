FR940512-2-00011 FR940512-2-00006 As a result of verification, we adjusted home market indirect selling expenses, packing, and credit costs which had been incorrectly or inappropriately quantified. Although we were able to verify ICI's home market packing expenses for the period December 1, 1992&hyph;June 30, 1993, we were unable to verify ICI's claimed home market packing costs for the July 1, 1992&hyph;November 30, 1992 portion of the period of review (POR). (See Report on Verification of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC and ICI Americas Inc., March 24, 1994, 9&hyph;12, and Memorandum from Case Analyst to the File, April 15, 1994.) We used BIA for all home market packing expenses for sales made between July 1, 1992 and November 30, 1992. Because respondents claimed that drums were reused once during this five-month period, as BIA we have used the verified packing costs for the latter part of the POR (adjusted as described below) and divided that amount by two, to account for the reuse of packing drums during the first half of the POR. During the verification of ICI, the Department discovered that the costs of at least some of the drums purchased in May 1993 were overstated. A number of purchases of steel drums were made during that month. At one point during the month, the price of the drums increased. Rather than determining an average price, ICI selected the higher price as representative for the entire month of May. From the information provided at verification, we could not determine how many drums were purchased at the lower price and how many were purchased at the higher price. Therefore, as BIA for all May 1993 home market sales, we have used the lower price for packing cost. In comparing home market sales to PP sales, we made a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for differences in credit terms by deducting home market credit expenses and adding U.S. credit expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). We have used BIA for the home market interest rate for the purposes of calculating credit and inventory carrying expenses. ICI does not incur short-term credit costs associated with INC in either the U.S. or the home market. ICI was unable to satisfactorily support at verification its reported claim of what its home market credit costs would have been if short-term debt had existed during the POR. In the U.S. market, ICI established that, if short-term debt existed, it would have been financed using a particular United Kingdom-based interest rate. For the purposes of calculating home market credit and inventory carrying costs, we have therefore used the same United Kingdom-based interest rate as used for U.S. credit. Currency Conversion We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the date of the U.S. sales as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank. Preliminary Results of Review As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine that the following margin exists for the period July 1, 1992 through June 30, 1993: ‚ê£ 1Manufacturer/exporter 1Margin (percent) Imperial Chemical Industries PLC 5.79 Parties to the proceeding may request disclosure within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice.
