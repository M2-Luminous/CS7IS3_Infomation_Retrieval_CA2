This resolution demanded that the delegation authorized to hold meetings on the Abkhazian issue in Moscow not sign any agreement or memoranda without the parliament's consent. Another 39 deputies associated themselves with the resolution later. According to legislation currently in force in Georgia, a protocol resolution has no juridical power. Namely, it is not recognized by the Law on State Authorities. It can neither be called an official resolution because a required procedure has not been accomplished. However, this decision has a political significance because it demonstrates the attitude of members of parliament towards the document, some articles of which are painful for the Georgian party. Meanwhile, a considerable part of deputies regards an overall wreck of the talks as impossible. Two days of debates have demonstrated that the parliament failed to take responsibility for the process of talks. Besides, we take into consideration that the head of state received important guarantees, which give hope for the favorable development of the process for us. We believe the only correct way out in the present critical circumstances is the head of state's action on the authority conferred to him by law. We believe today a real way to secure a dignified return of refugees to Abkhazia and a final restoration of Georgia's territorial integrity is through cooperation with Russia, which will become a basis for the levers of the collective security of the CIS countries. We believe the United Nations, which has been actively involved in the settlement of the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict since the very beginning, will not spare efforts to ensure the implementation of its peacekeeping mission in Abkhazia is in full accordance with paragraphs of the UN Charter and the interest of the Georgian statehood. We also pin hopes on the CSCE participation in the peaceful settlement of this conflict. The process has started and its cessation could only bring our state to a chaos and territorial disintegration.
