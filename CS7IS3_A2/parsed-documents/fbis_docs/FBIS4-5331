Speaking in Jakarta today, Irawan Abidin, director of foreign information service of the Foreign Affairs Department, said the Indonesian Government is closely monitoring political developments in Japan and hopes that the Japanese prime minister's resignation will not affect existing cordial relations between the two countries. Speaking on a separate occasion, Sabam Sirait, a member of parliament, said Hosokawa's resignation will provide an opportunity for Japan's Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] to stage a comeback and assume the country's premiership which the party lost in the last general elections. Sabam Sirait noted that factional power struggle within the LDP may still continue if the party regains the premiership. However, he believes Indonesia is not expected to suffer the consequences of such a scenario.
