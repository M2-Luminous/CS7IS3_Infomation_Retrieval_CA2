The two command headquarters distributed leaflets to the newspapers and the people to inform them that 74 villages and 10 farming settlements were razed, nine villages partly destroyed, and 36 villagers and all the men in 10 farming settlements have been missing for some time. The leaflets also expressed condolences over the dead villagers. Asserting that the Turkish state's move that began 10 years ago to force the Kurdish people to emigrate and become a community without a homeland has peaked, the two command headquarters argued that the security forces, which are involved in the spring operation against the PKK, have tried to force the Kurdish people to agree to register as village guards, burned down several houses in various villages, and compelled the people to emigrate. The leaflets said: "The wide-ranging operations launched at the end of April and maintained without interruption have clearly indicated the objectives of the security forces. The Kurdish people are faced with the threat of being forced to emigrate from Turkey, as was the case from 1925 to 1940. The state forces have burned down villages to force the people to emigrate and to stop them from going back. They do not fail to shoot and kill people from the villages after accusing them of being terrorists." The leaflets stressed that the Turkish State regards the Kurds as a potential threat and a rebel community, and noted that it has moved to burn and destroy the entire region step by step in order to prevent them from organizing resistance against the security forces. They begin with the areas where the people rebelled against the government in the past -- that is, areas such as Palu and Dersim. The leaflets also noted that all rural areas have been declared out of bounds and the military troops have been ordered to shoot and kill anyone they suspect. They said: "The tactic in the recent operations is as follows: The Turkish state deploys large military units with heavy arms to evict the people from particular areas. Those areas are then pounded with bombs. The security forces predetermine the people who must die in the areas. They shoot and kill them during the operations, and evict the survivors from their villages. The evicted people are not allowed to go back to their property, which is set on fire and destroyed. The Turkish state no longer bothers to accuse the villagers it evicts from their homes of `aiding and abetting the guerrillas,' as it did in the past. Every Kurd who refuses to be an agent for the Turkish state; to serve as a member of the village guard units, which are merely armed bands; or to commit treachery against his community is regarded as a `terrorist,' selected as a target, and shot and killed -- regardless that they are unarmed and innocent villagers. Such acts of violence are occurring before the eyes of the world in Kurdistan in general and in Amed and Garzan Provinces in particular." The leaflets said that 74 villages and 10 farming settlements were burned down, nine villages partly destroyed, and 36 villagers and all of the men in 10 farming settlements reported missing in the recent operations. They urged the local and international media organs to send their representatives in order to verify the situation on the spot.
