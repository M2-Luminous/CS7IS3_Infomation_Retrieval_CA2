Deputies attending the current NPC session expressed their understanding of and support for these measures which will involve a readjustment of interests among social sectors. The hottest topics during group discussions of the current NPC session include reform of the taxation, finance, investment and foreign trade systems, and the establishment of a modern enterprise system, since problems are likely to crop up in the course of carrying out these reforms. Sichuan Provincial Governor Xiao Yang said that reform measures are formulated from a macro-economic angle with the interests of the entire nation and its long-term interests in mind. Therefore, it is impossible to enable everyone to enjoy the same benefits at the same time. "This is quite normal so far as reforms are concerned," Xiao said. He said that it is inevitable that some localities, industries, enterprises or individuals will suffer relative interest losses of varying degrees. "I think this problem can be solved gradually in the course of pushing ahead with reforms," he noted. Inflation is also one of the hottest topics of group discussions by NPC deputies. Ye Gongqi, a deputy from Shanghai, said, "People are concerned most with their rice bags, vegetable baskets and cooking oil bottles." If prices rise too rapidly, it will be impossible to stabilize popular feelings, he noted. "While expanding a socialist market economy, we should never take a hands-off policy on prices," he said. Huang Da, a deputy from Beijing, said society's capability to accept reforms is tested primarily by prices. Specific conditions in China indicate that an annual rise of around 10 percent in prices is the limit that consumers can accept, he said, noting that exceeding that limit would cause instability. Many deputies also emphasized the importance of viewing things from the angle of development. They pointed out that no country in the world has thoroughly eliminated inflation. With a population of 1.1 billion, China needs a high economic growth rate, they said. At the same time, inflation should be curbed to allow people to gain more tangible benefits. Another hot topic is how to step up agricultural development and narrow the gap between developed east China and underdeveloped west China. Many deputies agreed that agriculture is a sector essential to social stability, as well as a sector with poor foundations. That is why under no circumstances should rural work and farmers' interests be neglected. However, farmers' incomes now do not increase simultaneously with agricultural development, nor do they keep pace with income increases of urban workers, they pointed out. While complaining that increased production did not result in increased incomes, farmer deputies talked more about how to bring about a relatively comfortable life for farmers. They agreed that township-run enterprises will play a significant role in helping farmers live a better life. Despite the fact that reform often means changes in existing patterns of wealth distribution, reform is popular among the deputies. A survey shows that, of the nearly 3,000 deputies, no one expressed objection to reforms, but some made proposals on and voiced criticisms of specific reform measures. Li Zemin, secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, expressed the consensus reached by many deputies that although reforms involve risks, they represent the general trend and must continue. Li said that it is imperative to carefully organize the implementation of reform measures and reduce the risks to a minimum in order to avoid wide repercussions on society.
