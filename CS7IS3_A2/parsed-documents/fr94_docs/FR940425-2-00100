FR940425-2-00100 FR940425-2-00069 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [Docket No. 94&hyph;24; Notice 1] Receipt of Petition for Determination That Nonconforming 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider Passenger Cars Are Eligible for Importation AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of receipt of petition for determination that nonconforming 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider passenger cars are eligible for importation. SUMMARY: This notice requests comments on a petition submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for a determination that a 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider passenger car that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards is eligible for importation into the United States because it is substantially similar to a vehicle that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards, and it is capable of being readily modified to conform to the standards. DATES: The closing date for comments on the petition is May 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to the docket number and notice number, and be submitted to: Docket Section, room 5109, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. [Docket hours are from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.]. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ted Bayler, Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance, NHTSA (202&hyph;366&hyph;5306). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the Federal Register of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the Federal Register . Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (``Champagne'') (Registered Importer R&hyph;90&hyph;009) has petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. The vehicle which Champagne believes is substantially similar is the 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider that was manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States, and certified by its original manufacturer as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. The petitioner states that it carefully compared the non-U.S.-certified 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider to its U.S.-certified counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Champagne submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S.-certified 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its U.S.-certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards. Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider is identical to its U.S.-certified counterpart with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102 Transmission Shift Lever Sequence. *␣*␣*, 103 Defrosting and Defogging Systems, 104 Windshield Wiping and Washing Systems, 105 Hydraulic Brake Systems, 106 Brake Hoses, 107 Reflecting Surfaces, 109 New Pneumatic Tires, 113 Hood Latch Systems, 116 Brake Fluid, 124 Accelerator Control Systems, 201 Occupant Protection in Interior Impact, 202 Head Restraints, 203 Impact Protection for the Driver From the Steering Control System, 204 Steering Control Rearward Displacement, 205 Glazing Materials, 206 Door Locks and Door Retention Components, 207 Seating Systems, 209 Seat Belt Assemblies, 210 Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages, 211 Wheel Nuts, Wheel Discs and Hubcaps, 212 Windshield Retention, 216 Roof Crush Resistance, 219 Windshield Zone Intrusion, and 302 Flammability of Interior Materials.
