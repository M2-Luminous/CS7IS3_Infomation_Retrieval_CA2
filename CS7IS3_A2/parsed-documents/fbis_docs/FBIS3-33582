Vegacruz] [Text] I would like to contribute to the debate inside the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front]. I will put forth several ideas in this connection. The FSLN is not the personal property of any leader. The FSLN is not the private property of any member of the National Directorate or of any Sandinist activist. Therefore, no one can claim to own the FSLN. In reality, however, we can see and show that Daniel, our national coordinator, appears to be the lord and master of the FSLN, or is made to so appear. I do not deny Daniel's major historic merits, but they do not mean that he is the most able or the only leader of the Sandinist Party. The times in which we live demand that we be consistent with the Dialectic. If we remain bogged down in internal political changes, the social dynamic will wipe us off the political map. The FSLN must continue to move forward with its democratization in order to be able to democratize society. This means that our main leaders, at every level of the party, must be agents of change, leaders who are in tune with the democratic winds that are blowing through the ranks of the FSLN and all over the world. We must promote change in the styles and methods of the Directorate, in the leadership, in our organizational structure. Therefore, we must be flexible yet firm, self-critical, and humble. We must struggle in a public-spirited manner together with our people for peace and for life. We must seek ways of erasing our party's militaristic image from the minds of the people. Our leaders must be peace-loving, intelligent people of progress who possess true social sensitivity and are not demagogues. Our leaders must be and have the reputation of being honest and must be respected by Sandinists and non-Sandinists alike, because when we return to power in the next elections, we are going to govern for the progress of the entire nation. The essence of the FSLN is its democratic spirit. We want to democratize Nicaraguan society. We tried to do so during the revolutionary government through agrarian reform, education, and the single health-care system, but we did not progress to the internal running of the FSLN. The methods of the historic National Directorate did not permit this, perhaps owing to the influence of its underground past, and they justified these methods by citing outside aggression. Today, however, the democratic spirit of Sandino must once again take hold of the minds and deeds of Sandinists. We must not allow creativity, freedom of individual thought, and collective consensus to be crushed. The democratization of the FSLN begins with respect for individuals and with not allowing people who seem to be one thing but who are quite the opposite to impose their unhealthy wills. The FSLN is opposed to dictatorship on principle. The FSLN emerged as the antithesis of Somoza's dictatorial system. A dictatorship is, in essence, the antithesis of democracy. Thus, dictatorship means imposition, a top-down hierarchy, arrogance, autocracy, violence, terror. This is why we in the FSLN must never allow any trace of dictatorship. On the contrary, all activists and the people must have confidence that our beliefs, our judgments, and our right to elect and be elected democratically are respected. Let us not allow leaders to be imposed on us. Let us democratize the FSLN. Let us bring in people who think and act democratically, leaders who have done a great deal for the party and the people and who have not made it a point to maintain their idolized image. Leaders who are in the vanguard of thinking, who look to the future, not to the past of violence. Leaders who think about a new Nicaragua. Leaders like Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado, who has worked without political propaganda, who has not availed himself of the FSLN's resources to cultivate his image. He shines with his own light. We Sandinists are thinking beings. The people are wise; they know how to distinguish what is good; a people who want a better future, a future of peace and of harmony. Carlos J. Vegacruz B.
