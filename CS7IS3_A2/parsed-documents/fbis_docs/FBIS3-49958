The Republic of Croatia can sign international agreements only for the territory it controls and that are not disputed. The government of the republic of Serbian Krajina sees the Geneva agreement between Croatia and Yugoslavia in this light. The CSCE documents do not imply the borders that the Croatian Government would like to have but those that it does have. The UN Charter, mentioned in the joint declaration of Yugoslavia and Croatia, has these regulations in mind, regulations that administer the peaceful solution to disputes and the right of nations to self-determination. This implies the will already expressed at the referendum by the people of the republic of Serbian Krajina, which is well known, not only once but on two occasions. The government of the republic of Serbian Krajina welcomes the peace processes on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and the normalization of relations between the Republic of Croatia and the FRY, in the belief that it will contribute to the establishment of peace along the borders between the republic of Serbian Krajina and the Republic of Croatia. I believe that this agreement opens vast possibilities of great interest to all the partners in the region. For example, in the infrastructure there are great possibilities for the use of the capacities that have been out of use for four years now. I believe that thus, in a peaceful way, we can solve these problems to everyone's advantage. I particularly think that there are no changes in the relations between the Republic of Croatia and the republic of Serbian Krajina. That is a problem that the republic of Serbian Krajina will solve in the best interests of the country through delegations, the government, the assembly, and other institutions. I believe that there should be more of such agreements, since if we are heading for peace such agreements can only benefit us.
