FR940928-0-00027 FR940928-0-00007 The commenter that supported the requirement believed that the monthly submission of a summary report for each month's collections would assist the INS in developing more accurate budgets and in allocating funds for staff and equipment as traffic patterns change. The INS continues to believe that, in order to improve its financial management of the IUFA, it must have some indication of fee remittances in advance of their receipt. Therefore, a report of net monthly collections will be required. As a result of the type and timing of remittance data available, there has been difficulty in making resource estimates. Remittances to INS represent passengers who purchased tickets during the remittance period, which is not necessarily the same period in which the passenger will travel. The INS data are limited to the number of persons inspected and actual remittances. Since the remittances are made on a quarterly basis, there is not timely information with which to make accurate collection projections. For example, even though the fiscal year starts on October 1, the first remittances for the fiscal year are not due until January 31 of each year. Historically, the bulk of these collections are received in February and accounting records report them in March. Hence, it is mid-March before any picture of actual collections comes into focus. The mid-point of the year is very late in the fiscal year to be making program and budget changes. Concerning the comment which suggested that the monthly reporting requirement and the statement which accompanies remittances are duplicative, INS believes that there is a misunderstanding concerning the purpose of each document. The monthly report is to serve as a predictor of the amount of funds to be received, while the remittance statement provides detailed information pertaining to a specific actual remittance. Each document has a separate, unique, and identifiable purpose. However, in response to the public's comments, INS is making the following changes. The INS will not require a reporting of the number of ticket sales, given issues related to commercial confidentiality. In addition, in order to ease the reporting burden, a report of remittances will be required only for carriers or ticket-selling agents whose fee collections exceed $50,000 a month. Further, in response to the issue of duplication of reporting requirements, INS is making an additional change. Since the quarterly remittance statement includes information for the last month in a given quarter, a separate monthly report will not be required for those months. This means that monthly reporting will be required for the months of October, November, January, February, April, May, July, and September. In order to allow more reporting time, the report will be due to INS on the last business day of the following month.
