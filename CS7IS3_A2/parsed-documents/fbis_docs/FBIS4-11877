The meetings are chaired by His Royal Highness [HRH] Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, minister for foreign affairs and chairman of the current session. At the beginning of the meeting, HRH minister for foreign affairs made the following speech: [Begin recording] [Faysal] In the name of God, the Compassionate and the Merciful, prayers and peace upon the prophets and messengers. Your Highnesses and excellencies, secretary general, respected brothers, God's peace and blessings upon you. It gives me great pleasure to express to you the warmest of welcomes to your country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; which is today pleased to welcome you in the GCC Ministerial Council fiftieth session. With God's assistance, I pronounce this session open, and would like to praise the elements of cooperation and solidarity existing among our countries, as exemplified in the most effective resolutions adopted by our leaders during the sessions of the GCC summits. [passage omitted] The field of bolstering military cooperation between the GCC states represented the most important issues discussed during the 14th summit. The higher council decided to set up a higher committee to implement resolutions pertaining to collective defense and military cooperation whose chairmanship will be assumed on a alternate basis by the GCC defense ministers. The committee will include the chiefs of staff and the chairman of the military committee of the GCC general-secretariat. The time has now come for the UAE to assume the chairmanship term. Brothers, our meeting takes place at a time when our Gulf region is still witnessing difficult and critical situations. The Iraqi regime continues its policy of violating and selecting all UN Security Council resolutions regarding its aggression against Kuwait; and its breaking of the UN Security Council 773 and 833 Resolutions which stipulated a demarcation of land and sea borders between Iraq and Kuwait, its continuation to keep as hostages Kuwaiti prisoners and other nationals thus violating international laws and appropriate UNSC resolutions. Also, Iran has again started to reiterate its claims of control and sovereignty over Greater and Lesser Tunb Islands and the island of Abu Musa, which belong to the UAE. However, we remain hopeful that Iran will respond to the voice of reason regarding the issue of the three islands and reach a final solution with the UAE through peaceful means; and in the process prove its sincere intention concerning its claims of good-neighborliness, development of friendly relations, and its desire for bilateral cooperation with GCC states. [end recording] HRH the minister for foreign affairs added that the GCC fiftieth session is taking place at time which is at best not reassuring, because the Iraqi regime continues to pose a threat to the security and stability of our countries. There are also threats aimed at destroying our cooperation council which represented the solid rock that quashed Iraq's ambitions and thwarted its ugly aggression. His highness went on to say that Iraq's latest efforts are represented in its large-scale campaign which it is conducting in the Arab arena, in an attempt to help lift the embargo imposed against it by the the UN Security Council resolution; and its attempt to re-establish relations without respecting and fully implementing these resolutions and recommendations. His highness added that it is absolutely crucial for our current meeting to issue resolutions that stress and underline our determined and strong stance regarding this matter, to close the door in the face of any such attempts. His highness said that our hearts continue to bleed profusely because of the ugly crime committed by the criminal Zionist settlers against defenceless and innocent worshippers in the sacred Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron; and its ensuing consequences and complications on the the peace process. Stemming from this, his highness went on to say, we call on the international community to shoulder its responsibility regarding the provision of protection for the Palestinians and the sacred places from the savagery of the Jewish settlers in the occupied land. Regarding Somalia, his highness said that we are still hopeful that the Somali leaders would be at the level of responsibility to implement what they had agreed upon in Nairobi, Kenya, to save their country from the ravages of a civil war and the tragedy of a deadly famine. His highness added that we also have not lost hope that the Afghan leaders would use the voice of reason and raise above their differences to spare Afghanistan from a total destruction. We also hope that the international community would continue to implement its promises to stop the criminal Serbs from implementing their criminal ethnic plans against Muslim Bosnians. His highness expressed his hope that the Bosnian Muslims and Croats would be able to reap the fruits of their confederation plan to live together in security, stability, and peace; hoping that this plan would convince the Serbs to join the peace efforts and accept the solutions which are on the negotiating table. In conclusion, his highness asked God to help them achieve success. Following this speech, the opening session was adjourned, and a meeting behind closed door was held.
