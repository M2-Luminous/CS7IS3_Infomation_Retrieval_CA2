Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU], Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], and Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] announced that they would put it at the top of the list of election campaign priorities. Nevertheless, internal security is in the background of public discussion. [Kanther] Not at all. We are not just complaining loudly but are doing practical work in the coalition. The point is success in the matter and not headlines. You can see that the issue is very important if you look at what we have achieved: The circumstances surrounding the antiterrorist action in Bad Kleinen have been clarified; we have presented a 1994 anticrime law; we have worked out the concepts for a law dealing with the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations and the Federal Border Police; the asylum problem has improved; the violent Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) has been banned; and the program for internal security has been adopted together with the laender. This is how I want to work. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Nevertheless, as a political issue internal security is not playing a big role. Is something true about the accusation being expressed secretly by some CDU/CSU politicians that Manfred Kanther does not really want to distinguish himself from the FDP and the SPD, that you are not interested in sharpening the conservative profile of the CDU/CSU? [Kanther] First, according to all polls, internal security is at the top of the list of issues in which citizens are interested, right behind economic issues. Second, I am pursuing a practical policy in which results are important, not some quarrel. We can be satisfied with the results of our work after nine months of my term of office; this sharpens the CDU/CSU profile regarding achievements -- and this is the important thing. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Is it so difficult to distinguish oneself from the SPD? Basically, their domestic policy concepts are no longer really so different from yours. [Kanther] I deny that. The SPD has indeed concurrently adopted a different attitude toward issues of internal security than in the past. The party leaders in particular are now realizing that crime, foreigners, and asylum are questions that are important to citizens and that it is impossible to make progress with the empty phrases used in the 1980's. However, it is still open whether the SPD is really determined to put its narrow party congress decisions into practice at the appropriate time. They will have ample opportunity to prove that in the Bundestag, when a vote is taken on the aforementioned draft laws. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] In other words: Regarding questions of internal security there is no longer the more liberal SPD on the one side and the more conservative CDU/CSU on the other? [Kanther] It is good that the SPD has come closer to the government in the fields of combating crime or asylum. In this way we can work more efficiently, and the Federal Government and the laender, the majority of which are ruled by the SPD and are largely responsible for the police and judiciary, have an easier time cooperating. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Has the SPD not already overtaken you? In contrast to the CDU and the CSU the party demands that assets are to be seized already when the owner cannot refute the suspicion that they have been acquired illegally. [Kanther] I think that this SPD demand is untenable in a constitutional state. It ignores the principle that the state must prove that a citizen is guilty and not the citizen that he is innocent. Rejection of this idea is unanimous among the experts. After all, the SPD's proposal smells strongly of election campaign. Only a few months ago did we make money laundering a punishable offense. There has been practically no experience yet with the new fine on assets and the so-called expanded forfeiture. Thus, it would be wrong to create new regulations before the newly introduced regulations have been tested. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] You and the CDU/CSU constantly speak of "exploding crime statistics," the "kraken of crime, which is stretching its arms out to everything." Of course, many crimes are committed. Nevertheless, it seems that the CDU/CSU is fanning fears to improve the social climate for ever stricter laws. Why else would you present the development of crime as worse than it actually is? [Kanther] It is an indisputable fact that more and more crimes are committed, and that they have reached a point that is unacceptable. We are not exaggerating anything; but we must accept reality and react with clear measures. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] The crime statics do not justify your drastic perspective. The number of registered crimes during the first half of 1993 rose by 3.4 percent; during the same period in 1992 we had an increase of 9.6 percent. This slower rate of increase is certainly not a reason to sound the all clear, but it should be reason enough not to continue frightening the many worried people with new depictions of the apocalypse, should it not? [Kanther] I read the statistics differently. For instance, I see that crime has skyrocketed in the new laender. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] This is primarily due to the fact that up to the period after the fall of the Wall, police there hardly kept any crime statistics and that the readiness of the east Germans to complain about crimes was negligible for a long time. Anyone who ignores all this pursues a "dubious and completely unnecessary dramatization," according to the renowned criminologist Christian Pfeiffer from Hamburg. Does this accusation concern you? [Kanther] Not at all. Unfortunately, crime is not declining but rising. There are still those who whitewash a bad situation and who often do not want to admit their own political errors. In addition, the point is not just the development of statistics. What the people feel is equally important, the feeling of safety and insecurity is conveyed at a broad level, primarily by the media. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Liberal lawyers criticize the "1994 Anticrime Law" as much too restrictive; your own people think it is too moderate. Mr. Werthebach, the president of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], for instance, complains that in the future, his office will be permitted to keep an eye only on political extremism and not organized crime. What do you say? [Kanther] The BfV is sufficiently busy with left-wing extremism and right-wing extremism and violence of foreigners in the FRG, in particular since it does not have that much personnel. Therefore, I do not see any reason to expand its competence to cover organized crime. The is the business of the police, which must be better equipped for that. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] In this year's Constitutional Protection Report you also did not classify the Republikaner as right-wing extremist. Is the examination of this issue so difficult because, among other things, the statements of some Republikaner are barely different from those of some CDU/CSU or SPD politicians? [Kanther] As interior minister I have the duty to examine the issue of classification very carefully from the juridical point of view, because a decision must hold up in court. So far, it has not been possible to prove that the Republikaner have a basic aggressive-militant attitude against the Constitution. In addition, there is not sufficient evidence that the party leadership tolerates or promotes political or criminal perpetrators in their own ranks. On the contrary. Many party functionaries have long restrained themselves verbally so that they cannot be attacked. Just because one feels like throwing up when one hears Mr. Schoenhuber's ranting, one cannot classify the Republikaner as extremist or ban them. This is the field of political conflict, which FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU has been demanding for 20 years in the struggle against political left-wing extremists in many different disguises. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Bavaria's minister-president warns against the "penetration of society by other races" and "lecherous niggers"; a CDU mayor states that, in order to balance the city budget, "a few rich Jews" would have "to be killed"; an SPD group chairman suggests a solution to the asylum problem: Make short work of it, grab them by the head and the collar and throw them out. And so on and so forth. Did you not classify the Republikaner as extremist because it is a political problem to measure them by their words, which are strongly similar to those of some CDU and SPD politicians? [Kanther] I consider such a question detestable and, therefore, I am not going to answer it. Back to the matter at hand: I can classify a party as extremist or ban it only if there is enough proof available. Imagine what would happen if the Republikaner sued against the classification as right-wing extremist and were to win: This would be a self-inflicted wound for democracy. However, I would also like to mention somebody else who bears responsible in connection with right-wing extremism: the media. In my view, coverage of the Republikaner is excessive. One constantly hears and reads what Mr. Schoenhuber said. However, only a few newspapers or television stations ask what is behind the empty phrases of the Republikaner chairman. One hears practically nothing about what the party suggests for the protection of internal security, for the solution of economic problems, and that it does not offer serious concepts for anything. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Does that meant that the media are to be blamed for the success of the Republikaner? Should one keep silent about the rightists? [Kanther] This would be completely wrong. However, journalists, too, must be aware of what their reports are doing. There is a narrow edge between necessary coverage and constant repetition of identical facts, which may then be transformed into free propaganda. There is no panacea for that. I think that many people in the media are not sufficiently aware of this sensitive situation. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Are the politicians of the CDU/CSU, FDP, and SPD sufficiently aware of how they have to deal with the right-wing radicals and right-wing extremists? We feel that the established parties tend toward adjusting toward the political right because they fear to lose voters. And we are also thinking of the endless discussions about joint television appearances and panel discussions with the Republikaner. [Kanther] The latter must be decided in each individual case. One thing quite clear, however: The democratic parties must never give the impression that we are cooperating with the Republikaner. The Hesse CDU, for instance, did not conclude one single agreement with the Republikaner on personnel decisions after the local elections in March 1993. However, the democratic parties must not make themselves dependent on what the Republikaner think. If the CDU or SPD were never again to initiate local policy without the approval of the Republikaner, the traditional parties would have to give up their work. This would be an absurd logic. By the way: At the local level one usually cannot deal with the radicals regarding material issues, because they are mostly either absent or lazy, uninformed, and torn by strife. In Hesse local policy there would be the opportunity to publicly deal with the Republikaner through motions on specific issues. This has not occurred because the Republikaner have not participated. It is important to explain this complete ineffectiveness to their voters. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Even if the Republikaner were not in some parliaments or did not have good prospects of entering a few more, we would nevertheless have to live with a certain potential for a basic right-wing extremist attitude in society and with right-wing extremists. How much right-wing extremism can a state such as the FRG tolerate? [Kanther] One has to put the question differently: How much extremism can a fundamentally liberal system afford? I think this depends on an overall assessment of the danger. We tolerated DKP [Communist Party of Germany] left-wing extremeists for 30 years, who were supported by a communist superpower. It was argued that one has to deal politically with these groups and persons. This also applies to dealing with right-wing extremism. Even if right-wing extremism were to decline to .01 percent, one would still have to live with these madmen, just as we live with the leftist madmen. The task consists in making political extremists of all shades completely ineffective politically. However, there is an additional danger that emanates from the right-wing extremists: Because of German history, it is viewed much more strongly by other countries and harms our international image. This is another central reason for me to deal with right-wing extremists.
