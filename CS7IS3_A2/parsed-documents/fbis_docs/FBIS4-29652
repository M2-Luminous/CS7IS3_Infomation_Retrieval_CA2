He said the state government viewed the movement's deviant activities seriously and would intensify efforts to explain to the people about the group. "We do not want to see the racial harmony enjoyed by the people under the Barisan Nasional government threatened by the movement," he said in response to Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's statement that the Al-Arqam movement had reached a level that may threaten national security. Speaking after attending a district-level Maal Hijrah [Hegira Muslim new year] celebration here yesterday, he said the state government would support any Federal Government action to curb the movement's activities. He said religious officers and mosque administrators in all districts would be asked to explain in detail to their congregation on where the movement went wrong. "In this way we will be able to check the movement's deviationist activities from spreading," he said, adding that the state government had banned the movement last year.
