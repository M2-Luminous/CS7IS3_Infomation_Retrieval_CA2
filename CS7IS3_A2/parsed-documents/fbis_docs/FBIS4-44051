Following the signing of the agreement with NATO, an agreement that for many sealed the end of the Cold War period, the Russian Federation aims to find in the Europe of the Sixteen the ally who will help it get out of its financial deadlock. [Yeltsin, in Russian with Greek translation in subtitles] When this agreement is completed, Russia will be given a way out. A new market opens up for the Russian economy and we will become equal partners for the mutual benefit of both sides. [Kafarakis] The historic agreement provides for a reduction of trade taxes and opens the road for negotiations after 1998 for the establishment of a free trade zone. It also gives a push to economic cooperation, exchanges of products and services, and political dialogue. [Yeltsin, in Russian with Greek translation in subtitles] I am grateful to Greece, which presides over the European Union, for everything that has happened in the past few weeks. [end recording]
