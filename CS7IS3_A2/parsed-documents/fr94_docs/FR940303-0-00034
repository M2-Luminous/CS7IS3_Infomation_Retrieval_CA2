FR940303-0-00034 FR940303-0-00011 Requirements for Making Carryover Allocations The proposed regulations provide guidance on the information needed for carryover allocation documents. A commentator suggested that the final regulations clarify whether a newly constructed building that receives an allocation of credit in different calendar years must have a separate Form 8609 for each allocation and, if so, whether the same building identification number (B.I.N.) should be used. The final regulations clarify that, in this and similar situations, a separate Form 8609 is necessary for both allocations and that the B.I.N. assigned to the building for the first allocation also is used for the subsequent allocation. Use by the General Public The legislative history of section 42 provides that residential rental units must be for use by the general public. Residential rental units are not for use by the general public, for example, if the units are provided only for members of a social organization or provided by an employer for its employees. The proposed regulations provide an exception for an employer-provided resident manager unit that is a facility reasonably required by a project. Commentators suggested that the exception for a resident manager unit be expanded to include a unit occupied by a full-time maintenance person. After further review, IRS the Service and the Treasury have concluded that the reference to a resident manager unit in the proposed regulations was inappropriate because the general public use requirement only applies to residential rental units. A unit that is occupied by a full-time resident manager or a full-time maintenance person is not a residential rental unit but is a facility reasonably required by a project. See Rev. Rul. 92&hyph;61, 1992&hyph;2 C.B. 7. Accordingly, the final regulations remove the reference to a resident manager unit. Utility Allowances A commentator suggested that the final regulations provide that in areas where there is a utility allowance increase without a corresponding increase in area median gross income, an owner may adjust the rent upwards so that rent receipts do not decrease below the minimum rent floor of section 42(g)(2)(A). Because a change of this nature requires an amendment to the statute, the final regulations do not adopt this suggestion. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of the proposed rulemaking for the regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Christopher J. Wilson, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries), Internal Revenue Service. However, other personnel from the IRS and the Treasury Department participated in their development.
