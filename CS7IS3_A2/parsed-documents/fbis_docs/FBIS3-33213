Commenting on the matter, Presidency Minister Oscar Alfredo Santamaria said it would be a mistake on the part of the United States to restrict aid to El Salvador. [Begin Santamaria recording] It must help other countries, but it seems to me that making this sort of assessment is a little premature. I think the United States has so much to win or lose in Latin America it will not establish conditions for certain actions that someone must carry out. I think that to continue the U.S. policy on aid or cooperation would be a grave mistake. [end recording] Santamaria said the U.S. Government must understand that the work by the Joint Group is based on confidentiality. [Begin Santamaria recording] The reference framework stated it was an investigation based on confidentiality. The commission cannot divulge a series of breakthroughs or partial results it may have achieved at some time. Therefore, we must also look at this from that standpoint. In other words, this is not a matter of not wanting to report. Instead, the work carried out by this commission has been in some way protected so that, by withholding it from the public, they will be spared from any difficult situation. Consequently, the other thing the U.S. delegate is referring to .... [pauses] nobody can force anybody. I already said every country is sovereign. [end recording] Atwood also said the United States will continue supporting the country regardless of the government that may be elected in the next elections. For the presidency minister, the decision by the Clinton administration on the matter is part of that country's sovereignty.
