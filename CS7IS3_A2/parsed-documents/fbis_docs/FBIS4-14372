In an exclusive interview with AL-QUDS, 'Urayqat ruled out the possibility of holding elections for the coming authority before the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and Jericho and their redeployment in the rest of the occupied territories and before the Israeli Civil Administration is dissolved. 'Urayqat disclosed that the date for these elections has been set for 15 October instead of July. He added: Any snag in the talks will lead to further delay. [passage omitted] 'Urayqat noted that the elections will be conducted under the patronage of the United Nations and the participation of the European Community, the Scandinavian countries, Japan, Canada, the United States, Russia, Egypt, and Jordan. On the cost of these elections, 'Urayqat said: We cannot itemize the expenses, but we are talking about training and equipment that might cost more than $44 million. 'Urayqat affirmed that during the talks, the Palestinian side proposed that the elected council comprise 100 members and insisted on this, because that is an internal Palestinian matter and no one has the right to object to it. [passage omitted] 'Urayqat emphasized that there were no lists of Palestinian voters and that it was impossible to hold a census before two years. He said: Therefore, we have officially asked Israel to hand us the population lists of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. Israel has agreed, in principle, to do so. 'Urayqat added: After receiving the lists, we will verify them. Then election cards will be distributed to everyone in his own district, including the residents of East Jerusalem who will participate in the elections both as voters and candidates like other residents of the occupied territories. As for the diaspora Palestinians, 'Urayqat said that the Oslo accord stipulates that the displaced persons listed in the 1967 census cannot participate in the elections for practical reasons which will not deprive them of their future status. In conclusion, 'Urayqat said that the 100 members elected to the self-rule council will automatically become members of the Palestine National Council.
