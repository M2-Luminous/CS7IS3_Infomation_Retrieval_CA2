An immediate threat of a breakdown in the ceasefire retreated when the leader of the Bosnian Serbs said his forces would withdraw their heavy weapons from Sarajevo after Russia pledged to provide 400 peacekeeping troops in the area. NATO has threatened air strikes against any artillery or heavy weapons around the Bosnian capital unless they are withdrawn at least 12 miles from the city or surrendered to the United Nations by midnight on Sunday [20 February]. Mr. Hurd said of the Russian move: "This fits in admirably with the NATO initiative. They sit well together and if this works on the ground, there is now a much better chance than before of avoiding air strikes because the heavy weapons will have been withdrawn or controlled." He told reporters in London: "If things turn out right on the ground, there will be a huge advance...but of course what counts is what happens not what is said." If there were "no significant shelling" by the time the deadline lapses on Sunday and the heavy weapons had been withdrawn or put under control, there would be "no need for air strikes." But he warned that the air strikes would go ahead if the UN terms were not met. He said: "There is now a real prospect of a nightmare coming to an end." Asked if the war in Sarajevo was about to end, he said: "There is a chance because of the NATO initiative, because of the way the troop contributors, including Britain, have responded and now because of the way the Russians have brought themselves back into the peace protest [as received] -- there is a chance of that." Mr. Hurd said he and the Prime Minister had been told during their trip to Russia this week that Moscow was willing to put in troops under the United Nations. Mr. Hurd, speaking outside his official residence in Carlton Gardens, said he and the Prime Minister had "spent hours" discussing the possibility of the Russians putting in troops when they met Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his ministers earlier this week. He had spoken to the American Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the French, German and Italian foreign ministers today by telephone about the importance of getting the Russians back into the peace process. "I think they felt a bit left out in the last two or three weeks. But I hope that is put right now," he said. "Russia is very much part of the answer to the Bosnian crisis. When the Prime Minister and I were in Moscow we urged the Russians to do all they could to get the Serbs into the right action and I'm delighted they've done so apparently to good effect," he said.
