Huang said that Taiwan expressed its concern about its huge trade deficit with Japan during the talks, and also discussed opening its market to Japanese agricultural products, alcohol and tobacco. Japan, although supportive of Taiwan's bid to enter GATT, expressed the hope that Taiwan would move faster in opening its markets, Huang added. (Huang said that Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan rose above US$15 billion in the past 15 months. He said he asked the Japanese side to lower import barriers to facilitate foreign exports. Japanese negotiators responded that Japan would begin substantive measures in June to increase imports in line with economic reforms. Taiwan also proposed that the two sides hold regular trade consultations, similar to those held between Taiwan and the European Union and the United States. Japan replied that it would consider the proposal. Huang said that Japan asked Taiwan to end discriminatory treatment on imports of Japanese agricultural products, automobiles, alcohol and tobacco. On agricultural products, Taiwan asked for a six-year grace period before allowing the import of Japanese fruits, but Japan rejected the proposal and further negotiations are necessary, Huang said. On imports of Japanese automobiles, Taiwan said that it would allow the imports of Japanese cars with engine sizes of 3000 cubic centimeters and above by the end of this year, Huang added. Huang also said that Japan would submit a list of proposed tariff cuts for Taiwan during a mid-May meeting of the GATT fifth working party reviewing Taiwan's membership bid. Taiwan applied for GATT membership in January 1990 and was given observer status in September 1992. It hopes to become a full member by the end of the year.
