FR940812-2-00187 FR940812-2-00068 Guidance for a Proposed License Amendment To Implement an Alternate Steam Generator Tube Repair Limit for Outside Diameter Stress Corrosion Cracking at the Tube Support Plate Intersections 1. Introduction This guidance provides the NRC staff position on the implementation of the voltage-based repair criteria in steam generators designed by Westinghouse for outside diameter stress corrosion cracking (ODSCC) located at the tube-to-tube support plate intersections. This guidance is not applicable to other forms of steam generator tube degradation nor is it applicable to ODSCC that occurs at other locations with the steam generator. The voltage-based repair criteria have been developed for, and are currently applicable only to, Westinghouse-designed steam generators with 2.2 cm [7/8-inch] or 1.9 cm [3/4-inch] diameter tubes with drilled hole tube support plates (TSPs). Application of the alternate repair criteria to other vendor designed steam generators would require both the development and NRC staff review and approval of a comparable data base and the associated correlations for each vendor steam generator type. The NRC staff wants to emphasize that while the NRC has approved the implementation of the voltage-based repair methods described in this generic letter as a short-term measure, this guidance should not be construed to discourage the development and use of better acquisition techniques, eddy current technology, and eddy current data analysis. The staff strongly encourages the industry to continue to improve the NDE of steam generator tubes. 1.a␣ODSCC The voltage-based repair criteria are applicable only to indications at support plate intersections where the degradation mechanism is dominantly axial ODSCC with no significant cracks extending outside the thickness of the support plate. For purposes of this guidance, OSDCC refers to degradation whose dominant morphology consists of axial stress corrosion cracks which occur either singularly or in networks of multiple cracks, sometimes with limited patches of general intergranular attack (IGA). Circumferential cracks may sometimes occur in the IGA affected regions resulting in a grid-like pattern of axial and circumferential cracks, termed cellular corrosion. Cellular corrosion is assumed to be relatively shallow (based on available data from tube specimens removed from the field), transitioning to dominantly axial cracks as the cracking progresses in depth. The circumferential cracks are assumed (based on available data) not to be of sufficient size to produce a discrete, crack-like circumferential indication during field nondestructive examination (NDE) inspections. Thus, the failure mode of ODSCC is axial and the burst pressure is controlled by the geometry of the most limiting axial crack or array of axial cracks. It is also assumed for purposes of this guidance that the ODSCC is confined to within the thickness of the tube support plate, based on available data from tube specimens removed from the field. Very shallow microcracks are sometimes observed on these specimens to initiate at locations slightly outside the thickness of the tube support plate; however, these microcracks are small compared to the cracks within the thickness of the support plate and are too small to produce an eddy current response. Confirmation that the degradation mechanism is dominantly axial ODSCC should be accomplished by periodically removing tube specimens from the steam generators and by examining and testing these specimens as specified in Section 4 of this guidance. The acceptance criteria should consist of demonstrating that the dominant degradation mechanism affecting the burst and leakage properties of the tube is axially oriented ODSCC. In addition, results of inservice inspections with motorized rotating pancake coil (MRPC) probes should be evaluated in accordance with Section 3.b of this guidance to confirm the absence of detectable crack-like circumferential indications and detectable ODSCC indications extending outside the tube support plate thickness. 1.b␣Exclusion of Intersections The voltage repair criteria of this guidance do not apply to intersections meeting the criteria discussed below: 1.b.1␣The repair criteria do not apply to support plate intersections where the tubes may potentially collapse or deform following a postulated loss-of-coolant accident plus safe shutdown earthquake event (e.g., intersections located near the wedge supports at the upper tube support plates). Licensees should perform or reference an analysis that identifies which intersections are to be excluded. 1.b.2␣The repair criteria do not apply to tubes support plate intersections having dent signals greater than 5 volts as measured with the bobbin probe. 1.b.3␣The repair criteria do not apply to intersections where there are mixed residuals of sufficient magnitude to cause a 1-volt ODSCC indication (as measured with a bobbin probe) to be missed or misread. 1.b.4␣The repair criteria do not apply to the tube-to-flow distribution baffle plate intersections. 2. Tube Integrity Evaluation Licensees should perform an evaluation prior to plant restart to confirm that the steam generator tubes will retain adequate structural and leakage integrity until the next scheduled inspection. The first portion of this evaluation, referred to as the conditional burst probability calculation, assesses the voltage distribution left in service against a threshold value of 1×10 ^2 probability of rupture under postulated main steam line break (MSLB) conditions. The conditional burst probability calculation is intended to provide a conservative assessment of tube structural integrity during a postulated MSLB occurring at end-of-cycle 2 (EOC). It is used to determine whether the NRC needs to focus additional attention on the particular voltage repair limit application. If the calculated conditional burst probability exceeds 1×10 ^2 , the licensee should notify the NRC per the guidance provided in Section 6 of this guidance. 2 For the purposes of this guidance, ``cycle'' refers to the operating cycle between two scheduled steam generator inspections. Operating cycle and inspection cycle are used interchangeably.
