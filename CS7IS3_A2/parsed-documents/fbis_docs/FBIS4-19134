The latest decisions have made it clear that the 12 states that concluded a treaty in Maastricht can be accompanied on their path toward further European cooperation by Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway. What remains is to work to have the people of these four states seize this opportunity courageously. The history of European integration has been a story of success up to now, the luster of which seems to be visible only to those outside. Peace, cooperation across borders, and prosperity for most people are part of this success story. It continues: The accession of the Scandinavian states and Austria strengthens those who have long been working for the realization of a social union and an environmental union. A country like Austria, for instance, strengthens those in the EU who are of the opinion that European traffic policy must finally take the interests of nature and the environment into account. This also benefits the people in Germany. We, too, do not want endless streams of traffic rolling along German highways in the growing single market. With the accession of these four former EFTA [European Free Trade Association] states, however, the bell also tolls the hour of truth for the governments of the member states themselves. The question is: What kind of Europe do we want? A Europe that is based on the principle of mere national cooperation between its governments and on a free trade zone? Or a Europe that can shape economic, social, ecological, and political matters, that is, one that wants to be more than the sum of its member states? In view of the globalization of problems and the internationalization of developments, the answer seems quite clear to me. All the more surprised one must be about those voices in the German discussions that, following the pattern of national-conservative thinking, call European integration into question as no longer necessary after the realization of German unification. Such a position, however, grossly contradicts -- quite in contrast to its public justification -- Germany's interests. It is bad that such positions are meanwhile also being advocated by parts of one government party in Germany, and that against its better knowledge, just to preserve its political power. This means the danger of a radicalizing nationalism that shifts toward the right and entails dangers just like those that arose after the first German unification 120 years ago. Loosening Germany's European integration would mean the formation of new "alliances" and thus new isolation. Economic prosperity, too, requires European integration. The economic benefits of an integrated Europe are hardly questioned any longer now. The preservation of European competitiveness in the triad and the possibilities of a common research and development policy, the necessary economic policy coordination, and initiatives for growth and stability in Europe will not work without an EU that is capable of action. More integration is also necessary to facilitate a social dimension in Europe. The conditions of the single market may lead to serious deregulations and social dumping if common minimum standards are not ensured. So far, Great Britain has been blocking potential progress in this field -- a comfortable state of affairs, since in this way none of the other 11 member states is forced to state its sociopolitical intentions clearly. Chernobyl has shown that environmental pollution does not stop at borders. Therefore, setting down ecological standards must not remain a national matter; after all, common survival is at stake. Freedom and democracy, a rule-of-law state, the protection of minorities, economic development, and social justice are the bases for the preservation of internal and external peace throughout Europe. Today the observation of human rights, basic freedoms, democracy, and the principles of a rule-of-law state is no longer exclusively part of a state's internal affairs but are affairs that concern all the CSCE member states. The EU is currently leading this process through political integration. In economic and ecological terms a national state is no longer sovereign, anyway. Europe's citizens have high expectations for the EU and justified expectations regarding the EU's benefits for their personal concerns. An EU that is not transparent and removed from the citizens and could not legitimize its actions in the eyes of its 350 million citizens cannot be successful. The EU needs reform to the head and the limbs, if it is not to become incapable of action. Not only is it necessary to strengthen further the European Parliament's rights to participate in decisionmaking, but also to adhere strictly to the principle of subsidiarity. Most problems can be solved more appropriately at the local, laender, or national level. The EU must become more transparent and democratic. The desirable strengthening of the political role of the EU, the European Commission, and its more effective control by the European Parliament, the necessary majority decisions in the Council of Ministers on all issues of European legislation can probably be achieved only if future conferences for restructuring the contractual bases of the EU also have national parliaments and the European Parliament participating. Therefore, it would be a fatal mistake if the conference, which is to review the Maastricht Treaties in 1996, were to be prepared once again in the old way of "secret government conferences." Rather, it should provide the opportunity to hold a large-scale public debate in our country in 1995 about the further development of Europe. Any new contractual shaping of the EU must be made subject to a vote by the people in Germany and in the other EU member states. The idea of democracy comes from Europe. The EU is to become a model of democracy, transparency, participation, and responsibility. The alternative would be: a failed hope and -- violence, because disintegration produces violence, as we see every day.
