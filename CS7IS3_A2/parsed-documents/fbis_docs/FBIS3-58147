It is necessary to re-establish the truth and to see to it that these slanders are not allowed to cast "absolutely unjustified shadows" over the landscape at a time already fairly harrowing for the nation's institutions, he said. Renewed and immediately denied allegations by former Sisde domestic secret service treasurer Maurizio Broccoletti, interrogated after his extradition from Montecarlo this past week, of money for government politicians and a top-level cover-up, have also involved President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and two recent interior ministers, in addition to the present holder of the interior portfolio. All have firmly denied the allegations and, yesterday, Mancino asked national police chief Vincenzo Parisi to stay in his post despite reports that he, too, had been placed under investigation by the magistrates handling the Sisde probe. According to Assistant Prosecutor Michele Coiro, new testimony from ex-Sisde officials naming Mancino would be sent to the Ministers' Tribunal responsible for judging cases filed against government ministers. Interviewed for the TG1 [First News Brodcast] newscast on the RAI [Italian State Radio and Television] first channel, Coiro said the testimony contained no new facts, but had to be passed on so that the tribunal would enjoy "the fullness of information." He added that the prosecutor's office is arguing simply that Mancino has no case to answer. Legal sources also pointed out that a prosecutor has an official duty to enter a name on the list of those entering an enquiry, even if only because they are subject to accusation in the testimony of someone undergoing questioning. "It's a purely formal act," Coiro pointed out. "As the chief prosecutor has already explained, in the very moment when a request was filed to shelve the allegation, he decided it was pointless to enter Minister Mancino on the register." Earlier, Chief Prosecutor Vittorio Mele told reporters that Broccoletti's allegations of top-level meetings to cover up the misuse of Sisde funds concerned meetings or "separate encounters," in any case not held at the Quirinale presidential residence. In his interview, Coiro said neither he nor his colleagues could report Broccoletti's statements in detail, but he confirmed that both Broccoletti and former Sisde director Riccardo Malpica had mentioned the meetings. As some MPs from the governing majority started voicing fears that the situation may be too obscure to allow President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to go ahead with calling elections, Coiro also confirmed the existence of "facts" suggesting an attempt at destabilising the institutions. In particular, he said most media had carried the report of Broccoletti's alleged reference to three cover-up meetings when this was in fact "an absolutely false item of news." He also said a similar argument had been applied to leaks that Police Chief Vincenzo Parisi was on the list of those under investigation. "A group of magistrates is investigating the question, trying to see if there is anything in this attack on the president's prerogatives," he reported, "to try and understand who and why." In a lengthy interview with ANSA, Mancino said of the Parisi case that, whether or not the entry on the list of those who have entered into an enquiry was secret or public, it allows "no-one to throw even a shadow on the person in question." Being entered on the register authorises no-one to "even advance a suspicion against the chief-of-police or anyone else in the same position," he said, although he admitted that the situation would change if the person was moved from the list of those entering an enquiry to those who have been notified they are under investigation for a given crime. Someone can naturally be re-examined, but a `new fact' would be needed," Mancino said, charging that he had "never known the truth" from Malpica, who was director of Sisde from February 1987 to August 1991. Mancino, who supported Malpica for his subsequent appointment as special government commissioner in Turin, added that the ex-Sisde head "enjoyed the whole Interior Ministry's esteem." "When we spoke of the question of Sisde's funds, he seemed to me to be a third party extraneous to the appropriation of public funds, but I was told there were secret service cover or guarantee certificates (for the funds)," said Mancino of charges that the accused secret service officials are withholding 14 billion lire in government money, but had claimed the existence of certificates proving they held the money on the intelligence services' behalf. "...I had no interest in covering up operations for the appropriation of public funds, nor did I have any interest in covering up for Malpica, also because at the time, I was unaware of any eventual responsibilities on his part." The Interior Minister also claimed that he had "never known" what secret service cover or guarantee certificates were before his conversations with secret service officials on the 14 billion lire. Adding that he was someone who found "great difficulty" in reading his own bank account, Mancino commented: "I may be regarded as being inexpert, but someone who is unaware of how the mechanism of these cover certificates works can hardly be called to account for a defensive line concerning them." But if this is what Malpica is in fact arguing, Mancino added, "he is lying, and knows he is." Mancino was equally adamant about reported allegations that he was one of the Interior Ministers who had received personal bonus payments from the secret funds or had taken part in cover-up meetings. Of the first, he said: "No-one ever mentioned these support payments to me. No-one ever proposed support payments to me, and I would in any case have turned them down. No-one will ever be able to argue the contrary." On the second, he said: "I have never taken part (in meetings of this kind) at the Quirinale, the Interior Ministry, or anywhere else. No-one will ever be able to show that I brought together a few prefects in order to cover for persons whom I didn't even know." In addition, he denied ever having given advice to anyone on the Sisde affair or agreed to a line of defence in it: "I have always had bilateral meetings (with Interior Minister officials) for duties inherent in my office...and I have always hoped that the magistrates were informed of the issues discussed in the same terms in which Prefect Finocchiaro and later Prefect Malpica too explained them to me." Admitting that some people purvey "incomplete or distorted" information, Mancino agreed that the political situation was "shot through with not always clear, probably turbid interests" which, by putting his name in the headlines in connection with facts about which he knew nothing, harm "my person, the institutions, the general context..." "Certainly, we are living through a transitional phase which should be seconded within respect for the institutional rules. This transition is encouraged by some, desired by others, and opposed by still others. One should see, then if among the latter, there aren't some interests being cultivated to weaken the image of the state and the institutions, in order to weaken the constitutional and institutional organs." On his term at the Interior Ministry, Mancino said he put "intellectual honesty, firmness and determination" into the job. He also claimed not to have favoured the traditional policies, citing in particular the fact that he had dissolved "over fifty" city councils in order to break the link between elected officials and organised crime. He also claimed credit for motivating the police, contributing to the capture of long-sought criminals, and "firing point-blank" at "secret lodges and other deviations against democratic order." "In short," he asserted, "I can hardly deny that I have delivered blows, and heavy ones at that."
