Ortega Interviewed on Pending Retirement, New Military Code PA1605204794 PA1605204794 BFN [Editorial Report] Managua Canal Cuatro Television in Spanish at 0430 GMT on 14 May broadcasts a 75-minute interview with Nicaraguan General Humberto Ortega, chief of the Sandinist People's Army (EPS), by Canal Cuatro News Director Manuel Espinosa Henriquez at the station's studios in Managua. The interview is live or recorded. Espinosa begins the interview by asking Ortega why 21 February 1995 was chosen as the date for his retirement. The general replies the date is the result of the two-year process under which the new military code was drawn up. Ortega says: "The agreement we reached has now become very important for the nation's stability." He adds: "My retirement, which has been highly politicized, has been practically resolved within the framework of the military code and within a framework of a solution acceptable to the executive, as well as to the EPS." When asked whether he chose the date of his retirement or whether President Violeta Chamorro chose it, Ortega replies that the date was agreed upon by the two sides. The general says he had agreed with President Chamorro to confirm his retirement date and to unveil the new draft Military Organization Law in the afternoon of 18 May. Ortega says: "What is most important is that this is being done based on an understanding and a rapprochement that takes important considerations into account." Espinosa continues by asking Ortega whether other EPS officers will also be retiring. Ortega replies that, at this time, no one else will be retiring, because junior officers still need to be trained to fill upper-level positions. Ortega adds that he had never planned to stay in the Army his entire life. The discussion turns to the amount of time the next EPS chief will remain in the post. Ortega says an agreement has been reached on the tenure of this post, which will run about the same length as the presidential term of five years. In response to a follow-up question, Ortega says the choice of the new EPS chief will be based on the military career of various candidates, adding that the chief will be chosen from the High Military Command. After Espinosa asks who indeed will be chosen to replace him as commander of the EPS, Ortega says the Military Council will review and examine the merits of all candidates, and it will then present its findings to the president in accordance with the military code. Ortega adds that he will be leaving the Army with the satisfaction of knowing he has fulfilled his role. Espinosa then questions Ortega on his plans following retirement. The general responds by saying any position he might hold as a civilian will not prevent him from "contributing to the freedom and full democracy" that Nicaragua has yet to enjoy. Ortega says he will devote himself to working with those who are interested in finding a solution to the critical situation facing Nicaragua. He says: "I honestly am not interested in becoming actively involved in any specific political post. Instead, I feel the duty and the need, as a Nicaraguan, to contribute to finding the right road for Nicaragua." Ortega adds: "There is a serious problem here; it is the problem of trust. If there is no trust, if the EPS -- now that it has its code -- is not given an opportunity to demonstrate that it is truly a national army that does not answer to any partisan interests, then we will always live in a climate of insecurity and will continue living with instability." In response to a question on whether he plans to return to the Sandinist ranks, Ortega says he will continue on the revolutionary road from a "very individualistic position." Ortega notes that since the Chamorro government took office, members of the EPS have not been members of the Sandinist political wing. He adds: "All of us who are members of the EPS are revolutionaries. Some radical Sandinists accuse us of being traitors." He continues: "These same people are launching a campaign that says the EPS cannot be trusted, because we do not answer to a party as in the past regime. I am against the EPS being under political leadership. This is very dangerous." When the discussion turns to the relationship between the Army and the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN), Ortega warns if Sandinist leaders attempt to influence the Army, the Army will distance itself from them and a civil war among Sandinists will follow. Ortega adds: "At this time, the FSLN can be split into as many factions as it wants. The Army will not break up over or follow any Sandinist leader." Asked about the risks posed to the nation by a division within the FSLN, Ortega says there have been extremists in the FSLN throughout his tenure as EPS commander. Some of these extremists have criticized the Army for failing to conform to their political position. He reiterates that the Army "should not follow anyone within the FSLN" but, rather, remain committed to the good of the Nicaraguan people. Ortega goes on to note that the draft Military Organization Law is important because, although it is not perfect, it lays the groundwork for a national Army and the construction of a democratic system. Next, Ortega denies having said in December that he had presidential aspirations, adding that he would consider such a possibility only at an appropriate time and under the right conditions. He adds: "My greatest aspiration is for Nicaragua to attain complete peace and to establish a course of stability leading to a more rapid reconstruction of the homeland. I think this is the most important thing. I would like to be part of a group of Nicaraguans who work to achieve this goal. I do not necessarily have to be the top leader of this effort and then be rewarded with a presidential candidacy. I am not looking forward to becoming a presidential candidate." Espinosa then asks Ortega about the situation in northern Nicaragua, where the EPS continues to clash with armed groups linked to the recontras. Espinosa adds that the EPS is being accused of committing abuses in the north. Ortega says steps are being taken "to correct this situation," noting that the Army has a duty to continue fighting in the area to keep the armed groups in check. Ortega continues by explaining he was originally named defense minister because he could contribute to a rapprochement between the executive branch and the Army. He adds: "I was then removed from the ministry because I was a Sandinist, as if being a Sandinist is tantamount to being evil. This did not help create the desired stability. As of now, unfortunately, there is no civilian who is politically qualified to occupy that post." He says that talks are being held with institutes to train civilians from various political parties to assist in this task. The interview continues with Ortega saying the defeat of the Somoza regime was the Sandinists' greatest success. He decries the fact that the Chamorro government was incapable of preserving the unity that prevailed after Somoza's defeat to rebuild the country. After stressing the fact that the country is indeed divided, Ortega says: "What is needed here is to secure a national unity solution in which every sector will be represented." Ortega says that joint efforts must be made to reach a national agreement in order that the next administration's economic policy will not be so burdensome. He says a national dialogue must be promoted to find solutions as soon as possible. He says: "Sandinism, which is such an important sector of society, should seek an adequate program for the needs of the country, thinking of the interests of the country, instead of ideological or sectarian interests. This will encourage other sectors to do the same." In discussing national unity further, Ortega says: "We Nicaraguans must realize it is necessary that we understand one another. Otherwise, the only path that will be left to us is to continue to kill one another and destroy one another. Not even the most fanatical individuals want this. I believe that not even those labeled the most fanatical extremists in a given party want war or more violence. They want more order and security. "What is happening is that this feeling is growing as the election period draws near. Therefore, the approaching election apparently does not encourage the best conditions. In ideal conditions, as in a laboratory, for example, all of us -- Daniel Ortega, Arnoldo Aleman, Virgilio Godoy, conservatives, Social Christians, in short, everyone, including Pablo Antonio Cuadra and the cardinal -- would work toward rapprochement. This is the least common denominator needed to prevent the destruction of this country." When asked about constitutional reform, Ortega says: "We must make the adjustments by reforming the Constitution. Therefore, a constitutional reform obliges us all to have the laws and instruments, so that, whether or not we like it, the police and the Army will ensure compliance with the laws. More important is that we appeal to the conscience of the people to secure such an agreement. I think this is what is important, to reach an agreement and to find solutions." Ortega concludes with a final message: "Despite all of the complexities, Nicaraguans over the past 20 years have at least demonstrated that they have more virtues than defects. I think we Nicaraguans have the duty to tell all Nicaraguans before the end of this century that we are capable of working together to reconstruct the nation."
