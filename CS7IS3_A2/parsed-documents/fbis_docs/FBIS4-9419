Can we really discern such a change? [Goscinski] Claims of having entered the path of economic growth were made even earlier that that, by Hanna Suchocka. I believe that talk about economic growth is an exaggeration, but it is fairly certain that we are no longer facing the threat of a recession, and there also are some signs of economic revival. Industrial output in February of this year was more than 10 percent higher than in February of last year. Nevertheless, it was still lower than in February 1989. [Socha] Even so, we can presumably take it for granted that recession has been overcome, can we not? [Goscinski] We have had so many months of successive growth that it can be regarded as a definite tendency. However, in my opinion, for the time being this trend is based on weak foundations because there is an absence of significant investment. Present outlays on investment, in both the state and the private sector, do not even ensure simple reproduction. Consequently, the technical condition of enterprises deteriorates steadily and that does not bode well in the long run. We can expect an economic boost when outlays on investment begin to grow faster than production. [Socha] Prof. Rosati presented the tenets of his socioeconomic policy in the national press. How do you view his concepts? Is their author the person who can provide the answer our economy currently needs? [Goscinski] Let me tell you what I think in perfectly unequivocal terms: Of all the economists I know, Rosati is to all intents and purposes the only one who has recently presented a sensible proposal that will give a realistic chance for our economy. It is hard for me to ascertain whether his administrative talents would make him a good prime minister or minister. He has not yet had a chance to prove himself in such a way. In this, we are reminded of Leszek Balcerowicz before him: After all, Balcerowicz, who was also a practising academic, later demonstrated that he was also a good administrator. Rosati seems to resemble him in this aspect. This is not to say that I believe that Marek Borowski [recently dismissed finance minister] was a worse proposition, but I am still personally inclined to value Rosati more. [Socha] What do you believe to be the strongest point of his blueprint? [Goscinski] First of all, his emphasis on the need to invest. Second, the absence of a fiscal angle, which was, unhappily, demonstrated by all of the earlier deputy prime ministers responsible for the economy. Rosati is the fist one who says that there is no need to increase taxation. On the contrary, he says the opposite. This year nothing more can be done in this matter anyway. The budget is as it is. And, if the president fails to sign the budget, I believe the Sejm will find the strength to reject the president's veto by a majority of two-thirds of all votes. The state cannot function without a budget, and it is pointless to go on using interim solutions. However, if Rosati is able to put his plan into practice next year, a decrease in tax liabilities would be quite realistic. This would, in any case, be closely connected with tax concessions for investment projects. You cannot strangle the economy with the taxation noose and then expect people to be willing to invest. [Socha] GAZETA WYBORCZA promotes the view, articulated in its columns by Janusz Jankowiak, that Rosati is opposed to Balcerowicz's ideas. [Goscinski] I do not share this opinion. I believe that Rosati's program would reinforce the functioning of free market principles in the economy, counteract inflation, and, at the same time, promote economic growth. After all, Rosati would not start from the same point of departure as Balcerowicz: He would begin at a point long after the one where Balcerowicz stopped. [Socha] It seems rather obvious that the new finance minister must take into account both the positive and the negative results of the decisions made by his predecessors. [Goscinski] Precisely. After all, a crisis of the public finance system had already begun toward the end of Bielecki's administration and was manifested with full strength during the Suchocka government; after all, a budget deficit usually grows with the speed of an avalanche. Please compare the balance of the 1992, 1993, and 1994 budgets. You will see that the sum doubles each time, while the inflation rate is no more than 30-odd percent. This means that the state's share in both public income and public expenditure keeps growing all the time. This is precisely the anti-Balcerowicz situation. However, it is not Dariusz Rosati or Marek Borowski that Mr. Balcerowicz should congratulate for this state of affairs: It is Suchocka and Osiatynski because it was they who created it. [Socha] On the one hand, the average citizen keeps hearing about the new economic growth, so he naturally expects to see its effects influence the contents of his wallet, and, on the other, he keeps hearing about a "budgetary gap." He is made to pay ever higher taxes, while, at the same time, he is informed that there is not enough money in the kitty for hospitals, social welfare provisions, the upgrading of old age and disability pensions, the police, the Army, and virtually everything else. Consequently, many people ask themselves where their money really goes.... [Goscinski] Here, as it happens, I would be inclined to agree with Janusz Korwin-Mikke [Union for Real Politics chairman]. The more the state takes from and redistributes among its citizens, the worse the consequences for the public. Public officials are really not best qualified to decide what our money should be spent on. Of course, we cannot count on the assumption that the public sector expenditure will increase in the coming years. On the contrary, it is inevitable that the public will be burdened with the requirement to pay for an increasing number of public services. The problem lies in the fact that, at the same time, we are forced to launch new schemes and ventures, which we cannot afford and which could perfectly well have been put on the back burner to await better times, such as the unfortunate brainchild of Suchocka's administration--that is, the creation of new districts. Just think how much money was sunk in that project. And what about each successive election campaign we have had? We know very well that trillions of zlotys [Z] were spent on them! And all in order to ensure that relations between individual power agencies were shaped in this or that way, according to the manipulators' intentions. The public has not benefited from any of that in any way. On the contrary, you could say that it is forced to meet the costs of the state's upkeep because the state does not know how to manage its resources.... [Socha] The economy is nowadays regarded increasingly as a field for political maneuvering or even political skirmishes. To begin with, Deputy Prime Minister Borowski became a casualty of this state of affairs. Now, the president seems to have eliminated Rosati from the competition even before the start of the game.... [Goscinski] It is not only the economy that is receiving such treatment--it is also the entire political system. A friend of mine from Canada asked me recently whether I saw even one true politician among all of the people involved in the discharge of power nowadays. I told him I did not--and he replied that he was fully in agreement with me. As he watched the situation from his distant position in Canada, for a short while after the 19 September [1993] election he pinned some hopes on Kwasniewski, who at that time was dubbed a likely "super prime minister." Unfortunately, Kwasniewski has shown himself to be a less than mediocre politician. After all, the Borowski affair began when Kwasniewski was absent on a visit to Davos. And immediately afterward, if I remember correctly, he went to Brussels, where he was as much use as a goat in a field of cabbage: just another deputy leading a group of delegates from his party's parliamentary caucus. Even as Borowski was offering to resign his post, he was convinced, in his political naivete, much as Clemenceau was in 1912, that his resignation would not be accepted and that he was actually holding everyone in check. The moves in these two political games were virtually identical. Kwasniewski returned from his trips abroad; he then assured reporters, who swarmed around him as he was leaving Pawlak's office, that everything was in order; then, in the evening, toward the end of the TV news program, Pawlak announced that he accepted Borowski's resignation. This was tantamount to a government crisis. However, at the same time, the Lillehammer Olympic games were starting--and, of course, Mr. Kwasniewski's attendance was absolutely indispensable there. So he left the whole mess behind and went to spend almost a week at Lillehammer. Surely this demonstrates complete political irresponsibility! Just imagine a situation where, in the face of the eruption of a major fire, the chief fire-fighting officer says: "I will attend to putting it out when I come back from my vacation." At that moment, Kwasniewski forever condemned himself in my eyes as a politician. If he had been president, the situation would have been just as bad as it is now with Walesa in that office. Neither one nor the other has the political imagination to visualize the consequences of his various political actions a week, a month, six months, or a year later. They just do not have what it takes to be a statesman. [Socha] In view of the president's position, it would seem that there is not much point for the government coalition to go on insisting on Prof. Rosati's candidacy for the post of finance minister. [Goscinski] Unless someone intends to provoke a deliberate conflict with the Belweder and use Rosati as a pretext. [Socha] Even so, we should still regret if not the man, then his concept, which, if your prognoses were to come true, could bring us clear economic advantages. [Goscinski] I believe that the president is actually interested in keeping the government as weak as possible. The stronger the government's social, economic, and political position, the more difficult it will be for Walesa to play his games with it. Whenever I hear anyone claim that what is at stake is Poland's interests or reasons of state, I cringe because it usually turns out that it is only someone's particular interests that are at stake. [Socha] As I observe the number of sensible people who remain on the margins of political life and see that the supposed democratic mechanisms offer them no discernible support, I begin to fear more and more that we will either continue drifting in this way indefinitely or some compulsory shock therapy will have to be applied. [Goscinski] THis is precisely what Lech Walesa is hoping for. In his eyes, such drifting--that is, indefinitely preventing a cohesive power apparatus from functioning properly--means that the only solution possible is an enlightened absolutism. [Socha] But how many people would be inclined to see the embodiment of such "enlightened absolutism" in the person of Lech Walesa? [Goscinski] I do not believe he realizes this. Politicians who are aware of their intellectual limitations are not particularly dangerous. The real danger is posed by those who are in love with themselves--and, which is worse, who reciprocate the sentiment! [Socha] Professor, I keep returning stubbornly to economic issues. What happens to the economy when it is, as at present, left, so to speak, to its own devices? [Goscinski] If it were left to its own devices, it would most probably not suffer too much damage, if I may say so. When that happens, the economy usually continues functioning, powered by the momentum of its own mechanisms. The problem is that, in our case, it is not left to its own devices. The other ministers in office keep up their activities, and each of them pulls in his own direction. You cannot say that there is no governmental intervention at all. But there is the absence of a conceptual center that would watch over the whole. And Prime Minister Pawlak does not have sufficient economic knowledge, which he would need to have if he were to discharge the role of the head of such a center, or that of a coordinator of our economic policy. [Socha] Who, apart from Rosati, could possibly fill the existing vacancy to good effect? [Goscinski] In my opinion, the vacancy will not be filled now. We will have to wait until the presidential election. And, if Walesa is reelected then, we will be justified in commiserating with one another. [Socha] So it does not really matter at all who holds the posts of deputy prime minister and finance minister until then? [Goscinski] The president is not interested in a strong government. He is interested in a good political arrangement with Pawlak because you just cannot fight everyone all the time. In his turn, Pawlak is not at all interested in having the economy run on behalf of the government by a good economist from the ranks of the the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], or found by the SLD. [Socha] Is it because a good economist would make it difficult for him to fulfill the promises he made to his peasant electorate? [Goscinski] Of course. There are rumors reaching us from Grzybowska Street--that is, the headquarters of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]--that peasants are increasingly displeased with Pawlak. They come to the Food Industry Bank and say that they had been promised 8-percent-interest loans--that is, the cheapest possible--for the purchase of fertilizers. They had been promised Z1 million per hectare for this purpose, but apparently the loans fund has money for only one-fourth that amount. In any case, someone will have to pay even for that. One of the worst parliamentary acts the Sejm has approved is the one on compensatory supplements for the agricultural sector. It was manifestly put together in a hurry. But the president refuses to use his right of veto to reject that act because, by doing so, he would let the prime minister know that he does not approve of such a policy toward agriculture. This kind of interplay really has nothing to do with Poland's interests. It is just a cynical struggle for power. [Socha] In the long run, the prospect of a collapse of the government coalition seems to be an increasingly likely possibility, does it not? [Goscinski] Pawlak keeps "drawing the bowstring" in an attempt to try the SLD and see how much more it is able to swallow. If the SLD is pushed too far, it could, in an act of despair, leave the coalition. Or, if the SLD puts up too much resistance, Pawlak could break up the coalition. A government without the PSL but with only the SLD, the Democratic Union, and other political groups is not really likely to even be considered. It is more probable that, if he has support from the president, the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR], and a proportion of the Democratic Union, Pawlak may form a minority government. Then, on the occasion of a major ballot, he might be forced to ask for a vote of confidence. It is not clear how the Sejm would behave in such a situation and whether the president would dissolve it then and announce a new parliamentary election. That possibility is still seen as a very powerful argument. People will find that they have burned their fingers on left-wing administration just as they burned them on Solidarity governments. Two years ago, I proposed the thesis that we would not really have a true parliamentary reflection of the existing configuration of forces in our society until the next Sejm. It may be that this existing configuration of forces is not ideal, but neither is it the worst one we could have. [Socha] Do you believe in society's collective wisdom--that is, that we learn things faster than our elected leaders? [Goscinski] Our society already showed us quite a few times that it is capable of greater political discipline than we would credit it with. Once we finally have a Sejm in which left, right, and center are equally represented, Poland will cease to be a country classified among hopeless incompetents. And, of course, someone else will be president then. It will have to be someone who will have the approval of both the left and the right side of the political spectrum, perhaps someone from the central orientation or even from outside the group of active, committed politicians--someone who will have enough common sense and be free from all pathological political ambitions.
