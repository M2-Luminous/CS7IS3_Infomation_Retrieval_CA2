FR940928-2-00030 FR940928-2-00026 [OPP&hyph;38510; FRL&hyph;4910&hyph;2] Alfred Waldner Co.; Notice and Order of Revocation of Registrations and Final Determination Governing Sale and Use of Existing Stocks AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: On October 29, 1990, EPA issued registrations for Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate, EPA Reg. No. 66410-1, and Insecticidal 2000 Ready to Use, EPA Reg. No. 66410-2. The original registrant certified that acute toxicity data submitted in support of these registration applications were obtained using a test substance identical to the Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate and representative of both insecticides. EPA subsequently determined that the tests were conducted on a substance which differed in concentration from the registered insecticides and that the tests were willfully misrepresented to EPA. By this notice, EPA announces and orders the revocation of registrations No. 66410-1 and No. 66410-2. EPA also announces that no sale or use of existing stocks of these insecticides will be permitted. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Richard F. Mountfort, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 713, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, 703-305-5446. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 29, 1990, EPA issued registrations to Microft Systems International for the insecticides Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate, EPA Reg. No. 62212-1, and Insecticidal 2000 Ready To Use, EPA Reg. No. 62212-2. On September 10, 1992, the registrations were transferred to Alfred Waldner Co. under new registration numbers 66410-1 and 66410-2, respectively. These registrations were originally issued after a review of acute effects toxicity data submitted with the Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate. Microft Systems certified that the tests were conducted with a test substance identical to Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate. Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate and Insecticidal 2000 Ready To Use each contain two active ingredients: Permethrin and Bioresmethrin. The Ready To Use product is a dilution of the concentrate. The acute toxicity data submitted with the 2000 Concentrate were conducted by RCC-Research and Consulting Co. AG of Basel, Switzerland. The following five studies were submitted: ‚ê£ 1Project No. 1Study Type 1EPA Identification No. #064383 Oral MRID 41110401 #064394 Dermal MRID 41110402 #064372 Inhalation MRID 41110403 #064416 Eye irritation MRID 41110404 #064405 Skin irritation MRID 41110405 EPA's review of these studies indicated that they were adequate to support registration of a concentrate identical to the proposed concentrate and indicated a classification for acute effects in Toxicity Category 3: a caution label and associated precautions (40 CFR 156.10(h)). On October 24, 1991, the Agency issued a registration to Bio-Environmental Products Corp. for the insecticide BEP Insecticide, EPA Reg. No. 64321-1. This insecticide is a dilution of a concentrate containing the single active ingredient permethrin. The same five acute studies described above were submitted by Bio-Environmental Products Corp. to support that application. It has subsequently been established that the studies referred to above were sponsored by Jesmond, Ltd. BioEnvironmental Products Corp. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Jesmond, Ltd. The test substance in these studies contained the single active ingredient permethrin. It did not include bioresmethrin and is not identical to the Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate. EPA has concluded that the registrations for Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate and Insecticidal 2000 Ready To Use are not supported by the acute toxicity data that were submitted with the registration applications and that the precautionary labeling cannot be confirmed to be adequate for these insecticides. This notice is organized into two parts. Part I describes the basis for the revocation of registrations for Waldner's Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate and Insecticidal 2000 Ready To Use. Part II describes the procedures which will be followed in implementing the regulatory actions set forth in this notice, including the treatment of existing stocks. I. Basis For Revocation Section 558 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 558) spells out the procedural requirements agencies must follow when terminating a license. Section 558 states: Except in cases of willfulness or those in which public health, interest, or safety requires otherwise, the withdrawal, suspension, revocation, or annulment of a license is lawful only if, before the institution of agency proceedings therefore, the licensee has been given_(1) notice by the agency in writing of the facts or conduct which may warrant the action; and (2) opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with all lawful requirements. Courts have interpreted willfulness to mean ``an intentional misdeed or such gross neglect of a known duty as to be the equivalent thereof.'' Hutto Stockyard, Inc. v. USDA (903 F.2d 299, 304 (4th Cir. 1990) (quoting Capitol Packing v. United States , 350 F.2d 67, 78-79 (10th Cir. 1965); Capital Produce Co. v. United States , 930 F.2d 1077, 1079 (4th Cir. 1991). To establish willfulness, one need only show that an act or failure to act was intentional, as opposed to accidental, and proof of an evil motive is unnecessary. Emil Lawrence v. Commodity Futures Trading Commission , 759 F.2d 767, 769 (9th Cir. 1985). In this case, the original registrants submitted data which were developed using a product with one active ingredient when, in fact, their product contained two active ingredients. Registrants certified that the information submitted was accurate. That certification and submission of data which did not represent the registered product was an intentional act, not an accidental one; therefore, it falls squarely within the definition of ``willful.'' Because the registrations were obtained through misrepresentation and a willful violation of the provisions of FIFRA, the registrations were not valid when granted and the procedural requirements for revocations in APA section 558 do not apply. Although not required in this case, the Agency did provide registrants written notice as well as an opportunity to respond to the allegations against them. Registrants did not respond to that notice. These procedures go beyond what is required by the APA in cases of willful violations of law. II. Order This notice announces EPA's decision and order revoking Alfred Waldner's registrations for Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate and Insecticidal 2000 Ready To Use. It is also notification that the Agency will not permit sale, distribution, or use of any existing stocks of either insecticide in the United States. Dated: September 16, 1994. Lynn R. Goldman, Assistant Administrator for Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23763 Filed 9&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
