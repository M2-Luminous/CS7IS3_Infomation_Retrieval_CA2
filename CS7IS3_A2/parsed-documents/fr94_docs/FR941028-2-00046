FR941028-2-00046 FR941028-2-00031 [Docket No. CP74&hyph;33&hyph;015] Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation; Notice of Petition To Amend Dated: October 24, 1994. Take notice that on October 20, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL), P.O. Box 1396, Houston, Texas 77251, filed an application with the Commission in Docket No. CP74&hyph;33&hyph;015 pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for authorization to recomplete an existing well as an injection/withdrawal well and connect the well to the Washington Storage Field 1 in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, all as more fully set forth in the application on file which is open to the public for inspection. 1 53 FPC 628 (1975). TGPL proposes to recomplete Well No. 62 as an injection/withdrawal well into the main storage reservoir and connect the well to the Washington Storage Field with approximately 3,800 feet of 4-inch diameter pipe. TGPL states that the proposed recompletion of Well No. 62 would not increase the injection, withdrawal, or storage capacity of TGPL's Washington Storage Field above currently certificated levels; rather it would replace the decline in deliverability from certain existing wells in the field that has occurred over time. TGPL states that the proposed recompletion of Well No. 62 would restore physical operational flexibility to better serve its FERC Rate Schedule WSS storage customers. TGPL estimates that it would cost $337,765 to recomplete Well No. 62. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before November 14, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the NGA and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for TGPL to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
