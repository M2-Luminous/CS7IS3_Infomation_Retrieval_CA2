Foreign Ministry officials from Bangladesh and Pakistan secretly visited Israel several weeks ago. Sources at the Israeli Foreign Ministry, however, do not expect the imminent establishment of diplomatic relations. Our political correspondent Imanu'el Rosen reports: Bangladesh, a calamity-stricken Islamic country in southeast Asia, is one of the poorest countries in the world. Several weeks ago, an economic delegation from Bangladesh held a secret visit to Israel. This came a short time after a visit by a senior foreign ministry official from Dacca. Senior Israeli foreign ministry officials have expressed the assessment that Bangladesh, out of all the Islamic countries in southeast Asia, is the closest to establishing ties, perhaps even diplomatic relations, with Israel. However, even Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's government prefers to move slowly and cautiously while maintaining clandestine ties. Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world, cooled off relations with Israel after the public meeting between President Suharto and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Although the two countries have economic and other ties, these activities remain covert. Despite the fact that Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto still refuses to meet Israeli leaders in public, she permitted a senior foreign ministry official from Karachi to visit Jerusalem several weeks ago and meet with the prime minister and foreign minister. [passage omitted] Even Afghanistan is in the picture; however, meetings between its representatives and Israeli officials have been limited to the United Nations building until now. Back in Jerusalem, foreign ministry officials assert that all the meetings so far have been with low-level officials, not with ministers or heads of state. Nevertheless, Muslim southeast Asia is moving closer to Israel.
