He said that he "is neither indicted nor under investigation" and added: "There are no judges wanting to commit me to trial." He went on to specify that one case has already been dealt with by the lower house and in the other case the magistrates acted because it was their official duty to do so. A thorny problem for [PPI Secretary] Mino Martinazzoli who, in a brief article in IL POPOLO, calls for "discipline and humility" from all party members. And, in view of the "huge responsibility" which the present moment carries with it, Martinazzoli says that "it must be clear to everybody that there are no problems regarding `individuals.'" Other PPI members, too, are trying to persuade De Mita to stand down. "Good examples must come first and foremost from the top," Popular Party movement leader Roberto Formigoni said, adding that there is a need for new faces and that De Mita was both DC secretary for seven years and prime minister. [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni referred to the example set by the PRI [Italian Republican Party] secretary: "La Malfa," he said, "set a really noteworthy example; it is painful to say so but the same unquestionably applies to De Mita." The call to stand aside was also made by [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Achille Occhetto, while [Christian Democratic Center leader] Francesco D'Onofrio feels that it is right for De Mita to want to return to Montecitorio [parliament]. [PPI left-wing faction leader] Rosy Bindi chose not to offer any advice. "Ciriaco has taught us a great many things," she said. "One of the many things he has taught us is that politics is conviction. This problem will be resolved on the basis of his convinctions, not thanks to any reiterated appeals on our part." The merry-go-round of withdrawals -- the latest comes from Freedom of Life movement leader Carlo Casini, who will not be standing for parliament again -- and candidacies is continuing. [Italian Social Movement (MSI) Secretary] Gianfranco Fini could lead the flame [MSI symbol] in Treviso, while in the eastern Veneto the PDS grass roots want [L'UNITA editor] Walter Veltroni. The oak tree [PDS symbol] will put forward Achille Occhetto in Bologna, and Vittorio Sgarbi [Italian Liberal Party member and Berlusconi supporter running on the "Sgarbi for Italy" ticket] is aiming for a constituency in the Marche region.
