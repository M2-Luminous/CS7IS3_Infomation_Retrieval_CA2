He wanted to test whether an old saying is true: insolence seldom does any good. He recently found the answer. The latest amputation of billions from the German military budget brought it to light. The defense minister no longer has any allies in the party, parliamentary group, and cabinet. "Commander in chief" Helmut Kohl is leaving him hanging and is hoping for a pedagogical effect. The Bundeswehr is grumbling about a lack of guidance in the chaos of financial straits, authorized strength, the question of compulsory military service, and an uncertain future mission. But Ruehe is not giving up. His next move to continue his ambitious career would be a grand coalition under the leadership of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]. That is what he believes--and this in an election year. His star has fallen rapidly. Just two years ago at Christmas time, it seemed to be rising in a big way. At the 1991 party congress of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] in Dresden, Kohl allowed General Secretary Ruehe to take the lead. Over a period of several months, Ruehe had elbowed the oldtimers of the CDU-east out of the field of vision and now in Dresden he presented the finale of the reformer play. Kohl was pleased to read the heading in DIE WELT: "The Second Crown Prince Is Volker Ruehe." The Union, short on new blood, had another hope in addition to Wolfgang Schaeuble Three months later, he rose to the cabinet and became chief of the Hardthoehe [Defense Ministry]. He thereby saw himself closer to the dream that he had never denied: to become foreign minister one day. Any other office appears merely as an intermediate stop. The man with the broad shoulders of a former handball player felt as strong as an ox. Before the 1992 party congress in Duesseldorf, he let it be known that after his election into the circle of Kohl's four deputies, of which he was certain, he wanted to stir up the musty party presidium. Sole ruler Kohl pricked up his ears. Ruehe experienced the first stage of disillusionment in Duesseldorf. He was unsuccessful. To this day those who interpret moods argue about whether Kohl had lowered his thumb then or whether the unyielding man from Hamburg, whose deplorable CDU land association offers no local power, had failed on account of his greatest weakness, namely his unwillingness to seek allies in the party as well as in the parliamentary group, not to mention in the public. "He has no need to wonder why he stood alone and lost" in defending the defense budget, say Bundestag colleagues. Ruehe turns to defiance: "They need me more than I need them." As a matter of fact, no party friend would dispute the fact that he is the head of the Union for foreign policy with no competition in sight who could be in the cabinet. This is indispensable for a profile that Konrad Adenauer's successors have long neglected. But sports friend Ruehe likes to take the ball to the wrong goal. What he sneeringly perceives to be the escapades of a grown-up kid others see as boorishness. His colleague Klaus Kinkel in the Foreign Ministry and his FDP [Free Democratic Party] complained bitterly that without consulting with anyone the defense minister stretched the limits of his office in matters concerning NATO's strategy for the East and during his trip to East Asia. And Kohl did not find anything funny about it either. It is "unwise," according to the word in the chancellorship, to display Kinkel in this way, who is loyal to the coalition but is not sure of himself in the FDP and in the footsteps of Hans-Dietrich Genscher. This is especially so when the real enemy is being systematically protected and courted. At the military science conference in Munich at the beginning of February, Ruehe lost his ability to speak when SPD chancellor candidate Rudolf Scharping knew of "no serious differences with the foreign policy of the government." Does this also apply to foreign operations of the Bundeswehr, possibly with a combat mission? Ruehe, the Union grumbles, allowed Scharping simply to talk past the constitutional suits of the SPD and its valid party resolutions. There is obviously a method behind the general silence. On 1 February, Ruehe explained to the defense specialists in the Bundestag how and where he would cut from the defense budget the 1.2 billion imposed by his colleague in the Finance Ministry, Theo Waigel, from the CSU [Christian Social Union]. He subsequently stated with a wink that he informed the SPD with the same degree of detail immediately after the Union. It was apparent in both meeting halls that "the same maps hang on the walls" and that "the clocks also run the same." The comparison of the clocks had its effect: the chancellorship had had enough. In Kohl's eyes, Ruehe's nonchalant courting of the election campaign opponent SPD must nearly border on treason. Ruehe puts on his poker face and lets it be known that Kohl and Waigel had broken their past guarantee to him and the defense budget: "That was an operation on a living person, almost without anesthesia." Party circles feel reminded of father-son novels, in which defiance and anger turn into family crises. Old sins are doubly burdensome. Kohl has not forgotten that right after taking office Ruehe wanted to shoot down the European Fighter-90 and the German-French helicopter projects. And not only because it was the first kiss for the SPD. More important was the fact that the brash secondary foreign-policy man from the Hardthoehe had caused the chancellor unplanned vexation with England's Prime Minister John Major and French President Francois Mitterrand. There is already a rumor circulating that Kohl will punish Ruehe if the coalition survives the Bundestag election. On the other hand: Who else could he have for the Hardthoehe? The Christian strategists know that the Union cannot afford to have both the Foreign and Defense Ministries in the hands of the FDP. Ruehe has little latitude. The desired Foreign Ministry plus office of vice chancellor might be possible only if the SPD were the strongest force in a grand coalition. But Ruehe makes himself "culpable" if during the election campaign he speculates on a slump of his own party. After a marriage of elephants with reversed proportion of forces, Ruehe must expect the tough competition of Florian Gerster, the SPD's candidate for the office from Mainz. The Foreign Ministry would go to the SPD in any case. And if the CDU has to abdicate? On the bench of the opposition, Ruehe would probably find himself set back 12 years: vice chairman of the parliamentary group for foreign policy. It would be out of the question that he could supersede Wolfgang Schaeuble in the chairmanship. This is certainly so for an individual fighter from Hamburg. Ruehe is steeling himself with stoic calm, listlessness, and gloating sarcasm: "I have time, I can wait. I am taking it all calmly." That is supposed to mean that at the age of 51 he sees his time as still ahead of him. Well-intentioned party friends are dampening such insolence: he should guard dissipating himself. The long-delayed change of generations in the CDU, especially under the conditions of being in the opposition, will "sweep over quite a few people in the middle years." In the end, Ruehe will have had his time and wasted it. And his little prince's crown as well, just as in the fairy tale.
