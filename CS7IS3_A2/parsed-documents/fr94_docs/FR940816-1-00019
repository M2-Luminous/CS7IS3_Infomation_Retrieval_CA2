FR940816-1-00019 FR940816-1-00007 2. Comprehensively inventory PM&hyph;10 emissions within the U.S. in the vicinity of the nonattainment area and demonstrate that the impact of those sources on the nonattainment area after application of reasonably available controls does not cause the NAAQS to be exceeded. This analysis must include an influx of background PM&hyph;10 in the area. Background PM&hyph;10 levels could be based, for example, on concentrations measured in a similar nearby area not influenced by emissions from outside the U.S. 3. Analyze ambient sample filters for specific types of particles emanating from across the border (although not required, characteristics of emissions from foreign sources may be helpful). 4. Inventory the sources on both sides of the border and compare the magnitude of PM&hyph;10 emissions originating within the U.S. to those emanating from outside the U.S. 5. Perform air dispersion and/or receptor modeling to quantify the relative impacts on the nonattainment area of sources located within the U.S. and of foreign sources of PM&hyph;10 emissions (this approach combines information collected from the international emission inventory, meteorological stations, ambient monitoring network, and analysis of filters). In addition to demonstrating that the SIP for the area would be adequate to timely attain and maintain the NAAQS but for emissions emanating outside the U.S., the SIP must continue to meet all applicable moderate area SIP requirements in order to qualify for the special SIP approval under section 179B. Among other things, the SIP must provide for the implementation of reasonably available control measures (RACM), including reasonably available control technology (RACT) (see 57 FR 13540). In international border areas, RACM/RACT must be implemented to the extent necessary to demonstrate attainment by the applicable attainment date if emissions emanating from outside the U.S. were not included in the analysis. The EPA believes that this interpretation of the degree of RACM the State is required to implement in moderate PM&hyph;10 areas affected by emissions emanating from outside the U.S. is consistent with the purpose of section 179B. By directing EPA, under section 179B, to approve the plan or plan revision of a moderate PM&hyph;10 area which shows it would attain the NAAQS but for foreign emissions and by excluding such an area from reclassification to serious, Congress clearly wanted to avoid penalizing States containing such areas by not making them responsible for control of emissions emanating from a foreign country over which they have no jurisdiction. Moreover, by excluding the area from reclassification, Congress also elected to avoid subjecting such areas to the more stringent control measures applicable in serious PM&hyph;10 areas. In addition, as set forth in section 179B(a)(2), the second condition which must be met before EPA may approve a moderate area plan showing attainment but for foreign emissions, by its plain terms, requires the State to establish only that the plan submitted would be ``adequate'' to timely attain and maintain the NAAQS, but for emissions from outside the U.S. Nothing in section 179B relieves the State from meeting all its applicable moderate area PM&hyph;10 SIP requirements, including the requirement to implement RACM. Nonetheless, if, in doing so, States containing such an area were also required, because of contributions to PM&hyph;10 violations caused by foreign emissions, to shoulder more of a regulatory and economic burden than States not similarly affected (i.e., by implementing measures which go well beyond those which the SIP demonstrates would otherwise be adequate to timely attain and maintain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS) such a requirement would unfairly penalize States containing international border areas and effectively undermine the purpose of section 179B. Indeed, to the extent an affected State can satisfactorily demonstrate that implementation of such measures clearly would not advance the attainment date, EPA could conclude they are unreasonable and hence do not constitute RACM. Notwithstanding the above, in light of the overall health and clean air objectives of the Act, EPA does encourage affected States to reduce emissions beyond the minimum necessary to satisfy the ``but for'' test in order to reduce the PM&hyph;10 concentrations to which their populations are exposed. The SIP for an international border area must also include contingency measures as required under section 172(c)(9) of the Act. Under section 179B(a)(1), such SIP's must meet ``all the requirements applicable to it under the Act'' except that they may demonstrate timely attainment by discounting emissions emanating from outside the U.S. Contingency measures are additional measures included in the SIP that can be undertaken to reduce emissions if the area fails to make RFP or to attain the primary NAAQS by the applicable attainment date. In international border areas, EPA will not require the contingency measures for PM&hyph;10 to be implemented after the area fails to attain if EPA determines that the area would have attained the NAAQS, but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S. However, the EPA will require contingency measures to be implemented if it determines that the area failed to make RFP in achieving the required reductions in PM&hyph;10 emissions from sources within the U.S., or if the area does not, in fact, obtain the emission reductions that were necessary to demonstrate timely attainment of the NAAQS, but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S.
