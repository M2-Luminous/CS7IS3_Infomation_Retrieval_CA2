The offensive was assumed in the north part of Karabakh front in the direction of Tonashen settlement (Mardakertskiy region). SNARK was informed of this in the Karabakh Defence Army Headquarters. Before the attack the Karabakh Forces defending that part of the confrontation line had been shelled. At 10 a.m. hard fights took place here. The Karabakh Defence army units manage to repel the massed attacks of the Azerbaijani units. The Karabakh leaders are of the opinion that the official Baku is deliberately increasing tension in the conflict zone just before the summit talks being prepared by the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry, and a new meeting of CSCE Minsk group, which starts today in Prague. Baku still relies on force methods, once again defying the World Community, which makes efforts to settle the problem by peaceful means.
