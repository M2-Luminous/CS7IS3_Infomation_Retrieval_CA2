In an informal chat with newsmen at the reception hosted in her honour by the Rawalpindi Press Club here on Friday evening she said "they do try to influence our policies but we must not under rate ourselves." "Despite all the pressure we will not let happen any thing against the national interest as our sovereignty is very dear to us," she added. She said many things which did not happen would have taken place, had we succumb to the us pressure. She expressed her ignorance when her attention was drawn towards the reports that 500 US commandoes will come to Pakistan for joint exercises. Asked what Pakistan can gain by allowing the foes of Islam to use its territory for enhancing their professonal skills, she said "this question should be posed to the policy makers." She pointed out that the job of diplomats is entirely different from the policy makers adding that the diplomats are there to communicate and articulate policies formulated by the policy makers.
