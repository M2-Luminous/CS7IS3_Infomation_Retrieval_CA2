His meeting with Russia's President Boris Yeltsin took place in the Kremlin. Among the matters discussed was a proposal for resolving the problem of the emigration of the Russian-speaking population from the republic. Akayev put forward an initiative to conclude an agreement on the protection of the ethnic minorities within the framework of CIS. In the afternoon Kyrgyzstan's president held a news conference. It was attended by our correspondent Roman Babyan. [Babayan] At the meeting with journalists, Askar Akayev stated that many problems now facing the new sovereign states have been brought about by the disintegration of the USSR, including the problem of the non-native population, such as the Russian-speaking population in these states. The Kyrgyz leader said the emigration of the Russophone population from the CIS countries to their historic homeland has reached a critical dimension. Akayev voiced his concern about the outflow of Russian speakers from Kyrgyzstan. Of late, some 100,000 people had left the republic. Among the reasons causing the Russophone population to emigrate from the CIS countries and, in particular from Kyrgyzstan, Askar Akayev noted the following: the language problem, the socio-economic problem, and the so called discomfort problem connected with interethnic conflicts. Speaking of the specific measures being taken by the Kyrgyzstan leadership to contain emigration, Askar Akayev said in particular: [Begin Akayev recording] We are doing everything to preserve the role and place of the Russian language in Kyrgyzstan. We have preserved teaching in the Russian language in schools, institutions of higher learning, the training of specialists in Russian philology in the same volume as existed prior to 1990. We have opened the Kyrgyz-Russian Slavonic University, the first in our region and indeed perhaps the only one in the CIS countries, which will become the center of Russian culture, so as to impart promise to them, so that they will have confidence and not tackle the problem by emigrating. [end recording] [Babayan] Continuing, Kyrgyzstan's president called on all leaders of the CIS countries to pool their efforts and to take all necessary measures to contain emigration flows.
