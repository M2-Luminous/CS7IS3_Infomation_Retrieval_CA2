At a meeting in Amman today, they reviewed the state of the tourist industry in Jordan and future ties between Jordan and the Palestinian National Authority [PNA]. [Begin recording] [Frayj] The tourist industries in Jordan and Palestine complement each other. Both sides, therefore, have a vested interest in promoting the industry here in Jordan and in Palestine. In my opinion, the future promises to be lucrative for both the Jordanian and Palestinian peoples. This region is home to the most important sacred and archaeological sites in the world. I anticipate a booming tourist industry. In a year or two a million or so tourists will be visiting Jordan and Palestine annually. [Al-'Adwan] I have expressed our full readiness to support our Palestinian brothers, especially at this stage when they are planning to set up new institutions. We also told them we would be ready to provide training for our brother Palestinians in the tourism and archaeology industries. [end recording] At the end of the meeting, the sides agreed to set up a joint committee to formulate an executive program for the full range of cooperation in the tourist industry between Jordan and the Palestinian National Authority.
