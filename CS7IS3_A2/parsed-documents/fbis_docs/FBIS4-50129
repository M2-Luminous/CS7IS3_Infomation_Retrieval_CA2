FBIS4-50129 "drchi094_d_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-094 Daily Report 14 May 1994 Northeast Asia ROK: North's Nuclear Reactor Decision `Regrettable' ROK: North's Nuclear Reactor Decision `Regrettable' OW1405145294 Beijing XINHUA in English 1240 GMT 14 May 94 OW1405145294 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 14 (XINHUA) -- South Korea expressed regret today over the decision by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to change fuel rods at its 5-megawatt experimental nuclear reactor. "It's extremely regrettable that North Korea (DPRK) gave notification it will unilaterally begin changing the fuel rods at its nuclear reactor," said Foreign Ministry Spokesman Chang Ki-ho. The DPRK has notified the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) respectively that it could no longer defer removal of the nuclear fuel rods from its reactor for technical reasons. But in its letter to the IAEA, Pyongyang said it has "just begun" the process and the agency still has time to choose the rods and place them under inspection for future measurement. Seoul, Washington and the IAEA have claimed that changing the rods without IAEA supervision would end the dialogue and place the DPRK nuclear issue in the United Nations Security Council. "The South Korean Government emphasizes to North Korea the importance of sampling and securing the rods as demanded by the IAEA and reminds it that the nuclear problem should not be taken to a destructive stage by North Korea's unilateral changing of the fuel rods," Chang said. He expressed support for the IAEA dispatching an inspection team to the DPRK and urged Pyongyang to negotiate with the agency on the replacement of the rods at the nuclear reactor and to carry out its "full obligations." Postponement of the refueling is a condition for the IAEA inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities. The agency told Pyongyang earlier this week it would send an inspection team "on the assumption" that the DPRK was deferring the changing of the rods. Officials here said that the uncertainty over the nuclear reactor is making the IAEA uneasy about sending the inspection team. They said that it remains unclear whether the IAEA will go ahead and send the team to Pyongyang this weekend or wait for an official reply from the DPRK before deciding.
