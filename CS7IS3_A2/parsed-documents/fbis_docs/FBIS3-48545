The students, who called themselves the Action Front of Indonesian Youths (FAPI), intended to see Wahono, House Speaker, to protest the arrest of 21 students, and to demand the release of their friends who were detained last month. Those students had been charged with insulting President Suharto during a demonstration in front of the House on 14 December. The new wave of protest by about 40 students criticized the harsh "security approach" being used by the government in its development efforts. During the protest demonstration, banners reading "Security approach is antidemocratic," and "Free our friends," were unfurled. Security troops managed to grab some of the demonstrating students while others succeeded in getting away. The demonstration was eventually dispersed by the mobile brigade of the Jakarta Police Headquarters. It was said that Beathor Suryadi, 35, spokesman for FAPI, managed to speak to the DPR's public relations officer about the matter because Wahono was absent from the House. However, while he was trying to do so, his friends who were waiting outside the House were arrested. According to Police Lieutenant Colonel Latif Rabar, the students were arrested for violating Section 510 of the Criminal Code of Law -- for staging demonstration and holding street processions without the police permit. He said that at this moment, the arrested students are under intensive police investigation. [passage omitted] News of the arrest reached Luhut Pangaribuan, director of Jakarta's Legal Aid Bureau. He said that there was no reason to arrest the students because they had not broken any law. [passage omitted]
