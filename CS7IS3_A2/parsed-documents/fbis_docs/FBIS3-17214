Kuts: "Will There Be a New Nuclear Power Plant?"] [Text] The agreement between Belarus and Russia on an integrated ruble zone may be signed as soon as this month. This is what Belarusian Prime Minister V. Kebich stated in Baranovichi at his meeting with representatives of local authorities from Brest and Minsk Oblasts. According to the prime minister, Belarus and Russia have also reached an agreement on gas prices. Fuel delivered to Belarus as of 1 January 1994 has become almost 40 percent cheaper. This has enabled Belarus to repay a large part of its gas debt to Russia. At the same time, V. Kebich admitted that Belarus would have to remember nuclear energy, because it had no other alternative in the visible future. Currently, work on the selection of a site for a future nuclear power plant is under way, in line with international norms.
