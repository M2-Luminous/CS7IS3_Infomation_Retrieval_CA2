Applications requiring fees as set forth at Part 1, Subpart G of this chapter must be filed in accordance with §0.401(b) of this chapter.

Unless otherwise provided by the FCC, filings of five pages or less are exempt from the requirement to submit on microfiche, as well as emergency filings like letters requesting special temporary authority. Those filing any amendments, correspondence, pleadings, and forms must simultaneously submit the original hard copy which must be stamped ``original''. In addition to the original hard copy, those filing pleadings, including pleadings under §1.2108 of this chapter shall also submit 2 paper copies as provided in §1.51 of this chapter. (1) Microfiche copies. Each microfiche copy must be a copy of the signed original. Each microfiche copy shall be a 148mm × 105mm negative (clear transparent characters appearing on an opaque background) at 24× to 27× reduction for microfiche or microfiche jackets. One of the microfiche sets must be a silver halide camera master or a copy made on silver halide film such as Kodak Direct Duplicatory Film. The microfiche must be placed in paper microfiche envelopes and submitted in a B6 (125 mm × 176 mm) or 5 × 7.5 inch envelope. All applicants must leave Row ``A'' (the first row for page images) of the first fiche blank for in-house identification purposes. (2) All applications and all amendments must have the following information printed on the mailing envelope, the microfiche envelope, and on the title area at the top of the microfiche: (i) The name of the applicant; (ii) The type of application (e.g. nationwide, regional, MTA, BTA, response channel); (iii) The month and year of the document; (iv) Name of the document; (v) File number, applicant identification number, and call sign, if assigned; and (vi) The identification number and date of the Public Notice announcing the auction in response to which the application was filed (if applicable).

Section 24.422 is revised to read as follows: §24.422 Amendment of application for Narrowband Personal Communications Service filed on FCC Form 175. (a) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to cure defects in FCC Form 175 specified herein except for failure to sign the application and to make certifications. These are defects which may not be cured. See also Section 1.2105 of this chapter. (b) In the Narrowband PCS, applicants will be permitted to amend their Form 175 applications to make minor amendments to correct minor errors or defects such as typographical errors. Applicants will also be permitted to amend FCC Form 175, to make ownership changes or changes in the identification of parties to bidding consortia, provided such changes do not result in a change in control of the applicant and do not involve another applicant (or parties in interest to an applicant) who has applied for any of the same licenses as the applicant. Amendments which change control of the applicant will be considered major amendments. An FCC Form 175 which is amended by a major amendment will be considered to be newly filed and cannot be resubmitted after applicable filing deadlines. See also §1.2105 of this chapter. 10. Section 24.429 is amended by removing paragraph (b) and redesignating paragraphs (c) and (d) as (b) and (c), respectively. 11. Section 24.430 is revised to read as follows: §24.430 Opposition to applications.

(b) A petition to deny a major amendment to a previously filed application may only raise matters directly related to the amendment which could not have been raised in connection with the underlying, previously filed application. This does not apply to petitioners who gain standing because of the major amendment. (c) Parties who file frivolous petitions to deny may be subject to sanctions including monetary forfeitures, license revocation, if they are FCC licensees, and may be prohibited from participating in future auctions.
