I am referring to the unification of the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems. People are calling us and asking about the motives behind this step, how and when this will happen. The main question is: In what way will the Belarusian economy and the man in the street gain from this? Please, comment on these government actions. [Kebich] I want to go back in history. As you know, I have always been an advocate of a close economic union with all CIS states. However, some politicians have failed to understand the advantages of such a union. The conference of Belarusian and Ukrainian entrepreneurs in which I participated today, demonstrated that nostalgia for the economic union, and not just nostalgia, but also new circumstances force entrepreneurs to unite. Speaking of Russia and the Republic of Belarus, you know that the two states are so closely integrated that in fact, we cannot exist without one another. With regard to Belarusian power resources, we totally depend on Russian supplies. Russia supplies us with 50 to 60 percent of metals and other raw materials. Russia in fact, remains the only market for our products. We have reached some very negative phenomena and this forced people who are not selfish...perhaps neither Kebich nor Ivanov nor Petrov need that; our people need a close economic union. Such a union means equal prices for power resources for Russian and Belarusian consumers, eliminating all quotas, duties, and tariffs.... In fact, this will lead to a reduction of prices. Wholesale prices will decrease following a decrease in production costs and then, retail prices will go down as well. Is it not a sad experience seeing people who went on Christmas vacation, forgive me the word, still not working. Healthy people who should operate machines and make products are spending time on the lakes fishing. The people do not understand what happened. They ask: Where are you, politicians? What are you preoccupied with? What are you doing? I am currently doing the will of my legislature that decreed the unification of monetary systems and the formation of an economic union with Russia. My recent meeting with Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin that lasted some three and a half hours led us to the conclusion that we are culturally, spiritually, and morally affiliated. We realized that the two states' economic systems are similar and that we need each other. Why should Russia build a plant like our BelAZ when we have difficulties selling our trucks? Huge prices for power resources make our products uncompetitive not only in the West, but also on CIS markets. All these factors brought about the signing of the agreement between the two states. We decided to sign it in Minsk which is the CIS capital to demonstrate that we made first steps toward [reforming] our economies. We are moving on from multilateral to bilateral relations. [Reporter] [words indistinct] [Kebich] As far as I know, I have been told by our ambassador, that as a result of today's negotiations [between Shushkevich and Yeltsin], orders were given to prepare for the signing of the agreements as soon as possible. During my meetings with the Russian leadership it was precisely envisioned that this should be done in January. [Reporter] Could you say what issues have been left unresolved? [Kebich] There will be no more declarations. Bilateral relations between Chernomyrdin and Kebich, the two prime ministers, will be signed [as heard]. All the agreements but one have been already ratified by ministers or their deputies. Thus, the signing of these 12 agreements will denote that our monetary systems have been unified. [Reporter] Considering that these agreements are so advantageous for Belarus, what caused opposition against their signing? [Kebich] I liked the interview given by Viktor Chernomyrdin after signing the agreement in which he said: We have no claims on anybody's sovereignty. I have always said, and I want to underline over again that by joining the single ruble zone, by signing economic agreements, by lifting all barriers that hamper the free flow of products, people may give us a chance to survive and save our sovereignty. I think that those politicians who oppose the economic union care only about themselves. They do not care about either Belarusian sovereignty or peoples' lives. They want to make a show. Every sound politician, even having a negative attitude toward the union must understand that the latter provides undisputable advantages. [Reporter, in Belarusian] Did Russia put forward any preconditions for [signing the agreement with] Belarus? [Kebich, in Belarusian] There were no preconditions. In general, I must say that we agreed that prices for power resources will be equal and even the Russian side maintained that the unification of monetary systems should be done on a parity basis. To avoid misinterpretations I want to point out that parity does not mean that our hare will equal one ruble. It means that one hare will equal (?30) rubles. [Reporter, in Belarusian] Is there a chance that following the unification of monetary systems Russian enterprises will repay their debts to Belarusian partners? [Kebich, in Belarusian] Our enterprises kept their assets in Russia. Now, they will be returned to Belarus and start working for the economy of Belarus and not Russia. [Reporter] Does this mean that the union with Russia is a real necessity? [Kebich] I do not see any other way to save the Belarusian economy. I may be mistaken; I may be condemned, but this is my way, my policy, and the rest of my life. By saying this, I do not rule out that we should not form economic unions with any other state. The agreement does not prohibit bilateral relations with other states. We should seek contacts with East Europe; we should have equally good relations with Western states. This does not contradict our union with Russia. I think that perhaps this move will push other CIS states to signing bilateral agreements with us. [Correspondent] [words indistinct] [Kebich] I would like to say that I am not as adamant on this issue. I can take a step to the left or the right to profit from this union. And now about my personal appraisal: You know, I would like to say that, from this perspective, I am very satisfied. However, from another perspective, I am somewhat dissatisfied, because the good work that we are currently conducting is being criticized by other people. You claim that the industrial complex is against this union, but this is not true. You know, one should not trust all reports and statements. I have recently met with Belarusian and Ukrainian industrialists, and they all, arm in arm, approve this very union. They are very thankful for what the prime minister has done for them. I have recently read a newspaper published by Belarusian Communists, and they also assault the government. You are probably in the center of this criticism. In all countries all over the world, people who are not in power always criticize authorities. However, they criticize the people who are responsible for concrete matters. Regarding the current issue, I would like to say that, when the time for the electoral race comes, all opposition forces wake up. In this case, I can see rapprochement of extreme radicalism from the left and right sides. As the saying goes, one goes left but comes from the right. Due to that, I must proceed on the path between these lines. I can step neither on the left path nor on the right one, and therefore I will proceed on the current path. [Correspondent] Returning to the issue of our economic union with Russia, we praise it [words indistinct]. [Kebich] The point is that if prices for energy sources become equal in Russia and Belarus, our relations will instantly become based on equal rights. Currently, the price for gas in Russia amounts to 26,000 rubles [R], in Belarus it reaches R80,000. The price for oil is also two and a half times higher in Belarus than in Russia. The unification of monetary systems cannot be accomplished, if prices for all goods in Russia and Belarus are not equal. Due to that, we have not even allowed the possibility that prices would be different. It is possible that we will finance the expenditures for oil exploration and drilling works, however, this will be an insignificant cost. Exploration work has already been conducted for a long time. This has cost them, too. Therefore, we put it this way: This does not mean that we should currently pay the same amount for gas as Russia does. The situation could be different: Our prices will be decreasing, while Russia's will be increasing until we reach one level. Moreover, I would like to emphasize that although the unification of our monetary systems has not yet been completed, we have already agreed that we will pay $55 instead of $80 for gas. So, can you tell me, isn't this alone a great achievement? Russia has met us halfway. Not $80 but $55. This is $25 or almost R30,000. This is the initial result. [Correspondent] Your meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin lasted almost three hours. What issues were discussed during this time? [Kebich] There have been no such lengthy negotiations over my entire political life. Due to that, a great number of issues was discussed, including the circumstances connected with certain East European countries' willingness to join NATO. We discussed the attitude toward these countries and the issue of participation of our countries in the IMF. The scope of the discussed issues went far beyond relations between Russia and the Republic of Belarus. [Correspondent] Suppose the monetary unification is not accomplished. What does it mean for Belarus and what is your prognosis? [Kebich] The most unpleasant prognosis is that our enterprises will simply collapse. I am not speaking about agriculture. The agricultural sector is in much better shape than industry. Due to that, a new government, and I do not know who it will be, will have a very complex situation. All I can say is that, over two years in Ukraine, three governments have been changed. What has rally changed there? There have been pragmatics, theorists, and professionals, and nothing has changed. Recently, the president has assumed all powers, and the situation there is even worse than ours. Thus, I believe that we have no other way. I always ask politicians: What do you propose? Yesterday, a NEW YORK TIMES correspondent told me: You always speak of help for Russia. Do you think that helping Russia you also help other CIS countries. However, this is not true. If you analyzed the help granted to Russia by IMF and the one granted to us, it would become obvious that we have received more. [Correspondent] [words indistinct] [Kebich] It is clear that if Belarus were a nuclear state, if we had not refused to keep the nuclear weapons, we would not be participating in this meeting [with President Clinton]. I am speaking sincerely. However, we see that the Clinton administration is paying tribute to Belarus, and this is being done, first and foremost, by U.S. President Bill Clinton. This is brought about by the fact that we do not lay claims to nuclear weapons and we do not make nuclear weapons the subject of political bargaining. This is the most important thing. I hope that during our short meeting -- Clinton will stay with us no more than five hours -- we will discuss issues related solely to economic relations between Belarusian and U.S. business circles.
