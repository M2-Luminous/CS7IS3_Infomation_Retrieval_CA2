[Kuncze] I do not believe that the government's role is to create ideologies, at least, it will not be the task of the government led by the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. In my view, the electors are expecting us to put the economy in order at last. The SZDSZ and the other liberal parties have the necessary program to do this. Therefore, if we form a government, this will mean the end of something else, namely of the unfounded accusations. [Pinter] In your view, to what extent have the parties of the liberal alliance remained together? [Kuncze] A cooperation agreement is in force between the SZDSZ, the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the Liberal Civic Alliance-Entrepreneurs' Party, and the Agrarian Federation, which does not actually cement these parties together but makes it likely that these parties wish to work together even in the period after the elections. However, it is still possible that a liberal party may not participate in a possible government coalition even if its election results made it eligible for government. [passage omitted] [Pinter] Many people see the intention of the SZDSZ and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] to participate in the same government coalition as a fact. Is this justified? [Kuncze] The MSZP's economic policy carries Laszlo Bekesi's name, however, even the MSZP's current leadership cannot tell whether this concept will be accepted by the majority of the MSZP's membership and the future parliamentary group. If it is not accepted then we have nothing to talk about. We have to wait for the final results of the elections, and we have to see to what extent the various parties are able to assert their ideas in the coalition talks. [passage omitted] [Pinter] To what extent can the voters view the SZDSZ's ideas that have so far been made public as a government program? [Kuncze] We are disseminating a version of the program that is easy to understand, so it is accessible for everyone. On the last page of our election program, we printed the following: "Keep this booklet because you will be able to question the SZDSZ's politicians on whether they have implemented what they promised." If we did not honestly believe that we could implement our plans when we are in government then we would not have written this sentence here. We assessed the tasks months ago, and we now precisely know what the first measures will have to be in governmental position. The first draft bills will soon be ready, we are now working on the texts. We also know what kind of amendments we will propose in the operation of Parliament and the government. [passage omitted] [Pinter] In your personal experience, what changes do the SZDSZ sympathizers expect you to introduce? [Kuncze] People are very well aware that we are facing difficult years to come and a real economic boom still has to wait. Therefore, first of all, they want honesty and sincerity from the politicians. They want to be treated as human beings, and they want their problems to be understood, in other words, the country first of all wants a change of style: a new style of politics, a new style in building relations with society, a new style in cooperation with the opposition, and a new style in the mechanisms of interest coordination. The electors expect the establishment of new workplaces to be at the forefront in the implementation of the economic policy, and we agree with this: Our proposals to increase investments, to attract more foreign capital, and to accelerate privatization are aimed at this goal. It is possible to establish the conditions for economic growth and this will be the basis for increasing living standards. Both the SZDSZ and the electors believe that the relationship between the government and the local governments has to be changed. We have to recognize the fact that everyone is living in a local government area. The operation of the local governments largely influences people's feelings about living in this country. The government and the local governments should be working by assisting each other, rather than opposing each other. We also want to implement in other areas, too, the kind of politics where antagonism decreases and cooperation increases. [Pinter] These goals are impossible to implement without a broad political consensus. Can you see any chance of this? [Kuncze] Yes, under an SZDSZ government. The next government will even have to agree to limit its own sphere of operation if this can make the consensus more solid. We are prepared for this. [passage omitted] [Pinter] The SZDSZ rejected with visible annoyance the idea that the elections will actually be decided by a duel between the MSZP and the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. Has your protest had any effect? [Kuncze] These two parties are playing the game of strengthening each other. Everyone who does not like the MDF should go to the MSZP and everyone who is afraid of the MSZP should support the MDF. Through this, the two parties show what they are most afraid of. Their claims are not true on the basic level of facts, either. As for [Prime Minister] Boross's statement that they are still in the competition, it is contradicted by all public opinion polls. The electors have long decided who has to leave. The question is, who should come. I am certain that the electors do not just want to swap their tulips for carnations [the MDF and MSZP symbols] and keep all else the same. I am seeking the conditions for a balanced coalition. However, we will not achieve any change if the MSZP becomes very strong. The MDF's fate shows that the electors did not like the concealed one-party system any more than the open one before. This is why we are asking the electors to vote for us. A strong SZDSZ is a guarantee that the practice of the past four years will not be continued and, at the same time, there will not be a return to the practice of the past four decades, either. [Pinter] The SZDSZ has a completely different attitude to the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]. What is this to indicate? [Kuncze] The SZDSZ is an party open to all democratic directions, therefore, we have not excluded the possibility of cooperation with the KDNP, either. However, we are not conducting talks with the KDNP to strengthen our relations. [passage omitted]
