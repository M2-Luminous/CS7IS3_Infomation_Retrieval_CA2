During the military exercise, which was conducted under a signboard of a so-called exercise for improving interoperability, the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets exercised as if in actual combat by landing Marine troops with transporters and helicopters in assumed enemy territory; bombing major facilities and obstacles, including dams and bridges; and eliminating the opponent's troops after infiltrating special Marine troops and helicopters. This dangerous fire game [puljangnan] aimed at attacking the inland of the Northern half of the Republic clearly shows how the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are frantically running to provoke a new war. As everyone knows, an extremely grave situation is being created on the Korean peninsula. The U.S. imperialists are gathering aggressive forces on a large scale in South Korea and the adjacent areas in order to put in actual practice the northward invasion war plan dubbed "New Operation Plan 5027," which they devised with the puppets. Apache attack helicopters and new Patriot missiles have already been deployed for mobile warfare to South Korea. According to data, in case of an emergency on the Korean peninsula, the U.S. military is devising a plan to deploy 600,000 soldiers, over 200 ships, and 1,600 aircraft from the mainland of the United States within 80 days. On the other hand, the war maniacs, including the U.S. defense secretary, are making a series of ruthless remarks that a preemptive attack against North Korea would not be ruled out and that they would even risk a war. Along with the U.S. imperialists, the Kim Yong-sam clique is also running wild in war exercises to harm fellow countrymen putting the entire puppet Army under an around-the-clock alert posture. At present, large-scale wild war exercises are being jointly conducted by three services of the puppet Army, Navy, and Air Force in the sky, on the land, and in the sea of South Korea. Apart from this, another military exercise is being conducted and South Korea is literally turning into an actual combat exercise field for northward invasion war exercises. There, the day dawns with war exercises and the night falls with war exercises. As we can see, the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are trying to kindle a war on the Korean peninsula by all means and their war mania is reaching extremes. Due to the provocative maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique for a new war, the situation on the Korean peninsula is developing into a phase of a dangerous war that could explode any minute. What is making us more outraged is that the puppets are describing the provocative northward invasion war exercise as contributive to the peaceful settlement of the Korean peninsula. They are indeed shameless. War exercises and peace can never be parallel. Peace cannot be achieved when war exercises continue. How can one say that it is contributive to peace to join outside forces to sharpen the sword to harm fellow countrymen and to lead the situation to a crisis of a brink of war? The puppets cannot conceal the provocative character of the war exercises or their bellicose nature by any deceptive talk. The U.S. imperialists and their hunting dog the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique are trying to shake our socialist system with a reckless war commotion, but it is as foolish and stupid as trying to break a rock with an egg. We want peace, but will never beg for it. We do not want war, but will never fear it. If the rascals dare to kindle the fire like a puppy not knowing of a tiger's threat, our people and People's Army, who have a firm self-reliant national economy and strong national defense power, will pay back with retaliatory strikes [pobok tagyok] that are thousands and hundreds times more severe [hodoen]. The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets, who are stirred up by northward invasion war fever, must clearly know that provokers will pay a dear price and must not run recklessly.
