The victims were taken from a church at Nyamirambo where over 190 had taken refuge. Government troops and militias attacked the church with machine guns and grenades. The 170 people were mainly Tutsis who were forced into trucks and taken for slaughter. The continued killing of innocent civilians by government forces is an indication of the refusal by the government to accept conditions given by the Rwandan Patriotic Front for cease-fire negotiations.
