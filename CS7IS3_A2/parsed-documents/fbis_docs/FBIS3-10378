"We totally support the proposal," FSLN Secretary General Daniel Ortega said. Last Tuesday, however, Stedman Fagoth, the Yatama [Miskito, Sumu, and Rama Indians, and Creole groups organization] leader and Rio Cocoa candidate for the Liberal Constitutionalist Party, reacted with surprise to the proposal. According to the document, the objectivies of the FSLN proposal are "to secure respect for the people's vote through proportional participation of each [political] force in the regional government." It also aims to politically stabilize the region by reducing signs of violence, threats, and terrorism. The North Atlantic Sandinist leaders propose that the minimum bases for this government of unity be: security for all residents, labor stability, proportional distribution of positions on the Regional Council's board of directors, and a consensus on the election of the governor. Also, to guarantee the operation of municipal offices and the establishment of mechanisms to reach "a joint definition on government action with the participation of religious authorities and political forces that do not obtain seats on the Regional Council." As a means of furthering the implementation of their proposal, the North Atlantic Sandinists suggest a meeting with the regional authorities of the parties that won seats on the Regional Council to discuss their proposal and the creation of a government transition commission.
