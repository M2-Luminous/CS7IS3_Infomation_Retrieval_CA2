The Economic-Policy Dilemmas of Export's Decline"] [Text] The development and state of Hungary's foreign trade are investigated usually on the basis of trade data reported in dollars. The figures for dollar-denominated trade from 1988 through 1992 show exceptionally dynamic growth. They are very impressive even if we know that ruble-denominated trade has ceased in the meantime. Until 1988-1989, transactions denominated in hard currency accounted for about 60 percent of our foreign trade. Since 1991, however, practically all of Hungary's foreign trade has been denominated in hard currency. Our dollar-denominated exports nearly doubled between 1988 and 1992. The growth of imports was even faster--it more than doubled during that period. The growth of imports accelerated in 1993, but there was an unprecedented sharp decline in exports. As a result, the balance of payments showed a very significant current account deficit. On the basis of its rapid growth through 1992, foreign trade seemed a success in comparison with the national economy's other branches. There was debate about whether the success had occurred despite, or actually as a direct result of the Hungarian economy's general depression. The former view was held by those who felt that the growth of exports could be attributed to significant effort, and not just to economic necessity; and that economic policy had to maintain and stimulate the orientation to export. The other group's opinion was based on the belief that the Soviet (or rather CEMA) market's collapse and the contraction of domestic demand automatically compelled producers to storm foreign markets and, therefore, export incentives were unnecessary. Anyhow, it seemed that the shift in foreign trade had been completed, and adjustment to foreign markets was faster than had been expected. Naturally, last year's events have modified the above assessments. It is obvious that both domestic and foreign factors played a role the sharp decline in exports. But the fact that, among the former socialist countries, the decline in Hungary's exports was uniquely severe indicates that Western Europe's recession cannot be regarded by any means as the decline's decisive cause. There are many possible domestic economic explanations that could be offered. What distinguished Hungary from several other Central European countries, until the autumn of 1993, was an exchange-rate policy that revalued the forint in real terms. Consequently, Hungarian export's cost-competitiveness declined. while import's cost-competitiveness against domestic production increased. In addition, the arsenal of export incentives that Hungarian economic policy employed was very meager. Because farm and food-industry products traditionally play an important role in Hungary's exports (their significance is much greater than in the exports of our competitors), the agricultural sector's collapse in recent years inevitably caused serious harm to export trends. But we are not talking only about agriculture. From 1992 on, "supply-side shock therapy" had an unfavorable affect on the entire economy. I have in mind primarily the statutory regulations (the Bankruptcy Law, the Accounting Law, and the Banking Law) that were introduced in quick succession, amidst a severe recession. The statutory regulations rocked the enterprises that were in an already unstable financial situation, coping with marketing problems and by no means able to say that the difficulties created by the transformation were behind them. This reduced the available stocks of commodities and had an unfavorable effect on the ability to export. A protracted and deep recession--in conflict with earlier views--does not help exports in any way. To the contrary, after a time it makes a decline in export value inevitable. Essentially the point is that between 1990 and 1992, even during the dynamic growth of dollar-denominated exports at current prices, the total export volume dropped by about 7 or 8 percent. The export volume's shrinkage accelerated in 1993: its decline was 13 percent. On the import side, a decline similar to that of export in 1990-1992 was followed in 1993 by dynamic growth (of 21 percent, according to official statistics). From the preceding it is evident that, until 1992, the decline in exports was less than in GDP or in industrial and farm output. Amidst the economy's general contraction, that was a considerable achievement. On the other hand, the data also show that the switching of markets actually occurred, but at a much lower level of export activity than in 1990. Thus, even before 1993, the export problems had been much greater than they seemed. In the light of the processes that took place during the preceding years, therefore, last year's export trends are even less surprising. Finally, the negative and positive signs, respectively, of the development of exports and imports in 1993 make it more unambiguous how serious the tensions are that developed in Hungary's foreign trade last year. The conclusions that can be drawn from all this are as follows: 1. At the beginning of the 1990's, the problems of our foreign trade (and balance of payments) eased only temporarily, and today they are hampering the search for a way out just as much as they did four years ago. The only difference is merely that the economy (GDP) has declined by more than 20 percent since then. 2. Today and in the future, our external economic policy has to (or should) focus on an opening to the world market. In the short term, however, external economic policy is a function of business-cycle policy; and the question is how the strategy of an opening to the world market can be reconciled, if at all possible, with a business-cycle policy that is inevitably restrictive. 3. It is certain that a current deficit such as the one in the 1993 balance of payments cannot be maintained over a longer period of time. The only thing debatable about the deficit is whether it can be reduced this year or be allowed to ride through 1994, in which case a decision regarding possible austerity measures would have to be made next year, in the light of the external economic situation and the domestic developments by that time. Sound arguments can be presented in support of either variant. Technically--primarily as a result of our relatively substantial foreign currency reserves and the continuing influx of foreign direct investment--also a a wait-and-see policy could be pursued. But if the deficit on current account in the balance of payments continues to rise until the elections or thereafter, we will have to reckon with the possibility of a worsening of the conditions for obtaining external financing, to an extent such that a more drastic curtailment of domestic expenditure will then become necessary. In this sense, then, we have a choice between curtailing domestic expenditures as soon as possible, or curtailing it more drastically later on. There is no doubt as to which option economic common sense would support. Yet, that is not the real dilemma. I suspect that the restrictive stages have not really been successful either. I am far from convinced that, when Hungarian economic policy resorted to stimulation or restriction, it did so at the right time and in the right way. Yet I do not think that business-cycle policy in the narrower sense is to blame for the economy's serious situation. Behind the external economic tensions there are structural problems that cannot be solved merely with these instruments.
