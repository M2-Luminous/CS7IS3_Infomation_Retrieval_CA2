Cooperala, Cooperative of Argentine Laboratories of Medicinal Specialities, says in a communique that the executive branch's draft "reflects the highest aspiration of U.S. multinational laboratories." It adds: "This is in disagreement with the guidelines agreed upon in this respect by the executive branch in the recently concluded GATT Uruguay Round." "In the chapter that refers to medicinal patents, the Uruguay Round considerably attenuates the U.S. demands and makes more equitable the rights and obligations of the 119 countries that signed the document," the communique states. Cooperala admits that "although intellectual property rights are a basic factor for guaranteeing the continuity of individual creativity and industrial progress, our organization understands that the creation of a monopoly to implement this factor is inconceivable." "We understand that with an adequate percentage of acknowledgement for the inventor, society can benefit from the serious competition of all those industrialists who have adequate capability to develop medicines," the communique concludes.
