FR940202-0-00042 FR940202-0-00006 In response to a comment, the final regulations provide a special rule for certain variable rate debt instruments (such as auction rate or adjustable rate debt instruments) that provide for a fixed rate of interest for an initial period, followed by a period during which the interest is reset to a rate that will enable the instrument to trade at a fixed amount when the reset becomes effective. Under this special rule, the debt instrument is treated as maturing on the date the reset rate becomes effective and reissued on that date for the fixed amount. As a result of this rule, for example, if a debt instrument is issued at a discount (i.e., the issue price of the debt instrument is less than its par value) and is reset to par after an initial period, the discount on the instrument will be accrued entirely in the initial period rather than over the full term of the instrument. Effective Dates These regulations apply to debt instruments issued on or after April 4, 1994, and to lending transactions, sales, and exchanges that occur on or after April 4, 1994. However, ยง1.1272&hyph;3 applies to debt instruments acquired on or after April 4, 1994, and ยง1.1275&hyph;2(d)(2) applies to qualified reopenings that occur on or after March 25, 1992. Reliance on Final Regulations Except for ยง1.1272&hyph;3, taxpayers may rely on the final regulations for debt instruments issued after December 21, 1992, and for lending transactions, sales, and exchanges that occur after December 21, 1992. Authority Under Section 6662 Although the final regulations dispose of the underlying proposed regulations (other than ยง1.446&hyph;2(e)(3)), the IRS will allow taxpayers to treat the proposed regulations as authority under section 6662 of the Code for debt instruments issued after December 21, 1992, and prior to April 4, 1994, and for lending transactions, sales, and exchanges that occurred after December 21, 1992, and prior to April 4, 1994. The IRS also will allow taxpayers to treat the OID regulations that were proposed in 1986 and 1991 as authority under section 6662 for debt instruments issued prior to December 22, 1992, and for lending transactions, sales, and exchanges that occurred prior to December 22, 1992. Special Analyses It has been determined that these regulations are not major rules as defined in Executive Order 12291. Therefore, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Drafting Information The principal authors of these regulations are William E. Blanchard and Andrew C. Kittler of the Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Financial Institutions and Products), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.
