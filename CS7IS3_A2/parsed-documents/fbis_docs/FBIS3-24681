Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-25FEB94-HUNGARY Hungary: Premier's Stance on NATO's AWACS Gets Wide Support Prime Minister Peter Boross, leader of Hungary's right of center government, has received wide domestic support for his surprise announcement on February Il that if NATO launches airstrikes against Serbian forces in Bosnia, NATO's AWACS surveillance planes will have to leave Hungarian airspace for the duration of the attack. Interviewed by the daily Magyar Nemzet on 14 February, Laszlo Kovacs--chairman of the foreign relations committee and member of the opposition Hungarian Socialist Party- -declared that he is "in complete agreement" with the prime minister's decision. Moreover, Kovacs indicated to Duna Television on 18 February after a joint meeting of the parliament's defense and foreign relations committees that "on the whole" all seven parliamentary parties agree on the issue because Budapest must avoid "even the appearance" of "indirect participation" in hostile action against the Serbian forces. The parliamentary consensus on banning NATO's AWACS flights appears to reflect athe public mood. Hungary's largest daily, Nepszabadsag--a socialist paper that is usually a harsh critic of the government--supported Boross's stance in a 14 February editorial, declaring that it "most certainly meets with the widest possible agreement in public opinion" because the Hungarian people want to avoid getting "mixed up in any kind of war." Support for Boross was not unanimous, however. Criticizing him not for the substance of the decision but for the handling of the issue, Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, foreign affairs spokesman of the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats, charged that Boross went "too far" in announcing the decision publicly at a press conference. While he "approved" of the prime minister's efforts to keep Hungary out of the Serbian conflict, Szent-Ivanyi said, it would have been "more appropriate" to "simply remind NATO" that the agreement allowing AWACS surveillance flights over Hungary stipulates that the flights "cannot be used for military activities" (Magyar Hirlap, 16 February). The only strong public condemnation of the decision itself appeared to come from the liberal daily Magyar Hirlap, which said in a 16 February editorial that by banning the AWACS flights Hungary was indirectly supporting the Serbian position and would therefore "share the guilt for all that is happening in Bosnia."
