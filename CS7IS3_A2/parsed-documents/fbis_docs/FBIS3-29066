Mr. Keating repeated that Australia would not enter any bilateral arrangements that were detrimental to Japan, but said this was different to taking sides. He said the tension between Tokyo and Washington reflected fundamental underlying differences. [Begin Keating recording] The U.S. and Japan will work that out. We shall create a new institution to work it out within, and that is APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]. APEC gives the United States and Japan a chance within an umbrella organization to look at their policy and trade differences, but they will always do it bilaterally as well as in any other framework. There is a lot of serious thought about this relationship, and it is in terms of their current account -- that has had a problem for years -- and this tension underlines the savings imbalance between the two countries. Now, it is going to take time to work this out, but it is working itself out in the sense now that the United States is enjoying very rapid growth of exports into North and South Asia. So the dependency of Japan upon the U.S. as a market is diminishing and, like most problems, they tend naturally to work themselves out. [end recording]
