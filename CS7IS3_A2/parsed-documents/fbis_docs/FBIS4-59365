FBIS4-59365 "drnes092_o_94001" FBIS-NES-94-092 Daily Report 12 May 1994 SYRIA Press Regrets U.S. Statement on Terrorism Press Regrets U.S. Statement on Terrorism JN1205100494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 12 May 94 JN1205100494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Press review] [Text] In an editorial headlined "An Improper Beginning," the AL-BA'TH newspaper says: At the beginning of next week U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will return to the region again after he toured its capitals two weeks ago, but his mission of giving a push to the peace process has not achieved any results due to the Rabin government's stands which pushed the peace talks to a stalemate. The paper adds: What makes things uncomfortable is that Mr. Christopher begins his new tour of the region with the statement issued by his department on terrorism and the states which protect terrorism, in which the name of Syria, along with the names of other states, was included. This is not a good and appropriate beginning, especially since the U.S. State Department's statement is unrealistic and based on many fallacies, in addition to the fact that it is hostile and provocative. AL-BA'TH says: If this statement is meant to pressure Syria, Syria has never yielded and will never yield to pressures from any one. The paper adds: We would have hoped and wished that Secretary Christopher had not sent this statement as an opening message concerning efforts to reactivate the peace process. This is because this is an improper message and the address to which it was sent is completely wrong. The paper says: Christopher is returning to the region based on his statements that he has positive ideas on the Syrian-Israeli track. Undoubtedly, everyone who loves just and comprehensive peace hopes that Christopher will something in his quiver that justifies his optimistic tone, and that the ideas he is talking about will be based on U.S. success in persuading the intransigent side which is rebelling against the international legitimacy; namely Israel, to accept the indispensable bases of making progress toward a just and comprehensive peace. The paper stresses that Christopher will find in Syria every concern about a just and comprehensive peace, and sincere cooperation to put the peace process on the road leading to this peace. Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH says: Syria is working for peace in the open. It will not accept a humiliating peace. Moreover, it will not do anything that would be shameful to announce. It is either an honorable and just peace or no peace. Under the headlines "The Basis for Peace," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: He is mistaken who thinks that Syria would accept less than the full restoration of the Golan, in addition to occupied southern Lebanon. This is because full withdrawal is the basis for a comprehensive peace, and he who is concerned about a just and comprehensive peace must also be faithful to the pillars and constants of peace which were approved at the Madrid Conference. The paper adds: Israel has imagined it can have peace and occupation together. Sometimes it slandered Syria's stands, and other times Lebanon's stands. It has always sought to entrap this or that party in a separate deal, something which was achieved in the labyrinths of Oslo which led to the Cairo agreement that imposed Israeli trusteeship on the Palestinian Arab people and their destinies. The paper adds: Israel cannot present the agreement with the Palestinian side as an example of partial solutions which it seeks to achieve on the other tracks of negotiations, or use it as a pretext to peddle such unilateral deals, and at the same time exclude the bases of the peace process and the pillars governing the Madrid conference, foremost of which is the implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. Proceeding from this important point, President Hafiz al-Asad stressed, when he received U.S. Secretary of State Christopher early this month, the need to tackle the major issues of the peace process in order to guarantee making progress. Also based on this, Presidents al-Asad and al-Hirawi have called for adhering to the Madrid bases and for further coordination among the Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian tracks. This is in order to foil Israel's attempts to deal separately with each Arab side and drag it into partial solutions that have nothing to do with the Madrid bases and the essence of a just and comprehensive peace, which is based on full withdrawal and resolving all aspects of the conflict to guarantee the establishment of a peace that would end all factors of tension and chaos, and fulfills the international community's desire for stability and security in the region. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Peace cannot be established without an accurate implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions which Israel seeks to bypass through secret deals and partial solutions which entrench occupation and give Israel peace and land together, something which is impossible. Under the headline "The Israeli Withdrawal," the newspaper TISHRIN says: News agencies cited informed sources as saying that the U.S. secretary of state's Middle East tour this time will be confined to Syria and Israel, and that it is aimed at giving the Syrian-Israeli track a push forward and at achieving tangible progress on the road to a just and entrenched peace in the region. TISHRIN adds: It is known that Christopher held lengthy talks in both occupied Jerusalem and Damascus during the previous tour. It is no longer a secret that Syria adhered to the principle of full and comprehensive withdrawal from the Golan as a basic condition for peace. At the same time, Israel gave first priority to its security, after which withdrawal will follow or will be achieved in phases to test Syria's peace intentions, as the Tel Aviv rulers say. The paper adds: Talk about probing Syria's peace intentions is a kind of deception and cover for the occupation and its expansionist plans, taking into consideration that Syria has always complied with the UN Security Council resolutions and the UN Charter and principles. Moreover, Syria has never been exposed to a single international denunciation. However, Israel has been violating the UN Security Council resolutions since 1947 until now. It has also violated the principles and charters of the international community. Based on this, Israel is the one which must be put to the test, considering that it is the aggressor and the occupier. Testing Israel's desire for peace can be represented by its full withdrawal from the Golan and all the occupied territories. The Knesset decision on the annexation of the Golan will never change this. The paper says: Syria has made several appeals to achieve a just and comprehensive peace, the peace of the brave, and called on Israel's rulers to be brave and to be up to this peace. Until this moment, Syria has not seen any true Israeli response. On the contrary, Israel's rulers adopted the policy of procrastination, prevarication, and of evading the UN Security Council resolutions. They have just made statements on a certain withdrawal from the Golan. We want to reiterate that Syria rejects any phased settlements or partial solutions. This is because true peace hinges on the full restoration of the Golan, the dismantling of all settlements, and the return of the Syrian evacuees to their land and homes. Consequently, Israel's withdrawal does not constitute a concession, for withdrawal is dictated by the international law and the UN Security Council resolutions. Concluding, TISHRIN says: Peace in the Middle East depends on Israel's compliance with the resolutions of international legitimacy. Israel's withdrawal from the Golan and the occupied territories paves the way for a firm and true peace. Without this, talk about peace will be a waste of time.
