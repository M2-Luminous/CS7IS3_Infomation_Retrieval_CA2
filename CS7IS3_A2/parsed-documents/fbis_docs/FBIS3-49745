I thought that it would be interesting to find out the political opinion of Mr. Tudor Mohora, one of the leaders of this party, regarding this issue. Mr. Mohora, you affirmed that the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] called itself a social-democratic party, thus a left-center party, which is ruling with right-wing measures. How can you support a different party in parliament and a different cabinet? [Mohora] We are in a somehow different situation today than right after the September 1992 elections. A possible answer to your question might be that, when we decided to support the ruling party, we took into consideration its program and the political signals that they released during the electoral campaign. Today, we have a certain critical attitude toward the government, the act of ruling itself, and our criticism ended in a simple motion, which however we could not promote further. After one year of ruling, we can no longer talk about declarations of intent, but we can talk about the act of governing, which has unfolded for long enough for us to have a proper picture of it. [Sragher] If the PDSR is ruling with right-wing measures, some of your voters are claiming that they should better allow the opposition to govern. How real does the possibility of the opposition's governing seem to you? [Mohora] I have studied the program and situation of the opposition carefully. Having a complete belief in the democratic system that we are currently building in our country, not only I do not exclude it, but I even believe that it is desirable that, in certain phases, the opposition should have a chance to govern. Unfortunately -- it is not I who judges them, but public opinion itself passes a judgment -- currently the opposition does not have a coherent picture of an economic and social construction. It is known that, although in the last part of this century there have been certain converging elements between the liberal and the social-democratic perspectives, both as doctrines and as pictures of the society, however, they stay far apart. [Sragher] You criticize the heterogeneous character of the CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania]. The PRM [Greater Romania Party] has only a national doctrine, just like the PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party], which, however, very recently called itself neoliberal, following the example of the PDAR [Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania], which, however, also assumes the agrarian doctrine. How homogeneous and viable is a possible future agreement with the parties that have such different ideologies? [Mohora] Well, certainly your question is very interesting and at the same time very difficult, but I believe that the answer to this question can be found in the responsibility and the idea of compromise that should govern us when we accept such a political alliance. The parties that you have mentioned might be criticized just like we can be criticized for certain aspects or, probably, for certain limitations in our policy. However, we have the following concept: We should be open and the democratic system requires -- if we understand the basic rule of democracy, which is ultimately a sublimation of tolerance -- that, if needed, one can set up alliances even with parties -- and such thing has already happened throughout history in Romania -- that are on the other side of the barricade. We have constantly said that we must be open and discuss issues regarding our country with all parties, regardless of their orientation, including the right-wing parties. [Sragher] Do you have a national unity government in mind? [Mohora] Yes, I do. As long as there are people outside our country's borders who are observing -- maybe from a more neutral position, that is, they are more detached from the political excitement -- that here one might reach -- and it is high time to reach -- an agreement on principles and on rules regarding major issues in the domestic and foreign policy of our country, that can be accepted by all of us. I believe that this would lead to the idea of a national unity government. [Sragher] Suppose tomorrow you become prime minister. What would be the first three major measures taken by you in order to solve the current crisis of our country? [Mohora] First of all a strong government is required. It should be strong both in the area of professional competence and in its moral force and the honesty of the people it includes, as well as in its team spirit. I believe that the PSM could form a strong government. It would need not only three, but a whole set of measures. First of all, those government decisions and those laws should be adopted and promoted that would put order in the public sector. If the government and society have such an important public sector, it should not be left -- as it has happened so far -- unattended. A second issue would refer to the real stimulation of the private sector. Currently I believe that there are no appropriate conditions, neither legislative nor governmental ones, that would enable a small entrepreneur to start a business and be successful. Currently, a monopoly and a banking system have been established, which are a wizardry that pumps very important funds into firms that, in most cases, do not have a productive character, but rather a character of financial-banking and commercial profiteering. The third measure: Precisely the team that I was talking about should start a merciless war against corruption. This affliction that I believe continues to expand is -- to say the least -- tolerated by the current leadership. This would mean to put order in the police and justice system. We can put our own house in order by persistently implementing daily measures and actions. In fact, our country has reached such a dramatic situation that, as a matter of fact, a concrete anti-crisis program should be adopted by a government that would have all fields of activity in mind. [Sragher] Does the PSM believe that the construction of socialism should resume? [Mohora] No. The PSM believes that we should establish the state of law because, in our program, we recognized and included, without any reticence, the provisions of Romania's Constitution. However, we should make sure that this establishment of the state of law serves the national interests, namely the reform, our integration in European structures, etc. and should be in Romania's favor. Secondly, the ordinary citizen should detect and perceive this state of law as a major advantage compared to the past regime. Unfortunately, one cannot say that, according to the way things have developed in the past four years, the citizen feels more protected or a greater social and legal, or even physical, security than before. [Sragher] In what way did you support the idea of privatization? [Mohora] From the very beginning, we agreed to privatization in agriculture and in the sphere of services, which should be much more developed, in commerce, and tourism. But privatization can be done in all areas -- apart from the energy system, telecommunications, transportation, and the defense industry -- on the basis of economic profitability and the privatization process should even be speeded up. [Sragher] Do you believe that the Euro-Atlantic integration is a positive act? [Mohora] We have spoken out without reticence in favor of integration in the European structures, both in the political area as well as economic and cultural areas. Those who believe that the PSM wishes to find answers for the renewal of the Romanian society in other regions of the world are greatly mistaken. We do not see integration under all circumstances, but rather under conditions that should really serve Romania. We desire a position of dignity and equity in relations with the countries that are members of the European Union's structures and also a real promotion of our interests on essential, cardinal issues such as integration into the NATO structures. As far as foreign bases are concerned, our position is on this issue is that the Romanian Parliament and the Romanian people should be consulted. These are not issues that belong exclusively to the government or the president. [Sragher] Can we understand that currently the PSM would oppose the deployment of NATO bases on Romanian territory? [Mohora] In the leadership of our party we have not established a position regarding NATO. However, I could not say that now, if Romania were invited to enter NATO structures, the PSM would certainly oppose such actions. We would decide about it after we took into account the respective circumstances at the time when such a proposal is made. Because the balance of forces certainly will be different in six months time or a year's time and the geostrategic picture will also be different. There is no point in discussing now how we would relate to such an issue. We cannot be against integration in a security system that would be to our advantage. As far as our position on a foreign basis is concerned, we have a determined position: We do not wish the deployment of foreign bases on our country's territory. [Sragher] Do you believe that Romania's joining or not joining a security system also depends on Russia? How do you regard the new political games after the announcement of the military doctrine and the strengthening of the army after the October coup? [Mohora] I believe that one should not ignore the warnings that Russia is launching toward all countries that formerly were part of the "cordon sanitaire" between it and the Western world, when it demands that no political-military alliances should be established that might be directed against it. Russia believes that every alliance in Europe in which it is not included is directed against it or in some way opposing it. In fact, this is an old political concept. The more so since Russia had and continues to have a global vision about foreign policy and cannot give up and will not be able to give in the future either -- except maybe under certain circumstances -- this idea. A healthy policy in this respect would be if Romania adopted a very prudent attitude on the issue of military integration and security structures, that are still not consolidated. We can see that the situation of establishing relations in this area is still vague. Forcing for example the issue of integration in military structures might create in the future reactions and might mark our relations with our very powerful neighbors, which possess the nuclear weapon and which, even if they currently face economic difficulties, still hold the statute of great military powers. And this might be harmful to our country's interests.
