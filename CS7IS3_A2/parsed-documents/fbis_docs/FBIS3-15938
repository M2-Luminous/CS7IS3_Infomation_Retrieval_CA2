In his interview with Interfax, he reported that shelling of Karabakh positions is going on every day. Moreover, in his words, "while waging active offensive operations, the Azerbaijani party deliberately creates obstacles on the way to any peacemaking efforts by referring to the existence of various approaches to settling the conflict: CSCE's and Russia's one." Petrosyan expressed conviction that "if to throw away the screen of words and to judge just by deeds, then it becomes clear that Baku's true goals remain the same, to force a solution of the Karabakh problem by military means." That is why, Petrosyan said, the Karabakh party is so anxious with respect to guarantees and provisions for Nagorno-Karabakh's security and is circumspect about peaceful statements voiced by Azerbaijani leaders.
