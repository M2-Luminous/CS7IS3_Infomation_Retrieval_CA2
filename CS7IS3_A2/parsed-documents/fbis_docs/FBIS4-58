FBIS TRENDS-29APR94-China-India Beijing Denies Troop Build-Up On Indian Border Beijing Denies Troop Build-Up On Indian Border Beijing has authoritatively denied Western news reports of large scale Chinese military deployments along the Sino-Indian border and portrayed recent talks with Indian officials on border issues as contributing to continued progress in resolving the sensitive border issue. In response to a reporter's question at a 28 April news conference in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin rejected as "sheer fabrication" reports that China had sent "30,000 troops" through Tibet to the Sino-Indian border (Xinhua, 28 April). Consistent with Wu's denial, the Western press agency Agence France Presse quoted an Indian defense ministry spokesman on 25 April as dismissing reports from "Tibetan sources" that day of Chinese troop movements into Tibet and described the Indo-Tibetan border as "absolutely normal" (AFP, 25 April 1994). Wu buttressed his denial of troop movements by noting that China and India had "begun talks on the reduction of troops" along the border in line with an accord signed last year by the two countries that established diplomatic and military expert teams from the two sides to negotiate a solution to the longstanding border problem (Xinhua 28, April). Both Chinese and Indian media commentary on the recently concluded second round of talks between the teams suggests that both sides view the 21-23 April meetings as having made progress on some issues. Reflecting this apparent progress, a 23 April Xinhua report stated that the two sides signed regulations guiding the work of the teams. The report also implied that progress had been made when, in contrast to Xinhua's portrayal of the first round of expert talks in February, it made no mention of military tension on the border and said that the two sides had discussed ways of "continuing" to implement the border accord. In February, Xinhua had said that the teams had exchanged views on solving, "as early as possible," the issue of "close military confrontation at certain sectors" of the border, and had discussed "future tasks in implementing" the agreement. Indian media were even more upbeat in assessing the results of the talks. A 25 April report carried by the ISI Diplomatic Information Service not only repeated Xinhua's evaluation of the talks but also went on to claim that both sides had expressed satisfaction at "the confidence building measures already in place" and that the line of actual control along the Sino-Indian border was "peaceful." The atmosphere of the talks, it said, was "friendly" and the two teams had "adopted a constructive and forward-looking approach." (AUTHOR: SIMON.
