In the meeting, the DLP decided to make efforts to have the people become aware of the present security situation. At today's meeting, Yi Se-ki, chairman of the Policy Committee, said that the crisis situation resulting from the North Korean nuclear issue is heightened because North Korea claimed that it would regard any form of sanctions against it as an act of war declaration against North Korea. Yi also said that in case the UN sanctions turn out to be difficult because of the Chinese opposition, despite the fact that measures for sanctions are pushed ahead on the part of the United Nations, the government is grouping for multinational sanctions among the ROK, Japan, and the United States.
