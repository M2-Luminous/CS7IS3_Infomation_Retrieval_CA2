FR940208-0-00035 FR940208-0-00019 By comparison, under the State proposal, the key consideration in determining whether an area of land qualifies as previously mined area, is whether the previous surface coal mining operations there were ``subject to the standards of the [SMCRA] *␣*␣*'' To the extent the State proposal relies upon whether an area of land was subject to the standards of SMCRA, it is similar to the previous Federal definition of ``previously mined area,'' promulgated on May 8, 1987 (52 FR 17526, 17529). As discussed in the preamble to the promulgation of the current Federal definition of ``previously mined area,'' the 1987 Federal definition of that term was remanded by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. See National Wildlife Federation v. Lujan , 733 F. Supp. 419, 438&hyph;442 (1990). The Court found that the 1987 definition did not conform to the requirements of SMCRA to the extent it relied upon any date other than the date of SMCRA's enactment_August 3, 1977. Id. Therefore, although the Director finds Iowa's proposed rule at IAC 27&hyph;40.4(9) satisfies the previous required amendment at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(1) and is approving it, the Director is requiring Iowa to further amend its definition of ``previously mined area'' at IAC 27&hyph;40.4(9) to be explicitly no less effective than the current Federal definition at 30 CFR 701.5. The Director will modify the required amendment at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(1) in accordance with this finding. 10 IAC 27&hyph;40.21(207), Definition for ``Valid Existing Rights'' Iowa proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27&hyph;40.21(207) by incorporating by reference the definition for ``valid existing rights'' (VER) at 30 CFR 761.5 as it existed on July 1, 1992. Paragraphs (a) and (c) of the definition were suspended on November 20, 1986 (51 FR 41952, 41954&hyph;41955). In that suspension notice, OSM stated the following with regard to Federal Programs and the Indian Lands Program: *␣*␣* Suspending the rule has the effect of undoing the improper promulgation and leaving in place the VER test in use before the 1983 definition was promulgated. That test was the 1979 test, including the ``needed for and adjacent'' test, as modified by the August 4, 1980, suspension notice which implemented the District Court's February 1980 opinion in In Re: Permanent (I) (the 1980 test) *␣*␣* Under the 1980 test, a demonstration of both property rights and that the person either had made a good faith effort to obtain all permits necessary to mine or that the coal is both needed for and adjacent to an ongoing surface coal mining operation is sufficient to establish VER. Accordingly, OSM will make VER determinations in Federal program States and on Indian lands using the 1980 test. OSM will make VER determinations on a case-by-case basis after examining the particular facts of each case, and will consider property rights in existence on August 3, 1977, the owner of which by that date had made a good faith effort to obtain all permits, as one class of circumstances which would invariably entitle the property owner to VER. VER would also exist when there are property rights in existence on August 3, 1977, the owner of which can demonstrate that the coal is both needed for an immediately adjacent to a mining operation in existence prior to August 3, 1977. As discussed in Finding no. 4 of this document, Iowa has indicated its intention to adopt the suspension notices located at the end of the federal regulations published in the Code of Federal regulations. Thus, as applied to the definition of VER, the Director interprets Iowa's adoption of the Federal definition to include the above-quoted language language from the November 20, 1986, preamble. The Director will notify Iowa of any change in the Federal regulation in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(d) and may in the future require Iowa to modify its regulatory program to remain consistent with the Federal provision. In the meantime, the Director is approving Iowa's proposed adoption by reference of the definition for VER at 30 CFR 761.5. 11. IAC 27&hyph;40.31(2), Requirements for Permits and Permit Processing Iowa proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27&hyph;40.31(2) by requiring that the words ``and the scale of the map'' be added at the end of the last sentence of 30 CFR 773.13(a)(1)(ii), as incorporated by reference into the State program. In addition, Iowa proposes to add the following paragraph to 30 CFR 773.13(a)(1)(ii), as incorporated by reference into the State program:
