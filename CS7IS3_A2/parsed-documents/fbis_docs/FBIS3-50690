The generals discharged from duty owing to a "reshuffling of structures" had less than 35 years in service, and their ages would allow them to remain on duty, the daily LA REPUBLICA reported on Tuesday, 4 January. The alleged "purged" generals are Roger Alvitez, Edgar Sullca, Eusebio Bedoya, Rodolfo Enceles, Hector Escobar, Jesus Sanchez, Ernesto Arenas, Cirilio Pacheco, and Ramiro Berrantes. All of them had been scheduled to attend a public tribute given in their honor by the PNP but did not attend, apparently unhappy with the government decision.
