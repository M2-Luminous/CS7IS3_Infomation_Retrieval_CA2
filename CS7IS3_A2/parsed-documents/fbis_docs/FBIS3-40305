The mission of the current intelligence service of the democratic state is to predict and mitigate the risks that threaten not only the democratic state, but all of human civilization. The greatest dangers include, for example, the expansion of technologies and components for the production of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, international terrorism, illegal transfers of classical weapons to locations causing concern in the world, racism, chauvinism, as well as anti-Semitism. But it is necessary to stress that positive intelligence can function well and serve only as an integral part of a comprehensive information system. Much like counterintelligence, the present-day Czech intelligence service--the Office for Foreign Contacts and Information--has been rebuilt from the ground up and is operating in accordance with totally new principles. After November 1989, we took absolute account of the fact that every secret service is a civilian barometer of the political regime of a given country. We were completely guided by the principle according to which a fundamental political change within a country must be followed by a fundamental change in its secret services. In other words, we did not embark on "democratization," but, as the only postcommunist country, we began building these services from the very beginning. Our approach is highly regarded today by all democratic Western services that accept us as equal partners as the only ones from the former Soviet bloc. As far back as 1990, communist espionage officers who operated under diplomatic cover were withdrawn from all Czechoslovak embassies. The liquidation of their stations also resulted in disconnecting the entire agent net of the pre-November intelligence service operated by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, which employed around 300 agents and confidential sources from among the ranks of foreign nationals during the period of 1970-89. The likelihood that these people continue to work against our Republic and against other democratic states is virtually nonexistent. Intelligence services with hostile aims must expect that the disconnected agent net is not only known to our intelligence service today. The Office for Foreign Contacts and Information even settled with the so-called illegals who were operating abroad without diplomatic cover. All of them--their numbers did not exceed 40--were exclusively Czechoslovak citizens who, as officers in the communist intelligence service, had undergone long-term training. They arrived at their destinations, where they lived as foreign nationals, equipped with false documents, generally via a third country from which they emigrated to the target country after several years of living in the third country. They were to be activated only in times of international crisis or in the event of war. All of the illegals were invited to return by the Office for Foreign Contacts and Information: Many heeded the call and with respect to those who remained in place our side undertook steps to limit their activities against our Republic and against the other democratic nations. The structure and activities of the Office for Foreign Contacts and Information are based on a completely new philosophy of positive intelligence that is based on the demise of communism and, thus, on the demise of a bipolar world. The harsh and merciless war between the democratic and totalitarian secret services has come to an end and the bitter opponents of 40 years are faced with the possibility of partnership relationships and collaboration. The twilight of political espionage is beginning; traditional forms of espionage are being reevaluated; the concept of an enemy is being replaced by the concept of danger and the "espionage" environment of agents, illegals, and active measures is being shifted to the area of anticivilization risks. In current intelligence work, more and more information is being acquired from overt areas. But not even this development changes much about the fact that secret services continue to represent a sharp sword and that democratic states must hold them on a short rein by exercising strict control over them. Nevertheless, the current political climate has already given rise to the process for their dedemonization and transparency. The public has the right to know what the secret services in democratic countries are for and why they exist. They are here to protect national interests, to protect freedom and democracy, and, as a result, also to protect every one of us against violence, crime, and a lack of freedom.
