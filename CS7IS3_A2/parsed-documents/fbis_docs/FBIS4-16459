Viktor Chernomyrdin told the EBRD leaders and prominent statesmen and business people from the bank's fifty-seven stockholding countries that the forum in St. Petersburg is "a weighty testimony to the fact that the anxiety and uncertainty felt by our international partners about the fact of economic reforms in Russia, so pronounced at the beginning of the year, are now giving room to other sentiments and different expectations". For his part, the Russian prime minister said "quite definitely and responsibly" that the policy of financial stabilisation, further reforms and restructuring of the national economy will remain the pivot of the Russian economic policy. Chernomyrdin pointed to the results of the first months of this year as bearing out his statement. In February and March, the inflation growth rate fell beneath ten per cent and the April figures will not differ considerably. The federal budget for the end of 1994 has been drafted with a deficit of about nine per cent of the gross product. It means that given the steady main parameters, the inflation growth rate will dwindle to seven per cent before the year is out. The discussion of the draft budget in the Federal Assembly is proceeding with difficulties, Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed. The draft has been approved as the basis, and "we shall take into account any modifications approved by the deputies in line with the overall logic of the reforms carried out in Russia. Political and financial stabilisation has already yielded its first fruit -- demand restrictions have begun to work. Although the production slump has been increasing since the beginning of the year, it has acquired a clear-cut structural character. "We are now at the deepest point of the crisis," the prime minister said. The Russians have come quite close to the frontier beyond which U-turn can occur in the main negative tendencies which determined our development in the past two-three years. But the U-turn can occur only if investments liven up", Chernomyrdin said. The Russian premier appealed to the representatives of the European bank for reconstruction and development and the delegations from industrialised countries and international financial organisations to step up their activities on the Russian market. Annual meetings of the board of directors of the EBRD traditionally examine the results of the bank's activity for the preceding year and determine guidelines for the next year. As concerns Russia, central bank officials told ITAR-TASS that the European bank has approved loans to fund 21 projects in Russia, including major ones, such as the development of the oilfield in the Arctic area of the Pechora basin, worth 300 million USD. By the end of this year, the number of approved projects, which are now being prepared, may reach fifty.
