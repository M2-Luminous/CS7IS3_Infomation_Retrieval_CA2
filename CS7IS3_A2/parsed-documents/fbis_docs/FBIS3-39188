The marine pilots saw how the graves were being dug on the football field next to Kosevo hospital. And then they flew back to base, without being able to fire a single shot. America could see, mainly through ABC, how the Bosnia policy of President Clinton, the European Union, NATO, and the United Nations was once again being reduced to nothing at all. The dramatic television pictures produced an immediate effect, in the form of meetings between the President and his foreign policy advisers. Throughout the weekend anxious looking ministers and CIA bosses shuttled back and forth to the White House. But the collective handwringing remained without result in Washington and Brussels on Monday. The absurdity level of these meetings was further emphasized by an anonymous Pentagon military official who told CNN that if U.S. pilots in Italy were given the order they could destroy Serbian positions around Sarajevo within an hour. But instead of this the world was treated to new declarations on ending the siege of Sarajevo "with all possible means, including air strikes." Powerful but familiar words. President Clinton in particular revealed an unexpectedly weak side last weekend. Following the latest meeting of NATO government leaders, in mid-January, Clinton gave the impression that new attacks on the so-called safe areas -- including Sarajevo -- would be met with harsh measures. But now at the first sign of aggression the President is balking -- or at least this is the impression he is giving. He has called for an enquiry to find out who carried out the attack. According to UN soldiers on the spot it is impossible to precisely determine the mortar's line of fire, but it is certain that it was fired from a position to the northeast of Sarajevo, from a Serbian position. The reason for Clinton's hesitant approach is clear. Divisions within the alliance -- with Great Britain and Canada exerting great pressure for restraint -- and divisions within the U.S. Government --- the State Department versus the Defense Department -- are the major causes. At the White House the belief took root some time ago now that active intervention by Clinton in Bosnia could be very dangerous for his domestic agenda, as the American people would not support him in such a policy. Clinton's power base in the United States and in Congress is too small to embark upon any foreign adventures, the argument goes. Given his slim electoral victory in 1992 and the balance of power in Congress, there are indeed arguments to support this analysis. The call for strong action by Congress comes mainly from a handful of Republicans and a few Democrats -- such as Lee Hamilton, president of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Together with a few vociferous columnists in THE NEW YORK TIMES, they are arguing for the United States to play a bigger role. This call -- which is being voiced increasing loudly -- has found little support among large groups of Republicans and Democrats from the south, mid-west and west of the country. Memories of previous wars -- Vietnam -- and recent military actions -- Somalia -- are still too fresh. And Clinton is a political animal who is acutely aware of prevailing opinions. Although no American lives are threatened in Bosnia, peace and stability in Europe are an American interest too. And violations of human rights are an affront to American values. What he can be accused of is having done so little to shift opinion and to assume the leadership of the international community. In public -- and as far as we know also behind the scenes -- he has done nothing to put an end to the national and international divisions. It is true that the Europeans have -- regretfully -- been found wanting, but the United States has subsequently done little to correct their errors. The only strong stance taken by Clinton concerned the lifting of the arms embargo so that the Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves. The attack on the Saturday market in Sarajevo has deprived opponents of lifting this arms embargo of any good arguments. If the Bosnians are not helped by the West then they certainly have the right to defend themselves. The basic error is that right from the outset the Europeans have presented Bosnia as a humanitarian problem and not also as the victim of a military campaign of conquest by the Serbs and Croats. If a UN enquiry shows that the Serbs launched the mortar grenade then military air strikes will be unavoidable. These must be accompanied by the lifting of the arms embargo to allow the Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves against the advancing Serbs and Croats. The argument that arms supplies will only prolong the fighting also lost its force last Saturday. What use have the Bosnian Muslims of food parcels if they are then going to be slaughtered on the marketplace? When Winston Churchill asked President Roosevelt for weapons and equipment in December 1940, Roosevelt -- who did indeed show leadership -- did not reply with the argument that it would simply prolong the Second World War.
