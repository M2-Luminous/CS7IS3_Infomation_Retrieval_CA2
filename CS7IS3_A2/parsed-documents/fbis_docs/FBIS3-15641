[Oliynyk] The life there, of course, is more interesting than in Volyn. Perhaps it is much harder, but therefore more interesting. The power of action equals the power of counteraction. We must stay in good shape all the time, as sportsmen say. We have united democratic national forces in the Democratic Donetsk [Demokratychna Donechchyna] bloc, which includes 15 organizations such as the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, the Union of Ukrainian Youth, the Plast [scouting organization], and the Prosvita [cultural society]. On the other hand, procommunist forces are still very active there, as they were before. Following the events that took place in Moscow last October, however, it became obvious that they were defeated. Pro-Yeltsin forces have recently come into prominence. [Verbych] As a matter of fact, these forces are also pro-imperial, but perhaps with more a considerable dose of demagogy. [Oliynyk] Exactly. They say that they support a market economy and privatization, however, only in Russia -- claiming that without it, we will not survive. Everything is oriented toward Russia, even our time zone is the same as Moscow's, according to a resolution of the Oblast Council. [Verbych] Certain steps have been therefore taken toward autonomy, and eventually toward seceding from the Ukrainian state. [Oliynyk] Do not forget about the so-called experiment: Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, Luhansk, and Dnipropetrovsk Oblasts form a special economic zone. Moreover, the authors of the experiment will not submit appropriate documents to the Supreme Council for adoption, since they have already received support from certain presidential circles. Everything will be resolved by a presidential decree. Actually, one of the Crimean options is being worked out in our oblast. A peculiar supreme council of the four oblasts is to be established soon. The only thing that distinguishes us from the Crimea is the fact that 51 percent of our population is Ukrainian (according to the 1989 census, during which many Ukrainians were registered as Russians). Even those Russians who have been living in Donbas for a long time, however, are not like those who bask in the Crimean sun. The majority of people in Donetsk Oblast understand who really wants what, and what have been, and will be, the consequences of a pro-Moscow policy. [Verbych] The authors of the experiment, however, hide themselves under the slogan "in the name of the people," as the Bolsheviks used to do. I would like to hear your opinion about the Liberal Party headed by Markulov, who was recently an adviser to Kravchuk. To what extent does this party advocate the interests of the new pro-Moscow forces? [Oliynyk] The Liberal Party does not register its members. There have been statements claiming that the party has 6,000 members in the Donetsk region alone. However, how could this number be substantiated if the party does not register its members? This is nonsense. There were 200 people at the party's electoral conference held on 6 November. I believe that this is all the party's membership. The party is very different in various regions. Whereas Kyselyova, vice president of the Liberal Party's branch in Lvov, speaks Ukrainian, the party's Donetsk branch is no different than communist forces. Our liberals openly state: "Only together with Russia." On 3 June, they, however, removed from their statute a resolution on federalization and bilingualism. They could achieve success only due to the fact that they have significant funds. [Verbych] Mrs. Mariya, there are, of course, certain achievements that testify to the fact that the Donetsk region is an integral part of Ukraine. [Oliynyk] It cannot be said that there are not, but there are only a few such achievements. For example, we opened the first Ukrainian school in 1990 with the help of the United Nations. In 1993, it was much easier to open the 12th high school in Donetsk and the first Ukrainian gymnasium in Kramatorsk, which 450 children now attend. On 1 December 1993, we managed to open the first Ukrainian kindergarten in Donetsk.... You should know that the fact that our Ukrainian people speak Russian does not mean that they are against Ukrainian. The Ukrainian language is taught at the Ukrainian high school, there are 11 Ukrainian groups at the university, and one group at the medical institute. Whereas we had 23 Ukrainian classes in Donetsk last year, there are now 60 such classes. [Verbych] As the first and last president of the former USSR used to say, the process has started. [Oliynyk] Nobody is able to halt this. However, there still are scouting camps, at which children wear red bandannas and attend solemn meetings on 7 November [anniversary of the October revolution]. Nevertheless, the stronghold of the empire is receding into the past with every day and every hour. The process continues! Without useless pathos, through our everyday hard work, we endeavor to prevent a wedge from being driven between Ukrainian territories, dividing them between East and West.
