This document, in his opinion, has not resolved the border problems that exist between our giant countries. At a news conference Ishayev referred to "submerged reefs" that could create new problems in Russo-Chinese relations. For instance, Article 5 of the agreement claims that the border between China and Russia in navigable rivers runs down the center of the main channel, while in nonnavigable rivers it runs down the center of the river or the center of its main branch. And Article 4 prescribes that a joint demarcation commission should "determine in line with Article 5 of this agreement the ownership of islands...." Russia could lose many valuable lands, Viktor Ishayev claims. In Maritime Kray alone China could gain around 1,000 hectares of fertile pastureland. The people of Khabarovsk are also put out, for instance, by this entry in Article 8 of the agreement: "The contracting parties agree that ships of various kinds, including warships, can sail from the Ussuri River into the Amur River past Khabarovsk and back again without let or hindrance...." Who would like foreign ships -- much less, warships -- to be sailing virtually in the city center?... The people of the Far East again find it impossible to come to terms with their Chinese neighbors' claims to the age-old Russian Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy and Tarabarov Islands. The governor cited numerous examples of Chinese ships navigating our internal waters past Khabarovsk without let or hindrance. They often deviate from the main channel, enter other channels, take depth measurements, and photograph the area and installations. IZVESTIYA PRESS SERVICE report: "Russian Foreign Ministry Disagrees" "Press reports of statements from the head of the Khabarovsk Kray Administration denouncing the agreement on the eastern stretch of the border between Russia and China are of concern to us," IZVESTIYA has been told by a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official. He refrained from making a definitive assessment, citing the fact that his department does not have any accurate information on these statements by the administration head. "We are trying to corroborate the accuracy of these reports," the diplomat said. The Foreign Ministry proceeds on the basis that the 1991 agreement is a fair agreement based on generally accepted norms of international law -- specifically, on drawing the border in navigable rivers down the middle of the main channel, and in nonnavigable rivers down the middle of the river or its main branch. The senior Foreign Ministry official asked for it to be clearly stressed that never before in history had the islands in the Amur and Ussuri Rivers been divided up between Russia and China by treaty. The specific ownership of the islands -- which is, indeed the reason why feelings are running high -- will be determined in the course of the border demarcation currently being carried out. The Foreign Ministry can in no way share the administration head's indignation about the passage of Chinese ships in the Khabarovsk area. This is normal practice, the diplomat said, when foreign vessels enter our ports or internal waters. The diplomat admitted, however, that regulations governing navigation have not yet been elaborated in line with the bilateral agreement. A Russian delegation comprising experts from different departments -- including the Amur River Shipping Company -- is currently holding talks with the Chinese on drawing up such regulations. Conclusion of this work will make it possible to avoid any complications or misunderstandings in the future, the diplomat said.
