He specially delivered a cautious and well-considered report to Federation Council senators on the government's measures to combat this scourge. But the government has no intention of reverting to the purely administrative measures that we all still remember in terms of mass monetary "amnesties." On the contrary, Chernomyrdin promised to begin the procedure of enterprise bankruptcies by introducing property liability for nonpayments. The means of formalizing nonpayments has finally been announced, namely the introduction of bills of exchange. The Tveruniversalbank has already advertised its system for the introduction of bills of exchange and won the premier's good opinion for its initiative. The Tveruniversalbank intends to solve the crisis of nonpayments by issuing its own bills of exchange. The stock market will then be filled with new securities -- "outstanding" bills of exchange issued by various banks. In that case, a process of secondary privatization will probably take place. In the summer privatization enters the stage of finding the "real owner." After buying up outstanding bills of exchange in the floated enterprises the new owners will seek out investors. Provided that everything goes according to the premier's plan, we will enter a new stage of upheaval and discovery. Commercial banks are to play a major role here. The premier said that he does not believe the state to be bankrupt and substantiated certain top-priority steps to strengthen the revenue side of the budget. First, the state monopoly on the production and sale of vodka will be revived in the near future. Apparently despite his commitment to market means of overcoming the crisis, the premier heeded the calls from the recent conference of vodka manufacturers. They were vociferous in their amazement that the state has opened the doors to illegal imports of narcotics and forgotten that vodka has always served true state values. As for tough state measures, Chernomyrdin promised to investigate the practice whereby enterprises and organizations open about a dozen accounts and sit on budget money. One enterprise should have one account, the premier said menacingly. The government will settle its debts, he said. By the end of March 4.6 trillion rubles [R] of the total arrears of R7.5 trillion will have been paid. The state will pay some of its debts by exempting various enterprises and sectors from tax. Interestingly, the premier's audience was not unanimous this time either. Senators with strong ties to manufacturers in their territories proposed alternative means of solving the crisis. Tsvetkov, leader of the Association of Manufacturers, criticized the premier's promise to tighten up tax policy. "You say that you are going to tighten it up, but whom are you going to tax when enterprises are standing idle?" Interdepartmental offsetting of state enterprise debts was then proposed. Incidentally, some economic experts think that is what will ultimately happen. Nikolay Gonchar said that the country obviously does not have enough of a free money supply. Japan and the United States have far more money than Russia. He disagreed with the premier's idea that the state is not bankrupt, unlike enterprises whose output no one wants. "A state is not bankrupt when it can pay its debts. Money should not be spent on wages. But used to solve the crisis of nonpayment. What is needed is tight control over where the money is going. But first there must be money."
