The summit, probably scheduled for June between South Korean President Kim Yong-sam and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, is expected to focus on bilateral relations and the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Han is currently visiting the United States and plans to fly to Moscow around April 10. Although the announcement of Han's Moscow trip was announced suddenly by the South Korean president, Seoul says it is not connected in any way with the results of the Chinese-South Korean talks which ended Wednesday [30 March]. The ITAR-TASS quoted Kim Yong-sam's associates as saying that Russia, the United States, Japan, China, are the four countries which Seoul considers important in the settlement of the nuclear problem. Russia and South Korea have held numerous consultations at different diplomatic levels about the security problem on the Korean peninsula, but now it is time for their heads of state to discuss the problem, the ITAR-TASS said. South Korea has refrained from supporting Moscow's idea of holding an international conference on the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula with the participation of all the countries concerned, the news agency said.
