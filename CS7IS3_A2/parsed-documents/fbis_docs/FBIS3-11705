Economic efficiency was recognized as the essential road to Cuba's recovery. Furthermore, the importance of solving the problems through common effort and intelligence and through honoring the principles of the revolution, was stressed. Several presentations were made during the meeting on what has been accomplished through the implementation of ideas brought forth by workers. These demonstrate the point that we must begin by becoming efficient in our own lives. [passage omitted] Pedro Ross, secretary general of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC], recognized that Cienfuegos has been very responsive to the ideas presented in the parliaments and stated that we do not have to freeze those ideas since new ideas could arise which could be more fitting to our actual situation. Ross went on to say that all possibilities have not been considered. He congratulated Cienfuegos for its dynamism in responding to the workers. In his remarks at the plenum summarizing the workers parliaments in Cienfuegos, Ross said that all the officials that attended the parliaments should keep in touch and follow up on those collectives, since we are just beginning the phase of shaping those ideas presented. Pedro Ross stated that all problems cannot be solved overnight, but that we must be active and bold, as is the case in Cienfuegos, through the implementation of ideas presented at the different workers parliaments throughout the province.
