Good evening. [Pernod] Good evening. [Masure] Correspondent Francois Cornet repeated a moment ago that there are 336 UN soldiers belonging to the intervention force who are now ready to go to Gorazde. Why are they not going there? [Pernod] Actually, I believe that things are quite simple. We do have a detachment from the Sarajevo sector which is to go to Gorazde. We are awaiting the order for their departure. This order will come only when the negotiations under way are over, and I believe that, for the moment, we are ready and waiting. Negotiations are under way and I believe that it will add to the confusion if I gave information that may not be accurate. [Masure] Are 336 men sufficient when we know how strong the forces in Gorazde are? There is talk of 7,000 Serb fighters. [Pernod] Listen, anyway, this detachment has been put together. We decided that it was amply sufficient to carry out the mission that was set at the beginning. It was created to carry out a mission of intervention and, for the time being, the command has decided that it was enough, given the elements we have. [Masure] You are in Sarajevo yourself. UN soldiers have been the victims of a whole series of provocations on the part of the Serbs recently. Several dozen of them were held, if I may put it this way. Is there any sign of detente this evening in your difficult relations with the Bosnian Serbs? [Pernod] If you like, tension has indeed stepped up dramatically since the air strikes last Sunday and Monday. As you know -- and it has been said -- some places where weapons are being kept were closed. Our traffic was subjected to major hindrances. I can tell you, for example, that this tension has decreased dramatically today. For instance, the various points for the collection of weapons were resupplied with vehicles by road today. As you can see, things are much less tense. I think that the situation is less tense because, on the one hand, we did not respond to the provocations made on the Serb side, and this is mainly thanks to the professional approach and the sang-froid of the people on the ground who are behaving in an exemplary manner. [Masure] Thank you very much, Lieutenant Colonel Pernod, speaking live to us from Sarajevo.
