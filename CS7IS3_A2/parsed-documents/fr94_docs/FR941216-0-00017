FR941216-0-00017 FR941216-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Minerals Management Service 30 CFR Part 250 RIN 1010&hyph;AB21 Oil and Gas and Sulphur Operations in the Outer Continental Shelf; Training AGENCY: Minerals Management Service, Interior. ACTION: Technical amendments. SUMMARY: The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is transferring its management of the day-to-day operations of the lessee training program (LTP) from MMS Headquarters to its regional offices. Therefore, MMS is amending its regulations on oil and gas and sulphur operations in the Outer Continental Shelf to reflect that change. Management of the LTP in the regional offices will improve customer service by placing MMS employees involved with approving the schools' and organizations' training programs and implementation plans and conducting onsite evaluations and audits in close proximity to the schools. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 17, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joe Levine, Chief, Information and Training Branch; Mineral Management Service; Mail Stop 4800; 381 Elden Street; Herndon, Virginia 22070&hyph;4817, telephone (703) 787&hyph;1033/Fax (703) 787&hyph;1575. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The MMS is responsible for operations in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). An important factor in ensuring that OCS oil and gas operations are carried out in a manner which emphasizes the safety of operations and minimizes the risk of environmental damage is the lessees' employment of highly qualified and trained personnel to perform such operations. To ensure that key operating personnel of lessees and contractors are properly trained in well-control and production safety systems, MMS has developed and implemented training regulations since the late 1970's. Initially, training was required for key personnel in drilling well-control and production safety devices. In the late 1980's, MMS proposed new training for well-completion, well-workover, and well-servicing operations and revised regulations for drilling and production safety systems. These training regulations_30 CFR 250.210, 30 CFR 250.211, 30 CFR 250.212, 30 CFR 250.213, 30 CFR 250.214, and 30 CFR 250.215_Subpart O_Training, became fully effective on February 25, 1993. Since the late seventies, MMS Headquarters personnel have been responsible for the day-to-day operation of the training program, including the review of training programs and implementation plans, and conducting of onsite evaluations and audits. Beginning with the effective date of these technical amendments, MMS regional offices will manage these day-to-day operations of the LTP. Headquarters will remain responsible for program oversight and coordination. Decentralization of the LTP to the regional offices is being performed to decrease the project management costs associated with implementing this program and to provide MMS's customers with more timely service. Dated: November 16, 1994. Nancy K. Hayes, Acting Assistant Secretary, Land and Minerals Management.
