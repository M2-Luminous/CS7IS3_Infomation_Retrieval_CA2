He said: "We do not consider this subject a rift. There is understanding within the GCC and the GCC members are the closest of people to each other." On a question related to the religious phenomenon in Kuwait, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said that it was an internal Kuwaiti phenomenon unconnected with the phenomenon of international religious terrorism or any external body. He said: "We accept this phenomenon since we consider it to be an internal Kuwaiti phenomenon which does not believe in what others do." On a question related to the State of Kuwait's stance on the Palestinian cause, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said that a differentiation must be made between the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian leadership, which has wronged Kuwait. He said that throughout its history the State of Kuwait has been one of the most supportive of the Palestinian cause and will continue to support the Palestinian people, but not through the current leadership. He recalled that the State of Kuwait has granted $25 million through international bodies to set up schools and hospitals in Gaza and Jericho. He explained that only small groups of Palestinians have been deported from Kuwait, and that those who left Kuwait have done so at their own will. In answer to a question related to Kuwait's stance on the Arab boycott of Israel, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad stressed that Kuwait abides by the Arab League resolutions related to the first degree boycott of Israel. He said that after its liberation from Iraq, Kuwait had been obliged to lift the second and third degree boycott because of its pressing need for companies which possess technology and expertise in those areas destroyed by the Iraqi forces during their occupation of Kuwait.
