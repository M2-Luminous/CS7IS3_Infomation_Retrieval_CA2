Kakizawa will visit Seoul on Saturday to hold talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and meet South Korean President Kim Yong-sam. On Sunday, he will leave Seoul for Beijing for talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. Talks with the South Korean and Chinese foreign ministers are likely to focus on the situation concerning Pyongyang's suspected nuclear development, ministry officials said. In Seoul, Kakizawa and Han are expected to discuss how to deal with the situation based on the consultations last weekend among Japan, South Korea and the United States, they said. South Korea may brief Kakizawa on Kim's visit to Russia and Uzbekistan and Han's visit to New York and Beijing, they said. But Kakizawa and Han will not be discussing the specifics of possible sanctions against Pyongyang, they said. The foreign ministers will also discuss other international and bilateral affairs. They will also discuss the summit meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers in July in Naples, Italy. In Beijing, Kakizawa hopes to reach a common acknowledgment with China that the current situation regarding North Korea is very critical. Japan is likely to voice its expectations of China's persuading Pyongyang to change its position. China has repeatedly said it wants to solve the problem through dialogue by taking more time and is against imposing sanctions.
