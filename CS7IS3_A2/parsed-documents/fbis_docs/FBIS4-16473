Through It, the Duma Can Contest the President's Exclusive Powers To Pursue Domestic and Foreign Policy"] [Text] Yesterday the State Duma Council received two draft laws initiated by the Agrarian Party faction, namely by the Duma's Legislation Committee Chairman Vladimir Isakov. The laws have long titles: The former, On Suspending Participation by the Russian Federation in Enforcing International Sanctions Imposed Against the Union Republic of Yugoslavia; and the second, On Compulsory Ratification of the Act of Accession to the Partnership for Peace Program. Mr. Isakov first announced the existence of these documents at the Duma's 13 April session, which discussed the chamber's statement on the bombing of Bosnia. Vladimir Isakov told the deputies at the time that their motives for issuing statements only because the Constitution refers the definition of the main aspects of foreign policy exclusively to the president's jurisdiction are erroneous because Article 3 of the Constitution says this is done in accordance with federal laws. Isakov called on his colleagues to adopt such laws. The first draft law provides for Russia's suspending its participation in sanctions against the Union Republic of Yugoslavia in view of their one-sided application, recommending to the government to restore all relations with Serbia and Montenegro. The title of the second bill speaks for itself and furthermore establishes that prior to ratification of Russia's accession to Partnership for Peace it does not impose any obligations on Russia. Therefore Vladimir Isakov, who reads the constitution carefully, unlike those who drafted it in their time, has scored a first success by finding a loophole which, if need be, can be enlarged. He does not, however, regard the corresponding article in the Constitution as a hole because, according to him, "it is big enough for even a truck to pass through." The fact is that the main domestic policy lines formulated by the president are also pursued in accordance with federal laws. To be sure, laws adopted by the Duma may be vetoed by both the Federation Council and the president but if there is really a strong desire, two-thirds of the votes can always be secured to override this veto. To a very large extent this applies to the Partnership for Peace ratification bill: An overwhelming majority of the Duma factions are demanding that an act on accession to this program be submitted for approval.
