Thirteen of Japan's biggest companies -- Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Nichimen, Itohchu corporation, and others -- have joined it. The committee is headed by the Turkmen Vice Prime Minister Rejep Saparov, and president of Itohchu Corporation, Minoru Murofushi. Representatives of this firm who are attending the meeting expressed their wish to become members of an international consortium building a gas pipeline across Iran to Turkey, and to take part in the modernization of a number of petro-chemical plants. The efforts of the joint committee have already resulted in agreement on the construction of a polyethylene plant in the town of Seydi, which will be built by Mitsubishi Corporation. The Export-Import Bank of Japan is extending credit of $320 million for this project. The next session of the Japanese-Turkmen economic committee is scheduled for next fall in Tokyo.
