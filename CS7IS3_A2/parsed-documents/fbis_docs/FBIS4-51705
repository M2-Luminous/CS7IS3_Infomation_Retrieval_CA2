Aguinaldo] [Text] Armed Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile yesterday declared government's counterinsurgency campaign a success based on recorded accomplishments in the first four months of 1994. At the same time, Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Vice Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Alfredo Filler said all existing rebel groups in the country are not capable of causing instability. Mr. Enrile said the total number of armed regulars of all threat groups dropped 30 percent last year through the military's counterinsurgency campaign plan "Lambat Bitag [Dragnet Snare]." The AFP also recorded a 13 percent decline in the total number of high-powered firearms in the hands of rebels and a 52 percent slide in the total number of insurgency-affected barangays [villages]. Recently, National Police Commission Chairman Rafael Alunan declared strategic victory over Muslim guerrillas, communist rebels, and other breakaway groups, saying their strengths have been reduced considerably through the combined efforts of the military and police. Likewise, Gen. Enrile said armed groups such as the New People's Army, Abu Sayyaf, Moro Islamic Liberation Front, and Alex Boncayao Brigade have been crippled by counterinsurgency efforts. However, the recently installed armed forces chief warned against "prematurely sweeping the insurgency threat under the rug" because "political consolidations are still going on." Even as the first quarter of this year has shown considerable rewards for government, Mr. Enrile said, "The decline in the number of major engagements only means that they have shifted into small unit operations. But they are still there." Mr. Filler also said threats from both the leftist and rightist groups have been marginalized. He stressed that unlike before, rightist groups like the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Revolutionary Nationalist Alliance]-Soldiers of the Filipino People-Young Officers Union (RAM-SFP-YOU) are no longer considered threats to national security. He belittled the capability of the said groups, saying they are not capable of grabbing power from the present administration based on the reported decrease in their manpower and assets. As communist factions are busy consolidating forces, Mr. Enrile said, the country's armed forces will concentrate on national economic development as well as the protection and conservation of the environment and the remaining natural resources. He also revealed plans to engage in massive cooperative projects nationwide. According to Army Chief Maj. Gen Romulo Yap, government is a month ahead of its counterinsurgency campaign scheduled before the year. [sentence as published]
