The package totals Australian $6 million and will go toward refugee and relief activities to help rebuilding the country after three decades of civil war and drought. Announcing the package in Australia, development assistance minister, Gordon Bilney, described Ethiopia as one of the world's poorest countries. In a statement, Mr. Bilney said that while the Ethiopian Government had set medium-term goals of rehabilitation and development, there were immediate needs for food and health and farm assistance. Australia's overseas aid agency, AIDAB [Australian International Development Assistance Bureau] will spend most of the new aid on buying and distributing Australian wheat through the world food program. The remainder of the money will be spent on an immunization program and construction of sustainable rural water supply systems in the Tigre region to help prevent health problems associated with poor water supplies. Foreign Minister Evans is set to hold talks in Ethiopia with goverment ministers and senior officials.
