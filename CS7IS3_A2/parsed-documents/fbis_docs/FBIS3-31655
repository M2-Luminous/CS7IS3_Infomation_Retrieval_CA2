After a working luncheon with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Klaus told journalists that as a pragmatist who does not build castles in the air, he believed that it was in the interest of the Czech Republic to join the Partnership project of European security. He said he hoped he would sign a document on participation in the project in Brussels on March 10. "We will gradually seek ways how to implement it," Klaus said. He went on to say that the idea to organise any bilateral Czech- Russian military contacts did not presently occur to him. "However, this should not be taken as a statement of fundamental position," he added. Kozyrev said Russia was developing military cooperation with some NATO countries, namely bilateral arms supplies, conducting joint excercises and resolving problems concerning conversion of arms factories into peace production. "Czech leaders often emphasise that the Czech Republic is a small country. I do not want to polemise with them -- maybe it is small from a geographical point of view, but with regard to its political importance it is much bigger," Kozyrev said, adding that Russia is interested in a continued extension of cultural, spiritual, political and economic contacts with the Czech Republic. "I fully agree," Klaus said. The Czech Republic, he said, strives to become a standard European country with all that involves, including membership of standard European organisations, namely the European Union and NATO. "In this context, for me, the Czech Republic's effort to join NATO is not primarily measured by our intention to defend ourselves against a sort of imaginatory Russian threat," Klaus said. Being a small country in the heart of Europe and a subject to pressure by its neighbours, the "entry into institutions like NATO is always a positive step for us. But I would not twist the meaning one or the other side," Klaus added.
