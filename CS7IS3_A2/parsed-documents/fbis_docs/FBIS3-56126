Organizers of the news conference stressed that, with regard to the increased tendency to bring a categorical tone to international dialogue, participants in the Kiev meeting -- representatives of patriotic organizations from Ukraine, the Russian Federation, Belarus, and Poland -- protested against the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine and Belarus. To resist the establishment of a "new world order," the Slavic Union intends to convene the World Slavic Congress in summer 1994. For this purpose, the Union Belaya Rus has already established a Belarusian committee to make preparations for the Congress. Union representatives also stated that the current Supreme Soviet is incapable of resolving any important issues, and therefore it should adopt a new electoral law and a resolution to hold early elections in the fall of 1994.
