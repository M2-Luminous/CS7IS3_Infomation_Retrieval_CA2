The basic industry sector includes eight [number as heard] branches: the production of oil, nickel, glass, paper and paste, as well as chemistry and mining geology, which have been offered to potential investors over the past few years for exploitation. As a result of these negotiations, thus far, Cuba has signed 26 contracts for mineral exploration and exploitation, two for administrative functions, one for the exploitation of copper in Pinar del Rio Province, and two partnerships have been established to conduct feasibility studies of gold, lead, and zinc deposits. These agreements, which cover 50 percent of the area up for bid, include work over an area of approximately 40,000 square km of national territory; they do not include agreements for the exploration and extraction of oil. This is another branch of the basic industry that has made serious progress in the field of partnerships between the state-owned Cuba Petroleum and foreign firms. Regarding oil exploration, 16 of the 33 high expectation blocks into which the country has been divided, have already been contracted to French, Canadian, British, and Swedish firms and, according to Basic Industries Minister Marco Portals, all of the blocks will have been contracted out by the end of the year. The nickel industry, meanwhile, is in the process of increasing its production after a strong decline that began following the severing of ties with Eastern Europe, which was its primary buyer. Cuba diversified its nickel markets and today exports the mineral to 26 countries. Thanks to economic partnerships with Canada, The Netherlands, Great Britain, and Italy, and the efficiency of Cuban specialists and technicians, production will increase this year. Thus, the growth of vital branches such as oil, nickel, and cobalt production is guaranteed by economic partnerships with foreign firms, none of which, in fact, are from the United States. Therefore, the economic blockade it decreed against Cuba has backfired on the United States, which is now deprived of participation in attractive business opportunities.
