According to Abkhazian sources, the airborne troops come from the Leningrad and Volga Military Districts. If they take up positions along the Inguri River and in the Kodor Gorge, the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict will shift to the stage of purely political confrontation. Needless to say, the peacemakers will not resolve the problems that caused the war, but they will be able to prevent armed clashes from flaring up again. [passage omitted] Representatives of the Georgian and Abkhazian military departments spent all last week at work in Moscow. With the mediation and participation of Russian Defense Ministry officers they drafted a schedule and plan for disengagement and for the introduction of peacemaking forces. Official Tbilisi was acquainted with the plan at the weekend. Russian Defense Ministry experts confirmed the previous dates for the introduction of the peacemakers -- 10 through 15 June. At the moment the following can be said about the impending disengagement of the adversaries: They will pull back 12 km into their territory from the contact line along the Inguri River. "Blue helmets" will take up positions in the resulting corridor. Something similar will also happen on the second Abkhazian front -- in the Kodor Gorge, where serious fighting started this spring. According to experts, once the peacemaking forces have been deployed the conflicting parties will no longer be able to launch full-scale combat operations. Regrettably, I cannot avoid using the word "if" in this commentary because today there is still no 100-percent confidence that the peacemakers really will be brought into Abkhazia. Events show that the good intentions could be frustrated. [passage omitted] Who stands to gain from provocations on the eve of the peacemaking forces' introduction? Presumably not the Abkhazians. The accords that have been secured satisfy the Sukhumi leadership on the whole. The peacemakers will, after all, be introduced in the way the Abkhazians planned -- between the enemies' troops, and not throughout the republic's territory as the Georgians demanded. The peacemaking forces' presence will put the conflict on ice indefinitely and, as I have already pointed out, will rule out the possibility of the problem of Abkhazian separatism being resolved by military means. It is also important for the Abkhazians that it is Russian airborne troops being brought into the republic, rather than the international forces for which Eduard Shevardnadze unsuccessfully appealed for so long. On the whole people in Abkhazia note some warming on Russia's part: The Russian Government has allocated 2 billion rubles in aid, the republic has been admitted as an associate member to the Association for Socioeconomic Cooperation Between the Republics, Krays, and Oblasts of the Russian Federation's North Caucasus Region, and members of the association have asked the Russian Government to lift economic sanctions. However, there are forces in Georgia that categorically oppose the proposed scenario for settling the conflict. I am talking about the Union for the Liberation of Abkhazia led by Boris Kakubava, a member of the Georgian parliament. The Union comprises Georgian refugees from Abkhazia, mainly active participants in the combat operations on the republic's territory. They sharply criticize Eduard Shevardnadze's policy, saying that he is mainly to blame for the lost battles and calling for the war to be prosecuted to a victorious conclusion. By all accounts, Kakubava also has supporters in the Georgian Army units opposing the Abkhazian Armed Forces. It is quite possible that they will take some action to wreck the disengagement plan in the time remaining until the peacemaking forces are introduced.
