FR940317-1-00115 FR940317-1-00013 (f) Is a bastardy claim. (g) Arises from the operations of a nonappropriated fund activity, unless generated by military personnel performing assigned duties (subpart L). (h) Is for the personal injury or death of a member of the armed forces of the United States incurred incident to service. (See ยง536.25.) (i) Is for the personal injury or death of a Government employee for whom benefits are provided by the FECA (5 U.S.C. 8101&hyph;8150). (j) Is for the personal injury or death of an employee, including nonappropriated fund employees, for whom benefits are provided by the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 901 et. seq.). (k) Is for the personal injury or death of any employee for whom benefits are provided under workmen's compensation type laws or regulations, including local law or custom, in cases where contribution is made or insurance premiums paid directly or indirectly by the United States on behalf of the injured employee. If, in the opinion of a foreign claims commission the claim should be considered payable; (e.g. injuries did not result from the normal risk of employment or adequate compensation is not payable under workmen's compensation laws,) the file will be forwarded with recommendations through claims channels to the Commander, USARCS, who may authorize payment of an appropriate award. The Commander, USARCS, also may specify that all or any part of any compensation received by the claimant from workmen's compensation sources, as above, will be deducted from the award to claimant. The claim of an insurance carrier subrogee who has received premiums paid directly or indirectly by the United States on behalf of the injured employee, however, is not payable. (l) Is for taking of property by technical trespass, such as the overflight of aircraft or a taking contemplated by the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as distinguished from common law trespass. (See AR 405&hyph;15, para 2c, and DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraphs 8&hyph;46 and 8&hyph;75). (m) Is for reimbursement for medical, hospital, or burial expenses furnished at the expense of the United States. (n) Is for patent or copyright infringement. (See AR 27&hyph;60.) (o) Is for war trophies, or articles intended directly or indirectly for persons other than the claimant or members of his or her immediate family such as articles acquired to be disposed of as gifts or for sale to another, voluntarily bailed to the Army, or for precious jewels and other articles of extraordinary value voluntarily bailed to the DA. The preceding sentence is not applicable to claims involving registered or insured mail. No allowance will be made for any item when the evidence indicates that the acquisition, possession, or transportation thereof was in violation of DA directives. (p) Is for rent, damage, or other payments involving the acquisition, use, possession, or disposition of real property or interests therein by and for the DA, except as authorized by section 536.152(c)(1). Real estate claims founded upon contract are generally processed under AR 405&hyph;15. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;46.) (q) Is not in the best interests of the United States or is contrary to public policy, general principles of equity, or the basic intent of the FCA. Examples are claims by inhabitants of unfriendly countries, claims by or based on injury or death of individuals considered to be unfriendly to the United States, or claims for property losses resulting directly or indirectly from illegal activities of the claimant, such as drug dealing, black marketing, or illegal loan sharking. When a claim is considered to be not payable for the reasons stated in this paragraph, the issue will be presented to the Commander, USARCS for determination of the applicability of this exclusion. (r) Arises from the activities of the Panama Canal Commission. (s) Is based upon an act or omission of a member or employee of the Army, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation is valid. However, this exception should not be used without prior approval of the Commander, USARCS. (t) Is based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a Federal agency, or a member or employee of the Army, whether or not the discretion involved is abused. However, this exception should not be used without prior approval of the Commander, USARCS.
