In statements he made on national radio and television, and which reached the shaykh, Peres promised that Israel would be willing to free Yasin if he issues a call to stop terrorism. At the same time, Peres summoned Knesset Member Talib al-Sani' of the Democratic List for Peace and Equality and asked him to contact Yasin. The meeting between the two is expected to take place on 8 May, but Yasin's attorney, 'Abd-al-Malik Dahamshah, smiles: "He does not have a chance. No person in the world could talk the shaykh into accepting a conditional release." After five years in prison, the paralyzed and sick shaykh is himself a ticking time bomb. Israel would love to rid itself of this bomb -- but honorably and for the right price. Peres shares the fear of many in the defense establishment that if Yasin dies in prison, it might reignite the territories. Yasin's continued imprisonment is a problem for PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat as well. 'Arafat seeks a quiet era to bolster his control over Gaza and Jericho. By freeing Yasin, 'Arafat will attain two goals: softening the Hamas opposition and proving to his people that he is the leader of all Palestinians, including his sworn rivals. Yasin, however, despite being paralyzed in the arms and legs and suffering from an acute lung disease, continues to thwart the plans of his domestic and external enemies. The signing of the agreement last week was no holiday for him. He will not play into their hands, not even for his freedom. From behind the walls, he rejects any offer of a "conditional release:" "I will sit in jail until the end of my days. I will neither surrender to dictates nor be released under constraints," he stated again last week. The Shaykh Yasin problem is a constant headache for the two partners to the Cairo agreement. Some time ago, he rejected another Peres condition for his release: to meet with 'Arafat and mend their relations. Yasin said: "Obviously, I will meet with 'Arafat. I do not need mediators for this. But I cannot accept such a meeting as a condition!" Shaykh Yasin is incarcerated in the Ashmoret prison in a room specially planned and built to accommodate his unique situation. Because of his physical handicap, two prisoners have been assigned to attend to all his needs around the clock ever since his detention in May 1989. Up to several months ago, Hamas prisoners were those who performed this task with great dedication, stemming from their respect for their leader. According to Yasin's lawyer, Dahamshah, the makeup of the prison's inmates has recently changed, which is also reflected in the treatment accorded to Yasin: "Now he is being attended by members of the Popular Front, Fatah, and various other organizations, who are unwilling to serve him. They are sick and tired. After all, the man is completely paralyzed. He must be lifted, undressed, washed, and accompanied to the toilet." Yasin's incarceration is not contributing toward moderating Hamas' attitude toward the autonomy. Yasin's remarks indicate that his opinion of Palestinian self-rule differs from that of many of his followers. According to Yasin, there is no problem in Hamas' participating in the autonomy institutions, including the Palestinian advisory council. He is unwilling, however, to participate in its formation and consolidation: "I am not part of this; I am part of the Palestinian people. The PLO is responsible for this process. I do not consider this a proper process leading to peace and tranquillity in our region." Will Hamas people use firearms against their Fatah brethren? Shaykh Yasin unequivocally states that this will not happen. Islam absolutely forbids such a thing. Attorney Dahamshah: "The shaykh never supported such behavior, did not accept it, and was unwilling to follow such a path. He maintains that all problems can be solved through peaceful negotiations." Dahamshah adds: "I am familiar with his position regarding terrorism. The shaykh never urged his followers to murder Jewish civilians -- neither before his incarceration nor afterward. You should ask yourself: Why have the Muslim organizations acted against soldiers and not civilians? This behavior is religiously motivated, and the shaykh has influence in this respect. Therefore, it makes no sense to demand that Yasin call on his supporters to cease their acts of terrorism, seeing that he never called for the murder of people just because they are Jews!" The recent closure has not made things easier on the shaykh. Gaza residents are not allowed to leave the Strip or to visit their imprisoned relatives. Since only those over the age of 60 are allowed to leave the Strip, only the shaykh's elder brother can visit him. The prison authorities award Yasin very special treatment. During early April, for example, after he returned his breakfast and announced that he was launching a hunger strike to protest the fact that a chair and table were removed from his room, all the furniture was immediately returned. What interest, if any, does Israel have in Yasin's continued incarceration? This question was recently raised in the Ministerial Committee on Security Affairs. In addition to punishing a leader responsible for serious terror attacks, there is also the consideration of keeping some bargaining chips in a period of negotiations and in the framework of pressuring Hamas to stop terrorism. Shaykh Yasin's associates claim that it is illogical to keep him in jail under the pretext that he is responsible for murderous attacks: "Terrorism increased only after the shaykh was jailed. As long as he pulled the strings from the outside, Hamas did not resort to the use of firearms. They settled for political protest, disturbances, and strikes." What about the murder of soldiers Avi Sasportas and Ilan Sa'adon? Shaykh Yasin continues to claim that the murderers were members of the al-Majd and al-Mujahidun organizations rather than Hamas. According to Yasin, this is a historical mistake. He says that even the charge sheet filed against him states that he became aware of the murders only after the event, "and even the Shin Bet knows I had nothing to do with it." What the shaykh "forgets" to mention, however, is the fact that he was the man who established these two secret organizations, which were the precursors of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the Hamas military arm. In his reply to the accusations included in the charge sheet, Yasin claimed he accepts the principle of peace: "I feel religiously obligated to make peace between my people and other peoples, because this is God's command." He said that in both nations, there are many who refuse to accept this peace. At the same time, he emphasizes that he is willing to accept a "peaceful solution" which safeguards the legitimate rights of his people. In statements meant for outside ears, Yasin is willing to say that "the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people" are negotiable: "If you do not want a Muslim state which will safeguard everybody's rights (according to Muslim concepts), then okay, we will not have such a state. Let us therefore establish a state according to the modern concept: a democratic state which will elect its institutions under conditions of equality and democracy." Today, Shaykh Yasin is considered to be Hamas' spiritual leader. In practice, he is more of a symbol than a leader who issues operational orders to his men in the field. The movement continues to pursue his ideological path. The Hamas leadership takes his opinion into consideration, but sometimes Hamas spokesmen correct his remarks and "explain" what he meant when he said this or that. Time has taken its course, and Hamas has a new leadership. Shaykh Yasin is far away and cut off from events. So far, Hamas people in Gaza are operating in the spirit of Yasin's approach. There is a rapprochement with Fatah, and there are some indications that Hamas is slowly being integrated into the autonomy institutions. At the same time, 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's murderers are still active. Gaza fugitives have already drifted to the West Bank. Senior security officials assess that Hamas terrorism will increase in those West Bank areas that will not be under 'Arafat's control. Attorney Dahamshah promises, of course, that Yasin's release and return home "will greatly contribute toward calming the situation and facilitate the positive process between the two nations."
