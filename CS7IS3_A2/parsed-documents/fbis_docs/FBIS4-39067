National law enforcement agencies heads, chairmen of oblasts and a range of city and rayon executive committees participated in this meeting. Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich, chairman of the Coordinating Council, said that combating crime is a key issue. This is a very important social issue, which in equal measure concerns both government and residents of the Republic. In the prime minister's opinion, in order to ensure personal freedom and self-confidence, not only new approaches by law enforcement agencies should be introduced but a range of everyday pressing problems of the citizenry should be resolved as well.
