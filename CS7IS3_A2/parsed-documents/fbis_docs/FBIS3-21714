Police officers found about four kg of cocaine camouflaged as the inner lining of a suitcase that was in her possession. According to the PF, the Bolivian woman had used a resin to glue the cocaine to the suitcase. She had arrived at Cumbica International Airport in Guarulhos (in Greater Sao Paulo) hours earlier on a flight from Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia. The suspect was about to board Varig Flight 766 for Zurich, Switzerland. Airport police suspected her because of the weight of the briefcase [as published] (about 8.5 kg) and because her passport showed that she had made another trip from Santa Cruz de la Sierra to Europe--the traditional drug trafficking route--within the previous 30 days. According to the PF, the case will have to be treated chemically to remove the cocaine paste. Editha was taken to a Federal Police cell on Piaui Street in Higienopolis (downtown Sao Paulo). She is being held without bail.
