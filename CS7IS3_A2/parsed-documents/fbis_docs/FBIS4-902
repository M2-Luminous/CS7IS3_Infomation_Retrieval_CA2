His move follows widespread allegations of corruption in land reforms meant to redress injustices of the colonial past by redistributing white-owned land to landless blacks. Entire farms had been leased to individual government ministers, senior civil servants, and top members of the military, instead of being used to resettle peasants. Mr. Mugabe told his ruling ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front] party newspaper, THE PEOPLE'S VOICE, that the land should not have been leased out in the first place because it had been acquired for the purpose of resettling peasant farmers. He said in future land should be leased after proper procedures had been followed, and the Land Acquisition Act would continue to be used for the resettlement of landless peasants.
