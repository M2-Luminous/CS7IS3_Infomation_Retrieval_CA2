If it were up to me, I would have Zhirinovskiy come to Italy, just like 'Arafat came when -- if I remember correctly -- he was a wanted man. Of course, I would not go to meet him, because in my opinion he is not a man of the right." In his study on the via della Scrofa, bursting with Italian flags like the office of a head of state, Italian Social Movement [MSI] Secretary Gianfranco Fini smiles, pleased. It is almost as if he wants to gauge the effect of his answer. He began with that and continued -- evoking the shadow of Russia's fascist leader, who has just been expelled from Bulgaria and rejected by Germany -- by painting the unseen portrait of the Great Right which he dreams of presenting at the next elections. A surprising picture, with some paradoxical features: It is virtually a complex of civil liberties advocacy, solidarism, and Third Worldism. [Brusadelli] Why is the leader of the Italian right disowning the leader of the Russian right? [Fini] I repeat: Zhirinovskiy is not of the right. He is not a nationalist like me; he is an imperialist. He has latched onto a feeling that has been present in the Russian people since Czarist times, a feeling which communism heightened. [Brusadelli] Yet it is proving difficult to place Zhirinovskiy anywhere outside the right. [Fini] He is a product of the decline of the former USSR. He is a complex of a number of typical Russian impulses, such as the desire for a strongman and anti-Semitism, all of which is supported by a powerful military caste. [Brusadelli] So which European right-wing movements do you like? [Fini] That is not easy to answer. There is no international organization for the Right because there is no ideology of the Right. In my opinion, the Right is the concrete response to everyday problems. However, those of us in Strasbourg are in a mixed group. [Brusadelli] A situation of isolation.... [Fini] We are working to introduce the MSI to other European political forces. I would exclude out of hand any link with neo-Nazis. With them there is the insurmountable discrimination of racism, whereas we are rooted in solidarity. [Brusadelli] Try to describe an MSI proposal for an international policy. [Fini] The agreement between the Palestinians and Israelis marks a major opportunity for Italy, as well as a major problem. Germany is concentrating on investments in the east. At this juncture, Italy should contrast the German choice and encourage Europe to concentrate on the Middle East market. For us this would present a twofold advantage: It would slow down immigration from that area and would have faster economic returns via oil. Moreover, southern Italy could really take off. [Brusadelli] Great, but we will have to see what [League leader] Umberto Bossi thinks of this.... [Fini] That is true. He is thinking of an Italy coupled to the German locomotive, while I am thinking of an Italy steeped in the Mediterranean. [Brusadelli] So there will be no agreement with Bossi? [Fini] We agree on tax protest, crime, and bribe city. But we have nothing in common on European policy, the national identity, and the issue of solidarism. [Brusadelli] What do you mean by solidarism? [Fini] We are aware of the duty of solidarity, not only between individuals, but also between rich and poor regions. [Brusadelli] And when you want to drive out non-European Community citizens, where is the solidarism then? [Fini] I have just presented a proposal aimed at improving their conditions -- but in their own countries, not here in Italy where nobody can ensure them a decent quality of life. [Brusadelli] Tell me what you would have to hear from Bossi in order to reach an agreement. [Fini] That Italy is one and indivisible and that the Italian people is a single people -- without [League ideologue] Miglio and Rocchetta saying the opposite thing the next day. [Brusadelli] Will you see Bossi in the next few days? [Fini] He is currently talking to [Judge] Di Pietro -- something that will certainly not happen to me. [Brusadelli] Do you, like your mayors, feel that [Fininvest President] Berlusconi is the ideal ally? [Fini] He has the merit of not using smoke screens in politics. [Brusadelli] Would you like to see him in the Palazzo Chigi [government seat]? [Fini] I do not think he wants to go there, and besides it would not be a solution. During a period of reconstruction, it is politics which should lead the economy, not vice-versa. [Brusadelli] Would it be better to have [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni at the Palazzo Chigi? [Fini] He is the leader of those who are pushing for reform. Today he is the anti-PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] candidate. At the local elections he supported the PDS candidates. [Brusadelli] So, at the end of the day, the moderate front risks remaining without a candidate to lead the government. [Fini] I think that at the end of the day neither of the two fronts will manage to agree on a candidate. [Brusadelli] It also seems that the MSI has been somewhat sidelined.... [Fini] I am not someone who longs to enter good society. However, I will not be accused of being the person who sabotaged an agreement. I am certain about one thing: Without us, the anti-PDS pole will lose. [Brusadelli] Will the anti-[Christian Democratic Party Secretary] Martinazzoli secessionists end up in the National Alliance? [Fini] We will not say no to a dialogue with them. However, let us be clear: There is no room in our house for people under investigation. [Brusadelli] What will the National Alliance's symbol be? [Fini] We are working on it. We are certain that the [MSI symbol] flame will be part of it. The MSI will be the most conspicuous component of the Alliance. I will give you an example: In Rome, out of 24 candidates, about 15 will be from the MSI.
