As the program begins, the announcer says a problem, regarded as one of the most complicated problems in the 20th century, is sweeping the world, particularly youths: drug addiction. The announcer adds: "An analytical reading of statistics on drug cases in Jordan reveals that the drug problem will grow continuously." She notes that what makes the drug phenomenon a growing challenge in Jordan is the fact that Jordan lies between areas that produce drugs and those that consume them. Jordanian territory is used illegally by drug smugglers as a passage for drugs, she adds. The program presents interviews with several unidentified individuals, including an unnamed official who says: "No doubt, we have a drug problem. As long as we confiscate various forms and kinds of drugs, arrest people involved in drug cases, and refer drug cases to the courts, we have a problem. With much regret, this problem grows from one year to another. This is proven by the fact that in 1992 we confiscated 3,000 kg of hashish, whereas in 1993 we confiscated 4,000 kg of hashish. In 1992, we referred to the court 163 drug cases in which 396 people were involved, whereas in 1993 we referred to the court 212 cases in which 513 people were involved." Later, the announcer adds: "With regard to the geographic distribution of drug cases in 1993, it was as follows: Amman, 59 cases; al-Zarqa', 35 cases; al-'Aqabah, 35 cases; the desert area, 16 cases; Irbid, 17 cases; al-Mafraq, 16 cases; Ma'an, 11 cases; al- Salt, one case; al-Ramtha, five cases; Ma'daba, one case; al-Azraq, five cases; the central Jordan Valley, one case; the al-'Umari border post, one case; the Suwaqah rehabilitation center [prison], four cases; the al-Juwaydah rehabilitation center [prison], two cases; the al-Karamah border post, two cases; al-Ruwayshid, one case; al-Karak one case; and Kurayyimah, one case." The announcer notes that "international reports indicate that there are 7,000 addiction cases in Jordan, most of them are addiction to medicines disbursed by medical prescription and which are available in pharmacies. A few of these are drug addiction cases." After explaining that the campaign against drugs cannot be carried out only by the drug fighting department because the drug problem has many other aspects, such as health, medical treatment, educational, information, and rehabilitation, the unnamed official adds that Jordan's Crown Prince Hasan has asked all concerned ministers and officials to coordinate and cooperate among themselves to work out the necessary plans, in a step similar to the formation of a higher national committee to fight drugs. The program then discusses the impact of drug addiction on people's bodies, emotions, psychology, and productivity, as well as on the community's productivity and development programs and on the family's economic and social situation. The announcer also interviews an unidentified clergyman who stresses that drugs adversely affect the human mind and perceptions, and that Islam prohibits drugs. The announcer points out that in the second half of 1984, the drug fighting department, assisted by other competent organizations, confiscated more than five million narcotic pills smuggled from Jordan's northern borders en route to neighboring Arab countries. Moreover, more than 10 kg of heroin were confiscated while being smuggled across Jordan en route to Arab and European countries and the United States. This department, the announcer adds, bans the illegal planting of drugs in Jordan and prevents the importation of poppy, opium, and cannabis seeds, unless they are toasted. Interviewed by the announcer, Jordanian Health Minister Dr. 'Abd al-Rahim Malhas says his ministry plans to build a special center in Jordan designed to treat drug addiction cases.
