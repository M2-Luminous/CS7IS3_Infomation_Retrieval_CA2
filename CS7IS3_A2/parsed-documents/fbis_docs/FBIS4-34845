Attention, Cassandras: the following report is horrible news for you. Because the inescapable conclusion is this: the mania for thinking that things are going badly and tending to get even worse is out of style. EXAME took the pulse of the elite of the business world's elite--the 500 largest firms--on various subjects: elections, the economy, and inflation. Out of the total number of questionnaires sent out, 126 were returned for tabulation. That is a highly representative sample in polls of this kind. The results can be expressed in three words: optimism, optimism, and optimism (see the table below). The answers to the questionnaire sent to businessmen and executives of the country's leading companies are a kind of confession of faith. Faith in growth. Faith in stabilization. Faith in the plan created around former Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso to defeat inflation. True, their faith is not all that great when the subject is the post-election scenario, but it would be an exaggeration to say that they foresee the apocalypse if Lula is elected. "The economy will probably continue to grow regardless of who the next president is," says Stephen Kanitz, EXAME's consultant and the man in charge of the poll. "What may happen is that the rate of growth will be faster or slower depending on which candidate is elected." Kanitz uses a number of main arguments to back up that view. The first is that given their low level of indebtedness, Brazilian firms are fully capable of maintaining a cycle of prolonged growth. His second argument concerns the emancipation that the private sector has won from the state. "The businessmen have learned to turn around without the state," says Kanitz. "They no longer depend so much on Brasilia to make their decisions for them." Finally, in the opinion of Kanitz, the agreement signed with the bankers and the Real Plan take care of two problems whose solution requires that the government continue to play a crucial role: the foreign debt and the fight against inflation. Repressed demand--That kind of optimism is echoed by several businessmen. One of them is Manoel Octavio Pereira Lopes, who is a stockholder in and president of Alcatel, the telecommunications giant. The firm he heads lost $30 million last year. Despite that, its investment program for 1994--on the order of $25 million--has continued unchanged. Pereira Lopes is among those who feel that the economy will probably grow by about 5 percent this year and then continue to expand next year "thanks to the economic plan." There are also those who mention other reasons in support of their optimism. "There is repressed demand in the infrastructure area that has reached its limit," says Roberto Muller, president of the ABB [Asea Brown Boveri]. "It is inevitable that from now on, business in that area is going to recover." In the opinion of Jose Marques, the firm's vice president, that prediction has a good chance of coming true. Reason: the possibility now opening up for partnerships between private capital and the public sector in areas such as electricity, which is the ABB's main field. That is also the reason why the ABB has not altered its plan to invest $20 million to modernize its equipment and increase its productivity this year. As is natural in an economy as complex as Brazil's, there are different reactions in some sectors. Businessman Jacks Rabinovich, for example, who is one of the owners of the Vicunha textile group (and also owns an interest in businesses in the world of finance and iron and steel), prefers to be cautious in his predictions. Rabinovich believes that GDP [gross domestic product] will rise and that the Real Plan will be a success, but he detects a temporary cooling which he attributes to the introduction of the real. "Store owners are buying with URV's [units of real value], but they have to sell in real cruzeiros," he says. "That difference in currencies will end up causing a harmful gap." In his opinion, the economy today is being pulled by a few locomotives. The automobile industry, because of its formidable influence on GDP, is chief of among them, he says. "But I hope that with the arrival of the real, there will be a more homogeneous development of business," he adds. Incidentally, there is no lack of support for introduction of the new currency. As the poll figures show, nearly 10 out of 10 businessmen and executives consider the Real Plan superior to its predecessors. "At last we have a plan that respects contracts, relies on the strength of the market, and dispenses with arbitrary packages," says Paulo Ferreira, the Dow Group's vice president for chemicals in Latin America. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Poll Results* | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Answer |Percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |By how much will the economy grow in 1994? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Over 5 percent |12.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Between 3 and 4.9 percent |62.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Between 1 and 2.9 percent |24.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Will not grow |1.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |If Lula wins, will the investment rate hold up? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yes |34.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Will wait and see |62.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |In part |2.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Is economic stability near? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yes |79.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |No |20.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Is the Real Plan better than the previous plans? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Better |95.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Same |4.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Who would make the best president? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Fernando Henrique Cardoso |88.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Maluf |4.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Brito |4.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lula |1.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Quercia |1.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |* This is how businessmen and executives responded to EXAME's poll of the co-| |untry's 500 largest private companies--in percentages. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Premature departure--After being out of the country for two years, Ferreira returned in April after Dow moved its Latin American office here from Miami. He liked what he saw. "When I left, it was the impeachment period, and people were exuding skepticism," he says. "Now it is easy to see that the situation has changed for the better and that society has matured a great deal." In his opinion, that new maturity is one of the main factors justifying optimism about the future. As far as a permanent stabilization of the economy is concerned, Ferreira warns that there are still some stages to go through. "What has been done so far is the equivalent of clearing off the table. Now it is necessary to set out the plates and provide the food." Among the things that still need to be done, Ferreira draws attention to measures making it possible to put the national accounts in order. His views on that subject agree with those of Rabinovich of Vicunha, Muller of the ABB, and Pereira Lopes of Alcatel. The latter three stress that long-term stabilization requires changes that must not perfunctory in any way. Chief among them is a persevering attack on the state's obesity. That plan has ended up being delayed by the fiasco of constitutional revision. "No matter who forms the new administration, those reforms cannot be postponed," says Pereira Lopes. "Society demands it." Because Fernando Henrique has become publicly identified with that reformist talk, it is easy to understand why, in this poll by EXAME, he emerges as the candidate preferred by businessmen. "While he was minister, he took stands corresponding to what the country needs," says Ferreira. "The success of the economic plan will be his best platform." Marques of the ABB adds an argument in favor of Fernando Henrique, saying: "He has a solid presence in the legislative branch. And the next administration is going to need support in Congress to put through the pending reforms." The fact that Fernando Henrique is not doing so well in the polls does not seem to bother his supporters too much, at least for the present. Rabinovich, for example, feels that "a lot of water will flow under the bridge" between now and the elections. "It is too early to make any predictions now, because campaigning has not even started," he says. Although clearly ahead among businessmen, candidate Fernando Henrique also stirs some criticism. "He should have stayed on as minister to carry out the plan," says Eugenio Staub, president of Gradiente. Staub feels that his departure from the ministry was premature, created an image of someone merely looking for votes, and compromised his credibility. Even worse, Staub feels that Fernando Henrique's actions as a candidate are distorting his political personality. "The alliance with the PFL [Liberal Front Party] is a contradiction with his past, as is his participation in pilgrimages in honor of Father Cicero," he says. Disappointed by those attitudes in someone he says is a personal friend, Staub has declared his neutrality. He even confesses to some liking for Lula's message. "Some of the things he says are pertinent," he says. "The big problem is not ideology but the question of whether Lula's team is competent to administer a country like Brazil." Volume of investments--There seems to be unanimous opinion on one thing, however. Although no one fears a cataclysm, there is certainty regarding the impact that a possible victory by Lula will have on the volume of investments in our country. Even firms saying that they are inclined to make no changes in their investment plans--examples being Vicunha, Dow, the ABB, Gradiente, and Alcatel--call attention to the negative effects that a victory by Lula will have on the inflow of capital from abroad. "There are many choices in the international market," says Rabinovich, whose group this year will open a plant in Natal that absorbed investments totaling $150 million. "It is understandable that foreign investors should think twice before investing in Brazil if Lula wins." Kanitz agrees. He has no doubt that a victory by Fernando Henrique will be much more welcome abroad than one by the PT [Workers Party] candidate. Even Staub, who is not dying of love for the candidacy supported by the alliance between the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and the PFL, is not neglecting a few precautions. At this time of the year, Gradiente should be drawing up its three-year plan. But that project has been shelved until after the elections. Staub justifies the postponement by recourse to semantic subtleties. "It is not that we have decided to slam on the brakes," he says. "It's just that we have taken our foot off the accelerator."
