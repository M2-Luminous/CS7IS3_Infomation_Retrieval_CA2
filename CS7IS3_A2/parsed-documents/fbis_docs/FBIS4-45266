It seems that this is the case now with an agreement signed by the United States and Colombia on bases for the surveillance of drug trafficking. In this case it was clear that Colombia rendered a service to the United States and not the other way around. It would be preferable for our policy to be increasingly independent, because those installations are not useful even for monitoring civilian air traffic in Colombia, rather for rendering service only to U.S. addicts [viciosos].
