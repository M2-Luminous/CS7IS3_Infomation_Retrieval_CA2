Two patients have died; one of them this year, Ferdats said. Ferdats claims it is difficult to find how many residents have fallen ill with AIDS and how many are HIV carriers because seven to 10 years may separate the beginning of illness from the moment of contamination. As reported, the World Health Organization and the Latvian AIDS Center opened a seminar for journalists Tuesday [10 May] in Riga. The workshop is conducted by WHO expert Marie Noelle Belot. The organizers maintain that the media play an important role in the formation of AIDS-related public opinion.
