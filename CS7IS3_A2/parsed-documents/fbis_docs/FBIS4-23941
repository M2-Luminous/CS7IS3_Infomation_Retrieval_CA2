Speaking at his usual Friday news conference this morning, Ajello said both the government and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] have been making positive statements in this direction, but there is a need to turn statements into concrete actions. The Italian-born UN official said the movement of people to assembly areas should not be delayed because of political differences since the confining of troops has been secured technically and logistically. Aldo Ajello said that in various meetings he held with both the government and Renamo during the week, he noticed progress in the process. He added that a solution to the problems involved in confining troops and demobilization will be found soon. Butrus-Ghali's representative in Mozambique has revealed that the government has so far demobilized 17,889 troops, while Renamo has demobilized 3,123. The government has still to demobilize 31,580 men, while Renamo must demobilize 3,630 guerrillas. Aldo Ajello feels that if these men are not demobilized as soon as possible there will certainly be difficulties in concluding the closing down of all assembly areas by 15 August. He was satisfied, however, with the approval of a timetable of the activities of the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] until the holding of elections in October. The timetable includes, among other things, the conclusion of the confinement of troops from the government and Renamo, the closing down of assembly areas, the conclusion of the demobilization of troops from both sides. The timetable also provides for the presentation of the final report on the national mine disarming investigation on 20 June and the conclusion of the collection of weapons, ammunition, and war materiel in government and Renamo depots on 10 August. Aldo Ajello says he believes that both Renamo and the government agree that this timetable, which he described as very important, will be fully implemented. Regarding the training of the new army, Ajello said that despite the progress already achieved, there are serious problems in convincing people to join the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces because they believe they will be badly fed and accomodated and receive low salaries. The UN Operations in Mozambique currently has 364 observers and 4,560 blue helmets in the field. The UN Civil Police is made up of 729 men deployed in 24 posts.
