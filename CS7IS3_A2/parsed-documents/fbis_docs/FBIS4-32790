The multiparty delegation that was in Cuba between 22 and 27 May was headed by Professor Juan Jose Castelo, president of the education, culture, and sports commission of the single-chamber parliament, and made up by Secretary Abdon Monroe Palacio, Gilberto Vaca, Osvaldo Coronel, and Magaly Robalino. Castelo, who spoke on behalf of the South American deputies in an interview with Jaime Crombet, acting president of the National Assembly of the People's Government (Parliament), expressed his satisfaction at the fruitful exchanges with their Cuban colleagues. The visitors, aside from seeing the National Assembly and other official departments, visited hospitals, institutions for infants, and educational, scientific, and cultural centers. They spoke to directors and workers. During a two-hour conversation with Crombet, the deputies expressed their admiration for the Cuban people's efforts to overcome the severe economic difficulties following the collapse of the European Socialist Bloc -- Cuba's historic ally -- and in the face of Washington's increased economic blockade. Castelo underscored that this struggle is carried out without impairing Cuban independence and sovereignty, or without affecting achievements in health, education, and social security, which deserve support and solidarity. Castelo, as president of an important commission comprising 10 percent of the total number of Ecuadoran parliament deputies, spoke about Ecuador's interest in participating in the Pedagogia 95 congress that will be held in Havana in February 1995. Castelo also believes that the fluid dialogue that began should continue together with broadening the parliamentary visitor exchange program so that both countries can take advantage of their experiences for the benefit of their political and economic processes. In reply to PRENSA LATINA, Castelo, in his role as national leader of the Democratic People's Movement (MPD), disclosed that this force, the number one leftist force, will promote electoral unity in order to win the 1996 elections and multiply solidarity with the Cuban revolutionary process.
