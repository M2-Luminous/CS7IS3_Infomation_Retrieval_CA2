Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi and Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice trade minister for international affairs, will attend the meeting, the official said. Undersecretary of State Timothy Wirth will head the U.S. delegation. The two countries are expected to discuss bilateral cooperation to battle illegal drugs, promote children's health, protect coral and observe geological processes, in addition to five fields that the two nations have been discussing under the framework talks, the official said. Japan and the U.S. have been studying bilateral cooperation on the environment, technology, the development of human resources, population and AIDS. Unlike the other two deadlocked areas of the framework talks -- macroeconomic and microeconomic areas -- the negotiations on global cooperation have seen some progress.
