Dorenko says that today practically everybody is talking publicly and openly about a conspiracy but the authorities are silent and behave almost as if they are participants in this plot. Today there were numerous meetings and sittings in the Kremlin and around it. People have discussed what to say, with whom to talk, and who will talk about the recent rumors. Many of them say they have nothing to talk about because there has been no coup. Some of them are afraid that if they talk about this with somebody, later the president may learn about it and, possibly, misinterpret their remarks. Dorenko then says: "The latest information is that today some people from the State Duma called the Kremlin and asked one of the president's assistants whether it is true that the president was delivered by air this afternoon from Sochi in very bad condition so he could be treated here. Well, around ten people in the Kremlin say that this is a lie. But all of them are saying that they will not talk about this in front of the camera. We know that in the near future a certain event is to take place in Sochi where journalists with cameras will be invited and they will be able to show the healthy president to the people. The apparatus is working with awful delays which we would like to explain by the fact that they are simply doing their work inefficiently. The only person in the Kremlin who is not afraid to speak for television at all is Georgiy Satarov, the president's assistant." The video then shows Georgiy Satarov giving an interview to Yelena Karayeva, an RTV correspondent. She asks him to comment on the rumors about Yeltsin's poor health. He says there are forces that would prefer to have a bad situation in the country. The correspondent asks him to explain whom he means. Satarov says: "There are two kinds of politicians. We are talking about those who are in principle outside legal politics and do not use legal methods, and those who, let us say, do not have experience in public politics and they know full well that they do not have chances, even if they are respectable people, they do not have chances to come to power as a result of a normal democratic process. These kind of people do exist. I am talking, above all, about the type and not about specific persons." He adds that he cannot speak about any particular person because he has no real facts. The correspondent asks Georgiy Satarov whether former KGB members and former bosses of the Ministry of Internal Affairs who have money and real power even now could start to use all kinds of propaganda to influence people. Satarov says: "Yes, potentially, of course, this could be done. But I do not know for sure whether such a team exists or not at the present time. But some facts could be interpreted in this way." But he adds that he does not have enough facts to confirm this. The correspondent then says that today they tried to speak about all these issues with many prominent political figures but they all refused to speak with journalists and said that they were too busy. Satarov says that it was difficult for him to find time for this interview as well and he has only a few minutes. He adds: "But on the other hand we should speak about this because, of course, people are interested to know where the president is, what he is doing, why he decided to have a rest and what all this means. Of course, they should know this and we should speak about it." Presenter Sergey Dorenko then continues to comment on this issue. He says that despite the fact that the authorities do not want to speak about this it is clear that the Kremlin is very anxious about these rumors. For example, Yuriy Baturin has interrupted his holiday and returned to Moscow and Stepashin urgently returned to work after his illness. Dorenko then discusses who was the organizer of these rumors and who would benefit because of them. There are several versions. One of them is that the president himself has organized all this so as to introduce a state of emergency in the country and thus, to get rid of opposition. This is a very weak argument. The second version says that some politicians like Soskovets, Luzhkov, or Skokov want to come to power now because they are afraid that "foolish and unpredictable" voters will allow Zhirinovskiy or Rutskoy to come to power. But the president supports these politicians and even considers Luzhkov as one of his possible successors. Communists are not interested in these rumors either because they do not have control over the Army and they hope to win only at open democratic elections. So, it seems as if there are no people who would be interested in all that. But the presenter adds that according to Yuriy Baturin these rumors are some kind of smoke-screen. He concludes: "When everybody gets used to talks about a conspiracy and stops paying any attention to them everything will start and we will learn the name of the author of the present artillery preparation."
