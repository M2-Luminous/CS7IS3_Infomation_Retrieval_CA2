The visit reflects a U.S. appreciation of Egypt and President Husni Mubarak for his intensive efforts to achieve an honorable peace providing the firm bases for Egyptian and other Arab peoples to build themselves and assert their existence in this changing world. Christopher's visit to the region reflects U.S. awareness of the importance of intervention on the level of the U.S. secretary of state at this phase in the peace process to prevent any setback that will return the talks to the whirlpool of Israeli obstacles aimed at extorting the Palestinians and turning the two self-rule areas into a prison without barbed wire. The visit reflects a U.S. desire for the success of the peace process to bypass the stage of wars to a new Middle East enjoying peace, security, cooperation, and prosperity for all the region's peoples. We believe the U.S. secretary of state must convince the Israelis to respect their pledges and signatures on the September agreement in Washington. He must also convince them that the only guarantee for their security is a just and comprehensive peace through which the Arabs will have their occupied lands restored and the Palestinians will regain all their legitimate rights. Israel must realize that regional peace and security are not its demand alone. Concern for peace and stability must be reflected in a clear commitment that the world can see and that the Middle East peoples can experience. The Middle East peoples are in dire need of peace and stability in order to devote themselves to development. Mubarak's Egypt has played a vanguard role for the sake of peace and stability in this part of the world. It continues to play this key role for peace, which will provide common security for all parties. President Mubarak has called on all parties to work to continue the peace process. Undoubtedly, accelerating the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement will be a sign of hope in a region whose people have lived in despair and disappointment for a long time, especially the Palestinian people. Speeding up the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement will give credibility to the process of a comprehensive peace and encourage the other Arab parties to sit at the negotiating table. It is a fact that President Husni Mubarak is playing an important role in pushing forward the peace process on all tracks. Egypt is the biggest Arab country and has the first experience of a permanent peace with Israel. All parties must realize that Egypt is not prepared to put any pressure on the Palestinian leadership to compel it to adopt unacceptable stances or to approve unsatisfactory proposals. Egypt is not a mediator. It does not play a neutral role between the Arabs and Israel. Egypt's stance is part of the Arab stance on interests and rights, including the Palestinian people's interests and rights. We are certain that the ship of peace will sail again. The difficult and complicated negotiations taking place in Cairo and President Husni Mubarak's continuing contacts with all parties will ultimately persuade Israel to respond to the Palestinian demands. Egypt is hosting the talks on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord and President Mubarak is sponsoring these talks. In view of President Mubarak's personal role for the sake of a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace, we say that the peace we desire must include the Palestinians, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan and must return to them their legitimate rights.
