The population of the wilaya of Oum El-Bouaghi is close to 500,000, and the growth rate is 3.06 percent, which far outstrips the national rate (2.72 percent). As of 1993, the labor pool was about 111,380 (including active job seekers), which means actual jobholders in the various sectors number only 85,844. The number of unemployed in the wilaya is 25,496 (official figure), which means an unemployment rate of 22.08 by conventional calculations; it also means that 5.27 percent of the total population of the wilaya are without jobs, and only one out of every 6 people is working, so the dependency ratio is 6 to 1. According to the manpower office, there are 1,890 persons seeking jobs. This figure breaks down by dairas as follows: 810 people in the daira of Ain Beida, 283 in Meskiana, 452 in Ain M'lila, 385 in Oum El-Bouaghi (we note that the highest figure is for Ain Beida, which is not realistic). The actual number of job seekers is much greater. For example, the number of youths dropped from the 3 AS high-school rolls is 2,029--all of them good prospects for joblessness. Young people aged 16-30 account for 78.57 percent of the unemployment (a veritable social disaster, compared to other wilayas in the country). The job market for the entire wilaya of Oum El-Bouaghi is about 43,000, a figure that reflects the nonexistence of statal or private productive investment, as well as the almost total absence of employment policy at the governmental or wilaya level. The supply of unfilled jobs breaks down by daira as follows: 182 for Ain Beida, 96 for Meskiana, 109 for Ain M'lila, 87 for Oum El-Bouaghi. Is this enough to resorb all the unemployment in the wilaya? Sectorally, employment in the wilaya breaks down as follows: 26,750 jobs in agriculture (31.14 percent), 11,256 in construction and water works (13.10 percent), 7,282 in industry (8.47 percent, which reflects the weakness of the industrial sector and its marginality), and 40,596 in the tertiary sector (which does not create jobs and economic growth). Administration, commerce, and services account for 47.26 percent of employment. These figures suggest there is a total lack of industrial investments to remedy the unemployment problem. In the face of these statistics, would it not be a good time to give new impetus to agriculture and construction, the biggest users of manpower? Recovery in these two sectors could alleviate unemployment at least to some extent. "You cannot talk philosophy with starving people. We want something concrete," quipped one unemployed youth. An outburst that captures well the current attitudes of youth.
