That Is What Ukrainian Presidential Candidate Leonid Kuchma Is Promising His Voters"] [Text] When Leonid Kravchuk was asked whom he sees as his main rival in the upcoming 26 June presidential elections, his answer was unequivocal -- Kuchma. The "duel" in the second round will be with him, the present head of state believes. So, since we recently set out Leonid Kravchuk's election platform on the most important political and economic problems, we decided also to allow Leonid Kuchma to speak out. Our correspondent met with him. Kiev -- [Prokopchuk] Leonid Danilovich, what direction is Ukraine going to take and what will it build if you become president? [Kuchma] We will build a state in which someone who works honestly has a better life than someone who refuses to work and steals and pilfers from the state. Where a pensioner can live on his pension rather than eke out a pitiful existence and root around in trashcans. Where you can live a life worthy of a human being on the minimum wage. [Prokopchuk] How do you see Ukraine's state structure, and what do you think of the idea of a federal land-based structure? [Kuchma] I am a categorical supporter of strong presidential power so that the head of state can assume full responsibility. Initially, I even rule out the post of prime minister. I do not want the president to be able to point the finger at anyone and find a whipping boy and scapegoat. As for the desire of the Dniester and Donbass regions for a kind of economic federalism, this is a matter not of a wish to escape pressure from the center but of its uselessness. It is little use today. The regions are surviving themselves nowadays, either on their own or by helping each other without intermediaries. The country's budget is practically empty. I was one of the first to advocate a future federal land-based structure and greater economic autonomy for the regions, but without this turning into political autonomy. That would spell the disintegration of statehood. I am opposed to that kind of structure. [Prokopchuk] In one of your first speeches in parliament as head of government you made the sensational statement that mafia structures and corruption have permeated all upper-echelon power structures. But what stopped you during your year as head of the cabinet of ministers from seeing through to completion at least one major case about oil, say, or the sale of metal at dumping prices.... [Kuchma] Why did I make that statement in the Supreme Council at that time? Because the problem of corruption and the mafia is a matter of personnel policy. Who is in charge of the power ministers? Not the prime minister, but directly the president. What about the courts and the prosecutor's office? Parliament is in charge of them. In this situation what can the premier do except refer cases to the prosecutor's office and make statements in parliament? During my premiership over 1,500 criminal cases were instigated against high-ranking corrupt officials. Now they have all been quietly shelved. I personally dismissed the directors of all Ukraine's oil refineries for machinations over the export of petroleum products running into hundreds of millions of dollars. They now have their jobs back.... I give my word that if I win the election I will have both the powers and the determination to deal a mortal blow against crime and to come down hard on the mafia. [Prokopchuk] What in your view is the way out of the Crimean crisis? [Kuchma] Everyone must clearly realize that Crimea is a component part of Ukraine and proceed on this basis. There can be no question of other terms. Second, there should be no attempts to take back what has already been given away. The Crimeans are asking for greater economic autonomy -- fine. Maybe Crimea will indeed be the place where all economic innovations are tried out. There must be an end to saber-rattling and threats: We cannot allow yet another "trouble spot" to appear on the map of the former Union. But some people badly want this. The only possible way out of the Crimean crisis is a full-scale treaty between Kiev and Simferopol that would grant Crimea within Ukraine all possible economic autonomy. In my view the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan is a model for such a solution. [Prokopchuk] What would be your way of extricating the country from the protracted economic crisis? [Kuchma] First, privatization. It must take place under strict state control, as it does throughout the world. Otherwise this will only enrich the mafia structures that are tightly interwoven with the bureaucratic apparatus. The foundation of the economy must be not ideological phantoms, whatever their hue, but people's real interests. The experience of economic development of countries like the FRG and Sweden cogently demonstrates this in practice. Second, the taxation system must immediately be fundamentally changed, since it stifles both private enterprise and state enterprises. In this connection the budget structure must also be radically revised, making a point of increasing the share of expenditure earmarked for the social sphere, science, education, and specifically for increasing pensions. After all, it is impossible to live on pensions today. Third. There is a need to eliminate all restrictions on the creation of a single economic space in the CIS countries, which over 80 percent of industry is geared toward. This question is not just Leonid Kuchma's view but a matter of the survival of the entire state. And the fixed exchange rate of the karbovanets is totally disastrous for our economy and is merely a source of fabulous wealth for certain powers that be. Its abolition is a priority measure. [Prokopchuk] All your election campaign opponents accuse Kuchma of dragging Ukraine into a new inviolable Union and say that if he comes to power Ukraine will lose its autonomy and sovereignty. How ideally do you see Ukraine's policy vis-a-vis Russia? [Kuchma] Because of its geographical position, historical past, and the entire spirit of the people Ukraine cannot play the role of "cordon sanitaire" between Russia and the remaining European countries that has been foisted upon it. Its historical mission is very different: Ukraine must become a bridge for the mutual enrichment of the civilizations of West and East. A bridge across which the most sophisticated and vitally necessary technologies pass. Russia, with which we are linked by thousands of historical, economic, and cultural bonds, is especially important in this respect. The path of confrontation with it is quite disastrous for Ukraine and entails total collapse and the possible loss of statehood. Relations of "special partnership" like those between the United States and Canada must inevitably be established between our countries. Finally -- a few words about economic integration, not about Kuchma's desire to create a new version of the former Union. Integration is the basis of the current economic prosperity of the EEC countries. Integration, and not the subordination of one country to others, and the creation of regional organizations for all-around equal cooperation, as is being done in Europe and North America. The CIS must become a model not of "civilized divorce" but of the ability to preserve old economic, cultural, and spiritual links while adapting them in the light of objective conditions and to organize new links. [Prokopchuk] So who do you think is going to win the upcoming elections? [Kuchma] I am sure the people will make the correct choice 26 June.... Demagoguery will no longer work, and the presidential candidates who have made it the basis of their activity have not got the slightest chance of winning.
