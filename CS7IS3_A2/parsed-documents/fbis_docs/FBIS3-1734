According to Liang Heng, deputy director of the State Press and Publication Administration (SPPA), a draft of China's first publication law will be submitted to the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People's Congress for deliberation this year. The draft, prepared by the administration, has been "repeatedly revised and is now ready for legislative procedures." As regards the country's first press law, "legislative procedures are to be completed within two or three years." Government decrees have, until now, been the guidance for China's press work. "Work will be intensified to ensure that law and self- discipline do the job," said Liang, who is in charge of the press work. As the government body in charge of the press and publishing industries, Liang specified, the SPPA will, in addition to planning and supervision, be responsible for drafting laws and decrees and selecting and awarding government prizes. "Self-discipline" means "instituting ethical standards or rules of conduct for journalists and writers in fulfilling their social responsibilities," Liang said. The official cited the All-China Journalists Association, which has issued a norm of professional ethics for journalists throughout the country. Local journalists' associations are busy preparing norms that suit local conditions, he added. In implementing laws and decrees, Liang said, the SPPA will continue to ban illegal publications, including those of "an excessively low taste or pornographic." But that does not amount to censorship. "Newspaper and magazine editors independently decide what to publish in accordance with state laws, government policies and their own editorial policies," he said. SPPA officials do read and check up some publications after they come off the press. But they insisted that this was to ensure a "healthy development of China's press and publishing industries for the good of the entire people." One was Zhang Bohai, a former editor of the People's Literature Publishing House and now an SPPA "examiner." "For me and my colleagues, the most gratifying thing is to conclude, after reading, that the publications are of high quality and taste," he said. "Unless the problems in a certain publication are exceptionally serious, we will not take administrative measures against it," he added. In most cases, the problems are referred to the editor with advice on improvement. By the end of 1993, he added, 2,039 newspapers and about 8,000 other periodicals had registered with SPPA. Among them, Zhang said, "only four or five were ordered to close down for grave problems." China's press and publications industry had a boom in 1993, the number of newspapers registering a 13.9 growth. This year, SPPA officials said, the growth in the number of newspapers will be "controlled somewhat" for better quality. The policy is one of aiding those "of high quality and popular" in their development and helping those of inferior quality to improve. Meanwhile, new publications badly needed in China's economic construction will have priority to get registered, and this policy also applies to publications of science and technology or in languages of China's ethnic minority nationalities.
