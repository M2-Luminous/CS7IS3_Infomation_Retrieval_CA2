The 65 year-old Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] politician gave cardiac disease as the reason for his decision. His doctors advised him to urgently abandon his original intention of remaining in office until the end of the present election period in Spring 1995. Guenther, who comes from northern Hesse, was Hesse's justice minister between 1974 and 1987, and also interior minister of Hesse from 1982 to 1984. He was reappointed to this office in April 1991 after the SPD and Greens defeated the Christian Democratic Union/Free Democratic Party coalition in the Landtag elections. [passage omitted]
