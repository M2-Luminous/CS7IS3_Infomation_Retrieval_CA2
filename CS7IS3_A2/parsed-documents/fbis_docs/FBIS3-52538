Me'ir Mendelovich, 32, a father of eight children, and Eliyahu Levin, 25, both from Bene Beraq, were murdered while driving through Baytuniya, a town near Ramallah. They were giving the deportees a unique welcoming reception, saturated with Jewish blood. The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam murder squads -- the military arm of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] -- left a leaflet on the scene of the murder. "This was in revenge for the killing of 'Imad 'Aqil, the Hamas commander of Gaza, and for the killing of three Tarqumiyah residents by Jews." Brigadier General Sha'ul Mufaz, the military commander of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, required no explanations. "I see no particular daring in the murders. They want to harm Jews. They lie in wait in places where they expect to find easy prey, they spot Jews, and they shoot." Twenty four of the deportees, who over the past year turned out to be members of the Hamas military apparatus, preferred to remain in Lebanon. They will presumably find their niches either in Hizballah operations or in the military apparatuses of Hamas. Defense figures believe that many of those who did return had been instructed and trained at the terrorist academy of Hizballah. "Hamas remains the same Hamas. We return stronger, with greater support and sympathy among the residents of the territories." This observation was made by Dr. 'Aziz Duwayk, dean of the geography studies at the Hebron University, one of the 197 deportees who were allowed to return to the territories last week. Of these, 65 remained in prison -- some for interrogation about ties with Hizballah, others for Hamas-related activities prior to the deportation. About 10 have received administrative detention orders. Fatah personnel members walked around with long faces this week. They had hoped that Israel would release a few hundred security prisoners, in order to offset the joy of their opposition and to try to stop the erosion of the support for the peace process. (A survey by the Palestinian Center for Research in Nabulus, which was published this week, showed that only 41 percent of the territories residents support the peace agreement, versus 65 percent in September; 38 percent are opposed to the agreement, versus 28 percent in September.) Hamas and their opposition partners are now seeking to take advantage of the deportees' return to create a new momentum for oppositionist activities. The 17 December 1992 deportation was carried out at the peak of the violent conflict between Hamas and Fatah, but the attitude of the deportees who returned this week was conciliatory toward Fatah, despite the new political reality which followed the Rabin-'Arafat handshake. "We are opposed to this agreement, but we will express our objection in democratic ways only," Dr. Duwayk stresses. "We will make sure that not a single drop of Palestinian blood is spilled in this struggle. Fraternal infighting goes against our faith, Islam." Referring to press headlines about an elimination list with names of Fatah members, which was allegedly brought back by the deportees, Dr. Duwayk says: "Nonsense. This is not our way." But violence against Israel will not cease, he adds. Its causes have not changed. "Rabin wants to give us autonomy. We want sovereignty. Therefore, I say thank you to autonomy. Anyway, Rabin wants 'Arafat to be a dictator, because that will ease the way to his goals. A majority of our nation are against the agreement. Therefore, you should remember that Rabin signed an agreement with only one organization out of all the Palestinian organizations. Were I to record history, I would say Israel signed an agreement with one man only -- with 'Arafat." Dr. 'Aziz Duwayk, 45, has seven children. The oldest, Muhammad, is 15, and the youngest, a four-month-old baby girl, was born while he was in exile. He named her "Di'ah" -- prayer. In the Marj al-Zuhur camp, Duwayk was one of the deportee spokesmen. It was an extraordinary camp: There were 88 university students, 30 professors and tutors from territories universities, 11 doctors, 10 engineers, 18 senior religious clerics, 10 liberal arts university graduates. Dr. Salamah, acting president of the Gaza University, was also there. A distinguished human composition, far beyond the average level of the Palestinian street. It is, more or less, the human composition of Hamas. The camp consisted of several dozen tents. Some were populated by five or six men, while others housed one man only. In the center of the camp, a large tent -- 10 by 20 meters -- was set up to serve as a mosque. Its floor was covered with mats, and a mahrab indicating the direction of prayer, as well as a small podium for the preacher -- a different one every week -- were built. "Thank God, we had quite enough preachers," Duwayk says, laughing heartily. Education is one of the most important Hamas values, and most of the deportees' days at Marj al-Zuhur were therefore spent in study. A few days after the deportation, two large tents were set up for that purpose. A large sign over the entrance to one of them proclaimed: "The ink in the pen is stronger than the bullet in the gun." They had teachers for every subject, plenty of time, and few students in every classroom. It was a university in every respect, and the studies conducted there have gained the recognition of the universities in the territories. Ibrahim Abu-Salim from Ramallah, for instance, completed his Phd dissertation in Marj al-Zuhur. The research, which dealt with the philosophical trends of Islam, was sent to the Sudanese 'Umm Durman University for approval and earned Abu-Salim a Phd. They studied biology, geography, education, and Islam at the Marj al-Zuhur university. The students had a large library at their disposal, after over 2,000 books were donated by Islamic universities. The library was arranged in a tent with carpet-covered flaps and with a large photograph of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam in the center. Dr. Duwayk taught geography. "I specifically taught the geography of southern Lebanon, so that the deportees would know on which part of the map they were situated. Later I talked about the geographical conditions of the place. I also taught them topographical orientation and air currents, to help them find the direction of the prayer." Various other lessons were arranged for nonacademic deportees. Language courses were the most popular. They studied French, English, Italian, Russian, Spanish, and some even took an extended, three-level Hebrew course for beginners, mid-level, and advanced students. Special professional courses were also launched, teaching electricity, first aid, and even bee breeding. A course taken by all the deportees taught Koran reading and comprehension. Some 350 course and professional training students received graduation diplomas during the one-year deportation at Marj al-Zuhur. A nine-member supreme committee, chosen in democratic elections by all the deportees, ran the camp's everyday life. In the last weeks, the deportees elected Mahmud Hasan Sham'a from Gaza as camp committee chairman -- a honorary appointment given to the oldest deportee. The camp committee had two tents -- one for an office and another for gatherings and conferences. Eleven deported doctors received fellow deportees in two tents -- a clinic and a hospital. A few weeks after the deportation, local Lebanese villagers also began frequenting the clinic. Medicines were received by special order through the Red Cross. There was no food shortages. Most was bought in neighboring Lebanese villages, and in addition, the deportees received donations from relief and welfare organizations and Palestinian groups. "Even Fatah people supplied us with food, and there are many Fatah factions in Lebanon. We received donations from everyone, even from 'Arafat's people," Duwayk says. "Hizballah gave us food, too. We were not fussy about the source of assistance." [Shaqed] What did you eat? [Duwayk] Rice, macaroni, meat, chicken, vegetables. All kinds of cooked food. Occasionally fruit too. [Shaqed] Who did the cooking? [Duwayk] Each in his turn cooked and did chores. I, for instance, cooked majadara, soups, meat, and rice. The deportees returned with large suitcases filled with clothing items -- mainly sports clothes. In the first days of the deportation, they received every conceivable kind of clothing. Summer clothes were sent with the advent of spring. The Red Cross supplied blankets. Their daily activities were arranged around prayer hours. Even on snowy days, they woke up at 0330 for early morning prayers. "When we washed to purify our bodies for prayer, water would freeze on our hands," Duwayk reveals. "But, thank God, we did it out of love. After the morning prayer, we would gather for special worship, including personal prayers. We prayed to God, calling out loud: God, take us back to our homes. God, please soften Rabin's heart of stone." After prayers, about one hour was devoted to gymnastics and sports -- judo, karate, yoga, jogging, and ball games. The Lebanese donated a few table tennis sets, and a volleyball court was arranged in the camp. After breakfast, time was set aside was cleaning and tidying. University and other studies began at 0800. They went on, with brief recesses, till the midday prayer, which was followed by a meal. Studies were then resumed till 1600, "after which there was more sports, personal things to attend to, dinner, and then everyone would sit around the TV set and watch the Israeli television newsreel. We saw footage on Hebron and Gaza on the news every day, and the little screen helped us to remain in touch with home. After that, there were gatherings, meetings, conversations, and a night prayer." Television was not their only link with the world. There were also many radio sets. In addition, they had three cellular phones and a fax machine. "Each morning, we received faxed news from news agencies, as well as a translation of YEDI'OT AHARONOT," Duwayk says. One cellular telephone was used exclusively by the spokesman, Dr. 'Abd-al-Aziz al-Rantisi, against whom the authorities have just issued a six-month administrative detention order. The dialing was done through a U.S. switchboard. The two other cellular phones were reserved for conversations with relatives. The phones belonged to local villagers, who charged $1.5 per minute. A news conference was held every afternoon. Telephone interviews were carried out with reporters throughout the world. "We had parties on religious holidays. Deportees from the Hebron area would prepare knafa (a baked sweet cheese dish), and we would buy sweet foods, particularly pastries, such as baklava. We had a debka [oriental dance] troupe made up of the youngest deportees, which danced at parties. We also had a drama group. In Marj al-Zuhur, we wrote and put up a play called `Deportation.' The play depicted the first 50 hours of our deportation, which were all agony. We sat opposite the actors and cried." Have you learned a lesson from the deportation? I asked Dr. Duwayk. He smiled, laughed aloud, and then said: "Hamas is an Islamic movement whose sole purpose is to implement the dictates of Islam. There is no reason for the Hamas stand to change, because the Islam will not change. In Marj al-Zuhur we practiced the `sabir', patience and forbearance preached by the Islam. And most importantly, the extensive media coverage brought Hamas into every Palestinian house in the territories."
