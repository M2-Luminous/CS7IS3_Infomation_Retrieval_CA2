Neither are Russian TV programs going out today in the town on the Yenisey. Only the local independent TV company "Afontovo," with its own transmitter, continues transmitting to Krasnoyarsk. "We are not satisfied at the government's decision on a stage-by-stage repayment of debts," the ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by Aleksandr Molchanov, the head of Krasnsoyarsk Radio and TV transmitting station. "We have heard more declaratory statements not backed up by any specific deadlines. The debts to our station alone in the last three months amount to 1 billion rubles, and it is not known when this money will arrive." TV journalists reacted promptly to the communications workers' threat. Last night they put more than 10 million rubles in cash into the communications workers' coffers, and local programs will go on the air this evening.
