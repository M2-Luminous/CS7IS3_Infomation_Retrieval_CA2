Now, there is so much confusion. I for one have not really understood, with this downpour of results, exactly what the parties' positions are. The only thing that is certain is that we have won. [passage omitted] I still have to make sense of what the real facts are, but I am extremely happy. [Correspondent] [passage omitted] Your party seems to have got 12.6 percent of the vote. What do you think of that? [Fini] I would say that that is very good. It's practically 13 percent. It's very good. Excellent. [Correspondent] Regarding the whole of the Freedom Alliance, the good government alliance, which gets between 319 and 338 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, an absolute majority, will there now be problems with your potential ally, someone you have never considered an ally, Umberto Bossi? [Fini] Now, once the euphoria of the results has passed, we will have to calmly assess the whole thing. I think I can say that the Italians have made a clear choice as to who is to govern them.
