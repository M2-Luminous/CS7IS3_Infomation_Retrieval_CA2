In a half-hour meeting with Mitterrand, Brundtland stressed the need to find solutions to problems brought up in negotiations over Norway's possible membership in the EC. Addressing European Parliament deputies in Strasbourg earlier Thursday, Brundtland said negotiations over the expansion of the EC could be concluded by March 1. "This is an ambitious target, but if the political will is there, it is feasible," she said. The main obstacles to Norway's EC membership remain agriculture and fishing, the prime minister said. As for agriculture, Norway is seeking "some special arrangements adapted to our climate and topographic situation," Brundtland said. Oslo is also requesting "creative reflection" to solve the problem of the management of northern Norwegian fishing areas, she added. "So far we have achieved encouraging results related to energy and also regarding environmental standards. We have also met a constructive approach to regional policy," she said. The EC has fixed February 28 as the deadline for concluding negotiations on EC membership with Norway, Austria, Finland and Sweden, so that these countries may join the community in early 1995. Speaking in Strasbourg Wednesday, Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos, whose country currently holds the rotating EC presidency, did not rule out that this deadline could be extended.
