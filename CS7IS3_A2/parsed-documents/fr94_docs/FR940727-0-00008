FR940727-0-00008 FR940727-0-00003 There are 5 handlers of olives regulated under the order, and approximately 1,350 producers in the regulated area. In addition, there are approximately 25 importers of olives subject to the requirements of the olive import regulation. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms, which include olive handlers and importers, are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of the olive producers and importers may be classified as small entities. None of the olive handlers may be so classified. The California Olive Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the order, met on December 14, 1993, and unanimously recommended revising outgoing inspection procedures to permit handlers to establish a QAP in lieu of maintaining continuous in-line outgoing inspection of processed olives. Outgoing inspection is the assignment of a final grade to the product after processing is completed, according to the requirements of the U.S. Standards for Grades of Canned Ripe Olives (Standards) [7 CFR 52.3751 to 52.3764]. The committee also recommended that handlers be allowed to size whole pitted olives by diameter after pitting, as an alternative to the current requirement that such olives be sized by weight prior to pitting. Pursuant to ยง932.52 of the order, and ยง932.152 of the current regulations, handlers are required to maintain continuous in-line outgoing inspection for the handling of processed olives. Pursuant to ยง932.53, such outgoing inspection is performed by the Processed Products Branch (PPB) of the Department. Continuous in-line outgoing inspection consists of inspection and grading services in an approved plant whereby one or more PPB inspector(s) are present at all times the plant is in operation to make in-process checks on the preparation, processing, packing, and warehousing of all products and to assure compliance with sanitary requirements. However, costs for continuous in-line outgoing inspection have increased in recent years. Thus, the PPB is prepared to develop QAP inspection procedures which will provide quality assurance certification for California olive handlers, thereby reducing handlers' inspection costs. Currently, most handlers employ their own quality-control personnel. The PPB is prepared to establish QAPs with individual handlers as provided in the ``Regulations Governing Inspection and Certification of Processed Fruits and Vegetables and Related Products'' [7 CFR 52.2]. As established, handlers will be permitted to use a QAP inspection procedure rather than the currently-mandated continuous in-line outgoing inspection. Under a QAP, the PPB provides training for the handler's quality-control personnel. The handler's quality-control personnel will be trained in the same procedures currently used by the PPB inspectors. Once the handler's quality-control personnel are trained to properly perform the same duties and responsibilities as a PPB inspector, a period of evaluation of the reliability of the handler's quality control responsibilities begins. This is the reliability evaluation period. At such time as the handler's quality-control personnel successfully complete the reliability evaluation period, a QAP will begin operation with oversight provided by the PPB. The PPB inspectors will continue to issue certificates of inspection. Certificates of inspection will be based on outgoing inspection records maintained by the handler's QAP personnel. These will be verified through spot-checks and sample regrading by PPB inspectors. A QAP will continue to assure safe, wholesome, and uniformly high-quality processed products. Under a QAP, each handler and the PPB will develop an individually written plan tailored to each handler's facility. A contract between the handler and the PPB will also be developed based upon the terms of the QAP. The contract will be signed at the beginning of the reliability evaluation. Once a handler's QAP is approved, the handler is notified in writing and the PPB begins verifying the work of the handler's QAP personnel. Such verification may include reviews of plant sanitation, quality and non-quality product analyses, procedures and/or techniques, case-stamping, checkloading, condition of container, or other types of procedures normally performed by the PPB. Inclusion of any or all of these verification procedures will be determined by the operating characteristics of each handler's facility or facilities.
