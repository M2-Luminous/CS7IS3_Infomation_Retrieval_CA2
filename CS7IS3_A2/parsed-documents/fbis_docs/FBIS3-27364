Last year the local gross domestic product and total industrial and agricultural output value reached 11.6 billion yuan (about 1.33 billion U.S. dollars) and 22.9 billion yuan, respectively, in this coastal special economic zone in south China's Guangdong Province, both doubling the figures for 1990. The city has set up a special industrial development foundation to foster new and high-tech industries, backbone enterprises and the production of quality products. In the year, it completed 92 scientific and technological promotion projects, which are expected to turn out an added output value of two billion yuan. With some 10,000 new township, foreign-funded, private and individual enterprises starting business last year, the city's total industrial output exceeded 20 billion yuan, up by 39 percent over the previous year. As an ancestral home of overseas Chinese, the city approved the setting up of 1,343 foreign-funded enterprises last year involving a total of 1.37 billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds. With nearly 40 percent of industrial products exported, the city's export volume reached 1.687 billion U.S. dollars last year. Shantou also boosted three investment areas last year, namely the Shantou Free Trade Zone, the Shantou new and high-tech industrial development zone and the Nanao Island experiment zone. The high-tech zone introduced 65 projects involving a total investment of 3.1 billion yuan. The city also put three billion yuan last year into the construction of infrastructure facilities covering airport expansion, docks, railway lines, highways and bridges, electric power, telephones and residential housing. This year the city plans to put another 5.6 billion yuan into further improving its investment environment, the mayor said.
