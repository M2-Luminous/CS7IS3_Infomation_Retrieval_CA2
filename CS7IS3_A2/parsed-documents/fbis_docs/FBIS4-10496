FBIS4-10496 "drlat071_r_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-071 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 Peru Fujimori Rejects Judicial Legislation Report Fujimori Rejects Judicial Legislation Report PY1204234094 Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 7 Apr 94 political section p 4 PY1204234094 Lima LA REPUBLICA Spanish BFN [Excerpt] President Alberto Fujimori said the United States has no moral authority to criticize Peruvian judicial legislation because injustice is also committed in that country. Regarding the report released by the commission headed by well-known jurist Robert Goldman, President Fujimori said the commission's criticisms do not match the real Peruvian situation. Fujimori said: "Injustice also is committed against ethnic minorities in the United States; therefore, that country has no moral authority to criticize us." Fujimori added that the Peruvian Government's position regarding the Goldman report is established in the letter signed by Justice Minister Fernando Vega Santa Gadea, which considers the criticisms of the Peruvian judicial system unfounded. According to the Goldman report, the Peruvian judicial system is not independent and many innocent people remain in prison due to the excesses of the antiterrorist legislation approved by the government. Fujimori also said on 6 April that the antiterrorist legislation already has been changed four times and no more changes will be made. He noted: "The antiterrorist legislation was necessary in the struggle against terrorism. It is logical to make mistakes when enforcing the law." "What I am convinced of is that we should not allow violence to take over the country," said Fujimori in ratifying his support for the antisubversive regulations. He admitted there are cases in which innocent people are accused but he said this does not mean they are the majority of those accused or arrested for terrorism. Fujimori also expressed satisfaction with the release of eight reporters accused of praising terrorism and he regretted they had to remain in prison. He blamed the judicial branch for this problem, and indicated that the branch is still slow in clearing charges against innocent people. In an effort to defend himself from criticism, Fujimori said there is a clear intention to do justice, which was shown with the reporters' release. "This shows that freedom of expression is respected here," said Fujimori to the reporters who asked him about this issue. Asked how many innocent people are still in prison, Fujimori said he did not want to talk about percentage but that there are not too many. He added: "But there are flagrant cases that should be corrected." Fujimori indicated, however, that the fact that the accused are doctors or reporters does not give them impunity if they are linked to subversive activities. He added: "There are cases in which some doctors appear committed in Shining Path military operations or in support of the People's Aid of Peru." [passage omitted]
