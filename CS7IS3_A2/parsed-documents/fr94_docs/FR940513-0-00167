FR940513-0-00167 FR940513-0-00034 Subsection (e)(1)(E) specifies that, for all covered compact fluorescent lamps, the required disclosures of light output shall be measured at a base-up position, but provides that, if the manufacturer or private labeler has reason to believe any lamp's light output at a base-down position would be more than 5% different, the label must also disclose the lamp's light output at the base-down position or, if no test data for the base-down position exist, the fact that at a base-down position the lamp's light output might be more than 5% less. Subsection (e)(1)(F) requires that for all covered compact fluorescent lamps and general service incandescent lamps, including incandescent reflector lamps, there shall be clearly and conspicuously disclosed on the principal display panel the following Advisory Disclosure statement: To save energy costs, find the bulbs with the light output you need, then choose the one with the lowest watts. Subsection (e)(1)(G) specifies that, for any covered general service incandescent lamp that operates with multiple filaments, the principal display panel shall disclose clearly and conspicuously, in the manner required by paragraph (e)(1) (A)&hyph;(C) and (F) of this section of the Rule, the lamp's energy usage in watts and light output in lumens at each of the lamp's levels of light output and the lamp's life in hours at the filament that fails first. Subsection (e)(2) states that all covered general service fluorescent lamps and incandescent reflector lamps shall be labeled clearly and conspicuously with a capital letter ``E'' printed within a circle and followed by an asterisk. The label shall also clearly and conspicuously disclose, either in close proximity to that asterisk or elsewhere on the label, the following statement: *(The encircled ``E'') means this bulb meets Federal minimum efficiency standards. If the statement is not disclosed on the principal display panel, that asterisk shall be followed by a clear and conspicuous disclosure of the following: *See (side, top, back) panel for details. Subsection (e)(2)(A), for purposes of this section of the Rule, states that on labels of general service fluorescent lamps the encircled capital letter ``E'' shall be clearly and conspicuously disclosed in color-contrasting ink and will be deemed ``conspicuous,'' in terms of size, if it appears in typeface at least as large as either the manufacturer's name or logo or another logo disclosed on the label, such as the ``UL'' or ``ETL'' logos, whichever is larger. Subsection (e)(2)(B) states that manufacturers and private labelers who would otherwise not put labels on covered general service fluorescent lamps may, instead of labeling such lamps with the encircled ``E'' and the statement described in paragraph (e)(2)(A), meet the disclosure requirement of that paragraph by permanently marking such lamps clearly and conspicuously with the encircled ``E.'' Subsection (e)(3) states that, if energy operating cost claims are made in the labeling of any covered lamp, that representation must in connection therewith clearly and conspicuously disclose the assumptions ( e.g ., purchase price, unit cost of electricity, hours of use, patterns of use) upon which they are based. Subsection (e)(4) states that all cartons in which any covered products that are general service fluorescent lamps, medium base compact fluorescent lamps, or general service incandescent lamps, including incandescent reflector lamps, are shipped within the United States or imported into the United States shall disclose clearly and conspicuously the following statement: These lamps comply with Federal energy efficiency labeling requirements. H. Section 305.13_Promotional Material Displayed or Distributed at Point of Sale This section has two subsections, the first of which requires all promotional materials for all covered products (other than fluorescent lamp ballasts, showerheads, faucets, water closets and urinals) that are displayed at the point of sale to disclose clearly and conspicuously the following statement: ``Before purchasing this appliance, read important energy cost and efficiency information available from your retailer,'' and the second of which requires all promotional materials for all covered showerheads, faucets, water closets and urinals to disclose clearly and conspicuously the product's water flow rate.
