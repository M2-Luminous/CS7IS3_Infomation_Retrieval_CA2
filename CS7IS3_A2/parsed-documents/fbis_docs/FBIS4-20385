The major problems are seen in the following areas: 1. There are conflicts between small productions and the big market: A basic condition existing in the agricultural sector at this stage is the contradiction between small productions and the big market. In 1992, we had 224.89 million peasant households nationwide. They had production, circulation, and management autonomy, but limited and constrained by transportation and information and other conditions, the small-scale production management mode of individual families and households cannot really meet the needs of a nationwide big market. Every time the wind blows and the grass rustles -- at the slightest sign of trouble -- there will be serious supply and demand problems. They often lead to all kinds of buying and selling "hardships" which obstruct circulation and in turn jeopardize and dampen the peasant production enthusiasm. 2. The "price scissors" between industrial and agricultural products have widened in recent years, and the peasant real income have been slow to increase: In 1989, the retail price index of rural industrial products rose 18.7 percent; the procurement price index of agricultural and sideline products rose 15 percent -- the price scissors between industrial and agricultural products widened by 3.2 percent in a year. Meanwhile the peasant per capita net income was 601.51 yuan, 1.6 percent lower than in the previous year. This was the first time the peasant income showed negative growth since reform began. In 1990, due to lower negotiated and market prices of grain, the agricultural and sideline product price index fell to 97.4 percent, 2.6 percentage points below the 1989 level, and during the same period, the rural industrial product price index rose 4.6 percentage points; the "price scissors" between industrial and agricultural products widened by 7.4 percent. In the same year, the peasant per capita net income was 686 yuan, and discounting the price factor, it only increased 1.8 percent over the previous year. In 1991, agricultural and sideline product procurement prices fell 2 percent compared to the previous year, but in the same period, rural industrial product prices went up 3 percent; the peasant per capita net income was 709 yuan, and discounting the price factor, income rose only 2 percent compared to the previous year. In three years, the peasant per capita net income only rose an average of 0.7 percent a year, but based on constant prices, the rural population's per capita agricultural output value was rising at an average rate of 5.4 percent per year: Agricultural output value was increasing much faster than the peasant net income. Under the Seventh Five-Year Plan, peasant per capita net income rose 9.6 percent, but in the first two years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, their income only increased 6.9 percent; the rate of increase has clearly slowed. In 1992, the peasant per capita net income was 784 yuan, and discounting the price factor, their actual income was 5.9 percent higher than in 1991. Agriculture's lack of productive momentum seriously undermines agricultural input. 3. Because of the shortage of procurement funds, the lack of storage facilities, and departmental separatism and local blockades, the circulation of agricultural products is often plagued by "hardships" the handing out of "IOUs" and other blockages in the circulation system, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. Statistics show that in the fall of 1992, the nation needed more than 90 billion yuan in grain and cotton procurement funds, and there was a 50-60 billion yuan shortfall. Many localities had no cash at the time they weighed and bought the grain and cotton and could only hand out "IOUs." According to the Ministry of Agriculture's statistics, at the peak, as much as 3.7 billion yuan's worth of "IOUs" were handed out last year for grain and cotton procurement nationwide. This seriously dampened the peasant and the masses' productive enthusiasm. 4. Too large a percentage of the main crops are put under state-set prices and centralized management, and their prices are too low: Currently, of all the agricultural products procured by the state, the prices of five types are set by the state. In some cases, the power to set prices have been handed down by the higher authorities but not at the lower levels; some prices are decontrolled in name but not in fact, and sometimes the central government has decontrolled prices but the provinces have not, or the provinces have but not the cities. The mandatory nature of those prices has not changed. Take grain prices for example. Even though 28 provinces and municipalities nationwide have partially or completely decontrolled the procurement prices; in fact, grain procurement prices must still comply with the state-set minimum protection prices and cannot really move up or down according to market supply and demand conditions. The power to set prices for cotton and tobacco is still in the state's hands, which does not mobilize the productive enthusiasm of the localities and the peasants. In addition, there is no price differential to account for the major farm products' quality difference, which does not give expression to the pricing principle of higher price for better quality and lower price for poorer quality. This does not facilitate high yield, high quality, and high efficiency in agricultural production. 5. The way the state sets prices causes the peasants to be inflexible about demanding higher prices: In recent years, in the wake of the significant increases in the price of agricultural means of production, the cost of farm production has also been rising at a rate of 10 percent a year. The peasants have become increasingly vocal in demanding the state to set higher cotton, tobacco, and other agricultural product prices. Even though the state has raised cotton prices four times since 1987, because of plant diseases and insect pests, the comparative advantage of planting cotton has steadily declined. In 1992, some localities have shown negative growth in the after-tax, per-mu net profit, and the peasant clamor for higher cotton procurement price has grown louder. Shandong and other localities have even demanded raising cotton price by 100-150 yuan per dan; otherwise cotton production will continue to slip. Although the state readjusted grain procurement prices in 1992, many peasants are still complaining that the prices of capital goods are increasing too fast and grain prices are still too low. Constrained by its financial strength, the state cannot raise agricultural procurement prices year after year, and this has exacerbated the conflict and contradiction between the state's and the peasants' interests. 6. There are big loopholes in the pricing mechanism, especially in the double-track pricing of some agricultural products. When the market price of agricultural products is higher than the state-set procurement price, not only the peasants look at the price differential as an invisible burden and are unwilling to fulfill their fixed quota procurement responsibilities but even some procurement departments and management units, acting in their own interests, will down-grade the products to lower prices and dock the peasants' pay and re-buy and resell the planned and extra-plan goods to make a profit and add to the confusion in the circulation domain. 7. Price management of most decontrolled agricultural products is in a state of confusion: By the end of 1992, after more than a decade of price reform, about 90 percent of the prices in the retail sector have been decontrolled. More than 75 percent of the agricultural products procured by the state now either follow the state's guidance prices or market-regulated prices. From the point of further reform of the agricultural pricing system in the future, the proportion of state-set prices will continue to shrink, and the share of market regulated prices will continue to grow, and eventually, all prices will be decontrolled. But in the interim, the state has not yet set up an indirect macroeconomic regulation and control mechanism to regulate market prices, and when market prices surge or plunge, it can only resort to even more administrative measures to intervene; it cannot truly give play to the economic, legal and regulatory, and other macroeconomic regulation and control measures. 8. In recent years, in the wake of bumper harvests of grain and cotton and other major crops, the conflicts between the production and sales areas are further exacerbated. In years of bumper grain harvest, the warehouses in the main production areas are filled to the brim but cannot transfer the grain out while the sales areas are not stocking grain but will transfer grain in as their stock is depleted. When cotton production is low, out of their self-interest, the production areas often ignore the state's allocation and transfer plan, forcing the mills in the sales areas to shut down as they wait for raw materials. Conversely when there is a bumper cotton harvest, the sales areas will ignore state plans to transfer cotton in a timely manner, and as a result, cotton is stockpiled in the production areas, slowing the fund turnover rate. 9. The existing grain policy does not mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm in developing agricultural production: Even though China has adopted a protective price system in grain procurement this year, judging by actual results, these prices have not really protected the peasants' rights and privileges. The scope of protection is too narrow: It is limited only to the original state contracted grain procurement and special grain reserve; other grain purchases at negotiated prices are not protected by the state. Moreover, most grain produced by the peasants still do not qualify as commodity, and under this kind of double-track grain pricing system, when there is plenty of grain, the state is unable to buy up everything, and it down grades the product to lower prices or issue "IOUs" when making purchases, so that the peasants are in effect subsidizing the purchases, and when there is a grain shortage, the state wants to "monopolize" everything, and the peasants are again short-changed. In addition, the state financial subsidies are rising sharply year after year, and even though grain sales have been made at the procurement price in the last two years, state expenditure on subsidizing the circulation of farm products has continued to rise. Both the state and the peasants are losing money. 10. The surge in the prices of means of production has seriously dampened the peasants' production enthusiasm. In 1992, the agricultural product price index rose 3.4 percent while the price of agricultural capital goods went up 3.7 percent and the cost of living for peasants rose 4.7 percent. Even though the state has set a maximum ceiling price for chemical fertilizers and other means of production this year, their prices have continued to surge. The price of state-allocated urea rose from 538 yuan a ton in 1991 to 662 yuan in 1992, a 23 percent increase. The composite price of urea rose from around 880 yuan last year to around 1,040 yuan this year, rising more than 10 percent. Locally produced small batches of carbonic ammonium tanan also rose from 300 yuan last year to 340 yuan this year. Meanwhile, the prices of grain and cotton and other farm products the peasants sell to the state have remained relatively low. The outcry that farming does not pay, that farming is a money-losing business has grown increasingly loud. 11. The market system is unhealthy: Currently, the agricultural product circulation market has a small radius; the market's role is seriously curtailed. "Hardships" take turns in plaguing the buyers and the sellers, and prices either surge or plummet. The bartering position and trading conditions for peasants have further deteriorated; the cost of exchange and the price of information have risen sharply. The price hazards are borne entirely by the state and the peasants. The only way to solve the above problems is to deepen the reform of the agricultural product pricing and circulation systems and further decontrol prices, decontrol management, and decontrol the market, so that the market mechanism truly plays a role in regulating supply and demand as well as prices. However, this does not mean that the state should wash its hands of everything; instead it should continue to strengthen the macroeconomic regulation and control, as well as management of the decontrolled farm products, and gradually set up a sound state agricultural reserve system and hazard regulation fund system and other price protection systems. Only in this way can we gradually set up a new system compatible with the socialist market economy and develop the new and necessary agricultural product pricing and circulation systems. 1. We should continue to implement a contract procurement system for key agricultural products: Currently even though grain and most agricultural product prices have been decontrolled and are regulated by the market, the thousands and hundreds of thousands of peasant households who are accustomed to the product economy are having trouble adjusting to this sudden transition from the product economy to the market economy. The state must provide guide the peasants' production management activities to help them cope with the risks and the income fluctuations brought by the market economy as soon as possible. As far as the state is concerned, it needs a relatively stable supply of commodities in order to avoid the hazards brought by market volatility. Therefore, the state both wants to and also needs to implement the contract procurement system with regard to grain and cotton and other major crops that affect the national economy and the people's livelihood. The contracts should be signed by the peasants with the state on a voluntary basis and in accordance with the principle of equal exchange and fair negotiation. The state should guarantee purchase of agricultural products under contract to further set standards for the peasants' production behavior. 2. We should continue to implement the agricultural product protection price and a host of preferential policies and measures: This year, 28 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions nationwide have partially or completely decontrolled their grain procurement prices. Because of reduced output of cotton last year, the state's cotton reserve is low and it will continue to sign contracts for fixed quota procurements. However, as three of the provinces piloting the reform of the cotton circulation system, Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu will open up their markets after fulfilling their nationwide procurement contracts. In the future, the state should continue to expand the pilot project to reform the cotton circulation system, striving to decontrol the management, the market, and the price of cotton by 1995, and it should gradually set up a new system under the state's macroeconomic regulation and control which makes market regulation the primary means of regulation, links domestic and foreign trade, and creates a highly efficient and smooth cotton circulation system. But in order to guarantee the sustained and steady development of agricultural production, the state must install supportive prices for grain and cotton and other major crops that are vital to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Each year, before the peasants begin planting, the state should announce the minimum protection price, and if the market price is higher than the minimum price, procurement should be made at market price, and if the market price is below the minimum protection price, the minimum price should prevail so as to truly protect the peasants' interests. The purchased grain and cotton should primarily be put into the state's reserve. 3. We should set up a key agricultural product price hazards fund or price regulation fund system: Setting up a major agricultural product price hazards fund or price regulation fund is one of the important measures the state can use to regulate and control price fluctuations. To impose supportive price or protection price for the major agricultural products, it is necessary to have a price hazards fund or price regulation fund as safeguard; otherwise it would be difficult to impose those prices. The funds should be financed primarily by the state, and a secondary source may be the local governments. In addition, with the elimination of price subsidies for grain and cotton and other important crops, the state can use the money earmarked for the subsidies to finance the regulation or hazard fund. 4. We should gradually set up a three-level--central, provincial, and prefectural (county)--reserve system. Nature still plays a critical part in China's agricultural production. Natural disasters and market supply and demand conditions have tremendous impact on farm output. Bumper harvests often create large stockpiles; the crops cannot be sold at the set prices, which results in lower income for the peasants, and this in turn diminishes their production enthusiasm. When crops failed, it often leads to panic buying of farm products, causing an upsurge in prices and severe ups and downs and highs and lows in farm production which have an adverse effect on agriculture's sustained, steady, and smooth development. Setting up a three-level--state, provincial, and prefectural (county)--reserve system for the major crops will play a positive role in the state's macro market regulation and control, in guiding farm production, and in stabilizing the agricultural product markets and product prices. Currently, the country already has a reserve of more than 70 billion jin of grain, more than 20 million tons of cotton, and more than 2 million tons of sugar, but they fall far short of the needs of the development of the socialist market economy. As the economy continues to gather strength, the state must further expand and increase its grain, cotton, oil, sugar, and other key agricultural product reserves in order to promote steady increase in agricultural output. Only in this way can we promptly regulate the disequilibrium in the supply and demand of grain and cotton and other key agricultural products so as to stabilize the market and curb price increases. 5. We should further strengthen the macro management and regulation and control of the decontrolled agricultural products. In the wake of the ever-deepening reform of the agricultural product pricing and circulation systems, the absolute majority of the farm products have turned to the market and are regulated by the market. Therefore, the state must further strengthen its macro management and regulation and control of the decontrolled agricultural products, further standardize their market behavior, strive to strengthen the supervision and management of the agricultural product market, and use legal means to manage and rectify market order. It should formulate and announce a guidance-oriented plan for the major crops each year and make market forecasts, and it should promptly announce the guidance-oriented prices and commodity supply-demand information each year before the peasants begin production, so that it can correctly guide the peasants' production management activities, standardize the commodities exchange activities, and advocate fair competition, and it can prevent price gouging, deceptive and predatory market practices, and monopolistic behaviors. 6. We should actively nurture and develop all sorts of country fair markets and wholesale markets for agricultural and sideline products. Agricultural production management must turn to the market and implement market regulation. Amid intense market competition, we must ascertain the changes in market demand and develop products that sell, that are of high quality, high yield, and are highly efficient, and by continuously developing the primary processing and deep processing of agricultural products, we an increase their added value and continuously raise the input-output ratio. This would require us to nurture and develop all types of agricultural product country fair and wholesale markets, and through these markets, we can guide the flow of goods, so that the products truly flow smoothly, and then we can promote agricultural development and upgrade the product-mix. 7. We should actively promote the integration of planting, breeding, and processing; commerce, industry, and agriculture; peasants, workers, and businessmen and further strengthen the socialized system of services to fully coordinate the production, supply, and marketing of agricultural products. Actively promoting the whole series of services to integrate or seriate planting, breeding, and processing; commerce, industry, and agriculture; peasants, workers, and businessman is one way to properly resolve the uncoordinated production and sales of agricultural products, the separation of town and country, and the contradiction between small productions and the big market. On the one hand, the leading enterprises and the peasants will be guaranteed their own fairly stable source of goods and marketing channels, which will greatly relieve the "hardships" in the buying and selling of agricultural and sideline products. On the other hand, by processing and changing the agricultural and sideline products and increasing their added value, the peasants can steadily increase their income. 8. We should continue to implement the policy of setting maximum ceiling prices for chemical fertilizers, diesel, and other important agricultural means of production. To maintain the sustained, stable, and smooth development in agricultural production and make sure that the peasants do benefit from growing crops, in the next few years, the state must implement the policy of setting maximum ceiling prices for chemical fertilizers, diesel, and other important agricultural means of production, so as to truly protect the peasants interests. The policy of setting maximum ceiling prices should not be limited to factory-exit prices but should extend to retail prices too. Today, a ceiling price only applies to the factory-exit price but not to the retail price, and this in fact cannot curb price increases but actually causes prices to go up. Therefore, so long as the prices of factors of production have not merged tracks with international prices, we must continue to set maximum ceiling prices for chemical fertilizers, diesel, and other important means of production. After setting maximum prices, the state should subsidize the chemical and industrial enterprises that have incurred losses as a result. 9. We should continue to perfect the two-tier contract management system that integrates centralization and decentralization and further develop coordinated services before, during, and after production. To resolve the peasants' small production management style which is based on a single household or a single family, we must further deepen the reform of the rural economic system. In particular, we should further perfect the two-tier contract management system that integrates the centralization and decentralization of agricultural products. We should continue to launch a series of coordinated services before, during, and after production, so that we can gradually attain economies of scale in agricultural production and escape or resolve the contradiction between the individual households' or families' small-farmer production and the socialist unified great market circulation. We should gradually set up a comprehensive, coordinated service system extending the entire agricultural production process, so that the peasants can adjust to the transition and changes from planned agriculture to market agriculture as soon as possible. Of course, we will fall short if we rely only on the above measures to resolve the contradictions in the agricultural product pricing and circulation realms. The state must continuously increase its investments in agricultural production, improve agricultural infrastructure and capital construction, strengthen agriculture's fundamental role, and increase agriculture's comprehensive productive capacity. Only in this way can agricultural production continue its sustained, stable, and smooth development.
