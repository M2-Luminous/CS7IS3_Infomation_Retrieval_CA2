ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is finalizing the approval of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the Federal Register on December 17, 1993 and April 7, 1994. The revisions concern rules from the following local agencies: The Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD), the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), and the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD). This approval action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised rules control VOC emissions from municipal landfills, graphic arts operations, barbecue charcoal ignition, and municipal sewage treatment plants. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of these revisions into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action is effective on November 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the rule revisions and EPA's evaluation report for each rule are available for public inspection at EPA's Region IX office during normal business hours.
