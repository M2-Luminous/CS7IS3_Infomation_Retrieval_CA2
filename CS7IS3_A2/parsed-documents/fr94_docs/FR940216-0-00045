FR940216-0-00045 FR940216-0-00010 A. Regulatory Negotiation (Reg Neg) Shortly after passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, EPA entered into a regulatory negotiation with interested parties to develop specific proposals for implementing both the reformulated gasoline and related anti-dumping programs. These parties included representatives of the oil and automobile industries, vehicle owners, state air pollution control officials, oxygenate suppliers, gasoline retailers, environmental organizations, and citizens' groups. (See the 1991 NPRM for the members of the negotiating committee and a discussion of the process for selecting them.) In August 1991 the committee reached consensus on a program outline and signed an ``Agreement in Principle'' describing that consensus. EPA agreed to propose a two-step approach to reformulated gasoline. The first step would take effect in 1995 and utilize a ``simple model'' to certify that a gasoline meets applicable emission reduction standards. The simple model allows certification based on a fuel's oxygen, benzene, heavy metal and aromatics content and Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP). Under the second step, according to the regulatory negotiation agreement, EPA would propose a ``complex model'' to supplant the simple model for certifying compliance with these standards. Certification under the complex model would take effect 4 years after it is promulgated. EPA also agreed to propose the more stringent Phase II emission performance standards. B. July 9, 1991 NPRM (56 FR 31176) The first NPRM for the reformulated gasoline program was published prior to the conclusion on the regulatory negotiations. Normally, in a negotiated rulemaking, such a reg-neg committee meets to develop a proposed rule which will be acceptable to all parties. If consensus is reached on a proposed rule, it is published as an NPRM. The committee members and the entities they represent agree to support the proposal and not to seek judicial review of the final rule if it has the same substance and effect as the consensus proposal. In this case, EPA published an NPRM while the advisory committee was still conducting negotiations. The Agency believed that although consensus of the members on an acceptable rule was possible, an NPRM was required at that time in order to meet the statutory deadline. The 1991 NPRM described the provisions of both a program to require the sale of gasoline which reduces emissions of toxics and ozone-forming volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in certain nonattainment areas and a program to prohibit the gasoline sold in the rest of the country from becoming more polluting. The 1991 notice described the outline of the reformulated gasoline program as required by statutory provisions and options that the regulatory negotiation committee members were considering. Topics included in the 1991 proposal consisted of the derivation of the emission standards, fuel certification by modeling, opt-in provisions, credits, anti-dumping requirements, and enforcement provisions for all aspects of the reformulated gasoline program. C. April 16, 1992 SNPRM (57 FR 13416) As noted above, the Agency's SNPRM (57 FR 13416) reflected the agreement reached in the regulatory negotiation that had been conducted to develop reformulated gasoline regulations under section 211(k). The Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPRM) described the standards and enforcement scheme for both reformulated and conventional gasoline. It also included specific proposals for the simple emission model to be used in gasoline certification and enforcement. D. February 26, 1993 NPRM (58 FR 11722) In their comments on the SNPRM, the ethanol industry expressed concern that the reformulated gasoline rulemaking, as proposed in the SNPRM, effectively excluded ethanol from the reformulated gasoline market. In an attempt to address their concern, the Agency proposed an ethanol incentive program, at the direction of former President Bush, intended to promote the use of ethanol (and other renewable oxygenates) in reformulated gasoline. The objective of the proposed renewable oxygenate program was to enhance the market share for renewable oxygenates while, theoretically, maintaining the overall environmental benefits of the reformulated gasoline simple model. This would be accomplished by offsetting any increase in volatility that may result from the inclusion of ethanol with volatility reductions that occur in the rest of the RFG pool. This volatility balancing, however would not take into account any increase in volatility in-use due to mixing of ethanol and non-ethanol gasoline blends (commingling). The renewable oxygenate program would not be required in class B areas (the South) unless a state requested inclusion in the program. Thus, the NPRM (58 FR 11722) for reformulated gasoline proposed revisions to the simple model, as well as to the associated anti-dumping, and enforcement provisions. Also included in the NPRM were the proposed complex model for certification of reformulated gasoline and the proposed Phase II performance standards. The complex model is now scheduled to take effect January 1, 1998. The complex model will provide a method of certification based on the fuel characteristics such as oxygen, benzene, aromatics, RVP, sulfur, olefins and the percent of fuel evaporated at 200 and 300 degrees Fahrenheit (E200 and E300, respectively). The NPRM also proposed Phase II standards for reformulated gasoline which are to take effect in the year 2000, as prescribed by section 211(k)(3) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The proposed VOC performance standard was 20&hyph;32 percent for class B and 26&hyph;35 percent for class C. EPA proposed to set the toxic standard at 20 or 25 percent reduction since additional toxics control was not found to be cost effective and, in most cases, these greater toxics reductions were expected to occur through fuel reformulation for VOC control. The NPRM also included proposed NO x performance standards of 0&hyph;16 percent in classes B and C. The proposed NO x standards greater than zero were not required by the CAAA, but were proposed under the authority of section 211(c)(1) in conjunction with the Phase II reformulated gasoline standards of the Act since additional NO x control was deemed beneficial and cost effective in reducing ambient ozone levels. E. Discussion of Major Comments and Issues EPA received a number of comments on the first NPRM (56 FR 31176), the SNPRM (57 FR 13416), and the latest NPRM (58 FR 11722) for reformulated and conventional gasoline. Comments covered a wide range of topics including regulatory procedure, certification standards, modeling emissions by the simple and complex models, the role of ethanol and other oxygenates in reformulated gasoline, vehicle testing, the anti-dumping program, Phase II standards, cost-effectiveness, and a number of enforcement-related issues. EPA has conducted an analysis of the comments received and duly considered the significant issues. Summaries of these comments and EPA's responses to them are contained in the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis and the Summary and Analysis of Comments which has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking (Public Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;12). Since the publication of the NPRM, the Agency has continued to develop the complex model. The first revisions of the complex emissions model since 1993 NPRM publication for reformulated gasoline have been provided to the public at a June 2, 1993 public workshop. EPA developed several complex model options in July which was provided to the public. In October of 1993, a draft version of the final complex model was released for public inspection as well. All the iterations of the complex model since the publication of the 1993 NPRM have been available to the public via a public electronic bulletin board and in submittals to the EPA Air Docket, Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;12. All the various components of this rulemaking are being finalized in today's notice. The additional time has allowed adequate public review of the complex model and its implications for the reformulated gasoline Phase II standards.

Treatment of Ethanol A. Background The April 16, 1992 proposal of the Simple Model and Phase I standards was designed to be fuel and oxygenate neutral. Ethanol, however, when added to gasoline in the amount needed to satisfy the oxygen content requirement of the Act raises the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) of the resulting blend by about 1 psi, making it more difficult for ethanol blends to meet the mass VOC performance standards than blends using other oxygenates. For ethanol to be blended with the RFG, a blendstock gasoline with an RVP low enough to offset the increase resulting from adding ethanol would have to be obtained. Ethanol industry representatives commented that obtaining such blendstocks would be both difficult and expensive, because ``sub-RVP'' blendstocks would be more costly to refine and because blendstock production would be controlled by petroleum refiners. Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), an oxygenate which does not boost a fuel's RVP, which is derived from methanol gas and the petroleum product isobutylene and whose blends can readily be put through petroleum pipelines, was thought to be the oxygenate of choice for most refiners. Ethanol's representatives theorized that the oil industry would have a desire to use MTBE over ethanol and, thus, little incentive to make the sub-RVP blendstock necessary for ethanol blending. The ethanol industry contended that a reformulated gasoline program which they argued would effectively preclude ethanol was contrary to Congress' intent that ethanol have a role in the program. They argued that the oxygen content requirement of section 211(k)(2) was motivated in large part by a desire to expand markets for ethanol. They noted the strong support afforded the RFG legislative initiative by members of Congress from agricultural states. They also cited statements in the legislative history indicating some members' expectation that the RFG program would provide an increasing market for ethanol. Ethanol representatives contended that the benefits of ethanol use justify its inclusion in the RFG program. Specifically, they explained that ethanol is currently made in the United States from domestically-grown grains, primarily corn, and thus represents an important domestic and renewable source of energy. They further explained that to the extent ethanol is used in place of imported petroleum products, it promotes the nation's energy independence and improves its balance of trade, and that ethanol use also strengthens the market for corn, consequently reducing the need for price supports. Moreover, as a biomass-based product, ethanol is potentially a renewable fuel to the extent the energy derived exceeds any fossil fuel energy consumed in producing the ethanol.
