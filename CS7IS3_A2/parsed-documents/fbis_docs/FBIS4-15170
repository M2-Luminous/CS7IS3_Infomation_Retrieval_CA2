The "moderates" and "Radicals" from Tataria's biggest national organization now sit separately while it is still not clear which of them after all has the more right to be called the PTPC. Judging from the moods in the plenum, the positions of former comrades-in-arms have again begun to converge on the basis of an extremely negative attitude to the treaty between Russia and Tataria signed in February. Even the "moderate" PTPC has altered its critical stance, to one of direct confrontation with the republic's leadership. The plenum expressed a vote of no confidence in the republic's leadership, which "has betrayed the Tatar people's interests," and stated that the PTPC demands early elections for president, Supreme Soviet, and heads of administrations. In the opinion of local observers, the Tatar national-patriots now have a chance to have a new leader capable of uniting the different trends. Rafael Khakimov, adviser to the Republic of Tatarstan president and a former PTPC ideologist, may become one such leader. The address at the plenum made it clear that he, too, has come to oppose the leadership and is likely to hand in his resignation soon. Should Mr. Khakimov really come to lead the national movement, the other leaders would have only a union to support because there now exist no differences between them save personal ones.
