During the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], the comrades in charge of various ministries and commissions under the State Council have successively held discussions with deputies from Tibet, Xinjiang, the Inner Mongolia, Guangxi and Ningxia Autonomous Regions; seriously listened to their comments and suggestions; and discussed with them how to accelerate development in the ethnic minority regions. Several State Council officials have separately visited the Tibet delegation and sought the deputies' opinions. They included Chi Haotian, state councillor and minister of national defense; Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation; Liu Bin, vice minister of the State Education Commission; and Song Defu, minister of personnel. During the discussion, Chi Haotian briefed the deputies on the situation of unity among nationalities, the army- people unity, and efforts to strengthen border defense, and discussed other questions which are of interest to the deputies. Wu Yi pledged to support Tibet's foreign trade and economic cooperation and to help Tibet overcome difficulties in work. Liu Bin and Song Defu answered the deputies' questions regarding compulsory education, educational institutions, and teachers' wages, and put forward solutions to some problems. The deputies said: The visits to the Tibet delegation by the department heads of the State Council show the attention and support given by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to the work of Tibet. The departments concerned under the State Council have been very considerate of Tibet in many things. For instance, Tibet recently submitted to the State Education Commission an educational plan which overlooked vocational education expenditures, the State Education Commission on its own initiative added the vocational education funding in its educational appropriation. Those who successively visited the Xinjiang delegation included Ismail Amat, state councillor and minister of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission; Han Zhubin, minister of railways; and Xiang Huaicheng, vice minister of finance. The deputies of various nationalities fully affirmed the achievements made by the railroads in recent years in transport and railroad construction and put forward suggestions on acceleration of railroad construction and the promotion of economic development in Xinjiang. Han Zhubin pledged to support Xinjiang's economic development by accelerating railroad construction there, and particularly by ensuring the transport of cotton, chemical fertilizer, and other capital goods. Yang Changji, executive vice minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, and others have visited the Inner Mongolia delegation to seek the deputies' opinions. They answered the deputies' questions regarding the change of operational mechanisms at large and medium state-owned enterprises, debt chains, and reform of the foreign trade system. Three deputies from the Inner Mongolia delegation who asked some questions in their letters to Minister of Personnel Song Defu will receive detailed answers from him soon. The comrades in charge of the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate answered Inner Mongolian deputies' questions on public order, anticorruption measures, and the strengthening of the public security and judicial forces. The comrades in charge of the State Planning Committee, the Ministry of Finance, the State Education Commission, the People's Bank of China, the Ministry of Public Security, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate attended the small group discussions of the Guangxi delegation. They listened to the deputies' views and suggestions on the education, finance, taxation, and comprehensive efforts to improve public order in ethnic minority regions. When Ningxia deputies were examining and discussing the government work report and the reports on national plans and finance, they were joined successively by Minister of Justice Xiao Yang, Vice Minister of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission Tudao Doje, and Vice Minister of the State Planning Commission Luo Zhiling. The deputies pointed out that since 1982 great achievements have been made in the special help-the-poor project in Gansu's Dingxi, Hexi corrider, and Ningxia's Xihaigu region. In Ningxia's Guyuan Prefecture, the basic needs of 80 percent of the population in food and clothing have been met. However, 240,000 people there remain in poverty and difficulty. The deputies suggested that the state improve infrastructure, such as transport and energy sources, and solve the people's food and clothing problems in a planned way in ethnic minority regions, and that state organs provide support relevant to their functions to poor regions. Xiao Yang, Tudao Doje, and Luo Zhiling pledged to convey the deputies' views to the relevant State Council departments, carry out the help-the-poor plan effectively, and help narrow the gap between the ethnic minority regions in western China and the country's eastern part.
