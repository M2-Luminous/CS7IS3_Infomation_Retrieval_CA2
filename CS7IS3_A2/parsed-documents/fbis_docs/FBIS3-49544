Are there any concerns about developments there? [Zieleniec] Of course there exist concerns about developments in Russia or, to be precise, in the entire territory of the former USSR, and not only in our region. They are shared with us by all of Europe, indeed by the entire world. Let us realize that it is a power armed with a nuclear arsenal, a state in which new democratic arrangements are being introduced only with difficulties. There are no democratic traditions in Russia. Traditions are very important phenomena. Russia is struggling against tremendous internal problems, the problems of the minorities within the country, and the large number of Russian minorities outside its territory. This country has experienced 70 years of communism, and we, who lived under it for 40 years, know what a tremendous burden it is, how difficult it is to implement reforms, from economic to legal ones. For a long time to come, developments in Russia will continue to be a source of uncertainty on the one hand, and a subject of interest and desire for stabilization on the other--not only to us but to the entire world. [Zak] To what degree can Russia's taking exception to NATO's eastward expansion affect the decisionmaking of the West on this matter? [Zieleniec] We should consider these matters with some restraint because of the present postelectoral situation in Russia. Regarding the alliance associations of the Czech Republic, we should clearly define our goal and go directly after it. After all, it is not possible to indefinitely prolong a situation where countries that have always been part of European history--such as our republic--are to live on the side of the, albeit collapsed but still existent, curtain drawn by Stalin. Therefore, I believe that our integration into the family of West European countries, including institutional integration--that is, also into NATO--is unavoidable. In the long term, any endeavors to derive a solution for European stability solely from developments in Russia will prove wrong. Developments in Russia will certainly be very complex and dynamic, and our integration is a matter so incontestable that it has to happen sooner or later--including membership in the relevant organizations. [Zak] Would it not be more pragmatic in this situation to coordinate our efforts with those of Poland, Hungary, and, possibly, Slovakia? [Zieleniec] I believe that this is the case. We have identical interests and say similar things. It is a matter of course. [Zak] You mentioned the postelectoral situation in Russia. Do you believe that the "shriek" of the Russian side regarding the expansion of NATO eastward has something precisely to do with the internal political situation, or do the external power interests of Russia still exist? Is there danger of this situation coming to a head--that is, that we would play "second fiddle" in talks that will take place mostly between NATO and Russia--that is, "about us without us?" [Zieleniec] Russia undoubtedly has its interests and articulates them. The West must have its interests, too, and, just the same, we have ours. I believe that, from this point of view, the space in which we are located together with Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary should be outside Russia's sphere of operations--and clearly within the West's sphere of influence. It is apparent that there are attempts to cooperate with Russia and that they are appropriate. There is no point, and it would not be in anyone's interest, in starting new hostilities, when they are not necessary. This does not necessarily imply anything about the future shape of West Europe or its institutional umbrella. The attempts on the part of NATO to get along with Russia certainly do not banish us from Europe. [Zak] What is the concept of our foreign policy eastward with respect to the present situation in Russia? [Zieleniec] Developments in Russia following the elections remain for us a great unknown. Nevertheless, our policy from this vantage point is clear. The territory of the former USSR, and Russia in particular, is for us a country of traditional contacts and business interests, and we are trying to be very active in this type of cooperation. On the other hand, we always emphasize that these relations must be based on equality, and our political orientation, our orientation in terms of future integration, is tied to the fate of West Europe. Nevertheless, I would like to point out that general laws of geometry cannot be applied in politics: If you turn to face someone, it does not mean that you are turning your back on someone else. It simply is not so. [Zak] Could you comment on the statements by some Russian politicians that, if a NATO expansion eastward occurs, we will automatically become the target of Russian nuclear weapons? [Zieleniec] Nowadays, nuclear arms are pointed at all kinds of targets; it is simply two sides of the same coin. If, however, we want to participate in the protection of the values of democracy, individual freedom, and a prosperous market economy, we have to expect that someone will not like it. Nevertheless, I do not see any reason why a willingness to protect these values evokes in Russia contemplation about arms. [Zak] What about the statements by Yeltsin and Kozyrev about the isolation of Russia and concerns of the so-called ordinary Russian citizens about the possible expansion of NATO? Do you not feel as if this originated in the vocabulary of the old-time communist ideologists? [Zieleniec] I do not know. Russia has always thought very geopolitically. The problem of isolation is well known in Russia because it has been discussed there probably throughout the entire existence of that country. Developments in Russia have always coincided with the clash of two trends--a pro-Western one and a national one leading to closing oneself. There is nothing left but to wish for ourselves and Russia that democracy prevails and that cooperation among all of the countries of Europe, including Russia, be as close as possible. [Zak] Let us look even more closely toward our borders--at Ukraine. Although it has ratified the START 1 Treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear arms, the overall outcome is rather awkward. Is there also a threat from the Ukrainian side? [Zieleniec] No. Ukraine's problems are more or less eastern-oriented. They are the problems of a new state that has emerged from the womb of the USSR. I believe that this has more to do with the general nonproliferation of nuclear arms than a real threat to our region.
