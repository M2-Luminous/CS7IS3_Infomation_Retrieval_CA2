FBIS4-4963 "dreas066_c_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-066 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 North Korea CPRF Statement Denounces Patriot Deployment CPRF Statement Denounces Patriot Deployment SK0604001494 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2206 GMT 5 Apr 94 SK0604001494 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2206 GMT 5 Apr 94 Korean BFN [Text] A spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] issued a statement on the grave situation that has arrived [toraehada] on the Korean peninsula in which a nuclear war may break out due to the reckless [mubunbyolhan] war provocation moves of the United States and the South Korean puppet clique. The statement issued by the CPRF spokesman: Due to the reckless war provocation moves of the United States and the South Korean puppet clique, an extremely grave [kukhi omjunghan] situation has arrived on the Korean peninsula in which a nuclear war may break out. As is well-known, the United States unilaterally reneged on its agreement to hold the third stage of DPRK-U.S. talks and is stepping up arms pressure on us. On 29 March, the U.S. Defense Department deployed 48 launching pads for Patriot missiles and a missile unit of some 400 personnel to South Korea from Texas. In addition, saying that it will resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise, which was agreed to be suspended, the United States ordered Carl Vinson, an atomic aircraft carrier, to depart a naval base in Yokoska and to deploy near the Korean peninsula; and maintained a U.S. naval fleet of 30 ships, including two task forces of aircraft carriers, in advance areas of our waters so they can reach our area within 24 hours. The South Korean authorities ruptured the working delegates' contact for the exchange of special envoys, which was arranged with much effort, and officially asked the United States to introduce Patriot missiles, which the whole world rebuffed. Worse still, it is openly instigating a war by disclosing a new Northward invasion plan called the New Operation Plan 5027, which was secret until now. The CPRF brands aggressive arms buildup and war provocation moves of the U.S. and South Korean bellicose quarters as a heinous criminal act to disturb the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and Asia and plunge the Korean nation into a new nuclear war holocaust, and strongly denounces this. The U.S. and South Korean bellicose quarters rave that the Patriot missiles are so-called preventive weapons and so forth in an attempt to hide their aggressive intent and to justify the maneuvers for its arrangement. This is nothing but a foolish scheme. Modern war is three-dimensional -- staged in the sky, on the ground, and in the sea -- attack and defense are not separated. Patriot missiles are ultra-modern weapons that can also be used for an attack. Considering the fact that the Patriot missiles can easily strike any target or object on the Korean peninsula, which is not that big, it is needless to say that its deployment is dangerous. Today, the United States is openly bringing nuclear weapons into South Korea and scheming to continue nuclear war exercises. This indicates that it seek solutions to the issue not through negotiation but through strength, unilaterally reneging on its promise to refrain from threatening the DPRK with nuclear weapons, which was stipulated in the DPRK-U.S. joint statement. Also, the U.S. imperialists are massively bringing modern warfare equipment into South Korea. This is a very ill-boding [simsangchianun] military move that can only be seen on the night before a war. What should not be overlooked is that the South Korean ruling bunch is coming out as a shock brigade for an anti-republic hostile policy of outside forces to crush fellow countrymen. The South Korean puppets' frenzied maneuvers to crush fellow countrymen by continually bringing in U.S. nuclear weapons and by depending on strength of outside forces are antinational crimes that can be perpetrated only by the flunkeyist nation-selling traitors [sadae maeguk yokchokdul] who do not have even a slight degree of a sense of national independence. Their maneuvers are an intolerable traitorous act that unilaterally destroyed the North-South denuclearization declaration on the agreement not to produce, not to introduce, and not to possess nuclear weapons -- which reduced the declaration to wastepaper. Today DPRK-U.S. talks, which can resolve a series of problems including the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through negotiations, were ruptured [kyollyol] and the nation's situation has been strained to an extreme pitch. This is because of flunkeyist nation-selling maneuvers of such crooked politicians as the traitor Kim Yong-sam who has no independent idea [chugyon] and philosophy for the nation. The modern history of our nation illustrates that when the flunkeyists without the spirit for national independence grasp power of the nation and abuse it, the nation was reduced to an arena of competition by outside forces, and the people could not avoid the situation of homeless, ruined people. The U.S. imperialists ignited the war of aggression in Korea in the early 1950's and brought their 15 follower nations, and as the result of this, the lands of our fatherland were infringed upon by outside aggressor forces and our people were enforced to suffer miserable war disasters. This was attributed to flunkeyist nation-selling acts committed by such a pro-U.S. flunkeyist nation-seller as Syngman Rhee in South Korea. The traitor Kim Yong-sam, the most vicious outside force-reliant flunkeyist nation-seller of all successive ruling bunches in South Korea, has no real power nor ability. Nevertheless, he continually and wildly ran amok in an attempt to interfere in negotiations between us and the United States, thus laying obstacles to DPRK-U.S. talks. The Kim Yong-sam group ruptured the working-level contact by putting forward the exchange of North-South special envoys as a precondition for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. It is no secret that this proceeded from insidious political aims to apply the brakes on DPRK-U.S. talks. Therefore, to ease the strained situation prevailing in our country and to seek a precise method for a solution to problems, the U.S. hostile policy against the DPRK must be altered and such flunkeyist nation-sellers like traitor Kim Yong-sam must be removed from power in South Korea, and the democratic reunification forces--independent forces of the nation--who treasure sovereignty of our fellow countrymen should grasp power. People from all walks of life in South Korea should oppose and reject the nuclear war policy and arms buildup maneuvers of the United States and the South Korean bellicose elements, including deployment of Patriot missiles, and should more fiercely raise the flames of anti-U.S., antiwar, antinuclear, and anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle. The United States and the South Korean puppets cannot frighten our people, who are firmly rallied behind the party and the leader with single-hearted unity, with any military threat, nor can they crush popular mass-centered socialism of our own style. They should correctly realize this and should not run recklessly. If the bellicose quarters in the United States and South Korea bring Patriot missiles to South Korea and advance along the road of war at last in defiance of strong opposition and rejection of the people at home and abroad, they will have to pay dearly for this.
