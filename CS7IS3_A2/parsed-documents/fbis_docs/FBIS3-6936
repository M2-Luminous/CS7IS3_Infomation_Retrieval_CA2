Our party is leading the socialist cause down an ever-victorious road without the slightest degree of faltering despite all kinds of difficulties and barriers. In the course of this struggle our party is demonstrating its pride as a party of impregnable fortress. The party of impregnable fortress! This is the symbol of our party's greatness and invincibility. Our party is a mighty party, the ideology of which is great and the faith and will of which are incomparably strong and which is single-heartedly united. There is no such great party in the world. Today our people are filled with the great dignity and honor of having the party of impregnable fortress led by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. They are burning with the firm faith and determination to fight more staunchly along the banner of the party. 1. Our Party Is a Party With Great Ideology The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: The chuche, which is our party's world view, is a guiding ideology of our times that elucidates the most correct way for the realization of the independence of the popular masses. The working class party is the general staff of the revolution and the guiding organization of socialist, communist construction. For the party to become the strong and mighty party that leads the socialist cause to victory, its ideology should be great. The party's guiding ideology is the fundamental idea [kibon inyom] that elucidates the purpose of the party's struggle and the principles and methods for its realization. The guiding ideology determines the party's character and regulates the basic direction of party building and party activities. The party of the working class cannot only implant faith in the correctness and victory of its cause among party members and the people, but also achieve its ideological and volitional unity and cohesion and lead to victory the revolution and construction with correct strategies and tactics only when it has the great guiding ideology. For the party of the working class to have a correct guiding ideology is a serious problem that is closely related to the destiny of the party, that is, the destiny of socialism. The socialist ruling party collapsed in some countries in recent years. This was because they did not have a correct guiding ideology. When one fails to carry out activities independently with one's own guiding ideology and fails to develop creatively one's own guiding ideology in conformity with the aspirations of the times and people, one will inevitably encounter bitter failure and vicissitudes in party building, which will eventually result in creating a grave consequence of making a mess of the party itself. Historic lessons have shown that when the party of the working class lacks a great ideology it is destined to become an enervated party like a club and cannot defend socialism from the maneuvers by the imperialists and the betrayers of the revolution. Today our party has become a party of impregnable fortress because it has the great revolutionary ideology. Our party's only guiding ideology is the immortal chuche idea, that is, the ideology that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has developed and completed. The correctness and vitality of the revolutionary ideology lie in how correctly the ideology reflects the independent demands and interests of the popular masses and how scientifically it has elucidated the way for their realization. The dear comrade leader has developed and completed the chuche idea based on his scientific, deep insight into the demands of our times and the aspirations of the people. Our party's ideology and theory are the ever-victorious banner that leads the struggle for the popular masses' independence to victory and are also the revolutionary strategies and tactics that make it possible to defeat imperialism and to consummate the socialist cause, the cause of mankind's independence. Our party has become the great and invincible revolutionary party that has not been shaken under any difficult circumstances because it has the great ideology and theory that are grouped with the respected name of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. The might of our party that has the great ideology is boundless. That our party has been able to pioneer a most correct road in building the revolutionary party of the era of independence and to defend the banner of the revolution without the slightest trepidation, even when others were encountering difficulties and vicissitudes, is precisely because it carries out party building and party activities, taking the great ideology and theory as its guiding principle. When we carry out party building and activities with the great ideology, we can be constantly strengthened and develop the party into an invincible, revolutionary party and can brilliantly implement the socialist cause. This is a valuable truth proven by our revolutionary practices. Our party is, above all, thoroughly adhering to its revolutionary character as a chuche-type party because it has the great ideology. How the party adheres to its revolutionary character is an important question that is related to its prospects. Missions, strategies, tactics, and the fighting way of the party can change in the course of progress of the revolution, but its revolutionary character cannot change. Changes in the party's character cause a loss of the party's face [tangui myonmoui sangsil] and result in a tragedy of its degeneration into a strange party. The strength of the party is demonstrated in the way of thoroughly adhering to its revolutionary character. The party's guiding ideology is essential in adhering to its revolutionary character. If its guiding ideology is great, the party will not flutter no matter how the imperialists and reactionaries maneuver to degenerate the party and can be constantly consolidated and developed along its own way. Today, our party can thoroughly adhere to its chuche-oriented character under any circumstances just because of its great ideology. No matter how environments and conditions for the revolution change, the party's revolutionary character created by the leader [suryong] should thoroughly be adhered to. This is a firm position that the dear comrade leader sticks to in the party building. Based on this position, the dear comrade leader presented the party building program on modelling the entire party after the chuche idea and has wisely led the struggle to realize it. In those days, the dear comrade leader generally systemized and completed the ideology and theory on the chuche-oriented party building and accumulated immortal achievements and valuable experience in party building. His achievements comprehend all theoretical and practical problems in building the revolutionary party -- including the question on party building and its activities with the chuche idea as a guiding principle, the policies of building the party as a party for the working popular masses, of firmly guaranteeing the unitary ideology and leadership in the party, of considering the party's unity a primary task in party building, and of preparing the party based on the ideology, as well as the question on imbuing the society with a single ideology and firmly realizing the political leadership for the entire society. Thanks to the ideology for chuche-oriented party building elucidated by the dear comrade leader, our party is proceeding with the party building and its activities without the slightest deviation or vicissitude and is firmly adhering to its revolutionary character. Our party is arming party cadres and members with the chuche idea and preparing them to become chuche-type communist revolutionaries who actively struggle to realize the chuche idea. At the same time, our party is firmly adhering to the purity of the chuche idea and is uncompromisingly fighting against all old ideologies that contradict it, such as bourgeois and revisionist ideologies, so that it can prevent any strange ideology from penetrating our party. Because it has the great ideology, our party has hardened its organizational and ideological basis and has consolidated and strengthened the single-hearted unity of the entire party. No matter how far the revolution advances, and no matter how vicious the imperialists and reactionaries maneuver, our party will continue its blood line unblemished and will shine forever as a chuche-type revolutionary party. With the great ideology as a guiding principle, our party is also brilliantly developing the future of socialism, overcoming any trial and obstacle. The road toward socialism is an untrodden road to be developed totally anew as well as a road of severe struggle, along which we should advance in an acute confrontation with the imperialists. Therefore, it is matter of course that there are obstacles and trials in the course of advance toward socialism and that unexpected incidents may occur. In order to stoutly push ahead with the struggle to complete socialism without the slightest vicissitude, the party must have scientific ideology and correct strategies and tactics. The party with the great ideology never pulls down the socialist banner until it accomplishes its historic mission and advances even more stoutly, filled with faith and optimism. Our party has the great socialist, communist building ideology and theory that enable it to victoriously lead the revolution and construction according to the demand of reality. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il presaged the inevitability [happopchiksong] of socialist construction and the people's desire with his extraordinary wisdom and scientific insight a long time ago, and has brilliantly completed the ideology and theory for chuche-oriented socialist, communist construction. Our party's ideology and theory are a great communist theory on occupying the ideological and material fortresses of socialism by remolding the nature, the society, and human beings in accordance with the chuche demand, under the banner of modelling the entire society after the chuche idea. It is also an encyclopedic theory, with which we can brilliantly solve all problems arising in the course of the revolution and construction. Because it is leading the revolution and construction with this great ideology and theory as its guiding principle, our party is brilliantly developing the future of socialism without the slightest deviation or vicissitude. Without fluttering even when others were loudly talking that they would reform and reorganize socialism [namduri sahoejuuirul kaehyokhago kaepyonhandago ttodurodael ttaeedo], our party has been able to further strengthen its leadership and advance toward socialism with confidence, adhering to the Taean work system and the rural theses, just because it considers the great ideology and theory its guiding principle. This is the basic factor that has enabled our party to protect and defend socialism of our own style and to accelerate the revolution and construction. The wise leadership of our party, which is pioneering the course of socialism with the great ideology, was clearly demonstrated when the grave incident of frustration of socialism occurred in some countries. When imperialists and reactionaries talked as if socialism had come to an end and when people who desire socialism lost their faith, our party scientifically elucidated the way to correctly explain the substance of the incident and to rebuild the socialist movement. This is a great historic contribution that can be made only by a party with its own great guiding ideology. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's works -- such as "Historic Lessons of Socialist Construction and Our Party's General Line," "On Fundamental Questions on Revolutionary Party Building," and "Disturbance of Socialism Cannot Be Allowed" -- vigorously demonstrate the greatness and justness of our party's ideology and theory that advance the socialist cause victoriously. Not only our people but also the revolutionary people of the world firmly believe that, when they adhere to the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideology and theory, they can sternly smash all antisocialist maneuvers by imperialists and reactionaries and can achieve the ultimate victory of the socialist cause. Since it has the great ideology, our party is displaying its high esteem and honor as a great guide [hyangdoja] that pioneers the socialist cause at the forefront through severe trials in history. 2. Our Party Is a Party With Peerlessly Strong Faith and Will The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il noted: Our party has never given in its faith and will under any offensive by the enemy. It has advanced through severe trials with such faith and will. The party cause is a difficult and complicated struggle through manifold trials and hardships. In order for the party to fulfill its sublime mission, it must have not only the great ideology but also faith and will with which to realize it to the end. The invincible faith that would rather break than bend! The invincible will with which the party never recedes from the road of revolution even if the world overturns tens of hundreds of times! The principle that the party never pulls down the revolutionary banner until it achieves the ultimate victory of the revolution! These are uncommon traits of the party that are carrying out the revolution. When the entire party is filled with such invincible faith and will, the party can demonstrate itself as an impregnable party. A party with firm faith and will that is unswayable in any trend of the time will never be destroyed or degenerated by any offensive by the enemy. Just like the people's revolutionary spirit is determined by the depth of their faith, the party's might and solidity are guaranteed by the resoluteness of its revolutionary faith. Faith and determination that the party keeps in leading the revolution are decisive factors that influence the destinies of the country and the nation. The long history of the communist movement has many actual examples showing that the revolution was frustrated and people fell into misery because of unstable determination. The faith of the working class party and its leader [yongdoja], which are responsible for the destinies of the country and the nation, did not become unstable. Inconsistent faith and weak will can never be allowed on the arduous road of struggle, on which even a single misstep may cause one to fall into subordination, servitude, frustration, and failure. The party's faith is the destiny and future of the revolution. Only a party with stout faith and will can overcome severe difficulties in the revolution and can lead the people to the heroic struggle and feats. Because it has iron-firm faith and will, our party wins honor as an impregnable party and as an ever-victorious party that never loses. All our party's activities and struggle are run through with the firm determination to advance along the single chuche road pioneered by the great leader [suryong] and with the perfect faith and will to lead the people to consummate the socialist cause. This determination and will have their roots in the Paektu revolutionary spirit created in an early stage of pioneering the revolution, and they have been firmly hardened through the severe class struggle and the huge struggle for creation and construction. Therefore, our party's faith and will are not shaken even in the fierce political, military, and ideological confrontation with the enemy, and have become stouter as generations are shifted and as the revolution advances further. Herein is the reason the people of the world call the Worker's Party of Korea [WPK] an iron party. As it has invincible faith and will, our party has become the great party that changes an adverse situation into a favorable one by bravely smashing any antisocialist maneuver by the imperialists. The confrontation with the enemy is the confrontation of strength and of faith and will. Only with faith and courage to free oneself from being afraid of any threat, blackmail, and powerful enemy, one can win a victory without fail. This is why we call the victory of the revolution the victory of faith and will. Today, imperialists are taking an unprecedented offensive in all areas -- political, military, and economic -- to isolate and ruin [malsal] our Republic, the fortress of socialism. Today, when socialism has been frustrated in some countries, the world reactionaries' antisocialist maneuvers aim at us. Although our party is leading the revolution in this acute political and military confrontation, it has never fumbled or fluttered under the enemy's antirevolutionary offensive. The more the imperialists highhandedly put pressure on it, our party copes with it with the spirit of untiring patience and smashes an antirevolutionary offensive with a revolutionary offensive. This is the stout trait of the WPK under the leadership of General Kim Chong-il, an iron-willed, sagacious general. Any threat with nuclear weapons or slandering agitation can never work with our party and people. It is no accident that the conscientious people of the world, who can look straight at the reality, warn imperialists to be well aware what rival [sangdae] they are facing. Since it has invincible, firm faith, and will, our party is always strong and stern in the confrontation with the imperialists. When the enemy created a dangerous situation on the brink of war, our party responded to it with the great decision by announcing the semi-war state in the entire country, all the people, and the entire Army. When the enemy maneuvered to demolish [wahae] us with crafty pacification strategy, our party smashed it with bold and clever tactics, taking the initiative. Today, our people are accelerating the socialist construction with the fighting spirit to annihilate the aggressors, who try to harm our socialism, while singing the song of faith that one can win victory when one keeps socialism, and one will die when one abandons it. This is because they have the same invincible faith and offensive spirit [konggyok chongsin] as that of our party. As long as our people's struggle is under the leadership of our party, which has the stoutest faith and will, its history will shine as an ever-victorious history of struggle of changing an adverse situation into a favorable one and of turning misfortune into a blessing. Because of its firm revolutionary faith and will, our party is demonstrating its mighty appearance as a most revolutionary party that never retreats even a step from the principle of the revolution. The process in which socialism is victorious is the process in which the principle of the revolution is defended and embodied. In the revolutionary struggle, the principle of the revolution is always precious as life--yesterday, today, and in the future, too. In the struggle to determine socialism or capitalism standing back from the principle of the revolution itself is synonymous with surrender. How to deal with the principle of the revolution and how to defend it is precisely an important touchstone which shows the firmness of the faith of the working class party and its combat capability and might. The character of our party's resolute revolutionary principle has already been known to the world. Even in the early period when modern revisionism emerged, our party repelled any pressure from big countries and firmly defended its chuche-oriented revolutionary line. Even in the period when the trend of modern socialist democracy emerged, our party never stood back from the principle of the revolution. The principle is victorious without fail, and even though the circumstances and conditions of the revolutionary struggle may vary, the basic ideal and demands of socialism can never change. This is precisely the revolutionary position to which our party has firmly adhered. It is easy to speak about faithfulness to the principle of the revolution, but it is not easy to put it into practice. This is more true today, at a time when the wind of antisocialism is sweeping. However, our party has firmly and invariably adhered to the basic principles of socialism, including the principle of realizing the party's unitary leadership in the revolution and construction, cherishing firm will. To be faithful to the principles of socialism, it is imperative to have firm faith, and to render this firm faith absolutely and invariably. This is precisely the noble truth that has been proven by the struggle history of our party. Because of its firm faith and will our party has also become an invincible revolutionary party that is capable of fulfilling without fail any vast tasks arising in socialist construction. The might of the working class party lies in the power of the practice of changing the socialist ideal into a great reality. The party that fails to carry out the struggle task once it has promised the people, cannot enjoy support from the people or maintain dignity. The history of our party's struggle is a history of stubbornness and a history of heroic exploits, as -- upon setting a bold attacking target -- it has occupied that target and has been constantly occupying a new attacking position in succession. The power of will that our party displayed on these days was beyond our imagination. Once our party decides to carry out a task, it fulfills it without fail. This is our party's disposition. Once our party has started to carry out a task it pushes ahead with it until it is finished. This is our party's (?habit). Smashing the maneuvers of the enemies of the revolution with rock-firm will if they provoke and breaking through the mountains with indomitable spirit of attack if they block is precisely the inherent struggle spirit of our party. The huge locomotive of the Korean revolution that is dashing toward the terminal of communism has been running to today's plane on the strength of this faith and will of our party. Our party is faced with the heavy but honorable task to cultivate political and economic strength capable of living independently under any difficult circumstances and to fully enhance the superiority of socialism of our own style. Each of the struggle tasks that our party carried out in the past were not easy. However, today's revolutionary tasks of our party are more vast and difficult. Despite such a situation, our party's determination and will to turn our Republic into a firm fortress of socialism by thoroughly embodying the revolutionary economic strategy and by firmly deepening the country's national defense capability are firm and invariable. Our party's matchless courage and its strong power of decision and rock-firm will have constantly bestowed faith and courage in the victory of the revolution upon our people. Whenever our party made a courageous decision and a strong measure that shook the social circles of the world our people's hearts were seething with the dignity and pride that our party is the first and our Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il is the first. In the dark period of national suffering our people waged an indomitable struggle, looking ahead to the future of national liberation. Likewise, our people are struggling with firm faith, looking ahead to the bright future of socialism of our own style from the might of the Workers' Party of Korea. This is today's proud appearance of our people. For our people who have the party of impregnable fortress there is nothing to fear and there is no task that cannot be carried out. With the resolute faith and will embraced by the party, our people will all the more vigorously accelerate the general march of socialism of our own style, and will wholly demonstrate the indomitable spirit of the heroic people who do not know defeat or retreat in that road. 3. Our Party Is a Party of Single-Hearted Unity The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: We can say today with confidence that our party achieved cohesion and unity that is most solid and has the greatest vitality in which it cannot be frustrated in whatever way and which can overcome any kind of trial. Unity is the party's might and the source of invincibility. The party itself cannot exist and strengthen apart from the revolutionary unity. Therefore, we are saying that one of the most important signs of the revolutionary party--the party of impregnable fortress--that does not waver in any kind of hardship of history, lies in the revolutionary unity. When looking back at history, there were no parties that did not uphold the banner of unity among the working class parties that exist up till the present. Then what is the reason for the collapse of parties that have magnificent tradition and a long history? This is because the parties did not carry out the struggle to achieve a true revolutionary unity. The most solid and mighty unity among unity is the single-hearted unity. The single-hearted unity is consisted of only one ideology and one center. It is also based on one bloodline being succeeded generation after generation. If we achieve single-hearted unity, then we can smash [chitbusida] any powerful enemy and acquire the universe. In the historical communist movement, the WPK was the first party to achieve this great single-hearted unity. Therefore, it is becoming a party of impregnable fortress in which the whole world is admiring. Our party's single-hearted unity has currently risen to the most lofty height under the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. In our party, we have already completed the historical cause that builds the party's organizational and ideological basis. Therefore, our party is becoming an iron-willed rank in which the whole party is firmly uniting around the great leader [yongdoja], who is succeeding the revolutionary cause, through ideological will, morality, and sense of duty. Also, our party is becoming an invincible party in which whatever element cannot weaken the party's political and ideological integrity and unity. The might of our party's single-hearted unity is most of all being manifested by the fact that the whole party is overflowing with the absolute admiration of endlessly cherishing and following its leader [yongdoja]. In essence, the work to realize the party's cohesion and unity is the work to strengthen the blood-tied relationship between the leader [yongdoja] leading the party and the party members who comprehend the party. Only when the leader [yongdoja] is great and when all the party members united around the leader [yongdoja] have a thorough faith and sense of duty, can this kind of unity become an invincible cohesion and unity that overcomes any kind of trials and difficulties. Unity based on practical unity and obligation cannot last long and cannot manifest the invincible might. In our party, we are highly upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the center of unity and center of leadership. Therefore, the blood-tied relationship, which cannot be severed even if we wanted to, between the leader [yongdoja] and fighters was firmly formed. This resolute relationship is based on absolute admiration of their leader [yongdoja], which is deeply rooted in the hearts of our party members through the long experiences of practical life. Thus, this has eternal vitality. Our party members are singing the song by Comrade Yi In-mo, "We win if you are with us," and are carrying on their party life bearing his dedicated poem deep in their hearts, for in this poem and song is reflected the firm, invariable outlook on the leader of the revolutionary fighter. The absolute mind of reverence the WPK members have--this is the fascination toward the dear comrade leader, the great iron-willed man and the incarnation of the great faith and will; the invariable conviction that our fatherland and socialism exist because he is with us; and the noble revolutionary conscience with which they are firmly determined to adhere to the revolutionary fidelity to the leader [yongdoja] who has brought them up. Because they have this ideology and spirit, our party members are waging a vigorous struggle with a resolve to become a gun and a bomb to protect and defend the party as they did during the last semi-war state period. Whenever they are assigned a difficult revolutionary task, they highly display unmatched devotion as a standard-bearer of the ranks. Flawlessly pure and warm is our party members' mind to entrust the great leader [widaehan yongdoja] with all their destiny and follow him to the end of the world. Seeing the noble traits of our party members who adore the dear comrade leader day and night and send him many a letter of faith and loyalty, the people of the world cannot help admiring our party's might in which the leader and the fighter are wholeheartedly united. Because the millions of party members with indomitable conviction are upholding the great leader [widaehan yongdoja], our party's unity and cohesion cannot be destroyed by anything, and the WPK displays its might to the entire world. Our party's might of wholehearted unity is also demonstrated in the strong organization and discipline with which the entire party membership functions consistently according to the leader's ideology and volition. The revolutionary organization and discipline are the lifeline of the party, and it is an important yardstick showing its might of wholehearted unity. Only such a party that has succeeded in realizing wholehearted unity can function consistently according to the leader's ideology and volition, and can organize and mobilize the entire party membership vigorously toward the realization of a single objective. The party's might is the might of organization and discipline. Our party has realized wholehearted unity without its parallel in history and has become a militant party with strong organization and discipline. In our party, a revolutionary leadership system has been firmly established, and all the party work and party activities are conducted thoroughly according to the dear comrade leader's ideology and volition. All the party organizations and party members always develop all work according to the party policy and implement the party's decisions and directives through fire and water to the end. This is the proud feature of our party. In our party, the resolve of the leader [yongdoja] is the resolve of the party members. All the party members talk the same thing and walk at the same pace. Apart from this might of our party, which has firmly established firm order and discipline, we cannot mention the proud reality of our revolution in which the unitary nature of ideology and leadership is firmly ensured, nor can we think of the might of our country with which all the country, all the people, and the entire Army function consistently. Because of its strong organization and discipline which nothing can destroy, our party becomes a great party which invariably deals the revolution's enemy a powerful blow and which gives the people confidence and optimism. Our party is neither a feeble party that is utterly disunited faced with the trial of the revolution, nor a dispirited party that is crumbled in the revisionist inclination advocating liberalization and democracy. Our party's organization and discipline are unshakable today, and they will remain as strong as iron in the future as well. No counterrevolutionary maneuvers of the enemy of the revolution will be able to destroy our party's strong organization and discipline. Our party's might, which is solidified like an impregnable fortress, consists in its taking root deep in the broad popular masses and commanding their absolute support. The popular masses are the foundation and root based on the working class party. The party which has departed from the popular masses, the party which cannot command the support of the masses is like a house of cards. As the strength of the popular masses is inexhaustible, so the party which is in firm unity with the people is ever-victorious. Today, our party has not only achieved single-hearted unity in the party ranks, but struck its roots deep among the broad strata of the popular masses and won absolute support from them. Our people have boundless pride in their party and cherish deep in their hearts the notion that they cannot live even for a moment without the party. The belief of our heroic working class is that our party is the best because it has built a working class-oriented society, and the will of our farmers is that they would defend and maintain the socialist rural economic system to the end under the party's leadership. Our intellectuals have a great honor to be the party's eternal companions, sincere supporters, and excellent advisers, and the young people of the new generation are filled with the pride of being the young vanguards of the WPK. This is a testament to the fact that the WPK is an invincible party that has blood ties with people from all walks of life and leads the revolution with their absolute support and trust. In particular, our party and the People's Army are one in flesh and spirit. This is great pride incomparable to anything else. A revolutionary army is the defender of the party's cause, the socialist cause. A party that wins no support or trust from a revolutionary army and fails to take deep roots in the army cannot defend socialism against the imperialists' aggression maneuvers or lead the revolution to victory. The military discipline of the People's Army, which is boundlessly loyal to the party and the leader [suryong] and moves like one under the party's leadership, is very excellent. Our People's Army officers and men are filled with a firm resolve to entrust their entire destinies to General Kim Chong-il, our supreme commander, and be the first to resolutely defend the party and the leader [suryong] by becoming guns and bombs. Our party is powerful, and the security of our fatherland is firmly guaranteed because there is the People's Army, which has grown into an invincible powerful Army under the comrade supreme commander's leadership. The invincible might of our party, which has struck its roots deep among the workers, farmers, soldiers, intellectuals, and popular masses from all other walks of life, is fully demonstrated in revolution and construction. We crush any challenge by the imperialists, resolutely defend and maintain socialism of our own style, and score great upsurges in revolution and construction because we have this might of single-hearted unity. The invincibility of socialism of our own style and its bright prospects lie in blood unity among the party, people, and Army that are strongly united around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. Truly, our party is a party that achieved the most solid and vital unity and cohesion never before seen in history and an invincible party that has blood ties with the popular masses. No power in the world can match this steel-like party. Having an impregnable party is our people's greatest happiness and honor. Because there is our party led by General Kim Chong-il, our supreme commander, our country takes pride in being a powerful socialist country no one dares to provoke; our people take pride in being heroic people with combatant disposition who are always in the habit of winning; and our People's Army takes pride in being an invincible revolutionary Army that makes it its conviction to win every war. Because the party is mighty, socialism of our own style wins victory after victory without shaking. Our party today takes pride in being an impregnable party, entirely because it upholds the iron-willed general and great leader of the revolution [kangchorui yongjang hyongmyongui widaehan yongdoja]. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great leader [widaehan yongdoja] who strengthens and develops our party into an invincible revolutionary party under the banner of modeling the entire party after the chuche idea. Our party's great ideas are Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideas and theories, our party's belief and will is General Kim Chong-il's incomparable boldness and will, and our party's single-hearted unity is single-hearted unity around Comrade Kim Chong-il. That our party casts its ray as an impregnable party because it upholds the great leader [yongdoja] is our party's proud reality today. Our party's might is boundless, and the party's prospects are boundlessly bright. Under this invincible party's leadership, we will win a victory in the cause of socialism of our own style and accomplish the historic cause of the fatherland's reunification after overcoming any wind or storm, defeat the imperialists, and hasten the cause of achieving independence throughout the world. The revolutionary banner which our impregnable party hoists aloft will eternally fly with the strong belief that "Let the cowardice go his way, and but we will defend the red flag!" The revolutionary cause of our people who, filled with confidence and optimism, are fighting under the banner of the great party, is ever-victorious!
