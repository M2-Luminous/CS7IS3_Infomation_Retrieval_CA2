They also called for proper regulation and control of such important commodities as grain, cotton, edible oil, sugar, meat, vegetables, chemical fertilizer, steel products, and petroleum products, which have a bearing on people's lives and economic development. Wang Yiping, a responsible person of the State Economics and Trade Commission, said: Regulating and controlling market operations is an important part of the operation of the economy as a whole and is crucial to ensuring steady economic development and the smooth progress of reform in all areas. As the majority of commodities have been decontrolled, in dealing with major problems that have emerged and with possible major problems that may emerge in the operation of markets, it is necessary to regulate and control market prices by applying economic means and monetary policies and guide market depand so as to achieve a balance between supply and demand. Wang Yiping said: In establishing new regulatory and control rules and regulations under the present circumstances, first, we should establish a national reserve system and a local reserve system. The central reserve system's main task is regulating and controlling social supply and demand and regulating and controlling market problems that will affect the situation as a whole; the local reserve system's main task is regulating and controlling the operation of markets in localities to ensure market stability there. Second, we should establish a system of risk funds for important commodities. The central authorities have studied and established a system of risk funds for grain and is planning to establish risk funds for meat, vegetables, and other nonstaple food. Some localities have established their own risk funds. After commodities are decontrolled, production will be protected and market regulation and control will be flexible and effective only if a system of risk funds is established. Third, price regulation and control should be conducted by making full use of international and domestic markets, with emphasis on coordinating import-export policies. Following the elimination of the dual-track system for foreign exchange, the reform of the foreign trade system, and the connection between the international and domestic markets, imports and exports are playing an increasingly stronger influence on the operation of markets. It is necessary to establish a unified coordinating system for policies on the import and export of important commodities and means of production, and to coordinate, in accordance with changes in the international and domestic markets, the application of customs tariffs and value-added taxes as well as necessary nontariff policies and measures, and to promptly readjust the specifications and quantity of import and export commodities, so as to promote the balanced and coordinated development of the international and domestic markets. Fourth, we should establish a market monitoring system to monitor the production, marketing, and stocks of important commodities and means of production, as well as to monitor changes in their prices, and also establish a comprehensive information forecasting and monitoring network that can provide feedback flexibly. Through such a system and network we can do quantitative analysis on a regular basis, promptly discover market problems suggesting a new development, and put forward corresponding regulatory and control measures or suggestions. In this way, market regulation and control we be carried out promptly, accurately, and effectively.
