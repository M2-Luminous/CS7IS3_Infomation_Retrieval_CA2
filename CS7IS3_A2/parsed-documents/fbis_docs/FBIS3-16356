He declared this today at a press conference. Sergey Shakhray called such a movement "the concept of the self-organization of the Russian Germans." In his view, Germans living in our country must, first of all, decide for themselves on how to restore their autonomy, liaising with the organs of power in the regions where they live in large numbers. Only then, he pointed out, will there be a real possibility of passing a federal law to that effect. Sergey Shakhray also informed journalists about his recent trip to Bonn, where he attended the fifth sitting of the Russo-German intergovernmental commission on the problems of the Russian Germans. According to the minister, the Russian side confirmed its opinion that the Russian Germans can and must remain in the Russian Federation. The rights of the Russian Germans, repressed in 1941, must be restored. At the sitting of the commission, the minister noted, there was discussion of the problems involved in financing the restoration of the Russian Germans' autonomy. At present, there is no coordination of the sides in this matter, since the Germans do not trust our state organizations and pass their part of the funds allocated to the implementation of the program through private intermediary structures. There are cases of the squandering and "disappearance without trace" of the German part of the funds. But now, Sergey Shakhray stressed, the sides have agreed that, in order to prevent such a situation arising, a special Russian-German foundation and, at the local level, Russian-German societies will monitor the distribution of funds at federal level.
