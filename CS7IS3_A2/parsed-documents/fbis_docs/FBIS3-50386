This means that the results of the struggle should be recognized: not only those of the Muslim side, but also those of all the sides in the conflict. "The Supreme Command adopted a decision about strict legal measures against deserters and all other persons avoiding military service, especially those who do not report to their local commands or army units at the earliest opportunity. "The economy of the Srpska republic will be placed entirely at the disposal of the republic's defense. "The entire able-bodied population will be mobilized into war or work units, and special women's units will be set up with the aim of bringing about a successful end to the war. "All forms of illegal trade and black marketeering, especially with the enemy, will be severely punished. "Disciplinary measures have been intensified within the VRS and in the internal affairs' organs [police], as well as against all those involved in the defense, security, and protection of the constitutional order. [sentence as received] "All state organs must function in accordance with their constitutional and legal role, bringing all forms of criminal, moral, disciplinary, and other proceedings in line with conditions of an immediate risk of war. "The Supreme Command has undertaken all measures ensuring and guaranteeing full security for citizens and their property. "New measures have been taken within the organization of the VRS in line with the defense needs of all of the Srpska republic territory, ensuring flexibility, efficiency, and the better equiping of the army's units. "The Supreme Command also adopted other decisions to ensure that the fundamental right and the sacred duty of citizens will be implemented: to defend the sovereignty, territory, and constitutional order of the Srpska republic. "The new measures of the VRS Supreme Command will secure victory over the enemy and preserve all of the gains of the Serbian people's struggle to date, based on the principles of sovereignty, democracy, and freedom of the people in the Srpska republic," the statement concludes.
