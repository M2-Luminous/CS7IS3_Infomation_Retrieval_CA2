SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Chapter 19 of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism to replace domestic judicial review of final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports from the other country with review by independent binational panels. When a Request for Panel Review is filed, a panel is established to act in place of national courts to review expeditiously the final determination to determine whether it conforms with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination. Under Article 1904 of the Agreement, which came into force on January 1, 1989, the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada established Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational Panel Reviews (``Rules''). These Rules were published in the Federal Register on December 30, 1988 (53 FR 53212). The Rules were amended by Amendments to the Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational Panel Reviews, published in the Federal Register on December 27, 1989 (54 FR 53165). The Rules were further amended and a consolidated version of the amended Rules was published in the Federal Register on June 15, 1992 (57 FR 26698). The panel review in this matter was conducted in accordance with these Rules.
