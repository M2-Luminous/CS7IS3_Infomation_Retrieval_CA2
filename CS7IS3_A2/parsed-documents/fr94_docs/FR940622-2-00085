ACTION: Notice and request for comments. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) is requesting written public comments with respect to market access issues, particularly tariffs and non-tariff measures and services, related to China's participation in the GATT and the WTO. Comments received will be considered by the Executive Branch in developing the U.S. position and objectives for the bilateral and multilateral negotiations that will determine the terms of GATT/WTO accession for China. DATES: Public comments on the GATT/WTO market access issues are due by noon July 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, 600 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20506.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Chairman of the Trade Policy Staff Committee invites written comments from the public on the market access-related issues to be addressed in the course of negotiations with China for its accession to the GATT and the WTO. These terms will be negotiated in bilateral meetings with government representatives and in meetings of the Working Party, established by the Contracting Parties to the GATT to conduct the negotiations. The Committee is seeking public comments on the possible effect on U.S. trade of China's accession to the GATT/WTO, with particular reference to any trade measures applied by China that could be subject to the provisions of the GATT or the WTO, particularly market access issues. Public comments on market access issues related to China's GATT accession were requested in August 1988. All comments will be considered in developing the U.S. position and objectives for an eventual request of the Chinese government related to market access (tariff rates and non-tariff measures) concerning the establishment of schedules for market access in the areas of agriculture, industrial goods, and services. Information on products or practices subject to these negotiations should include, whenever appropriate, the import or export tariff classification number used by China for the product concerned. Persons submitting written comments should provide a statement, in twenty copies, by noon, Wednesday, July 13, 1994 to Carolyn Frank, TPSC Secretary, Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Room 414, 600 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20506.
