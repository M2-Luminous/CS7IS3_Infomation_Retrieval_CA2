Mr. Coetsee was apparently reacting to a request by Gen. Holomisa that the TEC give serious consideration to asking the United Nations to send a peace keeping force to South Africa because this country was tardy in forming a national peace keeping force. Mr. Coetsee said the government's representative on the TEC's defense subcommittee has informed him that there had been dynamic progress toward establishing a national peace keeping force.
