Ganeyeva: "More Millionaires Every Day"] [Text] Privatization of housing in Kazan began three months ago. Over the elapsed time, this mechanism has been fine-tuned and now is working almost without a glitch. The city authorities have managed over an extremely short period of time to put together a legislative base--the basis for the conduct of privatization; to set up a powerful computer network linked to the main computer in the city agency for housing privatization, which gave the city the necessary information on the process of transferring housing to private hands. The agency, created at the end of November of last year, practically began its operation at the time that housing privatization got its start--on 6 December. According to the agency's data, which were provided to us by its chief, Yevgeniy Tokarchuk, as of 5 March 4,430 apartments had been privatized in Kazan, which comprises 3.5 percent of all city housing subject to privatization by law. In Kazan's Baumanskiy Rayon, 273 persons received contracts transferring housing to private ownership; in Sovetskiy Rayon--1,083, Vakhitovskiy--572, Privolzhskiy--956, Moskovskiy--934, Leninskiy--1,220, and Kirovskiy--368. More than 9,500 applications for housing privatization already have been submitted. Now in the housing maintenance organizations, waiting for its owners who apparently had not expected to get all [lines missing]. Instead of the period of one month envisaged by the law for a contract to be issued after the application is submitted, in Baumanskiy, Sovetskiy, and Moskovskiy Rayons the processing period for housing privatization documents has been reduced to 10 or at most 16 days. In Leninskiy and Privolzhskiy Rayons, however, which are experiencing some computer problems, contracts are issued a month after the application is submitted. Time begets new problems: refusal to privatize after the contract has already been processed. People had submitted applications to housing maintenance offices, and then changed their mind. Ye. Tokarchuk's comment on this situation was that they explain their change of mind by open threats of extortion. For instance, quarrels have already begun in some families, and canceling the contract in this situation is the best way out of the situation. Quite possibly, some of soon to be property owners have run into those who already own it and have realized that it is better at this point to keep living in a state-owned apartment. The pace of housing privatization in the city has stabilized. Looking at the December data, at the time more than 1,000 applications a week were coming in; in January, the number dropped to 800, and in February--600 a week. According to the latest data from the agency, now about 650-700 applications are coming in every week. Ye. Tokarchuk noted that city residents are not well informed on the terms, rules, and advantages of housing privatization. People ask the most elementary questions. The most often asked is whether they may have to pay more for a privatized apartment. "We have to explain patiently that payments for a privatized apartment remain the same," Ye. Tokarchuk tells us, "while the property tax amounts to only 0.1 percent of the book value of the cost of the housing as of 1 January 1994; that the tax is paid once a year in November-December, and inflation will make the amount of the tax rather modest. Besides, some categories of citizens are exempt from property taxes altogether." Many questions are asked regarding residence permits as applied to privatized housing. People ask about the procedures of willing apartments as inheritance, giving them as a gift, and buying and selling. Generally, however, the city agency's main tasks are not in answering people's questions. The agency represents the main link in the chain of housing privatization departments under heads of rayon administrations; it has been set up under the head of the Kazan administration. [Line missing] of privatization is computerized. One of the agency's main functions is to monitor compliance with the law. The main computer located at the agency checks whether the housing unit indicated in the application is subject to privatization. As is known, it is against the law to take possession of decrepit housing or housing assigned as part of one's official position. There are restrictions on apartment privatization in buildings that represent historic and architectural landmarks. The dispassionate machine also picks up facts of multiple residence permits and repeat privatization by the same person. The main computer also assigns a registration number to all contracts transferring housing into private ownership. Each rayon has its own code, but the city keeps its own integrated registration. Therefore, the registration number consists of a code and a sequential number. In addition, the agency monitors the work schedule and operations of housing maintenance offices and rayon housing privatization departments and conducts planned weekly audits. As to the concrete results of the city agency's work, over these three months three incidents of multiple residence permits have been detected, and several precedents of attempts to privatize housing that by law is not subject to privatization. The privatization applications of all these persons were rejected. According to fresh statistical data received in the agency through the computer network, local soviets' housing comprises 65.9 percent of all privatized housing, and 34.1 percent--housing previously owned by organizations. The city authorities had quite a few unpleasant moments dealing with reluctance and open sabotage on the part of enterprises that did not want to relinquish their housing to ownership of the people living in it. Now the situation has improved perceptibly, and enterprises that attempt at all costs to make their housing a part of their charter capital are few and far between. They have managed, however, to slow down privatization of enterprise-owned housing, which accounts for a lower share of such housing as compared to one owned by local soviets. The main computer has a full picture of the attributes of the privatized housing. One-room apartments account for the greatest share of privatized housing (44.3 percent), followed closely by two-room apartments (37.6 percent), then three-room apartments--14.9 percent, and rooms in communal apartments--3.2 percent. [Lines missing] cases become single or elderly people. Our state has deprived our elderly of the opportunity of leaving inheritance in a deposit book. Their life savings--3,000-5,000 rubles--have lost their value completely. Now, however, they have the opportunity to leave a million-ruble inheritance--an apartment-- and the elderly want to take advantage of this right. According to Ye. Tokarchuk, the results of analysis conducted by the service show that 3.5 percent of housing has now been privatized in Kazan; by the end of the year it will reach approximately 20 percent. In Russia during the first year also 10-12 percent of housing had been transferred to private ownership; now it is between 30 and 50 percent, depending on the region. So far, housing privatization is proceeding here in the same way as in Russia, and only a few of us have had the chance to appreciate fully the right to own housing. However, a market in apartments is already emerging in the city, where enormous prices per square meter will lift the mood of owners of Kazan real estate.
