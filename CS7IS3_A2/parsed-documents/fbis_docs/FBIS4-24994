Such a new urban-rural relationship has become increasingly distinct in the economically developed cities of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou in Jiangsu Province. Thanks to the spread of urban industries, village and town enterprises rose like a new force suddenly coming to the fore in the fields beside Tai Hu in the early 1970's. They opened a new chapter in the annals of industrial revolution in China's rural areas. After more than 20 years of pioneering work and development, southern Jiangsu's rural areas ended an era of "grass-roots industry" and entered into a new phase of industrial development with scientific and technological advances and the export-oriented economy playing the dominant role and with a rational distribution of village and town enterprises being relatively concentrated in satellite towns. At present, the three cities of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou boast 50,000-plus village and town enterprises. Over 70 percent of their equipment is of the advanced level of the 1980's and the 1990's, surpassing the technical and equipment standard of urban industries. On the average, every township and town set up more than 10 "three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises." According to statistics, staff and workers of village and town enterprises already accounted for over 80 percent of the labor force in southern Jiangsu's rural areas. The ratio captured by village and town industries in the whole industrial sector of southern Jiangsu already exceeded two thirds. On the list of China's top 100 village and town enterprises made public recently, 45 are located in southern Jiangsu. The successful process of industrialization in the countryside has filled the chasms that have chronically divided urban and rural areas. In southern Jiangsu, all townships and towns have been interconnected by highways, most of the villages are now illuminated by streetlamps at night, and the overwhelming majority of townships and towns have installed program-controlled telephones. On the basis of "feedback" from village and town industries, southern Jiangsu has initially realized farming mechanization, and more than 90 percent of the villages have set up general agricultural service stations. Fair-sized operations on land and socialized agricultural service networks have developed significantly, turning age-old heavy farm jobs, which peasants performed with "their faces turned toward the yellow soil and their backs toward the sky," into "pieces of cake." Various social services, including culture, education, and medical and health care, have all advanced side by side. The dream of urbanizing the countryside is slowly coming true. The economic take-off in rural areas has posed endless challenges to Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, setting even stricter demands for building up the multipurpose functions of key cities. Faced with this task, the cities in southern Jiangsu have aggressively reversed the old pattern of lopsided development in secondary and tertiary industries as they have begun implementing a new blueprint for giving modern cities a new lease on life. In recent years, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou cities have successively designated tertiary industry as a new economic growth sector to be developed on a priority basis. This will turn the cities into the hubs of manpower, material, capital, and information flows. Traditional commodity exchanges and catering businesses aside, such burgeoning tertiary businesses as finance, communications, post and telecommunications, scientific and technological consultation, and information media services are on the rise. New service industries, which are primarily of a knowledge-intensive type, have sprung up incessantly, breathing powerful life into urban economies, and lending strong support to the further development of rural economies. People in economic circles commented: The shift of secondary industry to the countryside and the growth of tertiary industry in the cities have eroded the traditional notion of an "industrial city." This will blur the boundaries between urban and rural areas, bringing about a new pattern in which the integration of urban and rural economies is accelerated.
