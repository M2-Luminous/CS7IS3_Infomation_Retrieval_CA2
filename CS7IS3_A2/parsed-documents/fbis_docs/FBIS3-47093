The source quoted Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae as telling members of a National Assembly committee that when the IAEA team arrives in Pyongyang, South and North Korea and the United States will simultaneously announce their positions on three issues. Song explained the government position on the process and prospects of Pyongyang-Washington negotiations to members of the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National Unification Committee in a meeting at the Federation of the Korean Industries, said the source who attended the meeting. The three issues are inter-Korean exchange of special envoys, suspension of the "Team Spirit" joint South Korea-U.S. military exercise, and high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington. What the three countries will say about the issues has not been decided, and Washington seems unsure of Pyongyang's negotiating posture, a second source who also attended the meeting said. When the IAEA inspectors arrive in Pyongyang, North Korea is expected to announce that it has decided to resume inter-Korean talks and is willing to open working-level contacts with the South to discuss mutual nuclear inspections based on the South-North non- nuclear declaration, he quoted National Unification Board officials as saying. Seoul will announce that it is willing to suspend Team Spirit, while Washington will announce that it will hold a third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang on condition of the IAEA nuclear inspection and progress in inter-Korean talks. An opposition Democratic Party lawmaker said: "I've heard that even if the government announces suspension of Team Spirit, it will make the final decision on when to suspend it after watching progress in inter-Korean talks and settlement of the North Korean nuclear problem."
