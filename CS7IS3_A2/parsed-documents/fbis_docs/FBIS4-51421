Li made the call before concluding his five-day presence at the session of the National Assembly in which he solicited opinions from assembly members on national-affairs issues. He said that Taiwan, behind the joint effort of the government and people, has built up its status in the international community behind the strength of its economy, but that to keep that status, it needs to face up to sharper international competition economically and the threat by Beijing to isolate it politically. He said that regardless of party affiliation or birthplace, Taiwan citizens "should demonstrate the spirit of solidarity to pool together our strength and wisdom so as to accomplish political reforms, expand our diplomatic arena and increase our economic strength," President Li said. During the past five days, 302 out of the 314 National Assembly members voiced their concerns on national affairs, especially regarding constitutional reforms, the national identity, cross- strait relations, foreign operations, judicial and educational reforms, and agricultural development. The National Assembly began its three-month special session on May 2 to consider proposed amendments to the constitution and the nominations by Li of grand justices and the head of the Judicial Yuan.
