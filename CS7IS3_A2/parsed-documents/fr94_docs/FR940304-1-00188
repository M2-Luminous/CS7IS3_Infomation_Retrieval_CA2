FR940304-1-00188 FR940304-1-00015 OMB Control No.: Formerly 2115&hyph;0574; Consolidated into 2115&hyph;0003. Administration: U.S. Coast Guard. Title: Collection of Commercial Vessel & Personnel Accident (Marine Casualty) Information (Forms CG&hyph;2692/2692A) and Programs for Chemical Drug & Alcohol Testing of Commercial Vessel Personnel, including Required Drug & Alcohol Testing following a Serious Marine Incident (Form CG&hyph;2692B). Need for Information: Sections 7101 and 7302 of title 46, United States Code mandate that the Secretary require chemical testing of each applicant for the issuance or renewal of a license, COR, or MMD for use of a dangerous drug. Proposed Use of Information: An applicant must submit proof of passing a chemical test for dangerous drugs or meet one of the exceptions from periodic testing in order to be considered for issuance or renewal of a license, COR, or MMD. Frequency of Responses: This information must be collected whenever an applicant applies for or renews a license, COR, MMD, or when individuals (e.g., a pilot) are required to receive an annual physical examination. Burden Estimated: The Coast Guard estimates that the total annual burden on merchant mariners will be $439,000. This estimate does not include the costs to the Coast Guard of administering the program. Again, these costs are incorporated into the ``Draft Regulatory Evaluation and Regulatory Flexibility Assessment of Regulations Requiring Chemical Testing for Dangerous Drugs of Applicants for Issuance or Renewal of a license, COR, or MMD.'' Respondents: The regulatory impact will fall on the estimated 7,258 merchant mariners not yet required to undergo periodic chemical testing for dangerous drugs. Form(s): There are no forms applicable to this rulemaking. Average Burden Hours Per Respondent: The average burden hours per respondent is 1.25 hours per year. The burden hours for all respondents total 9,072.5 hours annually. The Coast Guard has submitted the requirements to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Persons submitting comments on the requirements should submit their comments both to OMB and to the Coast Guard where indicated under ADDRESSES . Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This proposal is a procedural regulation without any direct environmental impact.
