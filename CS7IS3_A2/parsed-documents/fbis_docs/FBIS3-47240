In addition, the number of joint-venture companies doing business in North Korea has diminished from 120 to 20, Yi Yong-tok, deputy premier and national unification minister, said on 10 January in a report to the National Assembly Foreign Affairs-Unification Committee. According to the report, the three joint-venture companies that were established in the last year are Aeguk Adhesion Plant, Aeguk Color Television Assembly Plant, and Myongsim Joint-Venture Company manufacturing graphite, which are all jointly invested with Japanese companies. The report revealed that there is a great possibility that North Korea has transferred initiative for economic policies from the Workers' Party of North Korea to the Administration Council as part of a policy attaching great importance to professionalism rather than partisanship.
