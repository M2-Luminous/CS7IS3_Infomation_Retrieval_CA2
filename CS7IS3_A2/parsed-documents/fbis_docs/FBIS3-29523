The newspaper LIENHEPAO here reported in a dispatch from Taipei Friday that Taiwan Finance Ministry's tariff rates committee on Thursday decided on the tariffs ranging from 110.67 to 6.57 percent on the ground that the polypropylene exported by South Korea and Japan has had a serious effect on the Taiwanese industry. This is the second Taiwanese anti-dumping tariffs on Korean products since diplomatic ties broke up between the two countries in August 1992. Last year, Taipei slapped anti-dumping tariffs on polyethylene cases exported by South Korea. The report said that the anti-dumping tariffs will be imposed on Korean and Japanese polypropylene as decided by the committee as soon as the decision is approved by the administration, a rather perfunctory procedure. About 20 South Korean and Japanese industries are subject to the assessment of the tariffs, the paper added.
