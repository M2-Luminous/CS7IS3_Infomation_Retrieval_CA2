Beijing Plays Down Human Rights Problems SUMMARY Apparently seeking to avoid putting its human rights record in the spotlight at a time when Washington is beginning its annual review of most-favored-nation trading status for China, Beijing has responded with its usual circumspection to recent critical reports on the human rights situation in China from the U.S. State Department, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch. END SUMMARY Reflecting this year's typically restrained approach, Beijing adhered to the pattern of the past three years and responded in a pro forma manner and at a low-level of authority to the 1 February release of the U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights, using the usual statement by a PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman to register its official opposition to the report (Xinhua, 3 February). The spokesman, at the regular weekly press conference on 3 February, denounced the report in standard terms, saying it is "utterly unreasonable and totally irresponsible" for the United States to "distort, criticize, and attack" China's "domestic situation." He went on to reaffirm Beijing's longstanding position that the issue of human rights is an "internal affair" which falls within the "sovereignty" of each country and to reiterate China's "resolute opposition" to any interference in the PRC's internal affairs on the "excuse" of human rights. In another indication of Beijing's apparent intention to maintain a low-profile on the human rights issue, media commentary on the release of the State Department report was similarly low-level and limited to an article in Renmin Ribao by Shi Quan on 14 February and a 4 February article in the PRC-owned Hong Daily Ta Kung Pao by well-placed columnist Shih Chun-yu. Issued eleven days after the Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, the Renmin Ribao article, while pegged to the release of the report, devoted most of its space to a historical discussion of the difference between China's view of human rights and the European "humanist concept" of rights. It concluded by stating Beijing's standard position that the human rights issue should not be used to "meddle" in a country's internal affairs or "exert political pressure on them." For his part, Shih Chun-yu used his Ta Kung Pao column to highlight what he said was a "significant improvement" in the human rights situation in China and to routinely warn Washington that efforts to "interfere" in China's internal affairs under the "pretext" of human rights will be counterproductive. Beijing's effort to deemphasize its human rights problems was also evident in its low-key response to the critical reports issued in mid-February by Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch on China's human rights record. Offering Beijing's only observed public comment on the reports to date, Xinhua on 22 February carried remarks made the previous day by a PRC representative to the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. According to Xinhua, the representative made no mention of the charges in the Human Rights Watch report, focusing instead on the Amnesty International report as evidence that the organization is "highly prejudiced" against China and that its thinking remains that of the "Cold War era." By contrast, last year Beijing had responded at a higher-level of authority with a Foreign Ministry spokesman statement to an Amnesty International report criticizing China's human rights record in Tibet (Xinhua, 23 May 1993).
