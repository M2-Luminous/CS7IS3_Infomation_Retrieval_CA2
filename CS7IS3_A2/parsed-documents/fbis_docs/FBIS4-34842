The U.S. economic recovery has opened the way for possible new inflationary pressures. The Federal Reserve, or Fed, has been anticipating those pressures and increasing its interest rates during the year's first six months. The price increase in raw materials is considered an indication that interest rates are still not high enough and will climb even more. The prospect was enough for the market to start dropping capital marked in dollars, expecting to buy them back later after an interest rate increase. That reluctance to keep dollars produced the drop in the foreign exchange rate. It seems clear that those movements will result in changes, perhaps important changes, in the international financial scenario. Obviously, it is still early to make any definitive assessment, but everything indicates that after the turbulence there will be still higher interest rates in the United States. The Federal Reserve's refusal to approve higher interest rates, despite the strong market pressure, produced the additional speculation that the monetary authority might be evaluating the possibility of a more permanent foreign exchange rate adjustment. The speculation continued even after U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the United States was not interested in a devaluation, although it is a fact that the drop in the dollar price will benefit U.S. exports. If this is the case, interest rate increases would be smaller or authorities would, at least, take longer to implement them. Brazil will not benefit from an increase in international interest rates. Higher foreign interest rates would reduce the margin making the national market attractive for foreign investors. Besides, high interest rates mean higher costs to renegotiate the foreign debt, that is, higher costs for the Brazilian Government. The effect of these eventual changes, however, will be slow to appear. The record volume of the country's reserves will give us a good margin for maneuvering, and the effect of a possible increase in the cost of renegotiating the foreign debt will be gradual. The impact on the Real Plan will be small, but we might have to anticipate future narrower margins in our economic policies.
