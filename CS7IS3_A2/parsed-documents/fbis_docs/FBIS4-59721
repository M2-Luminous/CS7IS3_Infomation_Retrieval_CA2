They did not rule out that normalization would be discussed in the final stage. While an Israeli source said yesterday that the main aim of the current Christopher tour "is to form a joint Syrian-Israeli committee to be entrusted with drawing up draft future border security arrangements between the two countries." [passage omitted] The sources added that Syrian officials have rejected a phased withdrawal. They cited the affirmation by a Syrian source on the eve of Christopher's arrival in Damascus that "Syria is not willing to deal with any Israeli proposals not containing a clear commitment to withdrawing from all the Golan within a reasonable and acceptable period." The sources stressed to AL-HAYAH that progress on the Syrian-Israeli track should follow the following sequence: -- the Israeli Knesset decision to annex the Golan and to apply Israeli laws on the Heights should be revoked; -- the principle should be accepted of Syria's absolute sovereignty over the Golan territory and willingness to withdraw completely from it should be announced; -- the peaceful solution should be within the framework of a comprehensive settlement on all fronts; -- security measures on both sides of the border should be equal, and the security of all states should be guaranteed; -- Syria is willing to discuss the other questions related to relations (normalization, the opening of an embassy, trade exchange) within the framework of the land-for-peace principle. The sources stressed that recognition of Syria's sovereignty over the Golan is a "base" for discussing all the other questions between the two countries. [passage omitted]
