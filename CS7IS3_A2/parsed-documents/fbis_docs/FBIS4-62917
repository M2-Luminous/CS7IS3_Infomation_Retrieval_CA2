These are the Communist Party and Rukh. [Chornovil] So we have. Our faction is currently comprised of 30 people -- members and supporters of Rukh. Several other deputies, representatives of parties with opinions close to ours, intend to join us. Other factions, unfortunately, are not being formed on a party basis. "Unfortunately," because this will not allow the parliament to be clearly structured. We should aim at the European model of parliamentarism with its faction discipline and clear division on the authorities and the opposition. Although this will not take place, the first step in this direction has already been taken. [Kokhanets] I recall that, while discussing the electoral law, the majority of speakers complained: "What parties? People are already allergic to the word `party'..." [Chornovil] Yes, the law proved to be completely antiparty, but it was corrected by the voters themselves, because they generally voted for certain political forces, not individuals. It is significant that people want these forces to assume responsibility; they do not want everyone be responsible for themselves. Thus, we have our faction, and we have already held an organizational meeting. According to our statute, the Rukh chairman is the faction head, Rukh Deputy Chairman Oleksandr Lavrynovych is its coordinator, and Rivne People's Deputy Volodymyr Kovtunets is the secretary. [Kokhanets] Will the program with which your faction is going to the parliament not duplicate the Rukh program? [Chornovil] What the faction will propose to the parliament is not a party program. However, it is actually a little bit easier for us, because we do not have to think over new things: We have a well developed state-building concept, which was elaborated by a large group of scientists and adopted as early as at the Fourth Rukh Congress. So far, no political force has elaborated such a document. [Kokhanets] Do you believe that the current alignment of forces in the parliament will ensure its ability to act? [Chornovil] Those who claim that the new parliament is worse than the previous one do not tell the truth. It is not worse. Its problem is that it is incomplete. The current Supreme Council, first of all, is more structured; second, it is not dominated by the extreme left-wing forces, about which there was a lot of talk on the eve of the elections. By the way, there are many sober-minded people who are willing to cooperate among leftists. For example, I have heard an opinion among socialists that the parliamentary work should not be politicized from its first days. The Rukh faction advocates exactly the same thing. We agree with Bolshevik Ulyanov that there should be less political idle talk. God forbid that we become stuck in a debate over symbols, anthems, or state languages. This will allow us neither to form a normal government and Supreme Council working bodies, nor to resolve urgent economic problems. I am very afraid of such politicizing. Perhaps we should first convene the leaders of all factions -- starting with those ranging from the extreme left to the center-right (since extreme rightists will hardly be able to establish their own faction). We must reach an agreement and prevent debates on certain issues, on which we will inevitably disagree, and we will again irritate the Ukrainian people with our senseless conflicts. I think that we all must agree on vital questions: How to improve the economy, implement market mechanisms, and curb the crime raise and impoverishment of society. Another urgent problem is the financial reform. Mr. Zvyahilskyy [acting prime minister], apparently, has not done his job.... However, I am afraid that the parliament's incompleteness can hamper our resolutions of vital issues. For example, what to do with the elections scheduled for 26 June? A working group, in which I am participating, has recently come forward with amendments to the Constitution, without which the elections cannot be held, since the Electoral Law says one thing, and the Constitution -- another. According to the latter, we have no right to hold either the presidential or self-government elections. It must be precisely defined what kind of presidential or local authority there will be, and only then we can go to the polls. As for the parliament's structure, I think that the center comprising predominantly nonparty people will have an impact on many things. Leftist forces have approximately a third of seats, national-democratic forces -- even less. Therefore, while making decisions on a majority of issues, every faction will be trying to win support of the center which has gathered representatives of the party in power, agriculture sector officials, entrepreneurs, and servicemen. [Kokhanets] Who, do you think, threatens Ukrainian statehood more -- extreme leftists or the interregional bloc? [Chornovil] The interregional bloc, of course. Supporters of Mr. Kuchma advocate things that unequivocally threaten our independence. Fortunately, they won very few votes. I do not know whether the bloc members will try to form a faction; they do not have even 12 deputies: They won some votes in Kharkov Oblast and Dnepr region; in Donbass, they were defeated by the communists. As for the extreme leftists, we suppose that they are not in agreement either. Among them are forces which, according to socialist recipes, want to build a Ukrainian state. We will be looking for a common language with them: We will be trying to convince them, or to make certain compromises. Of course, compromises will be out of the question if we see an open proimperial mood. We expect, however, that there will not be many such deputies in the new parliament. [Kokhanets] What will be your party position in the presidential elections? [Chornovil] We will coordinate who will be nominated and registered. It is not so easy to collect 100,000 signatures. Rukh has not officially nominated any candidate. Perhaps we will unofficially support Lanovyy. He really is a serious economist, a man who stands on state-building positions and can strip the proimperially oriented Kuchma of some votes. Yet, the point is not Kuchma himself, but the forces which bet on him, intending to command their nominee if he is elected to presidential office. [Kokhanets] Thus, we will not see your name among presidential candidates this time. People say that Chornovil-oppositionist can do more than Chornovil-president. What is your opinion about such a "compliment?" [Chornovil] I am not focused on being an oppositionist. I simply consider these elections immoral. Even the situation surrounding them is somewhat unpleasant. Look, this is our president who states either that he will no longer run for his current office, or that he will. [Former Supreme Council Chairman] Plyushch has also put forward his candidacy, and he is arguing at news conferences that Leonid Makarovych, to put it politely, is not right.... They are simply fighting for the chair, not knowing how will it look, since the president's functions have not been defined, nor has the new constitution been adopted. Where in the world is a president elected first, and then his functions defined? This does not occur. This drive to the chair, this intriguing against one another, this coquetry, all this is very shameful. Most candidates are not any better, either. Do these people really not realize that they are ridiculous in their claims to the presidential office. You know, watching such an atmosphere, I am only glad that I have not joined this game. Of course, if there were a different configuration of forces, a different situation within society, why could not Rukh recommend its own representative? Regarding that "compliment," I believe that I was governing Lvov Oblast rather well, when I was openly not in the opposition. The general situation was simply unfavorable for my work. The economic collapse began at that time. We were trying to prevent it, as much as we could. We achieved a lot, but.... I would like to emphasize again that opposition is not the goal for me or our faction. If a political force only aims at being in the opposition, it is doomed. Pure opposition does not exist in politics. Thus, the opinion that "Chornovil is an eternal oppositionist" is rather false. The current situation simply gives us no chance to win more than we could win. [Kokhanets] How, in your opinion, can Rukh's victory and the defeat of the Ukrainian Republican Party [URP] be explained? [Chornovil] I think that the URP leaders' policy is too temporizing, not only toward Kravchuk, but also his nomenklatura. They recklessly believed that the old team would honestly build a new state. Recklessness does not work out in politics... And Rukh... Rukh was successful, because it understands this. We expect that our faction will become more solid after the run-off elections, since in many constituencies where the elections were disrupted we had a very good chance; our representatives made it to the second round not only in western Ukraine, but also in eastern oblasts (in Kiev, for example, -- 14 "pure" Rukh members). Our faction is ready for the parliamentary work. It will cooperate with all who want to make our Ukraine an independent and developed state.
