This is one of the reasons the party was very successful in the 1980's. The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is currently undergoing a process in the other direction that has remained largely unnoticed. For decades it was considered the classical social welfare party, and in opinion polls citizens made it clear that they considered the SPD responsible in this area. Now the strategists around Rudolf Scharping, the new party chairman, have realized that they must open the party to a "New Economic Problem" if the social democrats want to win and retain a majority over the long term. The SPD is finally going to be given a new economic profile, as has been demanded for a long time. Scharping, who is setting up an election campaign team and is looking for expert advisers in many policy areas, attaches special importance to economic policy advice. Even though the SPD moved away from its state economy ideology and adopted the market economy concept at its Godesberg party congress in 1959, it never succeeded in proving its competence in the economic policy field. In November, three large opinion research institutes found out for the first time that voters think the SPD is better able to solve economic problems than the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CSU]. Eight Economics Ministers in the Federal Laender Members of the SPD Executive Board admit that in the contest of the parties, every party profits from failures of the other one. In the economic area, the CDU/CSU has so far failed to submit a convincing concept to cope with acute problems, which is why the citizens are now staking their hopes on the SPD. The party is aware that it must provide a substantive basis for this confidence and present economic experts to put it into practice. At the Wiesbaden party congress, the delegates agreed that nothing can be distributed before it has been produced. This is a decisively new course for the SPD's future economic policy, as the party executive board stresses. Scharping now intends to forge the iron as long as it is hot. Comparable to the CDU during its time in opposition in the 1970's, a renewal has meanwhile also set in within the SPD through the federal laender. The Social Democrats supply the economics ministers in eight of the 16 federal laender -- more than ever before. Dieter Spoeri from Baden-Wuerttemberg is considered the most important asset in this respect; he has the best chance of becoming economics minister in Rudolf Scharping's shadow cabinet. Spoeri was in Bonn for many years, and gathered experience in the SPD Bundestag group in the economic and financial policy area; he is also standing his ground in a grand coalition with the CDU in Stuttgart. This could, in fact, qualify him for a top position in Bonn this fall. But even apart from active politics, a renewal movement is manifesting itself within the SPD. In circles organized by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation and elsewhere, leading SPD politicians meet with scientists, industrial leaders, and business managers who chat with Rudolf Scharping more and more often. "The culture of holding talks on important current political affairs is only now beginning to develop within the SPD," says a member of the election program commission. Such talking circles existed when Bjoern Engholm was chancellor candidate, but they were never more than informal circles. The idea now is not only to exchange views but also mobilize them for practical party work, no matter whether economic, financial, social welfare, foreign, or any other policy areas are concerned. Former SPD Federal Manager Peter Glotz, who is now a professor at Munich University, is an important link to the scientific world. In the "Kochel Circle," young university teachers who are at least close to the SPD are meeting in January to give thought provoking impulses in talks with practical party politicians. In Search of Qualified Candidates The party leadership considers it one of the most important problems to overcome the still existing skepticism about modern technologies; accepting and guaranteeing them for Germany's economic base is of outstanding importance. In this respect, the Transrapid magnetic train and genetic engineering are mentioned as examples. "In this context, we will not always pursue the same course as the trade unions," say the program planners. The search for qualified candidates for Scharping's election campaign team includes practicians like Spoeri from the laender and theoreticians from the scientific area. It is true that the SPD chairman in 1993 installed a commission to draft the election campaign program, but this commission will not be identical to the shadow cabinet. Doubts have even been expressed of whether Saarland Minister President Oskar Lafontaine, who is responsible in the commission for economic and financial policy, will be a member of the shadow team. New names will emerge, including persons that currently appear as prominent advisers in talks, to clearly open up the SPD to business and industry, the middle class, and the scientific world. Scharping's circle of advisers also includes active politicians from the past -- people like Helmut Schmidt, Karl Schiller, or Manfred Schueler -- to whose advice the new party chief attaches equally great importance and who have promised help. Chancellor candidate-designate Scharping is also inconspicuously practicing his appearance in the international arena. Shortly before the EC summit in Brussels in December, the SPD chief met with the chairmen of other European social democratic parties to discuss problems of economic growth.
