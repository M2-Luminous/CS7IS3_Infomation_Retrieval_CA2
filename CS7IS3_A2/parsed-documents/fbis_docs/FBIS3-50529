There was also a unique meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and five of Caricom's 13 heads of goverment that irritated some Community leaders who subsequently failed to meet separately with Vice President Al Gore. In Jamaica, which accounts for more than a third of the 13-member Community's ethnically and culturally diverse population, Prime Minister P.J. Patterson led his incumbent People's National Party (PNP) back to power with a massive electoral victory. The March 30 election that coincided with Patterson's first anniversary as successor to the retired Michael Manley as leader of the PNP and government, gave the PNP 52 of the 60 parliamentary seats. But the win was dampened by an electoral turnout of approximately 58 percent, one of the lowest in Jamaica's electoral history, and sustained charges of electoral malpractices, including stuffing of ballot boxes on voting day. The election results forced the opposition Jamaica Labour Party's leader, ex-prime minister Edward Seaga, to publicly indicate that the "rebuilding process" of the party could include determining his own future with the JLP. Three months later, on June 30, the veteran politician of Belize, George Price, took a gamble with a snap poll that saw his People's United Party (Pup) losing power. The PUP lost by three seats to Manuel Esquivel's United Democratic Party (UDP). The UDP's 16-13 victory, which surprised some political analysts, was its second in three contested elections. Four months after the poll, Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds of St. Kitts and Nevis also chose to call an early election on November 29, only to be faced with a crisis that by year-end was posing a threat to the longevity of his one-seat majority coalition government. Simmonds' People's Action Movement (PAM) gained four of the eight seats in St. Kitts -- the same number as the opposition St. Kitts-Nevis Labour Party -- with the three seats in sister territory, Nevis, being shared by the Concerned Citizens Movement (CCM) of Premier Vance Amory (two) and the Nevis Reformation Party, PAM's traditional coalition partner (one). The swearing in of a minority coalition government of PAM and NRP with Simmonds back as prime minister, sparked violent demonstrations, forcing declaration of a state of emergency, a dusk-to-dawn curfew and an appeal by Simmonds for assistance from the Regional Security System (RSS). Both the curfew and state of emergency were lifted within two weeks, but the bitterness between labour and the coalition remained. The St. Kitts Christian Council and the Evangelical Association failed in bids to broker a peace that would have resulted in fresh elections within six months, which labour party leader Denzil Douglas said was "the logical and decent thing to do." Douglas, pointing out that his party commanded 54 percent of the votes cast to PAM's 42 percent, warned that a "new election is now inevitable since we have no intentions of being governed by two parties in a coalition overwhelmingly rejected by the electorate." In a no-confidence motion in the new parliament, the CCM's two votes would be crucial to bringing down the PAM-NRP coalition. The year 1993 also saw changes in the leadership of the governing Dominica Freedom Party (Brian Alleyne for the retiring prime minister Eugenia Charles) and the ruling Antigua Labour Party (Lester Bird for his octogenarian father, Prime Minister Vere Bird, Sr). There were also numerous technical and ministerial meetings to advance the deepening and widening of the region's 20-year-old economic integration movement, Caricom. At the 14th Caricom summit in The Bahamas in July, heads of government decided to have in place "appropriate measures" so that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), subsequently approved, would not adversely affect the Community's trade and agricultural policies. The region's dissatisfaction over benefits from the current Lome IV convention with the European Community and its concerns over access to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) without "undue disadvantages" from concessions already granted to founding members like Mexico, were also on the agenda of that summit. After the meeting, on August 30, the president of Guyana and the prime ministers of Jamaica, Barbados, The Bahamas, and Trinidad and Tobago were invited to a unique working luncheon meeting at the White House with President Clinton. While U.S./Cuba relations remained a cause for concern, for the five Caricom leaders, the Community's access to NAFTA on favourable terms was the major agenda item. They left Washington with a promise from the President that his administration would study the likely negative impact of NAFTA on the region's economies to determine how best it could respond to Caricom's areas of concern. The leaders of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) were not happy over the choice by the Clinton Administration for the August 30 working lunch and, with the exception of Prime Minister Charles of Dominica, failed to show up for a planned October meeting with Gore. Prime Minister James Mitchell of St. Vincent and the Grenadines reflected his own disagreement when he said that while the President of the USA was free to invite whoever he wished, "I do not recognise two sets of Caricom heads of government." During October, Caricom heads of governments were meeting again for a special session in Trinidad and Tobago, this time with the leaders of the so-called "Group of Three" in Latin America -- the presidents of Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia -- as well as the vice president of Suriname. Delegates said the meeting was "a positive development in the process of increasing political consensus which is developing in Latin America and the Caribbean...." They pledged to find mutually acceptable solutions to common problems. Their interest in encouraging deeper involvement of the private sector in new development thrusts in the post-Cold War phase of rising mega-economic blocs, was later reaffirmed when the sixth Europe-Caribbean conference, organised by the Caribbean Council for Europe took place in Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic November 10-12. One of the significant developments flowing from that conference was the inauguration on November 28 in Santo Domingo of a federation of European chambers of commerce. Except for the Port-of-Spain meeting of Caricom and Central American leaders, Cuba was involved in all of the major meetings and events organised by the Community's governments during the year. Having rejected "misrepresentations" and "unnecessary fears" emanating from a group of United States congressmen over a proposed Caricom-Cuba joint commission, the Community's governments went ahead and formally launched the commission on December 13 in Guyana, where the inaugural meeting reviewed the wide range of areas for technical, economic, and cultural cooperation. Earlier, Caricom countries had, for the first time, given overwhelming support to an approved resolution at the United Nations General Assembly in October for an end to the 31-year-old U.S. trade, economic, and financial embargo against Cuba. The Cuban foreign minister, Roberto Robaina Gonzalez, who subsequently made a seven-nation tour of Caricom member states, estimated that the U.S. embargo had already cost his country 40 billion U.S. dollars. Robaina said he would visit the remaining six other Caricom countries early in 1994 to "strengthen our relations with the Caribbean which we regard as a natural ally." The Caribbean Conference of Churches and the Caribbean Policy Development Centre (CPDC) of non-government organisations were active in their advocacy for the lifting of the U.S. embargo against Cuba. They were also very vocal, along with Caribbean Rights, in urging Caricom governments to keep alive demands for the international community to help restore constitutional government in Haiti under exiled president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Toward year-end, however, such a development seemed even more remote than prior to the United Nations brokered peace pact in July at Governor's Island in the USA that called for Army strongman, Raoul Cedras, to step down from power and for Aristide to return by October 30 as head of government. It was also a year that saw government and tourism officials worrying about crime. (Tourism for the estimated 30 member countries of the Caribbean Tourism Organisation in all four major language areas of the region, accounted accounted for 9.8 billion U.S. dollars in revenue for 1993, or approximtely 100 million U.S. dollars more than in 1992.) Crimes of violence, rape and murder, particularly in evidence in countries like Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Barbados, and St. Lucia, included among its victims in 1993 the prison superintendent of Trinidad and Tobago, Michael Hercules. Gunned down while on a charity mission, Hercules, hailed as one of the region's strong advocates of penal reform, was given a state funeral and praised by all sections of the society. The year saw a widening between the country's police service and the government, in particular its minister of national security, Russell Huggins, whose disagreements with both the Police Service Commission and the police commissioner, Jules Bernard, were no secret. The minister's own initiatives on structural changes and "cleansing" of the police service were related to the findings of a Scotland Yard investigative team that had found "endemic corruption" in the country's police service. But he failed to get the early retirement of Commissioner Bernard. In Jamaica where the incidence of violent crimes and charges of police corruption were also making the news, Prime Minister Patterson, was supported by opposition leader Seaga in the unprecedented appointment as police chief of the retired Army colonel, Trevor Macmillan. The year also saw an historic ruling by Britain's judicial committee of the privy council in November, commuting to life imprisonment the death sentences of Jamaican prisoners Earl Pratt and Ivan Morgan. The ruling led to intense, and at time angry debates between opponents and proponents of the death penalty. One prompt and dramatic development resulting from the privy council's ruling against the execution of those on death row beyond five years, was the decision by some Caricom governments to commute to life imprisonment the sentence of more than fifty prisoners awaiting execution for murder.
