The document included NAM's stand on issues of disarmament, international security and economic cooperation, the environment, development, South-South cooperation, human rights, social developments, regional issues, resolving conflicts, and UN reform. The document stressed that the international situation remains "extremely fluid," shrouded in confusion, and characterized by a growing tendency toward focusing primarily on the interests and concerns of a limited number of advanced countries. The NAM foreign ministers called in their final document for defining new priorities in the world order and for paying more attention to the principal development requirements and the need for reconciling the new criteria created in international relations to the cultural characters of developing countries. The ministers stressed that the continuation of the problems connected with poverty, unemployment, developmental backwardness, illiteracy, environmental deterioration, terrorism, and the drug trade will result in political and social tensions and this in turn will negatively affect international peace and security. The final document stressed the need for the contribution of the regional economic groupings to the achievement of the free flow of trade, investments, and technology across international borders and integrated commercial blocs. They expressed hope that these groupings will help establish and strengthen an open and energetic international trade order. The ministers underlined the importance of the contacts that NAM has with all the advanced industrialized countries in order to expand the North-South dialogue while simultaneously strengthening South-South cooperation. Regarding regional conflicts, the NAM foreign ministers stressed the need to strengthen the existing international mechanisms for resolving conflicts that have remained without a solution so far. The final document noted that the NAM Coordination Bureau [words indistinct]. It underlined the need to unify efforts for the sake of upholding tolerance as a solid concept in conducting international relations and as an indispensable factor in international behavior, in addition to being a principal concept in the UN Charter. The document reaffirmed the importance of not marginalizing the role of countries that are continuing their endeavors to play a principal role in international affairs. It noted the need for the international organizations to effect fundamental changes in their structures so that they can react to the arising challenges that are imposed by the new international state of affairs. The NAM foreign ministers decided to boost their efforts to attain this objective. The final document said the NAM foreign ministers discussed during their conference the role of their movement in light of changes that have recently taken place on international relations. They confirmed once again the importance of enabling the continued operation of the movement and its follow-up of new international circumstances. The final document clarified the concept of nonalignment which has embodied the hopes of mankind for comprehensive disarmament and the right to self-determination; guaranteed human rights, man's basic freedoms, and economic development; established an international economic system; and developed human resources and coexistence among the various regimes, cultures, and societies. The document said that this is why the ministers decided to continue making efforts to give NAM greater effectiveness. In this regard, the ministers welcomed the increase in the number of members in the Movement. They believe that this indicates there is continued interest in the role of NAM. They affirmed that NAM should adopt a program that would enable it to absorb the wide-ranging interests of its members and the amendments that need to be introduced into the structure and methods of the movement. The ministers recommended that relations between NAM and the Group of 77 should be strengthened. The developing countries' stands should also be advanced as a whole with the objective of bolstering their negotiations' strength with the progressive industrial states. The ministers affirmed once again their firm belief that the United Nations is the most appropriate international authority for preserving international peace and security and for cooperation for development purposes. They praised the role of the team working on reorganizing and reforming the United Nations which was formed by the Jakarta summit. They stressed that the process of reforming the United Nations should take into consideration the important changes in international relations and should re-activate the role and duties of the General Assembly. The ministers see a need for discussing the process of reforming the UN Security Council, modifying its structure, and increasing its members on democratic and geographic basis. NAM representation among the permanent members of the Security Council should be increased. The ministers once again affirmed the need to conduct the Security Council's decision-making process more openly. In order to realize this objective, they urged the Security Council to convene a larger number of official and open sessions when discussing any issue and before making any decision. This would allow greater participation on the largest scale possible. The ministers urged the Security Council to establish a basic system for regular and direct consultations with those countries contributing forces [to the United Nations] during the decision-making process with respect to setting up and administering the peacekeeping process. The ministers called for taking the appropriate measures that allow the non-members who are interested in participating in any mechanism, such as any special sub-committee the Council might form, to participate. Affirming the importance of the UN peacekeeping operations, the ministers called on NAM to participate in drawing up guiding principles for the peacekeeping operations that would conform to the UN Charter and enable the United Nations to contribute more effectively toward consolidating world peace and security. The ministers demanded that all peacekeeping operations adhere to the principles of the UN Charter, have a non-interventionist character, and be negotiated at the request of the concerned member states. The ministers affirmed the need for the peacekeeping operations to be non-discriminatory in character. They also demanded that complete openness and constant consultations be a main factor in the formation of the peacekeeping operations, which must have a clear mandate, a specific time frame, and guaranteed financing. Resolutions on the formation of these operations must include clauses pertaining to the safety of personnel. The ministers demanded equal opportunity to facilitate the widest possible participation of the member states, particularly the developing states, in the peacekeeping operations. Regarding NAM's position on decolonization, the ministers reaffirmed the right of peoples in regions that do not enjoy autonomy to self-determination and independence, in accordance with UN General Assembly Resolution 1514 of 14 September 1961. They affirmed their absolute support for the work of the UN Decolonization Committee and its effective contribution to the implementation of the declaration on granting independence to colonized states and peoples. Regarding disarmament and world security, the ministers reaffirmed the stand adopted by NAM in the final document of the Jakarta summit. They expressed the belief that total disarmament under effective international supervision remains a noble goal which must be achieved. They called for clearing the world of nuclear weapons and urged the disarmament conference to give priority to negotiations on an international agreement banning the use of nuclear weapons or the threat to use them. They urged the disarmament conference to work to conclude a comprehensive international treaty banning nuclear tests. They called on states that possess nuclear weapons to stop all experimental detonation of nuclear weapons until this treaty is concluded. The ministers stressed that the creation of nuclear-free zones is a first necessary step to achieve the goal of eliminating the weapons of mass destruction. They welcomed UN General Assembly Resolution 48/71, adopted without a vote and dated 16 December 1993, calling for the creation of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. This ideas was first proposed by Egypt and Iran. The ministers praised and called for the implementation of President Husni Mubarak's initiative declaring the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass destruction. They expressed the belief that the removal of nuclear weapons from the region will lead to the removal of weapons of mass destruction. They urged Israel to get rid of its nuclear weapons, to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and to subject all its nuclear installations to the comprehensive safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The ministers welcomed the progress made in drafting a treaty or agreement declaring Africa a nuclear-free zone. They also welcomed Mongolia's 1992 declaration making its territory free of nuclear weapons. On NAM's position on international economic cooperation, the ministers expressed the belief that it is necessary to adequately treat the usual problems of the world economy. The nonaligned states and other developing countries must contribute toward the formation of a new world economic order. They noted the low growth rate in the developing countries, the debt burdens, and the low prices of basic commodities. The ministers stressed the need for coordination between the Caracas working program of the Group of 77 and NAM's working program for economic cooperation. A joint coordinating committee must consolidate relations between the two groups. The ministers affirmed the importance of South-South cooperation as a basic factor in the efforts to reorganize international relations and as a vital tool to expedite development in the developing states. They asked the ministerial economic cooperation committee to give priority to discussing this issue and to submit its recommendations in this regard to NAM's 11th Summit Conference, which will discuss these recommendations and issue the appropriate resolutions. The ministers called on the nonaligned countries and other developing countries to intensify and strengthen current efforts for South-South cooperation, to use new tangible forms and priorities for cooperation, and to adopt practical methods to implement this cooperation. Concerning the GATT, the ministers stressed that developing nations should be accorded the benefits spelled out by preferential agreements and that they must be given appropriate financial and technological aid to be able to diversify their exports and compensate the direct losses they will suffer as a result of the liberalization of world trade. The ministers announced that the agreements, rules, and new structures agreed on during GATT's Uruguay meeting must yield greater opportunities to the countries of the world, particularly developing countries, to reach new markets, expand world trade, raise incomes, and provide more jobs. The ministers voiced concern about certain parties' tendency to circumvent the multinational structures for liberalizing trade which were agreed on during GATT's Uruguay meeting. They said this is done by exploiting environmental and social issues as pretexts for new forms of protectionism. The ministers urged the developed countries to limit their coercive and unilateral economic measures against developing countries for political purposes. They also asked them not to impose political conditions on international cooperation. They called on the world community to adopt firm and effective measures to end such practices. The ministers underlined their belief in facilitating and encouraging private sector business activities in view of the private sector's major role in promoting cooperation among the countries of the South. They expressed satisfaction at the implementation of the constituent treaty of the African economic group, seeing it as a step toward greater South-South cooperation. The ministers again asserted that the international trade preferential system is an important method of strengthening and expanding trade among developing countries and urged the countries that have not yet signed this agreement to do so. The ministers emphasized the United Nations' major role in promoting international cooperation for the sake of economic and social development. They welcomed the UN General Assembly's resolution calling for renewed dialogue among the world's nations to encourage development through partnership. They said that this dialogue is important for mutual interests and benefit. The ministers called for canceling or at least reducing debts stemming from the developing countries' official debts and urged the prompt adoption of measures on the issue of the commercial debts that these countries owe. They urged multinational financial institutions to continue their current backing for the reduction of debts and the costs of servicing them and called for solutions to this problem that would help the economic development of countries that are facing tremendous difficulties in servicing their debt. They called on creditor countries, private banks, and multinational financial institutions to extend new and suitable financial aid to developing debtor countries, particularly those with low or medium revenues that are burdened with debt. The ministers urged holding a new international conference to finance development projects and expressed their worry about the low levels of financing offered for the economic development of poor countries. They called on the developed nations to allot 0.7 percent of their gross national product for this type of financing. The ministers stressed the importance of linkage between trade and currency issues and the need to improve the trade environment so that the developing nations can carry out their development plans. They welcomed the Moroccan king's proposal to establish a high-level inter-governmental team to study new mechanisms for international economic negotiations and to promote greater cooperation with the IMF, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization. The ministers called on the United Nations to assume a major role in backing the developing nations' efforts to build up scientific and technological capabilities and said more opportunities must be given for them to acquire new technology with favorable conditions. They demanded that developed, industrial nations stop resorting to the restrictions they now use to limit the export of technology to developing countries. The ministers welcomed the expanded cooperation program, adopted by the Nonaligned Movement's presidency, which will help organize a UN conference on human settlements in Turkey in 1996. The ministers voiced grave concern over the continuing deterioration in global food and agricultural supplies, particularly in the developing world. They emphasized the Nonaligned Movement's advocacy of a prompt and concerted effort to solve the problem of hunger in the world. In this connection they welcomed the formation of an advisory team of experts on food security and approved the recommendations that this team made during its meeting in Jakarta in January 1994. The ministers stressed the need to attach special attention to the critical economic conditions in Africa and voiced grave concern about the fact that numerous agreements on ways of handling this issue that were agreed upon at several international forums were not implemented. The ministers voiced satisfaction with the immense progress made by some developing Asian and Pacific economies and the existing cooperation between those countries and other regional partners. Concerning the Nonaligned Movement's stance on the environment and development problems, the ministers called for intense efforts to preserve the environment and reiterated their adherence to a balanced, integrated approach to development such as that which appeared in the Rio Declaration on the environment and development. They also stressed that states have a sovereign right to utilize their intrinsic resources according to their environmental and developmental policies and that these states should take care that their activities do not harm the environment of other countries or areas beyond their national jurisdiction. The ministers expressed the hope that commitments to implementing the 21st century agenda concerning new and supplementary financial resources and technology transfer easily, as indicated by the Rio Declaration, will be honored. The ministers also expressed the belief that the developing countries' financial and technological resources should be commensurate with their actual requirements. The ministers emphasized the importance of the current negotiations to devise an international agreement to combat desertification, especially in Africa, and reiterated the G-77's stand on the need to set up a fund to implement the agreement. The ministers approved the resolution adopted at the second conference of the Basel Accord, under which any cross-border transportation of toxic waste undertaken to get rid of such waste by the countries of the cooperation and economic development organization by dumping it in other countries that are not member states of that organization should be banned by 1997. They also stressed the importance of devising new charters [word indistinct] to preserve and run fish stocks in overlapping areas and stocks of fish on the high seas. The ministers noted that the developing countries' lack of adequate basic structures to prevent disasters and minimize their effects and the lack of relief structures made them the countries most affected by these disasters and they recommended that the nonaligned countries intensify cooperation in this field. The ministers reaffirmed the importance of the UN Maritime Law Agreement to the [word indistinct] of the member states and stressed the need to ratify the agreement worldwide. The ministers renewed their countries' commitment to their pledges to consolidate world respect, care, and protection of all human rights and everyone's basic freedoms according to the UN Charter. They emphasized that democracy provides an open system to protect and enhance human rights and expressed their deep concern about random massacres perpetrated in areas of armed conflict. As regards human rights, the ministers reaffirmed that, although human rights are of a universal nature, they should be viewed by considering the importance of various national and regional characteristics and historical, cultural, and religious backgrounds. The ministers reiterated that all forms of racism, social discrimination, new forms of racism, and hatred of foreigners constitute a grave violation of human rights and should be combated with all means. They expressed their profound concern over the emergence of stringent immigration policies in many developed countries imposing firm restrictions on people's movement and leading to hatred of foreigners. The ministers affirmed that the right to development is universal and that the international community should support collective cooperation the achievement of which requires devising new, suitable development policies. The ministers emphasized that terrorism is a violation of human rights and openly condemned all forms of terrorism. They stressed that sponsoring terrorism, allowing the use of a particular country for planning, organizing, provoking, or committing terrorist acts against other countries is a breach of the principles of the UN Charter. They urged the international community to enhance cooperation in combating the danger of terrorism anywhere, no matter who perpetrates such an act or who is subjected to it at national, regional, and world levels. The ministers discussed the status of human rights in the provinces of the former Yugoslavia and stated that ethnic cleansing was the direct cause of the bulk of the grave and organized violations of human rights and that their primary victims are the Muslims who are threatened with near-annihilation. They urged all countries to adopt immediate measures to combat this odious practice and expressed concern at the continued violation of Muslims' human rights in Sanjaq and Kosovo. As regards social development, the ministers reiterated that structural adjustment programs and foreign debts should not be allowed to have a negative effect on human development programs. They also affirmed the Nonaligned Movement's commitment to enhancing international cooperation in social development and stressed the need for national efforts and international cooperation to give priority to eliminating poverty, increasing productive labor, creating a suitable international social and economic climate to overcome the obstacles blocking economic and social development. The ministers renewed the Movement's support for holding the fourth women's labor conference for equality, development, and peace, due to be held in Beijing in 1995. They decided to coordinate their efforts to devise a working program to expedite the removal of impediments blocking women's full participation in various fields. The ministers reiterated that child rights require more protection and improvement. They called for consolidated efforts to improve conditions for children all over the world and expressed concern at critical conditions for children in many parts of the world as a result of improper social and economic circumstances, natural disasters, armed disputes, illiteracy, hunger, and disability. They condemned the exploitation of children in armed disputes and called on all NAM governments that have not as yet ratified the child rights agreement to do so as soon as possible. The ministers suggested that member governments allocate 20 percent of their budgets to human development, particularly to children, and called for urgent measures to prevent the exploitation of children in prostitution and the distribution of pornography, as well as the illicit trade in children, all of which are poisons that affect children, particularly in developing states. The ministers noted that the heads of states and governments addressed an appeal during the Jakarta summit to all competent UN agencies to intensify efforts to work out a practical plan to develop youth. They called for setting a date to hold the UN General Assembly meeting on youth issues in 1995. The foreign ministers voiced their deep concern at the risks involved in the abuse of and trade in drugs and at the mental influence of drugs that still undermines society's ethical and physical aspects and the life and future of new generations, particularly in view of the growing demand for drugs in developing countries. They drew attention to the growing links between drug traffickers and terrorists, which left a negative impact on peace and stability in different corners of the world. They called for coordinated and exhaustive international action that addresses the various aspects of the problem, including efforts to curb poverty and increase development aid to developing states to allow their inhabitants, particularly farmers and their families, to break free from the circle of drug dealing. The NAM foreign ministers reiterated support for the principles of national sovereignty and noninterference in the internal affairs of other states. They noted that the issue of drug trafficking should not be turned into an instrument for the pursuit of political goals. They appealed to nonaligned and developing states to enhance cooperation in fighting drugs. Touching on general political issues, the foreign ministers reiterated their support for the peace process that started with the Madrid conference to achieve a just, lasting, and all-embracing peace in the Middle East on the basis of UN Resolutions 242 and 338 and the land-for-peace principle. They recognized the significance of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles signed on 13 September and the agreement signed in Cairo on 4 May, which represents a first step toward implementing that declaration. They also recognized the importance of the Jordanian-Israeli joint agenda, hoping to see urgent progress along the other tracks through Israel's compliance with the basic prerequisites of peace in the Middle East. The NAM ministers reiterated that comprehensive peace in the Middle East must result in Israel's full withdrawal from all the Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem, from the Syrian Golan, from the Jordan territories occupied since 1967, and from the occupied Lebanese territories. They stressed that this peace should also result in endorsing the lawful national rights of the Palestinian people, primarily their right to self-determination on their national soil; providing guarantees for peace for all regional states within safe and internationally-recognized borders; and solving the problems of Palestinian refugees and Israeli settlements. The Iranian delegation objected to these two paragraphs. Referring to UN Security Council Resolution 252, which calls on Israel to revoke all the measures that changed the legal status of the city of Jerusalem, the ministers reiterated that all the legislative and administrative measures Israel adopted as an occupation authority, particularly announcing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, are null and void. They affirmed that the issue of Jerusalem cannot be resolved by unilateral measures. The foreign ministers reiterated that the Israeli settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 are illegal, constitute a hurdle on the road to peace, and should be dismantled. They once again emphasized the need to take sufficient measures to guarantee peace and protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territories. They called on Israel to take measures to facilitate the return of Palestinians deported since 1967, to speed up the release of detained Palestinians, and to respect the basic freedoms of the Palestinian people. They stressed that all the measures Israel took to change the features and legal status of Syria's occupied Golan Heights are null and void and constitute a blatant violation of international law. The ministers praised the recent positive developments in Lebanon represented by the continuing progress in the process of national reconciliation. They called for respect for Lebanon's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. They condemned the continuing Israeli occupation of parts of southern Lebanon and western al-Biqa' Valley. They affirmed the need for the reconstruction of Lebanon. The ministers reviewed the situation between Iraq and Kuwait and stressed that all NAM member states are committed to respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of both Kuwait and Iraq. They also emphasized that the full implementation of all the relevant UN Security Council resolutions constitutes the means of establishing peace, security, and stability in the region. They urged Iraq to confirm its recognition, clearly and unequivocally, of Kuwait's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and demarcated international borders by accepting Resolution 833, in order to create a positive climate, leading to security and stability in the region. The ministers urged Iraq to complete the implementation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions on the release of Kuwaiti detainees and the settlement of the issue of missing persons. The Iraqi delegation objected to this paragraph. The ministers noticed the progress in the ongoing contacts between Iraq on the one hand and the Special Committee and the IAEA on the other with a view to implementing Paragraph C of Security Council Resolution 687. The ministers called for an end to human suffering in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions. The Iraqi delegation demanded that the words "of the Iraqi people" be entered after the words "human suffering." Regarding Yemen, the ministers expressed their support for the ongoing efforts to solve the conflict through peaceful means, establish peace and stability, and resume the dialogue among the Yemeni parties, particularly Security Council Resolution 924/1994, including an immediate cessation of fighting, an end to supplies of arms and other military hardware which could contribute to continued fighting, and the dispatch of a fact-finding mission to the area, as soon as possible, to help resume the dialogue among the Yemeni parties. The ministers affirmed that political differences cannot be settled by the use of arms. They urged all Yemeni parties to return immediately to the negotiating table so as to allow a peaceful resolution of their disputes, the restoration of peace and stability, and the safeguarding of the interests of the Yemeni people. This will positively contribute to maintaining peace in the whole region. The Yemeni delegation objected to this paragraph's non-mention of Yemeni unity. Regarding Libya, the ministers welcomed Libya's acceptance of Security Council Resolution 731. They reaffirmed their hope that the concerned parties will find a peaceful and just settlement that will secure the interests and rights of all parties in accordance with international law and the principles of the UN Charter. They expressed their concern over the negative consequences of the continuation of the crisis on the Libyan people, the neighboring countries, and the whole region. The ministers urged the parties concerned to refrain from any action that would result in escalation and to settle the crisis in a peaceful and speedy manner in accordance with Chapter 6 of the UN Charter. They welcomed Arab League Resolution 5373 issued on 27 March 1994 and urged the Security Council to take into consideration the new proposal this resolution contains with a view to finding a peaceful and fair solution. Regarding African issues, the ministers welcomed the OAU's establishment of a mechanism for the prevention, management, and resolution of conflicts in accordance with a resolution issued by the conference of the African heads of state and government held in Cairo in June 1993. They expressed the hope that the establishment of this pioneer mechanism would bring a new institutional dynamism to deal with conflicts in Africa. The ministers welcomed South Africa's membership in the OAU and NAM. They wished the new republic a successful and prosperous future. They paid special tribute to President Nelson Mandela as a leader of stature commanding the respect of the international community and the confidence of the people of South Africa. They welcomed the UN Security Council resolution lifting the economic sanctions against South Africa. The ministers welcomed the Addis Ababa agreement signed by all Somali factions on 27 March 1993. They praised the efforts of President Husni Mubarak in his capacity as OAU chairman and the efforts of Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi on behalf of the OAU to achieve national reconciliation in Somalia. The ministers agreed to explore the possibility of holding an international conference on Somalia. They urged the international community to adopt an effective and large-scale program for reconstruction and development in Somalia. The ministers voiced extreme concern over the tragic conditions facing the Angolan people as a consequence of UNITA's [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] refusal to accept the results of the September 1992 elections and its resumption of military actions, causing grievous loss of life and property damage. The ministers urged UNITA to accept unconditionally the results of the country's democratic elections and to negotiate with the government in good faith so that the current negotiations in Lusaka would produce an agreement capable of maintaining a lasting peace in Angola. They appealed to the world community to send prompt humanitarian aid to the residents of Angolan areas that have suffered war damage. Regarding the Rwandan crisis, the ministers expressed profound regret over the tragic events there which have displaced or killed hundreds of thousands of people and created huge numbers of refugees. They urged an immediate halt to the violence and killings ravaging that country and called on the concerned parties to adopt a spirit of national reconciliation, end the violence, and form a new government. The ministers appealed to the world community to send generous relief supplies and other humanitarian aid to the Rwandan people and refugees. They also called for additional economic, financial, and technical assistance to rebuild that country. The ministers expressed their appreciation to the Burundian Government and people for their commitment to national reconciliation. They welcomed the formation of a state council and a new transitional government in Liberia on 7 March 1994, regarding this as a positive step toward stability in Liberia. The ministers expressed solidarity with the Sierra Leonean Government's efforts to repulse the raids and rebellion of the United Revolutionary Front. They urged this government to continue its efforts to put a quick end to the rebellion. The ministers praised the recent positive achievements in Mozambique illustrated by the implementation of the peace agreement between the Mozambican Government and Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance]. They also welcomed the Libyan-Chadian agreement to adhere to [the international ruling on] the Aouzou Strip. They reiterated the Nonaligned Movement's support for the UN efforts to organize a referendum in the Western Sahara. As for the Korean crisis, the ministers expressed concern over the continued partition of the Korean peninsula and voiced support for the Korean people's efforts to reunite their country. They noted the importance of maintaining peace and security in the peninsula for the sake of the Korean nation's prosperity. They expressed hope that the Korean nuclear issue would be settled peacefully by way of negotiations and dialogue. Concerning Afghanistan, the ministers expressed concern over the fighting there and appealed to the Afghan leaders to observe an immediate and unconditional cease-fire, settle their differences by peaceful dialogue, and form a stable government on the basis of free and fair elections. As to the Latin American region, the ministers acknowledged that this region has effectively participated in nonaligned activities and that its contributions to the shaping of a new world order are indispensable. Regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina the ministers welcomed the agreements recently signed in Washington between the Bosnian and Croatian leaders and expressed hope that further positive steps will be made. They voiced concern over the acts of extermination and ethnic cleansing against the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and affirmed that the UN Security Council should impose a total halt to fighting all over that country. The conference adopted a resolution calling for respect for Bosnia-Herzegovina's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The resolution called for holding a UN-sponsored international conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina to attain a cease-fire and declare the entire country a safe haven.
