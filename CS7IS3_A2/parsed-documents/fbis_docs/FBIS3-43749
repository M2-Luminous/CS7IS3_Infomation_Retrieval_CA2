The Transvaal IFP leader Themba Khoza says the stayaway call has been made by local traditional Zulu leaders and not the IFP. Khoza was speaking at a news conference called to explain an apparent clash between IFP national and the Transvaal region. Reports have said that West Rand IFP leader Humphrey Ndlovu called on Zulus to stay away and to go to Pretoria's Union Buildings on Monday. That's because President F.W. de Klerk is meeting Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. IFP national spokesman Ziba Jiyane distanced the IFP from the call, now Khoza says Ndlovu was misquoted. [Begin Khoza recording] The entire operations rest on the Zulu leaders, in other words, traditional leaders, representatives of Amakhosi [chiefs] in these regions who met yesterday and who actually issued the statement. The long and the short of the story is that the IFP is not the one who is doing the job. [end recording]
