The Union of the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] is blaming the government for the cease-fire violation. UNITA is even questioning the continuation of the peace negotiations. Alcides Sakala, UNITA representative in Brussels, stated that his movement wants the dialogue but the government's attitude does not allow this: [Begin Sakala recording] We believe there is no military solution for Angola's problem. We need to find a solution through negotiations, a peace solution. But for as long as the government persists in this irresponsible and criminal policy, we believe this is an attack, a serious attack on the Angolan peace process, and the government is still persisting in this irresponsible strategy. We believe that we need to find peace for Angola, we need to negotiate it. [end recording] [passage omitted]
