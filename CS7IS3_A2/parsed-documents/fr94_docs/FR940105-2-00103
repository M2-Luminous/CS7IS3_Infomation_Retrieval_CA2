FR940105-2-00103 FR940105-2-00050 B. 10 CFR 20.207(a) requires that licensed materials stored in an unrestricted area be secured against unauthorized removal from the place of storage. 10 CFR 20.207(b) requires that licensed materials in an unrestricted area and not in storage be tended under constant surveillance and immediate control of the licensee. As defined in 10 CFR 20.3(a)(17), an unrestricted area is any area access to which is not controlled by the licensee for purposes of protection of individuals from exposure to radiation and radioactive materials. Contrary to the above, on December 1 and 2, 1992, licensed material consisting of a 35 millicurie cesium-137 brachytherapy source was located, at various times, in unrestricted areas, namely, a hallway on the ninth floor of the hospital, the laundry collection area of the hospital, and a contractor's laundry facility; and at those times, the brachytherapy source was not under the constant surveillance and immediate control of the licensee. C. 10 CFR 20.105(b) requires, in part, that except as authorized by the Commission in 10 CFR 20.105(a), no licensee allow the creation of radiation levels in unrestricted areas which, if an individual were continuously present in the area, could result in his receiving a dose in excess of 2 millirems in any one hour or 100 millirems in any seven consecutive days. Contrary to the above, on December 1 and 2, 1992, the licensee allowed the creation of radiation levels, at various times, in unrestricted areas, namely, in a hallway on the ninth floor of the hospital, in the laundry collection area of the hospital, and a contractor's laundry facility, such that if an individual were continuously present in the area, he could have received a dose in excess of 2 millirems in any one hour or 100 millirems in any seven consecutive days. These violations are classified in the aggregate as a Severity Level III problem. (Supplements IV and VI) Civil Penalty_$2,500 Summary of Licensee Response to the Violations in Section I The Licensee, in its response, states that the safety significance of the loss of the source was minimal, noting that the potential absorbed dose to any member of the general public as a result of this incident was well below regulatory limits. Further, the Licensee argues that the possibility of public exposure was minimized by the hospital's prompt search for and discovery of the source. The Licensee believes that personnel and members of the public who may have been exposed to the source received only a minimal dose as a result of this incident, noting that its calculations indicate that the maximum dose to any exposed individual was unlikely to have exceeded a total of 30 millirems. While the Licensee recognizes that, under postulated worst case conditions, the exposure rate at distances less than 2.4 meters could have exceeded the NRC's applicable limits for the general public, the Licensee argues that this exposure condition would only have existed for very short periods of time, on the order of several minutes, and with the bulk of the postulated exposure at a dose rate well below NRC's standards for the general public. The Licensee also notes that the source was located in linen that was removed from a patient's room, and that since the linen is treated as a biologically hazardous waste, it is highly unlikely that a person would have any extended contact with the source once it had left the patient's room. The Licensee states that immediately upon discovery that a source was missing, the Radiation Safety Officer, and the resident physician who misplaced the source, conducted a search that promptly located and safely recovered the missing source. The Licensee further contends that despite this corrective action, the NRC chose to treat the sequential consequences which flowed from the initial failure as separate violations which could be treated in the aggregate and escalated to a Severity Level III problem. In addition, while the Licensee recognizes the NRC's authority to cite for each separate violation, the Licensee believes that the circumstances of the violations do not represent a programmatic breakdown in its radiation safety program, and even when aggregated, do not have the safety or regulatory significance to be considered a Severity Level III problem. The Licensee argues that the 100 percent escalation of the civil penalty was not warranted since the Notice makes reference to an incident that occurred in 1989. The NRC's enforcement policy states that a licensee's prior performance normally refers to a period within the last two years of the inspection at issue, or the period within the last two inspections; whichever is longer.
