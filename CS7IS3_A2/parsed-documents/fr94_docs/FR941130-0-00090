FR941130-0-00090 FR941130-0-00015 Comments: One commenter recommended that the regulations include a definition for the minimum period during which a borrower must be enrolled in school in order to qualify for the 6-month post-deferment grace period after ceasing to be enrolled. This commenter suggested that the borrower be required to complete the enrollment period. Discussion: The Secretary is quite interested in this issue and understands that there is a wide variety of interpretations of the applicability of the 6-month post-deferment grace period. As the Secretary understands it, institutions are granting the 6-month post-deferment grace period in one of four ways: (1) granting a 6-month post-deferment grace period regardless of the period of time the borrower is enrolled, even if it is only for one day; (2) granting a 6-month post-deferment grace period (and also a ``student'' deferment) only after the enrollment records are finalized, usually 5 or 6 weeks into the term; (3) granting the 6-month post-deferment grace period only if the borrower is enrolled longer than the borrower's repayment billing period; or (4) requiring the borrower to complete the enrollment period. The statute requires granting the post-deferment grace period for ``any period'' the borrower qualifies for a deferment, and a borrower qualifies for a ``student'' deferment for ``any period'' of enrollment as at least a half-time student. Therefore, any institution that is granting post-deferment grace periods under the first condition is in compliance with the Federal Perkins Loan program regulations. All other institutions need to modify the procedures used for determining eligibility for post-deferment grace periods and also student deferments. While the statute allows an institution much discretion in administering the Federal Perkins Loan program, the granting of deferments and post-deferment grace periods to qualified non-defaulted borrowers and the granting of cancellation benefits to qualified borrowers are not at the institution's discretion. These provisions are an entitlement to the borrower once the borrower has provided a written request and acceptable documentation to the institution. The Secretary expects to revisit this issue, should the Secretary find that there is widespread abuse by borrowers of this benefit. Changes: None. Comments: A few commenters suggested that the language in §674.34 should read ``interest should not accrue'' instead of ``interest does not accrue'' for consistency with other sections. Discussion: The Secretary does not agree. Each provision in the current regulations governing the 6-month post-deferment grace period contains the language, ``interest does not accrue.'' Changes: None. Section 674.38␣Deferment Procedures Comments: Several commenters felt the proposal to require defaulted borrowers to make ``satisfactory arrangements'' to repay the loan as one of the conditions to be met in order to be granted a deferment would be unfair to the borrowers and impossible to accomplish in many cases because a borrower is in ``default'' the first day a payment is missed. Several commenters felt the provisions in the current regulations should be maintained. Discussion: The Secretary agrees that implementation of this provision as written in the proposed rule is unfair to borrowers and agrees that the current regulatory provision should be maintained. The Secretary reminds the commenters that §674.37(a)(2) provides the option to an institution to declare a borrower in default if the borrower fails to supply a deferment request and documentation. The fact that a borrower is in ``default'' the first day after a payment is missed is more significant for the cohort default rate calculation. The borrower still has the opportunity to respond to the demand letters before being reported to a national credit bureau, for example, even though this borrower would be counted as a default for purposes of the cohort default rate calculation. Changes: The Secretary is withdrawing the proposed language in favor of the current language of §674.37(b). Section 674.39␣Postponement of Loan Repayment Comments: A few commenters felt that postponement of loan repayment in anticipation of cancellation should reflect loans made before ``July 23, 1992'' not before ``July 1, 1992.'' Discussion: There is a typographical error in this section. The date should be ``July 1, 1993.'' The Secretary has included this date to provide for those borrowers who are eligible for cancellation benefits but are not eligible for the new deferment provisions (borrowers whose loans were made on or after July 23, 1992, but before July 1, 1993). Changes: The Secretary will change this section to reflect ``July 1, 1993.'' Section 674.43(a)(3)␣Billing Procedures Comments: While several commenters supported the Secretary's proposal to amend section 674.43 to allow a borrower to elect to repay his or her Federal Perkins loan by means of the electronic transfer of funds from the borrower's bank account, they felt the Secretary should modify this proposal even further to allow for annual notification to the borrower regardless of the repayment frequency. These commenters felt that this requirement was too burdensome. Discussion: The Secretary agrees. Using the electronic method of repaying a loan is quite similar to the coupons system, and no statement of account is required under this system. However, the borrower has the remaining coupons to demonstrate the amount still due on the loan. This does not exist under the electronic system, and the borrower needs to be kept apprised of the status of his or her account. This statement of account needs to be no more frequent than annually. As part of the Secretary's effort to be mindful of the burden imposed by regulations on the institution, the Secretary is reducing burden in this provision by requiring only an annual statement of account.
