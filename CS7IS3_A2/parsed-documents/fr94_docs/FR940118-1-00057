A Type V PFD is a PFD that, unlike other PFD Types, has limitations on its approval. (b) The approval tests in this subpart require each Type V hybrid PFD to have at least Type I, II, or III performance if permitted by its intended size range. (c) A hybrid PFD may be approved for use on recreational boats, commercial vessels or both if the applicable requirements are met. §160.077&hyph;9 [Redesignated as §160.077&hyph;5] 8.
