In a statement, NP Director of Information Marthinus van Schalkwyk said the ANC was totally unrealistic and made promises they would never fulfil. The massive state intervention proposed in, for instance, the field of housing was exactly the kind of thing that would destroy the economy and result in widespread unemployment and poverty, he said. "The ANC has not learnt from the collapse of the socialist states in Africa and Eastern Europe," he said. Mr Van Schalkwyk warned that if the manifesto ever became policy, South Africans would pay much higher taxes.
