Brief Review of 1993 Work In 1993, all fronts in the municipality deeply implemented Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks and the guidelines of the 14th party congress, conscientiously implemented the tasks as set forth at the sixth municipal party congress and the First Session of the 12th Municipal People's Congress, unified thinking, quickened the pace of advance, made new headway in various aspects on the basis of the previous achievements, and made noticeable achievements. The national economy developed in a sustained, fast, and sound manner. The main economic targets could be overfulfilled and the economic growth rate was higher than that in the previous year. Some of them reached peak levels when compared with those in the previous years. Positive achievements were made in macroeconomic regulation and control. The gross national product was expected to surpass 50 billion yuan, an increase of about 12 percent over the previous year and the second fastest growth year since the implementation of the reform and opening up policy. The total industrial output value was expected to surpass 120 billion yuan, an increase of about 24 percent. The municipality made achievements in halting deficits and increasing profits. The rural economy developed in a sustained manner. After combating the serious droughts, we reaped bumper grain harvests for 10 consecutive years. The total output value of town and township enterprises was expected to reach 54 billion yuan, an increase of 36 percent. Markets were brisk and there were ample supplies of commodities. The total volume of retail sales of commodities was expected to increase by 17 percent over the previous year. The 1993 urban and rural capital construction tasks were better fulfilled when compared with the previous years. A group of infrastructural facilities were completed and began operation ahead of schedule. A total of 2.4 million square meters of new residential houses were built, an increase of more than 600,000 square meters over the previous year. The investment in fixed assets was expected to increase by 32.4 percent. The investment structure was further optimized. The revenues increased by about 20 percent and the revenue growth rate was higher than that in the previous 10 years or so. The urban and rural people's livelihood was further improved. Bigger strides were made in reform and opening up. Enterprise reform was being deepened. The experiments with various reforms were quickened. Approval was made in 54 shareholding enterprises. The small-sized state-owned enterprises positively carried out the system characterized by state ownership, civilian management, amalgamation, and shareholding cooperation. The trend of setting up markets was good. There were 11 state- and regional-level wholesale markets in the province. The reform of the land utilization system and the housing system was steadily carried out. The social security system started to be carried out. The trend of opening to the outside world was good. A total of 3,500 items on using foreign capital and the relevant agreements involving $3.5 billion in investment were signed, including $2.25 billion worth of foreign capital, respectively increasing by 100 percent, 82 percent, and 84.6 percent over the previous year. The municipality made noticeable achievements again on the basis of the achievements made in 1992 when the amount of foreign capital used during the year surpassed the total volume of the previous 13 years. The developmental zones tended to develop forcefully. The major economic targets of the development zones ranked the municipality among the best in the whole country. Bonded areas made noticeable achievements in the introduction of businessmen, development, and construction. The new technology industrial park zones developed in a sustained and faster manner. The twelve small development zones made a good start in development. Situations in the social and political fields of the entire municipality were also very good. The municipality, as well as various districts and counties, smoothly completed the end-of-term reshuffle of their leading bodies. Party committees and governments at all levels adhered to the principle of "attending to two tasks simultaneously and achieving competence in both" and won notable results in building the spiritual civilization, improving democracy and the legal system, and strengthening party building. Tianjin continued to be one of the areas with the best public security in the country. The anticorruption struggle produced remarkable achievements. Party committees and governments at all levels established the system to complete work within a definite time and the system for various departments to coordinate in work. Education, science and technology, culture and art, public health and sports, family planning, and environmental protection all made new headway, and an important breakthrough was achieved in producing movies and television programs. After the publication of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, in particular, the vast number of cadres and the masses conducted earnest study of it in line with their thinking and work reality. A new upsurge in the study was created very quickly throughout the municipality, and an encouraging situation in theoretical study unseen for many years emerged. There were also problems and deficiencies in the work of 1993. Our economic development still lagged behind others, with the growth of gross national product lower than national average and economic efficiency not good enough. Some weak links still existed in economic development and the economic structure had yet to be adjusted more rapidly. Work proceeded in an uneven manner, and some units lacked the sense of urgency and responsibility. On the whole, our gap lies mainly in our inadequacy in the depth in the emancipation of the mind, in the extent of reform and opening up, and in the degree of economic development. 2. Unifying Thinking With Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Theory as the Foundation for Successful Work The year 1994 will be a very crucial year for Tianjin. To win success in the work for 1994 and achieve a significant breakthrough and development, the most important thing is to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to unify our thinking and guide our action. The theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics that Comrade Deng Xiaoping established inherits, enriches, and develops Mao Zedong Thought, is the Marxism of contemporary China, and is the basic guarantee for achieving success in work and promoting reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. We should conscientiously study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee in line with the reality of the current reform and development and further enhance our understanding and unify our thinking concerning the following issues. A. We should profoundly understand the important idea that "development is the essential criterion" and be more conscious and steadfast in implementing the party's basic line. Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasized that development is the essential criterion, and that "poverty is not socialism, nor is sluggish development." We should fully understand that, as far as Tianjin is concerned, if our development is slow and economy not promoted in the next few years, the development in various social undertakings will be out of the question, the existing contradictions and problems will become increasingly conspicuous, and people's living standard cannot be duly improved. This is indeed a major issue concerning the future and destiny of Tianjin and the basic interests of the 9 million people of the municipality and also an urgent and acute issue for the entire municipality. We should embrace a strong sense of development, enhance our sense of urgency and responsibility, and persistently take economic construction as the central task without wavering. Faster development depends on the hard work of everyone. All the people have the responsibility and should feel the pressure, and all departments and individuals should take the initiative in serving this public interest and channel their work to the track of faster development of the municipality. B. We should profoundly understand the importance of "seizing the opportunity" and become more urgent in accelerating development. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out on many occasions: "Do not miss the opportunity." For China, there are not many opportunities for effecting a large-scale development." We must foster a strong sense of opportunity. We should profoundly understand that whether we are good at seizing the opportunity is the key question to decide whether we can gain the initiative in accelerating development. The year 1994 provides a hard-won opportunity for Tianjin. When viewed from the current situation at home and abroad and from the situation of Tianjin, there are many favorable conditions for accelerating development, but there are also many difficulties. When viewed from the overall situation, however, we are indeed faced with the historical opportunity of effecting a large-scale development. All comrades must approach this issue from an overall and strategic point of view. Lacking the sense of urgency in seizing the opportunity and in accelerating development means lacking the sense of responsibility for our undertakings. Being unable to seize the opportunity and to accelerate development means bungling major matters and means, so far as leading cadres are concerned, dereliction of duties and irresponsibility for the party's cause and the people. We must seize the opportunity without any delay and slackness so as to bring forth a new vigorous situation of racing against time to accelerate Tianjin's reform, opening up, and economic development. C. We should profoundly understand the "quintessence" of "emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts" and should conscientiously break away with all sorts of ideas that hamper the rapid development of the economy. When making an inspection tour of Tianjin in 1986, Comrade Deng Xiaoping demanded us to "take bolder steps and effect a faster development." He also pointed out: "Without the pioneering spirit, we cannot break a good path and a new path and cannot pioneer a new cause." Leading cadres at all levels must even more consciously persist in the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from fact and must further emancipate the mind. On the premise of conforming to the standard of "being conducive to developing socialist productive forces, to building up the comprehensive strength of the socialist country, and to improving the people's living standards," we should dare to reform the conventions that are detrimental to developing the socialist market economy, dare to pioneer the new path for emancipating and developing the socialist productive forces, dare to promote reform and development, and dare to overcome the ideas of sticking to conventions and being content with the existing state of affairs. We should foster lofty ideals, aim high, dare to create a new situation, and resolutely overcome the ideas of blaming god and men and attempting and accomplishing nothing. We should be more urgent in accelerating the development of Tianjin, be more brave in doing pioneering work, be more enthusiastic in dedicating ourselves to the state. We should enhance our morale and work energetically to achieve self-respect, self-improvement, and self-confidence. We should arouse ourselves for vigorous efforts to make the country prosperous, should be bold in making innovations, and should work hard to pioneer new undertakings so as to restore the magnificent view of Tianjin. We should truly achieve dialectical integration in the fields of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. Now that we are doing our best to accelerate economic development, we should accelerate it as fast as possible and act according to our capability in order to avoid losses, serious losses in particular. D. We should profoundly understand the principle of "taking a two-handed approach and being touch with both hands" and actually build well the spiritual civilization in order to create favorable conditions for accelerating economic development. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out on many occasions that we should "take a two-handed approach and being tough with both hands." Under the new situation, we should truly have the sense of urgency in two aspects and embark on new stages in two aspects, that is, we should enhance the sense of urgency and the sense of responsibility not only in accelerating economic development but also in building spiritual civilization and should push both economic construction and spiritual civilization construction onto new stages. Leaders at all levels should keep sober-minded, enhance consciousness, strengthen initiative, and strive for attaining new levels in order to ensure the smooth progress of Tianjin's reform, opening up, and modernization drive. 3. The Major Tasks of 1994 in Reform, Opening Up, and in Economic and Social Development The general demands of the municipal work in 1994 are to comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, seize the opportunity to accelerate the pace of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, maintain a sustained, speedy, and sound development, strengthen the building of spiritual civilization, promote comprehensive social progress, and achieve breakthroughs and major development in expediting the establishment of the socialist market economic structure and prefulfilling the second-step development objectives. In 1994, party committees and governments at all levels must concentrate greater energy on accelerating reform and expediting development. They must propose ideas for realizing the work objective of deepening reform, expanding opening up, and accelerating economic and social development, and further deepening the emancipation of the mind; expand the degree of reform and opening up, and adopt major measures; achieve great breakthroughs in all undertakings by making earnest efforts to do practical work and firmly implementing measures; and attain the goal of seizing the opportunity and realizing great development. In work guidance, we must pay attention to grasping five principles well. First, we should attend to the relationship between the quantity and quality of economic development. We should always persist in taking economic construction as the central task, and concentrate efforts on pushing economic construction forward. In developing the economy, we must have new ideas and realistically channel our ideas to the path of taking enhancement of economic efficiency as the central task. Regarding all economic targets, we must adopt measures to fulfill them with earnest efforts, continue to attend to the work of ending deficits and increasing profits, and through raising economic efficiency, enable financial departments at all levels to collect more revenue, enterprises to earn more profits (money-losing enterprises to further reduce deficits), and the broad masses of workers to increase more income in an effort to unceasingly raise the living standards of the Tianjin people. In developing the economy, we should pay attention to the increase in total supply and demands, raise the quality, exert efforts to readjust the structure, strengthen management, achieve technological progress, and raise efficiency in an effort to combine rate with economic returns. Second, we should attend to the relations of reform, development and stability. Since development is our aim and reform is the motivation and fundamental way of development, we should cultivate the idea of relying on reform to accelerate development. In addition, we should fully understand that only under the condition of maintaining social stability can reform, opening up, and economic development be smoothly carried out. We should accelerate economic development by deepening reform and expanding opening up. In making arrangements for economic work, we should pay attention to creating a fairly relaxed environment for reform. In 1994, the whole country will make big strides in reform and issue many measures which will involve the readjustment of some patterns of interests. We must do in-depth and meticulous work to prepare for the issuance of measures, properly handle all contradictions and problems, maintain a stable political and social environment, and create good conditions for smoothly promote reform and development. Third, we should attend to the relationship between advancing the work in an all-round manner and making breakthroughs in some major aspects. The municipality as a whole should make big strides in all fields of work, seek improvements, achieve major progress, and comprehensively promote the work. meanwhile, we should firmly grasp the major work and important aspects that affect the overall situation, and never lose opportunity to seek breakthroughs in some major aspects. In the work objective, the increase of major economic targets, such as the GNP, and all major work should be better than that of 1993; great breakthroughs should be made in major work and some weak aspects; and efforts should be made to maintain a certain level in some aspects and to strive to march towards the front rank of the country. Fourth, we should handle well the relationship between faster economic development and comprehensive social progress. While accelerating reform, opening up, and economic development, we should attach great importance to the development of various social undertakings, conscientiously strengthen the spiritual civilization, democracy, legal system, and comprehensive management of public security, safeguard political and social stability, maintain coordinated economic and social development, and promote comprehensive social progress. Fifth, we should handle well the relationship between consolidation and improvement on the one hand and innovation and development on the other. We should greatly value, earnestly persist in, and continuously improve and upgrade the good work foundation, traditions, experiences, and methods that have taken shape in Tianjin over the past many years. We should also continuously achieve innovation and development to comply with the new situation. Regarding the major issues concerning the overall situation and the existing weak links, in particular, we should all the more adopt major measures and open up a new situation. To meet the general requirements of Tianjin's work for 1994, we should pay attention to the following 15 tasks. A. We should deepen enterprise reform, transform the operating mechanism, and gradually establish a modern enterprise system. Accelerating enterprise reform is the most important task for deepening reform. All enterprises in the municipality, especially state-owned large and medium-sized ones, should achieve a breakthrough in transforming the operating mechanism. First, we should continue to thoroughly enforce the "enterprise law" and the "regulations" and delegate to enterprises all the powers and responsibilities they should hold. Second, we should accelerate the reform of the organizational, managerial, financial, and accounting systems of enterprises. Enterprises' inner accounting units should be made smaller based on the actual conditions, and a market mechanism should be established within enterprises. We should streamline enterprises' inner managerial levels and personnel and comprehensively facilitate and further deepen their reform of the labor, personnel, and wage systems. Third, relevant government departments should change their functions, make less interventions, and provide more service so that enterprise can have a free hand in management. More than 80 percent of Tianjin's state-owned enterprises should meet the requirements on transformation of the operating mechanism by 1994. We should conduct reform of enterprises' property right system in an active and prudent manner. State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises with sole investor may be reorganized into sole-invested companies when conditions permit; and those with multiple investors may be reorganized into limited liability companies or limited liability stock companies whose stocks are issued to definite units. Some should make active efforts to win state approval for reorganizing themselves into limited liability stock companies which issue stocks publicly to society, including foreign countries; others may cooperate with foreign firms to establish limited liability companies or limited liability stock companies; and still others may institute the cooperative shareholding system. New or expanded enterprises should adopt the new mechanism and enforce the company system. We should actively develop the enterprise groups linked mainly by property right and should expand the merge and cooperation between enterprises. These types of reform should be conducted in the 100 budgetary state-owned large and medium-sized industrial enterprises that we have arranged. Regarding small state-owned enterprises, their management should be actively contracted or leased out to people while their state-owned status remaining unchanged, or they may adopt the cooperative shareholding system to them. Some of them may be sold to collectives or individuals. Small state-owned commercial enterprises should actively conduct these types of reform, and 90 percent of them should do so in 1994. Proceeding from reality, urban and rural collective enterprises may be reorganized into shareholding enterprises or cooperative shareholding enterprises when conditions permit. We should implement the "regulations on the supervision and management of the property of state-owned enterprises" in an orderly manner; make an inventory and check of the property, define property right, and clarify debts receivable and debts payable; and achieve success in the experimental work to reduce enterprises' burden of debts, to increase the proportion of enterprises' own circulating funds, and to authorize property management right. Thirty enterprises should be selected to experiment with the modern enterprise system. It is necessary to further quicken the readjustment of the enterprise organizational structure and the industrial structure. The assets should be reorganized and the reasonable distribution of production factors should be pressed forward in line with the measures of amalgamation, transfer, auctioning, and bankruptcy. The enterprises that suffer long-term losses due to poor management should be closed down, suspended, merge with others, or shift their lines of production. Simultaneously, these enterprises can use their existing areas, workshops, and infrastructural facilities to positively develop the diversified economy. The small number of state-owned enterprises that are hopeless to halt deficits and have no ways for shifting their lines of production should settle their accounts and declare bankruptcy according to laws. Proceeding from reality, enterprises are allowed to select the reform methods suitable to themselves. On the premise of paying taxes according to laws and guaranteeing and adding the value of state-owned assets, we should try every possible means to enliven enterprises. B. It is necessary to quicken the reform in the circulation sphere and cultivate and develop the market system. We should foster the awareness of developing large-scale commerce and trade, cultivating large markets, and enlivening the circulation sphere on a large scale; be determined to quicken the pace of cultivating and developing the market system; and strive to build the municipality into a commercial and trade commercial center in north China. We should exert great efforts to well run the existing markets. The established national and regional markets for capital goods and the markets for various commodities should strive to build themselves into the first-grade markets in the country and enhance their influential power and attractiveness. Wholesale markets should be set up for bulk agriculture produce, industrially produced consumer goods, and capital goods. A group of large-scale and high- quality commodity markets should newly be built and reconstructed. Several large-sized goods purchasing centers should be set up. Another group of specialized wholesale markets and overall trade fairs should be developed in the areas linking the urban areas with the rural ones. Various categories of markets should be sure that business is brisk so as to expand and enliven their business. The total commodity purchasing and marketing volume and the total volume of retail sales of commodities should increase by a big margin. It is necessary to quicken the development of the markets for various production factors. Emphasis should be placed on setting up labor markets, skilled persons exchange and service centers, technology markets, information markets, real estate markets, construction markets, and markets for transfer of enterprise property rights. It is necessary to firmly grasp the construction of a state-level technological trading market in north China. Particularly, we should vigorously develop banking markets and positively open stock exchange centers and gold trading centers in Tianjin. We should positively develop such self-disciplined organizations as professional intermediate organizations of market, trade associations, and chambers of commerce. By dividing duties, all departments should positively support the setup of markets, abolish "unnecessary outposts," enthusiastically offer service, and try all possible means to bring in more skilled persons, goods, and capital. C. We should conscientiously implement the state macroeconomic reform measures and positively achieve the reform of the income distribution, social security, land utilization, and housing systems. In 1994, the country as a whole should make bigger strides in reforming the financial, tax revenue, financial, investment, foreign trade, and planning systems. Resolutely in line with the unified arrangements of the central authorities, we should proceed from the overall situation, make a unified arrangement, and carefully organize forces for implementation. We should conscientiously work out and implement plans, positively and steadily coordinate with various fronts, actively suit various reform requirements, and further improve and strengthen the macroeconomic regulation and control. It is necessary to set up a reasonable individual income distribution system. On the premise that the increase rate of the wage bills of the staff and workers is lower than the enterprise economic efficiency growth rate and the enterprise labor productivity growth rate, the state-owned enterprises should decontrol the management of their wages. That is, enterprises have the right to deciding their wage levels and internal distribution forms. We should conscientiously reform the wage system of organs and institutions. The administrative organs should carry out the state functionary system and the state functionary wage system. The institutions with conditions are able to carry out the enterprise wage system. We should establish a multi-layered social security system, and take active and reliable steps to accelerate reform of the old-age pension, unemployment, and medical insurance systems for workers. It is necessary to actively promote reform of the land utilization system, give full play to our municipality's advantages of land resources, adopt flexible forms, speed up the pace to invite business and investments, and achieve great breakthroughs in the scale of transferring land-use rights and in introducing foreign capital. We should further expedite the pace of reforming the housing system in cities and towns, give simultaneous attention to selling, renting and building houses while giving due emphasis to selling publicly owned houses, adopt supporting policies to form a market so as to accelerate the commercialization and socialization of houses. D. We should realistically change government functions and actively carry out organizational reform. In line with the central plans and the principle of separating government functions from enterprise management, streamlining organs, adopting unified plans, and paying attention to efficacy, we conscientiously conduct reform of the administrative management system and organizational reform, promote the public servant system, and achieve breakthrough progress in changing the government functions. Governments should not manage enterprise affairs or directly interfere with their production and management activities, and should decontrol their operation. As for macroeconomic activities which must be managed, the governments should reduce and simplify procedures and raise the working efficiency; they should realistically shift the emphasis of work to working out overall plans, attending to policies, using information guidance, organizing and coordinating the work, providing service, and inspecting and supervising the work. In short, we should strive not to interfere with the work of enterprise, give less interference, give more services, help the grass roots and enterprises eliminate misgivings and difficulties, and do more practical things for them. E. We should further expand opening up to all directions, both domestically and internationally, and accelerate the pace of using foreign capital. We should open the municipality to all directions, to the higher layer, a broader sphere, and in a comprehensive manner, and regard using foreign capital of a larger scale as a prominent task. In 1994, the whole municipality should strive to reach agreements in directly using a total of more than $5 billion in foreign capital, of which, more than $3.5 billion should be investments from foreign businessmen. All trades and professions should be bold and given a free hand in using foreign capital. It is necessary to make major breakthroughs in building infrastructure facilities, carrying out major industrial items, conducting grafting and transformation in old enterprises, and attracting big financial groups and trans-country companies to build large projects, develop real estate, and develop the tertiary industry. In addition to grasping major items, we should not neglect small ones. Through two years of efforts, we should strive to make 50 percent of industrial enterprises, of which, two-thirds of budgetary industrial enterprises, use foreign capital. We should attend to the signed foreign capital items and speed up their construction and operation as quickly as possible. All committees, offices, and bureaus, and all districts and counties should realistically strengthen leadership, encourage the top leaders to grasp this work personally, assign one leading comrade to manage it specifically, and establish special organs or work groups to take charge of the work. We should regard using foreign capital as an essential task, share the targets to all departments and localities, and conduct evaluation in line with the demand of the "six ratios." Personnel who contribute to introducing foreign capital should be awarded. We should make strenuous efforts to improve the investment environment. It is necessary to uphold and improve the system of completing the examination and approval procedures in "one place," giving "integrated" service, and jointly handling official work, actively create conditions for running the existing foreign-funded enterprises well, improve the relevant policies, laws, and regulations, do a good job in conducting external propaganda, strive to build our municipality into one of the areas with the best investment environment in our province, enable the domestic and foreign businessmen feel an ease of mind in making investments and convenient in doing things in Tianjin, and that they can earn money from production and operation, and can be guaranteed in their legal rights and interests. Economic and technological zone, free trade zone, and the new-tech industrial park are the showcases and a dragon head of Tianjin in opening to the outside world. During this year, we must have new ideas, adopt new measures, accelerate the pace of development and construction, and strive to take the lead in all fields of work in the whole country. A large-scale increase should be made in foreign export trade. We should further rationalize the foreign trade management system, transform the mechanism of foreign trade enterprises, and guide foreign trade enterprises to take the road of integration, industrialization, and internationalization. Non-foreign trade enterprises should be encouraged to deal in exports independently and strengthen their ability of dealing in export and earning foreign exchange. An even greater steps should be taken in the opening to the domestic areas. Tianjin should be opened wider to other places, and service should be improved in order to promote integrations through good service and promote development through integrations. Central departments and the places other than Tianjin should be attracted to make investment actively in Tianjin. The important role of their agencies stationed in Tianjin should be brought into full play. Emphasis should be placed on the integrations and coordination among Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei in order to commonly build the "large Beijing-Tianjin economic circle" in line with the principles of being integrated to make the best possible use of advantages and to make up for the deficiency, making overall plans, and effecting a common development. Great efforts should be made to strengthen the economic integrations and coordination with the areas in north, northeast, and northwest China, and, in particular, with various fraternal provinces and municipalities in the areas around Bohai Bay. F. We should accelerate the pace of readjustment and optimize economic structure. The acceleration of economic development must be based on optimization of structure and improvement of economic returns. Great efforts should be made to readjust product mix. All categories of enterprises in the municipality should fix their eyes on the market and try every possible means to readjust their product mix. They should renew old products and develop new products in a timely manner to make their products more competitive and marketable. Through the endeavor of one to two years, we should turn out a large number of new fine-quality, brand-name, or competitive products in order to restore the magnificent appearance of Tianjin's industry. We should further attend to the readjustment of industrial structure. In this aspect, emphasis should be placed on developing energy resources, communications and telecommunications, and basic raw materials industries and on turning out the products that coordinate the production of pillar industries and key foreign-invested enterprises of three types. Positive support should be given to light industrial and textile industrial enterprises to open up new paths and change mechanism. Construction of water, power, gas, and heat supply facilities and construction of roads and other infrastructure facilities should be accelerated to enhance cities' functions as the carrier. Great efforts should be put in accelerating the building of ports. Great efforts should also be made in developing commercial trade, storage of goods, financial insurance, transportation and communications, service to residents, information consultation, labor export, and all sorts of professional intermediate service trades. Development of tourism with Tianjin's characteristics should be expedited. Real estate trade should be developed rapidly on a priority basis. Domestic and foreign investment should be absorbed from a wide range to form a pattern of developing the tertiary industry in diverse forms, through diverse channels, and at diverse levels. Attention should be paid to readjusting investment structure, with emphasis on improving economic returns. Capital construction projects and technological transformation projects should be arranged in line with the principles of conforming to industrial policies, having good markets, and having good economic returns in order to spend the money on where they are needed most. G. We should actually strengthen management work and ask for good economic returns, efficiency, and levels from management. First, we should pay attention to management of enterprises. We should vigorously grasp the management of basic projects and special-purpose projects, strictly enforce rules of operation and various regulations and systems, strictly enforce labor discipline, straighten out production order, and achieve results in cutting production cost and improving quality. Second, we should grasp management of work. All departments and units should conscientiously perform various regulations and systems and strictly enforce work discipline in order to establish a good work order and constantly improve work efficiency and expertise. Third, we should grasp the management of trades. The emphasis of this work is to strengthen the overall, coordination, guidance, and service work. Fourth, we should grasp the management of safety. The system of assuming responsibility for the safety in production should be carried out conscientiously and the various safety control system should be executed strictly so as to eliminate all sorts of hidden peril, prevent the emergence of accidents of all kinds, and ensure the safety of state property and of the people. Fifth, we should pay attention to the management of investment. The project owner responsibility system should be applied to construction projects, and the progress of construction should be guaranteed, the quality of the projects upgraded, and the efficiency of investment improved. Sixth, we should pay attention to social management. we should strengthen the management of the overall plan of the city and establish and improve the scientific and strict managerial methods. We should strengthen management of the city appearance, municipal administration, environmental protection, and environmental sanitation and improve the management and service of the units and departments that serve as "windows" so that Tianjin can become a city with a beautiful environment, a good order, and quality service. All departments and units should bear in mind Tianjin's status as the municipality under the direct jurisdiction of the central government when considering all their work, exert great efforts to strengthen management, and ensure high standards and strict requirements so that all work will have good efficiency and high level. H. We should make great efforts to cultivate and develop new growing points of the economy. We should make great efforts to cultivate and develop more new growing points of the economy to maintain the vigorous economic growth, promote faster economic development, and enhance the capacity for long-term development. First, we should have more courage to develop township enterprises and foreign-invested enterprises, increase their number, expand their scale, raise their level, and improve their efficiency. We should relax policies and actively develop the individual and private economies. We should develop the neighborhood economy more rapidly in line with specific local conditions. We should adopt effective measures to speed up the industrialization of high and new technology. Second, from large and medium-sized industrial enterprises, we should develop a number of backbone enterprises and a number of highly competitive products which can exert a great influence, make great contributions, reflect advanced domestic and world levels, serve as models in reform and management, and pay large amounts of taxes and profits. We should carry out the "222 project." That is, we should make a success of the two key enterprises -- the Auto Industrial General Company and the Steep Tube Company, make a success of the 20 municipal-level key enterprises, and make a success of the 200 key enterprises of various bureaus, districts, and counties. Third, we should speed up the construction of the ethylene, the polyester, and other key capital construction and technical transformation projects and make the investment yield returns as soon as possible. Fourth, we should learn from the opening up and development of Shanghai's Pudong New Area to accelerate the opening up and development of Tianjin's coastal new area and strive to build it into an area with coordinated development of finance, commerce, foreign trade, and other trades of the tertiary industry, which is centering on the harbor, the development zone, and the bonded zone, guided by new and export-oriented industries, and based on several pillar industries in about 10 years. We should organize forces from all quarters to step up formulation of specific plans and definite targets and put them into practice as soon as possible. I. We should conscientiously strengthen agriculture and rural work. We should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the national rural work conference, attach great importance to agriculture and rural work, further strengthen the fundamental position of agriculture, persist in the integrated and common development of urban and rural areas, and speed up Tianjin's agricultural modernization. The general requirements are to actively develop high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture; to achieve faster development of township enterprises; to greatly promote the spiritual civilization in rural areas; and to substantially increase peasants' income. We should continue to stabilize and improve the responsibility system with household-based and output-related contracts as the major form and the dual management system combining unified operation with independent operation. Operations adaptable to scaled economy may be adopted based on the voluntary participation of the masses. We should improve the rural socialized service system, greatly develop the integrated management of trade, industry, and agriculture and the coordinated operation of production, processing, and marketing, and actively cultivate the rural market system. We should increase the investment in agriculture through various channels and intensify construction of the basic facilities for agriculture to enhance the capacity to resist floods and other natural disasters. We should pay great attention to developing agriculture with science and technology and increase the investment in science and technology. On the premise that a steady increase in grain production is guaranteed and the "shopping basket" project is made successful, we should actively adjust the structure of agriculture and the production setup of rural areas and expand the diversified economy. We should continue to successfully reduce the burdens on peasants and enterprises. Town and township enterprises should further accelerate the pace of development and develop as quickly as possible. We should firmly attend to implementing the "project for rising to a new height in the Eighth Five-Year Plan period." We should positively carry out the share holding system, develop enterprise associations, boldly use foreign capital to conduct technological transformation, develop joint ventures, and further enhance enterprise vitality. We should pay attention to technological transformation and strive to expand the scale and to improve quality. It is necessary to develop increasingly more townships, villages, enterprises, and enterprise associations that each generates over 100 million yuan or 1 billion yuan of output value annually. J. We should rely on science, technology, and education to rejuvenate the economy of Tianjin. It is necessary to further implement the principle of relying on science and technology to rejuvenate the municipality and increase the proportion of scientific and technological progress in economic development. We should organize scientific and technological forces to tackle major technological problems cropping up in the course of production and construction while assimilating imported technologies and blazing new trails in importing technologies. We should pay attention to bringing into play the roles of the central scientific research organizations stationed in Tianjin. The existing scientific and technological findings should be popularized and applied as soon as possible. It is also necessary to set up a system for tracing and assessing the popularization and application of scientific and technological findings. It is necessary to speed up the construction of new technology park zones and to firmly work out and begin implementation of the plan for building a corridor of science and technology along the Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu Expressway. Applied research, development research, and scientific and technological service organizations should gradually carry out enterprise management. From now on, we should link the allocation of funds to scientific research units engaged in applied research according to efficiency gained from popularizing and applying scientific research findings. Civilian-run scientific research organizations should be developed positively. Education is the foundation for rejuvenating the municipality with science and technology. We should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the municipal educational work conference; quicken the pace of reforming the educational system and developing education; exert efforts to grasp the fulfillment of the work tasks; ensure that thinking, work arrangements, and guarantee measures are put in place; and make noticeable headway in deepening the reform of the educational system, enhancing vitality in running schools, upgrading the quality of education and the efficiency from running schools, and serving economic construction. We should further form a strong social practice of respecting knowledge and skilled persons, pay high attention to and realistically achieve work toward intellectuals, and mobilize and encourage the broad masses of intellectuals to make more contributions to the municipality's reform and development. K. The eighteen districts and counties should bring their roles into full play. We should exert great efforts to enliven districts and counties, delegate power to districts and counties, and bring their different functions into better play. In line with the principle of integrating responsibility with rights and profits alongside human, financial, and material resources, we should balance the relationship between the municipality and districts and counties. On the basis of clearly dividing the affairs and rights of the governments at these two different levels, we should reasonably define the scale and base figures of revenues and expenditures and enable districts and counties to retain more when their revenues increase. The affairs relating to regions and suitable to management by districts and counties should be managed by districts and counties. The departments concerned should work out specific plans, implement them as soon as possible, and ensure that rights should be delegated in a coordinated manner. In line with the requirements for changing government functions, districts and counties should quicken reform of the self-management system, appropriately simplify administrative procedures and delegate powers to lower levels, and better handle affairs originally managed and assigned by the municipality. L. We should do our best to seek benefits for the masses and do real deeds for the people. The leading cadres at various levels should ensure that they keep the masses in mind, do things for the masses, and rely on the masses to do their work; and continue to persistently do 20 good deeds for the urban and rural dwellers in line with the 10 requirements as defined by the municipal party committee. In 1994, we should improve the work of doing concrete deeds for the people and pay particular attention to work in the following three aspects: First, we should exert efforts to promote the economy, ceaselessly increase the income of the urban and rural people, create more real benefits for the people, and also pay attention to solving the problems for staff members and workers with living difficulties. Second, we should grasp the management of markets and goods prices and control price hikes. Third, in line with the implementation of the "project of living in peace," we should exert efforts to grasp the housing construction and the reconstruction of dangerous and shabby one- story houses, and set historical records in the areas where houses are built and completed. M. We should further strengthen the building of the spiritual civilization. In propaganda and ideological work, we should greatly advocate the major melody and persist in the unity between the major melody and diverse work to raise people's spirit and boost their morale. We should intensify the ideological and moral education with patriotism, collectivism, and socialism as the major content, advocate the pioneering spirit of the new era, guide the people, especially young people, to develop the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation, and train the new people who have lofty ideals and moral characters and are better educated and self-disciplined. We should strengthen ideological and political work, oppose money worship, ultra-individualism, and the influence of corrupt styles of life with a clear-cut stand, and resist the erosion of capitalist and feudal ideas. In press and publication work, we should persist in the correct guidance of the media. In cultural and art work, we should make active efforts to create healthy and progressive intellectual products. We should also achieve success in science and technology, education, public health, sports, afforestation, environmental protection, and family planning to promote comprehensive social progress. Seizing the opportunity of hosting the 12th Asian Table Tennis Games and the 43d World Table Tennis Games, we should launch large-scale activities to "build a civilized city and become civilized citizens." We should widely publicize the theme of the games -- "peace, friendship, prosperity, development." Focusing on the trades that serve as "windows," we should extensively launch the emulation activities to "make people satisfied in Tianjin" and to "create good quality and attain targets," strive for first-rate service, first-rate quality, and first-rate efficiency, display Tianjin's outlook, and win honor for Tianjin and for the state. N. We should strengthen socialist democratic politics and the legal system. Aiming at accelerating Tianjin's reform, opening up, and economic development, people's congresses at all levels and their standing committees should exercise the power entrusted by the Constitution and laws, give full play to the role of people's deputies, speed up local legislation, and strengthen legal supervision. We should fully develop the role of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference committees at all levels in political consultation and democratic supervision. We should strengthen the consultation with democratic parties to develop the advantages of all quarters. Trade unions, the Communist Youth League, women's federations, and other mass organizations should play their role still better as the bridges and channels for the party to establish ties with the masses. We should conscientiously implement the party's policies on nationalities, religions, and overseas Chinese affairs and strengthen the work directed toward Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and Overseas Chinese. We should conscientiously enforce the laws, administrative regulations, and local regulations issued by the state. We should step up the legal system and further establish and improve local regulations. We should strengthen and improve the law-enforcement by judicial and administrative departments and the supervision over law-enforcement. We should intensify the "Second Five-Year Plan" for the education to disseminate laws to enhance all the people's sense of respect for laws and the legal system. O. We should step up efforts to comprehensively manage public security to safeguard social stability. Leaders at all levels should regard the work to safeguard Tianjin's political and social stability as a major task to accomplish. They should conscientiously enforce the "regulations of Tianjin municipality on comprehensive management of public security." Following the principle that "those in charge hold responsibility," they should pool the efforts of different departments and different areas, with the focus on the latter, and establish a strict responsibility system for attaining the work targets of comprehensive management of public security. We should continue to adhere to the principle of meting out prompt and strict punishment according to law, sternly crack down on criminal offenses that seriously endanger public security and serious economic offenses, and continue the activities to "wipe out pornography" and eliminate the "six vices" to purify the social environment. Public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments should achieve success in their own reform, improve their work systems, upgrade their work levels, and ensure strict law-enforcement. 4. We Should Strengthen Leadership, Implement Responsibilities, Unite as One, Make Earnest Efforts To Do Practical Work, and Guarantee the Fulfillment of All Tasks in 1994 A. We should further strengthen the building of the party and the party's leadership. Strenuous efforts should be made to strengthen the building of leading bodies. We should build leading bodies at all levels into strong collectives that are firm in politics, and have courage to reform, do practical things, blaze new trials, work in unity and coordination, perform their administrative work honestly, maintain close relations with the masses of people, and comprehensively implement the party's basic line. We should conscientiously implement the principle of building ranks of cadres of "political integrity who are young, better educated and professional competent", the principle of choosing cadres with both ability and political integrity, and the principle of attending to political achievements and selecting the best through competition while building the leading bodies, make bigger strides in selecting outstanding young cadres, and do a better job in the exchange and readjustment of cadres. We should entrust cadres with outstanding achievements, good ideology and work style, and who enjoy mass support, particularly outstanding young cadres, with heavy tasks and boldly use them. We should continue to attend to the building of grass-roots party organizations and enhance the cohesion and fighting strength of the party organizations. We should further strengthen the building of enterprise party organizations in line with the guiding principle of "giving full play to the core political role of enterprise party organizations, upholding and improving the plant director responsibility system, and wholeheartedly relying on the working class." We should strengthen the building of party style and administrative honesty and continue to deepen anticorruption struggle in a down-to-earth manner. Leading cadres at all levels should be clean and self-diciplined, do their administrative work honestly, and serve as good examples. It is necessary to concentrate efforts on investigating and handling major and appalling cases and continue to conscientiously check the unhealthy trends which the masses show strong reaction. We should persist in unswervingly conducting education on party style, party discipline and clean politics, pay attention to building and improving the mechanism of supervision and restraint, and perfect the responsibility system in building party style and administrative honesty. B. We should actively strengthen study and training and raise the quality of cadres and the worker contingents. The realization of Tianjin's grand objective of reform and development is chiefly determined by the quality of the ranks of cadres and workers. Grasping study and training well is not only an urgent task but also a long-term plan. We should form a study atmosphere in the whole municipality and conduct various froms of study and training activities. While attending to the study of theories, Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and the "decision of the CPC central Committee on some issues concerning the establishment of the socialist market economic structure," we should strive to gain knowledge, and study science, technology and professional knowledge, as well as foreign languages in line with the requirements of our work. We should arrange for the training content in line with the principle of "learning the most useful," study what we do not know and make up for the lessons we miss. It is necessary to conscientiously formulate study and training plans and to establish necessary systems. Leading cadres at and above the district, county, and bureau level should do a good job in training as well as in leading the study. It is necessary to create conditions for cadres and workers to study and to undergo training, prepare training funds, and guarantee them time for study. We should extensively conduct a municipality-wide activity on "comparing with one another in the achievements of study, professional skills, and contributions." Relevant departments and mass organizations should play a positive role in promoting this municipality-wide study and training activity. C. We should comprehensively promote the work target responsibility system, improve work style, raise efficiency, and firmly carry out this system. We should comprehensively carry out this system in all party and government organs and departments, and enable them to meet high standards and set strict demands, and standardize and institutionalize this system. We should share the municipality's major economic and social development targets and tasks to all levels and urge them to implement them. Those that can be measured should be measured for evaluation, and those which cannot be evaluated with measurements should be given criteria for evaluation of work. Both economic departments and non-economic departments and various regions and departments should all be assigned with specific targets and tasks so that everyone has pressures and targets on their shoulders. In fixing targets, we should manifest the spirit of accelerating development and should set specific demands on time limits, progress rate, quantity, and quality. Some important items of work should be defined with the signing of letters of responsibility at each level. In carrying out the system concerning public service, we should consider the fulfillment of the assigned targets as an important content to assess official performance of leading bodies and leading cadres. In this aspect, each level should assume responsibility for its own work and supervise the work of the next lower level. Leading organs at higher levels should give good guidance to the work and supervise and examine the work of lower levels in order to truly yield results in this aspect. We should effect a big change in work style. Subjectivism, bureaucratism, and formalism should be overcome. We should tell the truth, do tangible things, and strive for practical results, rather than indulging in boasting, exaggeration, and fraudulence. Great efforts should be made to reduce the number of meetings and ordinary activities. Leading cadres at or above the district and county levels should use at least one third of the year to delve deeply into the realities of life to conduct investigation and study. We should continue to persist in and perfect the good methods of "jointly handling affairs" and "handling affairs within a set time" that will help improve work efficiency. Leading organs should pay high attention to coordinating work well. D. We should depend on the broad masses of the people and mobilize all positive factors to accomplish 1994's tasks. We should further persist in the idea of doing everything for the people and relying on the people to do everything. The channels to contact with the masses should be broadened, and the opinions, voice, and demands of the masses should be listened to in a timely manner. Importance should be attached to the work concerning the letters and complaints of the masses. In fulfilling various tasks, we should always mobilize the initiative of the masses, depend on the masses, and strengthen the ideological and political work. All reform plans and all major work measures should garner the comprehension and support of the masses. Full play should be given to the role of the working class as the main force to carry out reform and construction. Old cadres should be respected and taken note of by bringing their role into full play and efforts should be given to solve the problems in the livelihood of retired veteran cadres and workers. "Double-support" activities should be carried out continuously to strengthen the unity between the army and the people and between the army and the government. On the whole, we should further strengthen the mass unity throughout the municipality, mobilize all positive factors, and pool the will and wisdom of all the people in Tianjin to attain the common goal of accelerating development and invigorating Tianjin. The year 1994 is key to Tianjin's reform, opening up, and modernization drive. The municipal party committee called on the vast numbers of party members, cadres, and the masses in the municipality to even more closely unite as one to implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its nucleus, and under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. They are also expected to work hard and to make bold innovations to fulfill all tasks and to seize the opportunity to accelerate reform, opening up, and modernization in Tianjin.
