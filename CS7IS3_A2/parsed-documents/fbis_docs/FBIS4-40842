The demand, which comes in a statement by the faction leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, was circulated in the parliament's lower house today. He says that on June 14 the Privatization Commission of the State Property Committee approved the privatization concept and program devised under the guidance of the commission's Chairman Anatoliy Chubays and drafted a decree on how to implement this program. He reports that his faction has prepared an alternative concept for the president, government, and Security Council and insists on giving it as much publicity as the government's package. The LDP faction maintains that the Duma should differentially distribute incomes from privatization and denationalization and proposes that the State Property Committee be abolished and a committee to oversee property relations be set up and a state committee be formed to control Russia's property abroad. The Liberal Democrats also want all privatization profits, including those remitted abroad, to be progressively taxed. To cut the budget deficit, they consider it necessary to slash aid to former Soviet republics.
