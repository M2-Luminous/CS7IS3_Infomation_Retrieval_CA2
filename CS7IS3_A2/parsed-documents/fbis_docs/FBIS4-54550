[Cerny] Bulgaria is located in the immediate neighborhood of the Balkan conflict, and because of historical correlations, it is also concerned with the problem of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. Could you characterize the attitude of your country regarding these two topical issues? [Daskalov] The conflict in former Yugoslavia is the most complex and the most tragic conflict in Europe since the end of World War II. The broad spectrum of the reasons for its emergence and the belated activation of the international community further complicate the search for a quick solution. The events in former Yugoslavia are projected onto our country in more than one respect. The war is close, which means a potential threat to the security of Bulgaria. The damages to our economy caused by honoring the UN Security Council sanctions against Yugoslavia are tremendous. They have surpassed $3.6 billion since the sanctions were declared. It causes great difficulties for Bulgarian foreign trade, telecommunications, and transport connections with Central and Western Europe.... It is of vital interest to Bulgaria that the military actions in Bosnia-Herzegovina are terminated and a permanent peace solution is found. As early as the beginning of the conflict, we said we would not take part in any form of military operations, including peacekeeping operations, in the territory of former Yugoslavia, and we appealed to other Balkan countries to keep their distance too. In our opinion, a way out of the conflict can only be found by the joint efforts of the international community: the UN, NATO, the United States, and Russia. The most recent development of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina makes us anxious but, at the same time, it points out the safest route to the termination of the conflict, which is negotiations. Therefore, we welcome the proposal for a summit of the representatives of the United States, Russia, and the European Union [EU] dedicated to these issues. The summit would confirm the readiness of these countries to engage in the search for a way out of the crisis. Our country has been demonstrating by all its deeds over the past two years that it does not have any territorial claims against its neighbors. Bulgaria was the first country in the entire world -- already on 15 January 1992 -- to recognize the independence of the just-emerged Macedonia. We are interested in having the statehood of Macedonia confirmed, in an even more determined support for this state from the international community. This process and the presence of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] are important steps in preventing the spread of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina outside its present framework. [Cerny] Traditionally, Bulgaria has always had close relations with the Russian state. How do you perceive Russia's present position and the new exertion of its influence in the Balkans and also its attempts at reviving the pan-Slavic ideas? [Daskalov] I have already answered this question to a certain degree; we welcome the constructive endeavors of Russian diplomacy coordinated with the United States and the EU that contribute to finding a peaceful way out of the conflict and that is just to all parties involved. As far as the contribution and deeds leading towards peace and stability are concerned, I believe we can all be satisfied. I would prefer not to comment on the new phenomena in the domestic political life in Russia. I would only observe that we bear witness to its multifarious tendencies. The development of the processes in Russia should be assessed from the vantage point of the progress in the democratic and economic reforms, but also from the point of view of the complex changes in Europe. The integrating and democratizing Europe, whose indivisible part are the Central and East European states, can provide a natural support for the democratic development in Russia. Your question concerning the revival of pan-Slavism is interesting already in the fact that the notion of pan-Slavism emerged for the first time precisely on Czech soil. Nevertheless, in the course of almost one and a half centuries, with constantly changing conditions -- sometimes more, sometimes less favorable -- it has never achieved substantial progress or scope. It is, from this vantage point, a form of utopia. It would be a mistake if we took a nihilistic approach and denied the contribution of the Slavic peoples to the European culture only because certain extremist politicians utilize it as their motto.
