Two United States Air Force F-16 aircraft were involved in Sunday's strike. One dropped three Mark 82 bombs at 16.22 GMT Sunday and the other dropped two more four minutes later, the officials said. Late Sunday, NATO forces attempted an air reconnaissance mission to evaluate damage done to the Serb positions, but bad weather prevented them carrying this out successfully, a diplomat said. U.S. military officials at the Aviano base in Italy said Monday that three 250-kilo bombs had been dropped on Serb positions by the two F-16s.
