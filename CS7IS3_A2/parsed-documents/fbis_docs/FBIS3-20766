This was confirmed by Bosnian Deputy Prime Minister Edip Bukvic and Minister of Finance Sead Kresa when they arrived in Ljubljana on 8 February. The finance minister was received by Mitja Gaspari [Slovene finance minister], Franc Arhar [Central Bank director], and the director of the firm Cetis in Celje, which had printed the Bosnian currency. However, Deputy Prime Minister Bukvic was unable to talk to his counterpart, although he came to Ljubljana to resolve the problem of a Bosnian helicopter and the arms discovered at the Maribor airport, which are still in Slovene possession. Although the Bosnian Embassy tried to contact Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lojze Peterle, and Davorin Kracun [minister of economic relations and development] a week in advance, the Slovene prime minister and deputy prime minister could not find the time to talk to the Bosnian officials. We have learned that the Bosnians did not despair and will continue to seek a consensus with the Slovene Government to reach an agreement on the arms waiting at the Maribor airport to be transported to Bosnia. The Bosnians suspect that, despite their claim to these weapons, the more expensive and sophisticated pieces are already missing. Because of the arms embargo, the Slovene Government will not be able legally to deliver the arms to Bosnia. The Bosnian Government would like to work out some kind of a compensation deal with the Slovene Government, e.g., in a form of aid to refugees or of putting up a satellite for Sarajevo television; after all, the arms discovered "accidentally" by the Slovene defense minister are valued at about $20 million.
