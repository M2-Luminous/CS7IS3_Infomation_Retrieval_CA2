SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements contained in this notice have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520), and have been assigned OMB control number 2577&hyph;0169. I. Purpose and Substantive Description A. Authority The regulations governing the Rental Certificate and the Rental Voucher Programs are published at 24 CFR parts 882 and 887, respectively. The regulations for allocating housing assistance budget authority under section 213(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 are published at 24 CFR part 791, subpart D. B. Allocation Amounts (1) Housing Needs Formula In this fiscal year, approximately $975 million of budget authority for the rental voucher and certificate programs is available for fair share formula allocation. (This amount may be reduced by up to $100 million (or some other amount) to increase the level of funding for litigation or desegregation.) This funding will support additional units for HA rental voucher and rental certificate programs. Of this amount, approximately $624 million is for rental vouchers and approximately $351 million is for rental certificates. This budget authority is being allocated to HUD State or Area Office and allocation areas under this NOFA, using the housing needs factors established in accordance with 24 CFR 791.402. For purposes of this NOFA, the Department is using the metropolitan area designations that were in effect prior to December 31, 1992, since detailed census data tabulations for the new metropolitan area designations are not available, yet. In addition, $51.3 million is retained in a Headquarters Reserve which will not be allocated by formula. (2) Metropolitan/Non-Metropolitan Mix Separate housing needs factors were developed for the metropolitan and non-metropolitan allocation areas within each HUD State or Area Office jurisdiction. On a nationwide basis, approximately 90 percent of the Fiscal Year 1994 ``fair share'' budget authority for the Rental Voucher Program and Rental Certificate Program is designated for metropolitan areas. The metropolitan housing needs factors were applied to the housing assistance budget authority available for use in metropolitan areas and the non-metropolitan housing needs factors were applied to the housing assistance budget authority available for use in non-metropolitan areas.
