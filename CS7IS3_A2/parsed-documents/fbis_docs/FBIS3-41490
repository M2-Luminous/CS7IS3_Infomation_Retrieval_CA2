A prototype station is supplying the inhabitants of Auvers-sur-Oise. They are the first people to drink water treated by nanofiltration which is softened and has no taste of chlorine. The development of membrane techniques, which made their first appearance in water treatment some 10 years ago, is based on various factors. These include increasingly severe legislation governing the quality of drinking water, the need to take into account any possible side effects of treatment due to the addition of reagents, the erosion of resources, and the technological progress made to make these processes competitive. Nanofiltration, which bridges the gap between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis, complies with the new standards for drinking water. It gives precise control over the quality of the water produced. Other points in its favor are its compactness and the simplicity with which it can be used, checked, and maintained. The Membrane Barrier The term nanofiltration is used for membranes that have a molecular weight removal threshold for organic compounds of close to 250 daltons. This corresponds to the hypothetical existence of pores 1 nm in diameter. These composite-type membranes are formed of a hydrophobic support bearing positively charged hydrophilic chemical groups. In this way, the traditional properties of an ultrafiltration membrane are strengthened by a repulsive force enabling the removal of similarly charged ionic species and their counterions. It is these groups that are responsible for the ionic action of the nanofiltration membranes -- bivalent species are held back at a rate varying from 70-90 percent, making it an excellent process for water softening (the removal of Calcium, Ca 2+ [superscript], and magnesium, Mg 2+ [superscript], both responsible for water hardness) and desulfurization (removal of SO4 2- [superscript]), while the retention rate for monovalent ions is lower (less than 60%). Less Chlorine in the Networks These membranes are also an excellent physical barrier to small dissolved molecules and micropollutants such as Atrazine. They are particularly effective at removing trihalomethane precursors and humic and fulvic acids. Another aspect of nanofiltration membranes is their capacity to retain organic matter. They remove the dissolved biodegradable organic carbon which is the part of dissolved organic carbon that feeds the bacteria in supply networks. Removing it avoids the development of biofilms and therefore reduces the final rate of chlorination normally used to disinfect networks. Lastly, these membranes operate at pressures of less than 10 bars. They therefore couple the ionic advantages of reverse osmosis with the low operating pressures and consequently reduced energy consumption of ultrafiltration. The Mery 400,000 Project The Ile-de-France water syndicate [SEDIF] supplies drinking water to 144 communes in the Paris region, representing four million inhabitants. It is continuing in its efforts to counter the erosion of resources and to conserve the same water quality throughout the supply network in a region of growing demand. This has already been achieved for the treatment processes in its two largest production plants at Neuilly-sur-Marne and Choisy-le-Roi (800,000 m3/day). The Mery 400,000 project is the opportunity to research into both water production and distribution. At the suggestion of its administrator, the Compagnie Generale des Eaux [CGE], SEDIF has set itself the goal of increasing the capacity of the Mery-sur-Oise plant from 270,000 m3 to 400,000 m3 per day. Fed by the river Oise, this plant now treats water for 600,000 inhabitants. The main stages in the treatment system are: preozonation and storage; coagulation and settling; biological sand filtration; ozonation and biological filtration on granular activated carbon; postozonation; and finally postchlorination before distribution. Nanofiltration At Work After an initial study into the different processes that could be used to achieve this aim, SEDIF and CGE wanted to test nanofiltration by building a prototype plant with a capacity of 2,800 m3/day on the Mery-sur-Oise site. The membranes in nanofiltration are packed in spiral modules. This kind of module has a small dead zone and a relatively low investment cost. On the other hand, it is very sensitive to clogging and requires quite exhaustive pretreatment. Two sheets of membrane are placed on either side of a spacer material. The three sheets are sealed along three sides to form an envelope. The open side is attached to a perforated tube that collects the treated water. The envelope is then wrapped around the tube with a spacer generating turbulence on the concentrate side. The rolls of membrane are placed inside a pressure tube with a system of joints at either end ensuring its watertightness. In normal operation, the water to be treated circulates in the interstices formed by the spacer. Pressure forces some of the water to penetrate the inside of the envelope and to collect in the central tube. Portrait of a Treatment System The use of membranes, the choice of operating conditions (pressure, tangential velocity, temperature, conversion level, etc.), and the correct match of pretreatment system to modules are all of vital importance if system performance is to be maintained for as long as possible. The stages in a nanofiltration treatment system are: pretreatment of the raw water (settling, sand filtration, and 5 5m safety prefilters); acid conditioning of the raw water to prevent the precipitation of carbonates and of calcium and magnesium hydroxides; conditioning by chelating agent for sulfate salts (CaSO2, etc.); pressurization using a pump; nanofiltration; post-treatment of the treated water, consisting of restoring the carbonate balance and, if necessary, remineralizing the raw water (often a simple aeration is sufficient); and final chlorination. With a degree of economic and technological progress, we can envisage the chosen solution producing water with a very low dissolved, biodegradable organic matter content, and that is free from pathogens, and softened. This solution also makes it possible to reduce the number of treatment stages, since water polishing by nanofiltration replaces the stages of ozonation and biological filtration on granular activated carbon. The Water at Auvers-sur-Oise Started up in July 1992, the nanofiltration prototype has been supplying the commune of Auvers-sur-Oise (6,000 inhabitants) since February 1993, with the agreement of the health ministry and the French council for public hygiene. The water entering the prototype still contains 3.6 mg/l of dissolved organic carbon, approximately one third of which (1.1 mg/l) is biodegradable and could benefit the regrowth of bacteria in the distribution network. Its chlorine demand, in the region of three mg/l may lead to the formation of byproducts such as chloroform (CHCL3), trihalomethanes (THM), and total organohalogens (TOX). One half of the organic matter in the water supplying the prototype is composed of humic substances. The other major components are hydrophilic acids (30 percent), carboxylic acids (five to eight percent), and carbohydrates (five to ten percent). In addition, 75 percent of the dissolved organic carbon has a molecular weight of less than 5,000 daltons, much of which (25 percent) has a molecular weight of less than 500 daltons. This justifies the use of nanofiltration membranes with a removal threshold in the order of 250 daltons. The water produced after nanofiltration is of a very high quality. Ninety percent of the dissolved organic carbon is removed and the dissolved biodegradable organic carbon concentration is less than the detection limit (0.1 mg/l). The chlorine is no longer consumed by the organic matter and remains at a more stable level in the network. The two effects are complementary: the low concentration in biodegradable organic matter and the chlorine stability make it easier to protect the network against bacterial contamination. It was possible to confirm this on the Auvers-sur-Oise distribution network which is supplied with nanofiltered water. A low residual chlorine level at the plant outlet (0.1 mg/l) was sufficient to keep the water within the bacteriological standards. Nanofiltration is therefore considered a leading candidate for doubling the Mery-sur-Oise plant's capacity. It presents a number of advantages: the production of water free from pathogenic micro- organisms, a reduced level of dissolved biodegradable organic carbon, the notable possibility of reducing the level of chlorination before distribution and thus the production of water free from chlorination byproducts, the removal of micropollutants such as pesticides, and the reduction of bivalent ions (hardness and sulfates). The inhabitants of Auvers are the first European consumers of water produced using this innovative process. There is no doubt that it will find its place in modern water treatment systems.
