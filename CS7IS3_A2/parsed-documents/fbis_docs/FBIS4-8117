How would you characterize the program of the governing coalition, and what guarantees can you see that this government will be more democratic? [Moravcik] We have only six months at our disposal. We will have new elections in October, which is earlier than originally scheduled. Until that time, we want to change the style of governing. We must depart from the policy of confrontation that was pursued by Mr. Meciar. We want to establish conditions for cooperation among all interested political entities, and we are declaring this desire in our international relations as well. [Niewiadowski] However, is it possible to reach a political consensus despite all of the programmatic differences in the new coalition, which is made up of both the Christian-Democratic Party, led by Jan Czarnogurski, the "center orientation," which is represented by yourself, and, finally, by the Democratic Left Party [SDL], chaired by Peter Weiss? [Moravcik] We want to underscore whatever links the new coalition, not the differences. I do not agree with the opinion that the main reason for recalling the previous government was so- called anti-Meciarism. We simply had a different concept of governing. [Niewiadowski] What exactly was this concept? [Moravcik] The Meciar government was a government of improvisation, which we will try to avoid. In parliament on 12 April, I will submit a long-term program for overcoming the crisis in the country. [Niewiadowski] Could you reveal the most basic points of this program? [Moravcik] The most important thing will be the transformation of the Slovak economy. We must fairly rigorously adhere to the schedule in our contacts with international establishments. The point is to attract foreign capital. We must establish a system of guarantees that would make investment in Slovakia profitable; on the other hand, we must liberate the initiative of our own citizens. [Niewiadowski] Are you also thinking about the privatization of the national wealth? [Moravcik] Yes, we are. We want to return to the old federative concept of coupon privatization implemented, with small technical changes, in the Czech Republic. We want our citizens to have as much of the national wealth as possible. [Niewiadowski] In the daily commentaries of the pro-Meciar daily RESPUBLIKA, the opposition accuses you of acting against the legislature because you have annulled the privatization contracts that have been signed so far. Can the law be retroactive? What is your response to this allegation? [Moravcik] I cannot agree with it. We reviewed the privatization contracts that have recently been forced by the Meciar cabinet. We did this because we received information that, during the privatization process, party interests took precedence over the interests of the state. The people who were privatizing the national wealth were selected in line with the priorities of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. Whenever we came across a contract that--I want to stress this--was not in conformity with the binding legal norms, we had to annul it. Incidentally, it was not very difficult to find such contracts. The government of Mr. Meciar was in an awful hurry in its last days and committed legislative errors. [Niewiadowski] Will the new Cabinet avoid such errors? [Moravcik] The process of privatization will be accompanied by permanent control; the coupon privatization will make it possible for citizens to control the national wealth. [Niewiadowski] Still, you are being severely criticized by Meciar, who has even formed a "shadow cabinet" made up of former ministers of his government. Do you not fear that the preelection campaign may reach the streets and that Meciar, as we already witnessed during a demonstration in front of parliament, will accuse you of destroying the state and will bring about a wave of nationalistic demonstrations? [Moravcik] I would not overestimate the strength of Mr. Meciar. When Meciar was recalled for the first time in 1991, before the government of Jan Carnogursky was formed, tens of thousands of people gathered in the Slovak National Uprising square. There were far fewer this time. They were mostly fanatic supporters of Mr. Meciar. One cannot feel the need for confrontation in Slovakia. What seems to be wanted is the creation of the atmosphere of peace and awaiting the moves of the new government. [Niewiadowski] These moves will also be of an international nature. What do you consider to be the priority in the relations with your closest neighbors? Let us start with the Czech Republic. [Moravcik] We must resolve the open questions of the division of the federative national wealth and the issue of frontier rigor. We are interested in maintaining the customs union. These are the issues of paramount importance. [Niewiadowski] What about your relations with Hungary? [Moravcik] We must intensively seek a platform of agreement so as not to allow nationalistic trends to increase. From this point of view, cooperation with representatives of the Hungarian national minority, which is represented in the Slovak parliament by "Egyuttels" and the Hungarian Christian-Democratic Party, will be very important. [Niewiadowski] What stand is Slovakia going to take on the increasingly more active foreign policy of Russia? Will it be similar in any way to Polish foreign policy? [Moravcik] I believe that the basic directions of the foreign policies of both states are the same. Just like Poland, Slovakia would like the political situation in Russian to develop in the direction of democratic transformations. We can say the same about Ukraine. We need a stable Ukraine very much because it is our neighbor, so it is our desire that the political and economic situation in this country be based on solid foundations. The maintenance of democracy in Russia and Ukraine is the best guarantee of our security. [Niewiadowski] Is the orientation of Slovak foreign policy defined clearly and unequivocally? [Moravcik] The new government will support the idea of Slovakia's integration into the structures of Western Europe as soon as possible. This is our principal strategic goal. What we want is to join both the Western European Union and NATO. I believe that the fundamental directions of the political strategy of Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland are very similar in this area. Thus, we can cooperate quite well within the Visegrad Group, because it would be a pity not to take advantage of the idea of this agreement. It is too bad that the concept of establishing a joint security system within this group has been put aside. [Niewiadowski] Are you also for the institutionalization of the structures of this agreement? [Moravcik] No, I do not think this is necessary. I believe that a system of regular consultations on the ministerial level would be sufficient. [Niewiadowski] A lot has recently been said about economic cooperation between our states. On both sides of the border, considerable pressure can be felt to establish the "Tatra Region." Do you envision any concrete decisions on this issue within the next six months? [Moravcik] I believe that there are no serious reasons that the "Tatra Region" should not be established and that it should not function properly. The government will discuss the materials left over by the cabinet of Mr. Meciar, and, with certain amendments, the entire project may be accepted by the Slovak party. [Niewiadowski] What about over a dozen interministerial agreements that were supposed to be signed this year? [Moravcik] We are ready to make a considerable step in this area to pass from purely verbal declarations to specifics. So far, a lot has been said about cooperation; in practice, however, it has looked different. [Niewiadowski] After the 1993 elections, a leftist cabinet was formed in Poland. Do you think the left may win the Slovak elections as well? [Moravcik] Most probably the left will not obtain such a number of votes as to be able to form a government that would have the support of a majority of parliament. The optimum solution for Slovakia would be to maintain the agreement of the present coalition, which has the character of a social consensus. [Niewiadowski] Do you think Peter Weiss's SDL may run in the elections along with Vladimir Meciar's HZDS? [Moravcik] This would be a tremendous failure for me. I believe that the SDL will be strong enough to transform itself into a modern party of a social democratic character. [Niewiadowski] You are the representative of the "center orientation" and support the program of "democratic liberalism." However, the "center orientation" includes other parties as well: Milan Kniazko's "Association of Democrats" and Ludovit Cernak's National-Democratic Party, which considers itself to be the only heir to the Slovak national traditions and which is not concealing its conservative ambitions. Do you think it is possible for the entire "center orientation" to unite? Now, if the center is divided, Meciar will certainly gain more undecided voters.... [Moravcik] There exists such a danger. However, we must not forget the political reality. It is quite possible to unite the center partially--that is, agreement may be reached by the "Alternative of the Political Realism" and the "Association of Democrats." Both groupings will soon form the "Democratic Union of Slovakia." Yesterday (that is, on 30 March--editor's note) we decided to establish it. The "Union" will have a "liberal-democratic" character. The supporters of Cernak are further "to the right." All of the other "center" parties, however, will form a joint preelection front; there is already an agreement on that. [Niewiadowski] If the coalition won the elections and you were once again asked to form a new government, would you accept such an offer? [Moravcik] I have already said twice that I would not accept the post offered to me--first in March of last year, when I became foreign affairs minister in the Meciar government, and second, in March of this year, when President Michal Kovac said I should head this Cabinet. Well, if I were forced to change my opinion once again...
