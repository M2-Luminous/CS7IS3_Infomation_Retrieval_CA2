FR940318-0-00058 FR940318-0-00012 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service 26 CFR Part 1 [TD 8532] RIN 1545&hyph;AP19 Final Regulations Under Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code; Discharge of Indebtedness AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains final regulations under section 108(e)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which provides that the common law stock-for-debt exception to the realization of discharge of indebtedness income does not apply where stock issued for indebtedness is nominal or token or fails to satisfy a proportionality test. The final regulations are necessary to provide guidance in applying section 108(e)(8). The regulations provide rules for determining whether stock issued for indebtedness is nominal or token under section 108(e)(8)(A) and rules for applying the proportionality test of section 108(e)(8)(B). EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective May 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Annette Ahlers (202) 622&hyph;7750 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This document adds final regulations ยง1.108&hyph;1 under sections 108(e)(8) (A) and (B) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Sections 108(e)(8) (A) and (B) were added by section 2(a) of the Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980 [Pub. L. 96&hyph;589, 94 Stat. 3389] and amended by section 11325 of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990 [Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, 104 Stat. 1368]. On November 4, 1992, [57 FR 52601] the Service published these regulations in proposed form in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Subsequent to the publication of the proposed regulations, section 13226 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 repealed the stock-for- debt exception. The amendments made by section 13226 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 apply to stock transferred after December 31, 1994, in satisfaction of any indebtedness unless such transfer is in a title 11 or similar case (as defined in section 368(a)(3)(A)) that was filed on or before December 31, 1993. The rules of the final regulations are effective with respect to any issuance of stock for indebtedness on or before December 31, 1994, or any issuance of stock for indebtedness in a title 11 or similar case (as defined in section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code) that was filed on or before December 31, 1993, pursuant to: (1) A plan confirmed by the court in a title 11 case after May 17, 1994, or (2) if there is no title 11 case, an insolvency workout in which all issuances of stock for indebtedness occur after May 17, 1994. No inference is intended concerning the interpretation of sections 108(e)(8) (A) and (B) of the Code prior to the effective date of the regulations. These final regulations adopt the proposed regulations with a few minor changes in response to comments. As indicated in the preamble to the proposed regulations, the Service is also publishing Rev. Proc. 94&hyph;26, I.R.B 1994&hyph;13, containing ruling guidelines for the nominal or token determination under section 108(e)(8)(A). One commentator suggested that the final regulations contain safe harbors or a list of specified factors for the nominal or token determination required by section 108(e)(8)(A) and that a revenue procedure be published for determining whether preferred stock meets the nominal or token requirement of section 108(e)(8)(A). Prior proposed regulations under section 108(e)(8) included factors that would be considered in determining whether stock was nominal or token. Commentators, with respect to those regulations, asserted that the list of factors was incomplete. The Service and Treasury agree that the determination of whether a stock issuance is nominal or token must be based on all the facts and circumstances, and that a list of specified factors would not fully address the relevant considerations in many cases. Rev. Proc. 94&hyph;26, I.R.B. 1994&hyph;13, provides one safe harbor on when common stock is not nominal or token. In the future, the Service and Treasury will consider issuing additional ruling guidelines as circumstances warrant. The commentator suggested that the final regulations provide that for purposes of computing both the common stock and preferred stock proportionality tests the definition of adjusted issue price should be modified to include accrued interest that the issuer of the debt instrument has not paid. The Service and Treasury agree with the recommendation. The final regulations clarify that for purposes of the proportionality tests of section 108(e)(8)(B), the denominator includes any indebtedness that is discharged in the title 11 case or workout, including accrued but unpaid stated interest.
