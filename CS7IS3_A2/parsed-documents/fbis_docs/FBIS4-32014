The NS, which presented itself for the first time on Tuesday [14 June], adheres to the values of "modern liberalism" based on the inviolability of democratic values and efficient market economy vouching for social security, says Mosny, a businessman who has returned after several years in exile in the USA to Slovakia. Many problems have been caused by privatisation which has become a political tool, says Mosny, adding that the Privatisation Ministry should be abolished because it can be easily substituted by the National Property Fund and "world professional organisations with perfect skill with respect to privatisation. Everything must be subordinated to the aim which is revitalisation of the company. Neither coupon privatisation nor employees' shares are such technique. They can be applied only if the company flourishes," Mosny states. The time has come for the positive influences of the West to arrive in Slovakia, he says. "There is economic instability, poor taxation, political fragmentation, corruption -- all the bad influences from the West here," Mosny stresses. It is untenable that 63 "billionaires," but also 50 percent of people living below the poverty line, are registered in Bratislava, he adds.
