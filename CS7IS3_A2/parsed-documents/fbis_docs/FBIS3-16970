Commenting on the situation, Oleksiy Sheberstov, Ukraine's first deputy minister of power engineering and electrification, said Ukraine's fuel supplies are rapidly diminishing. At the same time, consumers owe 8,000 billion karbovantsi to the ministry, which is the reason why it lacks the money to buy oil and gas for heating.
