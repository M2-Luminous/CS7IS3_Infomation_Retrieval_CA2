FBIS4-30972 "dreeu106_p_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-106 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 POLAND Government's `Strategy for Poland' Outlined Government's `Strategy for Poland' Outlined WS0206073094 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 1 Jun 94 p 8 WS0206073094 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA Polish BFN [Report by D.E.: "Economic Strategy for Poland; Rapid Development, Lower Costs"] [Text] During the weekend session of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement, Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and finance minister, presented the concept of the "Strategy for Poland," prepared by the coalition of the Polish Peasant Party and the Democratic Left Alliance. The document specifies the goals that the coalition government will strive to achieve between 1994 and 1997, and envisions the measures that need to be taken and the threats that may arise. On Tuesday the strategy was discussed at the session of the government. On Monday the document reached the various ministers. The "strategy" should contribute to the maintenance of a high rate of economic development. Between 1994 and 1997 the GDP may increase by approximately 22 percent, that is, by approximately 5 percent a year on average. Real consumption will increase by more than 10 percent. The rapid increase is to be accompanied by macroeconomic and systemic stabilization of the economy, which will lie, among other things, in the lowering of the rate of increase of the public debt: In 2004 it should not exceed 60 percent of GDP. The budget deficit should drop from over 6 percent in 1992 to approximately 2-3 percent in 1997. The inflation rate should be lowered to a single-digit figure by 1997. One of the fundamental springboards of the economic development will be production for export. The document draws particularly great attention to the lowering of the social costs of reforms, the improvement of the living conditions (it is envisioned that the average wage will rise by 10 percent and the average retirement pension -- by 7 percent); it also stresses just, efficiency-oriented principles of shaping wages and social insurances. It is expected that greater pressure will be placed on active forms of combating unemployment, whose rate should decrease from the current 16 percent to less than 14 percent at the end of 1997. Here are some of the other main goals that are included in the "Strategy": striving for a rapid integration with the European Union, economic competitiveness on an international level, and reform of the economic center. Apart from this general section, the "Strategy" also contains 10 main programs detailing the diagnoses, goals to be achieved, planned measures, possible threats, as well as execution criteria of achieving the main goals in such spheres, among others, as wages, unemployment, development of the rural areas, and development of the banking sector. Below we have briefly discussed this detailed section of the document; we have drawn attention mainly to the measures proposed and to the criteria of execution. The latter are not quantitive, but only qualitative. Despite that, in the future they will help evaluate the degree to which the various intentions of the government have been put into effect. Partnership-Like Labor Relationships and Negotiation-Related Mechanism of Wage Regulation The government wants to create modern labor relationships. The negotiation-related and decentralized mechanism of wage regulation will assign the state the role of an arbiter that resolves disputes between employers and employees. This goal is to be achieved, among other things, through the amendment of the Labor Code; as a result, it will become possible, among other things, to: -- conclude collective work agreements at the level of enterprises, branches, and branches and regions; -- impose on the employer the duty of notifying the employee on the cause of an intended layoff; the employee will be guaranteed the right to submit reservations; -- adjust the leave law to the requirements specified in the 132 MOP [expansion unknown] Convention (among other things, increase the minimum leave, create legal guarantees allowing the use of leave every year); -- prohibit the employee from conducting any activities which compete with the employer during the period in which he is employed and for a year after this period. Other plans are as follows: 1. Forming -- in democratic elections, in all companies both public and private employing more than 20 persons -- enterprise councils as supra-union employees' organs entitled to conclude agreements at the enterprise level. 2. Amending a packet of laws: on trade unions, on the organizations of employers, and on the resolution of collective bargaining; accepting such an interpretation of these laws which would guarantee a balance between the collective parties and the work relationships. 3. The status of the Tripartite Commission for Social-Economic Issues, acting at the central level, will soon be regulated. Apart from issuing opinions, the commission will be entitled to launch legislative initiatives, the contents of which would be binding for all parties. Possible threats here are the barriers and possibilities of the economy's development and lack of progress in the restructurization of the economy, particularly in the ownership, organizational, substantive, technological, and regional spheres. The government wants to treat the decline in the number of working days lost by the economy as a result of strikes as a criterion for the execution of this plan. Reform of the System of Social Insurance The government sees the issue of a systemic resolution of the issue of the social insurance as one of the priorities of its activities. A complex concept of reforming this sphere is being prepared; preparations are also under way to implement it. It must be realized, however, that the entire process will take from 10 to 20 years to complete. At the same time steps will be taken to increase the efficiency of the existing system. One of the goals is to decrease the system's tendency to create conflicts, through the enhancement of its clarity and the individualization of the accounts of the individual participants of the system; to gradually decrease the insurance premium (which now amounts to 49 percent, along with the Labor Fund), until a proportion comparable to the world level (approximately 25 percent) is reached. Between 1994 and 1997: 1. The law on financing and organizing social insurances and the law on the Social Insurance Agency will be changed; 2. There will be an individualization of the accounts of the individual participants of the system; 3. Principles of paying the subscriptions by employees and employers will be introduced which will make it possible to control the state of the account by any interested person at any time; as a result, private and state-owned companies will better observe the discipline of paying the premiums, which will increase the budget's revenues; 4. Identification cards will be introduced for all citizens; on the basis of the cards, events influencing the state of the account of each insured person will be registered; 5. The legal, institutional, and organizational framework of the functioning of the retirement pension funds and of the functioning of insurance companies will be created; 6. The present tax system will be modified in such a way as to make it possible for employees and employers to include the insurance premiums in the costs of obtaining the gains. Moreover, the following is to be expected: -- decreasing the number of persons entitled to retirement benefits by prolonging the required employment period, equaling the retirement age of men and women, and sharpening the principles of retiring at an earlier age; -- suspending the benefits, if a certain income level is achieved, in the case of persons who are continuing (taking on) a job after acquiring retirement rights; -- changing the rules of the valorization of retirement and disability pensions (departing from the indexation in relation to the wage movement, in favor of adjustments to price changes; [no closing parentheses as published] -- decreasing the number of persons receiving invalids' pensions, by making detailed diagnoses of the health condition, by emphasizing rehabilitation before the pension is granted, by sharpening the criteria of granting invalids' privileges (especially in the case of persons who have maintained the ability to work -- for example, liquidation of the third invalid group); -- regulating the payments of peasants' subscriptions to KRUS [expansion unknown]; -- standardizing the rules of paying sick leave and maternity leave benefits in all sectors of the economy; -- enhancing the efficiency of solutions in the sphere of social protection for unemployed persons; placing emphasis on the control of the access to social benefits and using them as motivational factors. The government wants to treat the decrease in the share of expenditures on social insurances in the budget's total expenditures as a criterion for the execution of the plan. Countering Unemployment In this sphere the government wants to pass on to an active policy, the intention of which is the stimulation of the process of creating new work places as well as the protection of public finances. The goals that have been set are as follows: gradually lowering the unemployment rate, especially between 1995 and 1997, combating the chronic unemployment, and decreasing the scale of unemployment among young people. The main measures that are expected to be taken are as follows: 1. Strengthening the pro-investment policy; 2. Linking modernization and restructurization programs more closely to the situation on the labor market. The demand for labor will be increased, among other things, by great investment undertakings, initiated by the government, linked to the modernization of the technical infrastructure of the country; they will concern, among other things, the modernization of the road network and the construction of super highways, the development of the telecommunications, modernization of the railroads system, development of the natural gas supply system. There will be a chance to limit unemployment and minimize its social results through the creation of special economic zones on the foundation of companies with a rich technical infrastructure, companies which have manufacturing property that is not fully utilized and which employ highly-qualified employees. One of the criteria of the evaluation of privatization undertakings is the protection of work places. This not only requires that clauses concerning the level of the guaranteed employment are taken into account in contracts; it also requires investment commitments whose implementation will make it possible to maintain the existing work places and create new ones. The policy of countering unemployment will be carried out at the regional level to a considerable degree; the criteria of including local labor markets in the group that falls under special activities will be sharpened. In these areas the instruments that are supposed to cause an increase in employment will be strengthened and concentrated. These will include, among others: Entitlement to an accelerated amortization of fixed assets, tax allowances for the training of employees and apprentices provided by individuals conducting economic activity, increasing of the employment limit which will not result in the loss of the right to pay taxes in the form of the tax charter, for a certain period -- due to investment expenditure [as published], credit guarantees for small and medium-sized companies, granting unemployment benefits directly to the employers of the unemployed persons. The following will be carried out in the social protection system: 1. Modification of the principles of paying unemployment benefits; greater emphasis will be put on the material situation of the family of the unemployed person and on the differences in the situation on local labor markets; 2. Change in the conditions of paying unemployment benefits and in the registration of the unemployed; unemployed persons who refuse to accept an offered job or training will be denied the right to unemployment benefits for a certain period or permanently; 3. A separate unemployment insurance will be introduced and a special insurance fund will be created, made up of the subscriptions of employers and employees, and earmarked exclusively for unemployment benefits. The establishment of the unemployment insurance will lessen the burden on the state budget -- the burden of financing unemployment benefits, and it will allow an increase in the amount of money allocated for active stimulation of employment. The introduction of an insurance-related form of financing the unemployment benefits will require (with the current scale of unemployment) that subscriptions be set at the level of approximately 7-7.5 percent of the wage fund. The main criterion of execution will be the decrease in the unemployment rate. Development of Rural Areas The strategic goal in this sphere is to help Polish agriculture and rural areas reach the standard of the highly-developed European countries, because this is the only way to defend Polish agriculture and peasants from foreign competition. Development in the conditions of the functioning of the market mechanism will consist of a gradual limitation of the rank of agriculture and an increase in the role of food processing and distribution. This will be accompanied by the strengthening of economically strong farms, as well as the departure of weak and inefficient entities from agricultural production. Following are methods that will be used to stimulate these processes: 1. Stimulation of nonagricultural activities; 2. Interventionism, that is, a long-term, not a temporary, program of the state's aid for agriculure. Intervention of the state will assume the form of targeted aid, and will lead to an acceleration of structural transformations in agriculture and to the creation of work places in rural sectors other than agriculture. The government will consistently limit direct, nontargeted intervention, which merely conserves the inefficient system of production, perpetuates old structures, and defers the indispensable process of transformations, by taking on a social function. The government will work out detailed programs of assistance targeted for specific types of farms; it will define the conditions that the peasant and the farm must satisfy to be able to take advantage of the assistance; the document will also set down the forms of assistance and methods of returning it (return payments). So-called cheap credits for agriculture will be a limited form of assistance and will be available only to young peasants (to help them get started) and to farms which, with the help of the state, will pass through a period of transformation more quickly and which, after modernizing, will be able to pay off the credit. The state will provide support and assistance in the financing of: -- the biological progress, peasant and social consulting, investments which result in the lowering of costs, improving quality, and limiting food losses; -- the development of the infrastructure, education, and various forms of training that will help peasants change their professions and work outside agriculture; the provision of elementary vocational training. Emphasis will be placed on the development of vertical integration, especially on the basis of its simpler form -- contracts between peasants and the government for the supply of agricultural products. This is an alternative to the central limitation of production. The main fears concerning the changes in this sphere is the danger of conserving the existing situation in agriculture and the creation of barriers around Polish agriculture which protect it from foreign competition. The main criterion of execution will be an increase in the percentage of inhabitants of rural areas that are employed outside agriculture in the total number of the population living in rural areas. Investing in Human Capital It is the government's view that the low amounts that were spent for many years on education and training, constitute a fundamental obstacle to restructuring the Polish economy today, as well as a factor impeding our international competitiveness. Therefore, the government will provide conditions conducive to investments, both by public and private subjects. The goal, among others, is to widen the scope of educating the youth at high school and university levels. In this area, the following can be expected: - Gradual exclusion from the tax basis [podstawa opodatkowania] with regard to individual incomes, of part of the expenditures borne on investing in human capital; - Inclusion of part of the expenditures borne on books, professional journals, scientific equipment and its software, into the cost of obtaining profit by teachers; - Exclusion from the tax basis of donations for public educational, scientific, cultural, and health protection units. The main criterion for execution will be an increasing role of expenditures borne on education, science, culture, and health protection, in the GDP. Managing State-Owned Wealth and Processes of Ownership Transformations The main goal which the government wants to achieve will be a clear improvement in the management of state-owned property through the establishment of strong, efficient, and productive management structures. This will be accomplished, among others, by transformations in the constitutive fundamentals of state-owned enterprises, strengthening the independence of the managements of state-owned enterprises of administrative organs, stabilization of the managing cadre, stabilization of the managing cadre through the application of managerial contracts and strong economic incentives, and an institutional separation of the State Treasury. Shortly, the government, in cooperation with the concerned parties, will define areas of the state's crucial interests in which no ownership transformations are being planned, it will indicate an enterprise destined for privatization, and it will create the proper conditions for an efficient and speedy dissolution and bankruptcy process. The main means of implementation are: - Commercialization of state-owned enterprises and an institutionalization of the State Treasury; - Setting in motion of the Program of Popular Privatization by establishing National Investment Funds; - Implementation of the "Stabilization-Restructuring- Privatization" program which is being introduced with organizational and financial participation by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The program covers those enterprises which are in a particularly difficult situation, and which will be subject to a process of bringing them back to health; - Continuation of the process of financial restructuring of state-owned enterprises and banks (which was begun in 1993); - Implementation of a long-term program of financial, asset- related, and organizational restructuring of those sectors which are particularly significant to the economy, like mining, the steel industry, the arms industry, and so on; - Privatization of the Polish economy by using all possible privatization and decentralization-of-privatization-decisions techniques. Among others, the following will take place: -- Speeding up the sale of small and medium enterprises into leasing by employee companies, through a simplification of the procedures and a liberalization of the terms of leasing; -- Introduction of a new institution of State Treasury companies with employees or other private investors, enabling partial privatization, with the possibility of conducting full-scale privatization in the future, with the participation of the same or other investors; - Undertaking rectification measures in enterprises that do not meet the criteria which are indispensable in the process of commercialization; - Speeding up the process of dissolving enterprises which are continuously ineffective. The main criterion of performance is an increase in the contribution of the private sector to the GDP. Medium-Term Financial Strategy Meeting repayments and servicing the cost of the foreign debt, requires development of the sector of production of export-bound goods and also of goods which are substitutive in relation to imports. It is a key issue in the long-term policy of a stable equilibrium in the balance of payments. The financial strategy for the years 1994-97 is subordinated to the goal of implementing the fundamental goals of the economic and social program, that is to say, maintaining the rate of real economic growth at the level of about 5 percent per year, and a reduction of the inflation rate below the level of 10 percent in 1997. Here are the main goals of the government's medium-term financial strategy: - Gradual return to a balance in the budget sector. It will be taking place through a reduction of the deficits occurring in that sector vis-a-vis the GDP, from 3.9 percent in 1994 down to 2-3 percent in 1997, and also through a stabilization of the internal public debt at the level of below 90 percent of GDP and a lessening of the cost of servicing the debt from about 4 percent of the GDP in 1994 down to 2.5 percent in 1997. This will make it possible to halt the decreasing trend occurring in the size of bank credits granted to the nonfinancial sector, and to accomplish a real growth of these credits at a rate that would approximate the real growth in the GDP; - Mobilization of domestic savings and an improvement in the banking system's credit potential, as well as developing the financial and capital market; - Maintaining the rate of real growth in expenditures and revenues in the 1994-97 period at below the rate of growth of the real GDP, and also maintaining the rate of real expenditure growth at below the level of the rate of real revenue growth; - Stabilization of the growth of foreign currency reserves (but the document fails to define at what level), despite a negative foreign-trade balance when it comes to routine turnover in the entire period up to 1997; - Gradual reduction of the foreign trade deficit vis-a-vis the GDP, as a result of a real and almost 1.5-time growth in exports compared with the growth in GDP, and as a result of reducing the distance between the real rate of import growth and the rate of general economic growth; - Maintaining the stable situation in the balance of payments over the medium term, with a very strict observance of repayments due and of servicing the foreign debt, in accordance with stipulations agreed upon with the Paris and London Clubs; - Denomination of the zloty and introduction into circulation of new banknotes and coins effective 1 January 1995. Monetary policies will play a fundamental role in stabilizing the economy. The main instruments of that policy shall be: - Maintaining credits for the nonfinancial sector in relation to the GDP at the level which is expected at the end of this year, that is about 19.5 percent; - A fall in real and nominal interest rates; the process will be influenced by the restructuring and by injecting additional capital into the banking sector, as well as by a gradual reduction of the rate of mandatory reserves; - A clearly slower rate of reduction of interest rates on bank deposits than a reduction of interest rates on export credits, along with (in the initial stage) guarantees by the state budget; - The kind of policies of foreign currency exchange rates which will maintain a stable relation of the zloty's real value to convertible currencies, with a simultaneous observance of the principle of a creeping growth of the exchange rate, which would be ever decreasing, along with a fall in the inflation rate; - A gradual change in the tax structure, which would be aimed at increasing the role of indirect taxes in general tax revenues, with a gradual reduction in the burden of income taxes, especially through a wider application of tax breaks; - An increased discipline of budget expenditures, including a reduction of the cost of servicing the domestic public debt, as well as slowing down the excessive rate of growth of expenditures borne on retirement pensions, other kinds of pensions, and social transfers. A fundamental part in that regard will be played by: A reform in the system of social insurance, establishment of retirement-pension funds, changing the principles of indexing of retirement and other kinds of pensions, a reduction of the cost of social protection along with targeting those social groups that are really the most needy, as the recipients of that protection; - At least a partial inclusion of the results of the activity of the economic "gray area" into the tax rate basis ("tax basis"). The main risk lies in the danger of inflation. Its return -- or a reduction which would be lower than assumed in the program -- will automatically mean a decreased reduction of interest rates and deteriorated conditions for investment and economic growth. The main criterion of execution will be a fall in the relation of public debt to the GDP. Development and Reforms of Financial Sector The government's main strategic goal is to take further measures for the sake of developing a strong, diversified, and efficient financial system. Measures will be continued for the sake of strengthening the National Bank of Poland's [NBP] independence and position as the state's currency-issuing bank and the government's financial agent, with a simultaneous freeing of NBP of ownership-investment and supervision functions. The government's policies toward the banking sector will be very clearly aimed at making its role in the process of economic growth more active through injecting additional capital into the banks, an improvement in the security of economic turnover, and so forth. Stimulation and supporting the process of consolidation of commercial banks is supposed to be accomplished through, among others: - Supporting the process of more efficient and stronger banks taking over weaker banks which are incapable of acting on their own; - Attaching inefficient banks acting in the form of Treasury-owned joint-stock companies, to those banks which are the State Treasury's property, and which have demonstrated a capability to generate profit for the owner and a simultaneous rise in the real value of their own funds; - Establishment of regional and supraregional banks, with the ultimate goal of establishing between 10 and 20 of them in Poland; - Establishment of a network of specialized banks, geared toward servicing specific kinds of activity, specific markets, types of operations, and so forth; - Transforming employee "grant-and-loan funds" [kasy zapomogowo-pozyczkowe] and cooperative savings-and-credit funds, into local funds and societies of credit self-help. A Bank Guarantee Fund will be established which will function as a guarantor of bank deposits. This will take the burden off the central bank and the state budget in terms of responsibility in that area. An independent organ of banking supervision will be separated from NBP's structure, giving it the importance of a chief supervision organ. Gradual consolidation and demonopolization of the insurance sector will be conducted, among others through supporting the process of integration among small insurance companies and applying selectivity in granting licenses to foreign firms. By the end of 1994, an insurance supervision division will be established within the Finance Ministry, and an independent Office of Insurance Supervision will be established. Before the end of 1994, the proper conditions will be created, enabling operation of both closed and open (of the "Pioneer" type) trust funds. The government will support the process of entry into the market by institutional investors other than trust funds, like insurance companies, retirement pension funds, and to some extent also banks, especially those which are geared toward investment activities and toward guaranteeing new issues [emisje]. The government will support the establishment of venture funds [preceding two words in English] to diversify the sources of financing developmental ventures of a high risk factor, which by definition cannot be covered by financing coming from banks. A further development of the Warsaw Stock Exchange will be continued, among others through the building of a second and third hall. At the same time, measures will be undertaken to initiate a stock exchange for date operations [gielda operacji terminowych] for foreign currencies and stock-market instruments. The main criterion of performance is a reduction of the differences between interest rates on deposits and interest rates on credits. Security of Economic Transactions and Absorption of "Gray Area" Development of the so-called "gray area" is a result (and also the reason) of the lack of security of economic transactions. Therefore, the government will make efforts to: - Popularize noncash transactions by using bills of exchange, and by securing executability of claims arising out of bills of exchange; - Encourage the use of checks in economic transactions; - Prevent many crimes in banking, checks, and bills of exchange transactions, and also increase the rate of detection of these crimes; - Introduce a uniform system of rendering payments by using magnetic cards (including foreign-made ones); - Introduce the obligation to have a bank account by every economic unit fulfilling specific criteria (for instance involvement in economic transactions); - Improve the system of bank noncash settlements, among others through supporting the work conducted by the National Settlement Chamber; - Introduce institutional barriers to prevent so-called money laundering. In relations with foreign countries, and especially in the state's foreign-currency policies, limitations on capital transfers out of Poland, shall be maintained over the next few years. Some provisions for protecting Polish investments will be widened, through conclusion of bilateral agreements on protecting and supporting investments. Perfecting institutional mechanisms in the area of taxes on merchandise and services, is being planned (widening the subject and object scope of the tax; perfecting the system of turnover taxes; eliminating unfair competition; imposing taxes on unregistered activity, mainly in the so-called "gray area," which will be accomplished through a continuously updated and uniform database on taxpayers; a duty to apply fiscal cash boxes [kasy fiskalne] in retail trade and other popular services, which will be introduced in stages; improving the system of documentation and circulation of documents, among others with the goal of mutual identification of taxpayers). Further measures include, among others, the widening of the scope of investment breaks in income tax, establishment of a popular taxpayer database, introduction by the Finance Ministry of a complete and comprehensive information system of real estate for fiscal purposes, and creating incentives and the proper conditions for revealing the entire profit by registered companies. Effective in 1995, customs services will be subordinated to the finance minister, making it possible to comprehensively settle customs and tax payments by just one integrated apparatus. In addition, the following will be accomplished: - Establishing an institution of deposit insurance which will operate in the form of a fund, guaranteeing bank deposits by individuals and by economic units; - Establishing a credit insurance fund, with the participation of the State Treasury, and with the goal of providing credit guarantees for small- and medium-size enterprises which do not have their own capital -- the fund will make it possible to obtain credits by conventional means. The main criterion of execution is a fall in the rate of economic crime, and a widening of the tax basis. International Competitiveness of Polish Economy The main goals are: - Establishment of a modern economy that would be characterized by a significant contribution of exports to the GDP, and a beneficial position in international trade; - Establishment of the proper conditions that would attract foreign capital and effectively use it in the process of development; - Poland's integration with the world economy (European Union, European Free Trade Association, CEFTA), and Poland's institutional presence in the system of international cooperation. The main means of accomplishment are: - Persistent implementation of the already existing programs of action, like: Fundamentals of the states' pro-export policies, timeframe for the implementation of the state's pro-export policies, programs supporting Eastern policies, fundamentals of the policies of economic cooperation with countries of the former USSR, East and Central Europe, and with China; - Continuation of the process of building a network of treaty-based agreements which will open up the cooperation of Polish and foreign economic units, with the goal of a geographical widening of markets; - Intensification of promotion of exports, especially to European countries, and also to China, Japan, India, countries of Asia and the Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East; - Preparing a draft law concerning insurance with regard to export credits from noncommercial risk, as well as strengthening and enlarging the Corporation for Export Credit Insurance.
