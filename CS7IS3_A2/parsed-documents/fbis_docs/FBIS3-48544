As such, cooperation between scientific researchers and consumers of technology is important and an early establishment of cooperation between the two is quite necessary. The consumers will be able to evaluate personally the benefits derived from the acquisition of new technology. This was stated by Suharto in Jakarta today at the simultaneous inauguration of a new gas-powered electron ray machine and the exhibition on National Atomic Energy Agency [BATAN] achievements during the Fifth Development Program. Taking the opportunity, President Suharto urged industry to take advantage of technological progress to increase production. [Begin Suharto recording] The community in general, and the industrial sector in particular, need to assimilate and utilize new technology so that quality can be improved further and production costs reduced. This is important in the effort to increase the value of industrial products and creating a more competitive atmosphere for medium-scale industries. People should also realize that nuclear energy is another important potential source of energy. Numerous developed nations have benefited from the utilization of nuclear energy. We now need to embark on the utilization of nuclear energy because our main energy sources are only derived from natural resources, which are not unlimited. The natural resources, which are irreplaceable, will be depleted soon if we do not utilize them sparingly. We should continuously strive to conserve our natural resources. Therefore, we should acquire nuclear technology because we need to consider the utilization of nuclear energy. [end recording] Minister of State for Research and Technology B Habibie reported that the establishment of the electron ray machine, which will begin operations soon, is for BATAN scientific research purposes. The installation of the machine is among numerous technologies using radiation. At the beginning, it will be used for the production of power cable. The U.S.$2-million machine uses technology from China.
