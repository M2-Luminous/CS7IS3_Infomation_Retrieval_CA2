The first lesson, however, is that Hungary has returned to the line of former socialist countries after a detour of four years. Like almost everywhere, the victorious left also returned to power in Hungary. For the Hungarian voters, the Balkan way seems to be more feasible than the European way; however, this does not mean the end of democracy; it only means a different model. We can draw at least a similar lesson from the fact that the Socialists' triumph is accompanied by the fall of all the former opposition parties. Members of the government coalition have been automatically replaced and, within the coalition, the collapse of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] became tragic at the election finish. The former rallying party with 42 percent of the votes has become a dwarf party with 9.5 percent. However, the collapse of the other opposition parties is even more spectacular than the tragic defeat of the MDF. The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], which seemed to be heading for triumph at the end of the first round, suffered the third-biggest loss after the losses of the MDF and the Smallholders Party by the end of the second round and compared with the 1990 elections. This is a surprising development, and it is even more surprising that the liberals were unable to get a single individual candidate in parliament in Budapest decorated with the party's flags. I think it is not an exaggeration to say that, indirectly, the two rival parties -- the SZDSZ and the MDF -- did the most for the success of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. And this really gives food for thought. Just like [SZDSZ Chairman] Ivan Peto's sudden fit of the blues. The chairman of the party that was running its superstar candidate for the position of prime minister is now desperately trying to prove that they have not yet made any clear statements regarding the coalition, and he is trying to make people understand that the liberals do not find it at all attractive to join the government. I believe that it is no longer attractive for them today. Gabor Kuncze's glory is over. Not only that he will not become prime minister, but it is hardly questionable whether he could get a ministry from the few the Socialists might offer to them in a possible government coalition. However, the issue is more complex than that. If the SZDSZ decides to remain in opposition, they will get into a rather special situation, because remaining in opposition at the cost of shrinking the party will hardly seem a noble feat of arms to the party membership divided over the idea of a left-wing coalition. In addition, in the opposition, the SZDSZ will enter political quarantine. Viktor Orban [chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats, Fidesz] already said it clearly that the liberal coalition has ceased to exist. And the relations between the former coalition parties and the SZDSZ are at least that clear. In the opposition, the SZDSZ can become unpleasantly isolated and this can lead to the disintegration of the party elite. If it gets into the government, the SZDSZ will become weightless and will also lose a considerable number of influential members and supporters who reject the leftist government. The coalition will not be an easy one, and the Socialists are also aware of this. They now regard both liberal parties as natural partners, and this formulation also contains a message to the Fidesz. The Fidesz will also find it difficult to decide, because this party collapsed into the smallest party, but they preserved their moral reserves, something that can also be reduced to nil in a few months at the side of the Socialist Party with an absolute majority in Parliament. Logic would dictate today that the Socialists should form a government alone, but logic is asserted in politics in a rather complex way. The MDF, which caused a landslide with its tragic politics, might cleanse itself and strengthen in the opposition, if it is able to acknowledge its defeat. Although the SZDSZ, which made complete use of the MDF mistakes, could make their dreams of power true, they could only do that at a price that could lead to a total disintegration of the party, because a big social-democratic party could also be the end of an MSZP-SZDSZ coalition. A possible liberal-conservative opposition coalition would completely close the door to the SZDSZ that joined the government. However, if the SZDSZ gives up its dream of power, they will have to admit that they also followed a tragic strategy. And they will not have the cathartic and protecting force of the experience of government activity behind them. Today, the SZDSZ has to choose between two bad things. Both bad things can considerably reduce the party's weight, power, and credibility. If they win, they will lose. If they join the loser, they might win. Perhaps in a later round. Whichever solution they choose, their decision will lead to the emergence of a new SZDSZ. Paradoxically, the tragedy of the SZDSZ is identical with that of the MDF. However, the MDF has it easier, because it no longer has a choice: If it fails to renew itself, it will cease to exist. However, its political counterpoint does not yet know which possibility of renewal to choose: To assimilate or to again deny itself.
