He was going to Estonia to take part in a ministerial session of the Council of Baltic Sea States. The Russian minister also intends holding a series of meetings with Estonian leaders. According to the Russian foreign minister, discussion of the Tartu treaty [signed by Estonia and Russia in 1920, dealing with territorial issues] is pointless. "We do not intend to discuss any territorial claims," the minister noted. Touching on the situation in Crimea, A. Kozyrev stressed that the main thing now is to refrain from using force. Talks between Russia and Ukraine on this issue are continuing at this time.
