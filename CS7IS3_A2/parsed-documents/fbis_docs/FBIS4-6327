FBIS4-6327 "dreas076_d_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-076 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 South Korea Official: 300 DPRK Loggers Hiding in Russia Official: 300 DPRK Loggers Hiding in Russia SK1804014194 Seoul YONHAP in English 0117 GMT 18 Apr 94 SK1804014194 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- More than 300 North Koreans who escaped from Siberian logging yards are hiding in Russia, besides the 200 or so who have already sought refuge in the South, a senior government official said Sunday. The official said, "the government has investigated the number of escapees from Siberian logging camps and found that there are still 300 more North Korean escapees who have not sought refuge in the South." However, he said, once the government actually allows the North Koreans to settle here, more escapees are expected to seek refuge in South Korea. "It seems that they have not visited the South Korean Embassy to seek refuge for fear that it would harm their families in North Korea," he said. The government has also discovered that some escapees want to settle in Russia rather than in South Korea. "If they wish to live in Russia, the government will support their settlement there through consultation with the Russian Government." North Korea operates logging yards in Siberia under a contract with the Russian Government, with hundreds of North Korean loggers reportedly having escaped due to poor working conditions and alleged infringement of human rights. The logging contract between Russia and North Korea was to expire at the end of last year and the two sides are now negotiating renewal after Moscow demanded an improvement in human rights conditions at the camps.
