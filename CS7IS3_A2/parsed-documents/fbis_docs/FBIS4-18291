What do you think of a European career for Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene? [Van Rompuy] No comment. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] If necessary, could you succeed Dehaene? [Van Rompuy] Become a colleague of Berlusconi? [laughs] No comment. I will be seeing Dehaene after the Easter holidays, but still, I am not going to give him my advice now through other people. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Our polls show that the CVP [Christian People's Party] is recovering. [Van Rompuy] I am pleased.... Two things are coming together. First, the fate of the CVP has always been linked with the fate of the government. The government has been doing better in recent months since it implemented its global plan and refused to give in to pressure. Second, we have been able to manage a transition of renewal in the CVP. I have accepted my responsibilities, and I think I have played a major role in helping us get over the crisis. I think I was right, even in the choice of prime minister. I sparked the renewal of the party which, as I had wanted, can only come through renewing the personnel. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Do you think you will again catch up with the Flemish Liberal Democrats (VLD)? [Van Rompuy] The European elections are very important. I am confident, and if the CVP could remain the leading party in Belgium, it would be a psychological blow for the Liberals. Today they are so euphoric and arrogant, as if the country belonged to them (with just 15 percent of the national vote in the polls). [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Are the traditional political parties capable of withstanding the "affairs?" Is not a major upheaval necessary? [Van Rompuy] You should see what remains of this upheaval in Italy. It makes me shudder to see that the fascists look likely to be included in the government.... However, there are other trends: In the French regional elections, the alternative parties were unsuccessful. The traditional parties must be aware that we are going through a very serious period of crisis in political legitimacy. They have to reconquer hearts and spirits and once more give people confidence in the system with a series of global measures for renewal. The political system must abandon its immobility and its feeling of ingratitude and conspiracy (the feeling that "everyone is against us"). Of course, there are excesses and, when I see the Flemish press printing complete lies, I am shocked that people are being discredited merely to improve circulation figures and to make money. However, I also know that there are serious files implicating the worlds of politics, insurance and trade unionism, and the worst thing we could do is deny the existence of these problems. The people must see that we are ready for change. The current climate is the worst, since no one knows what the future holds in store. An economic crisis could strengthen extremist reactions and if, at that time, democracy is not entrenched sufficiently with the population, certain elements could profit from the situation. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] The opinion of the Central Committee on Competition is worrying. What political conclusions can you draw? [Van Rompuy] The situation is perhaps not as alarming as people make out. The National Bank does have a significant balance of payments surplus. We should therefore relativize the "share of the market" reasoning. Let's wait for September's report. The government has recently decided on the global plan. We must assess its effects and impact on the economy at the beginning of fall. It is still too early. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] The measures proposed in the plan have been affected by measures taken in other countries, and especially the wage moderation granted in Germany.... [Van Rompuy] Yes, but with the notable difference that in Belgium we had to impose moderation.... [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] What do you think of the divisions among your partners on this crucial subject? [Van Rompuy] Since October, the consensus has been that the economy is in serious crisis. This is always the case when harsh measures have to be taken. The situation has worsened since the failure of the social pact. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Do you think that the Belgian social model is threatened? [Van Rompuy] In a time of crisis the threat is always there. Remember that in 1981 an interprofessional agreement was signed imposing a wage freeze. Two months later, [former Prime Minister] Martens launched an additional rescue plan. In 1982, when the currency was devalued, no social agreement was achieved. In such cases, it is up to the government, as guardian of the common interest, to take action. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Will Dehaene's team accept its responsibilities? Will it do so in September? [Van Rompuy] Everything will depend on the new opinion of the Central Committee and the attitude of the social partners. Will they manage to reach an agreement this time? They will have a month to do so. After that, we will intervene. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] If the current scenario were to occur again, would you act.... [Van Rompuy] We are obliged to by law.... [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Do you share the relative optimism of the governor of the National Bank who considers that we are "out of the crisis?" [Van Rompuy] I was the first to say so! Our darkest postwar year was 1993. In December, the Bank recorded its first jump, which was then confirmed in January and February. Technically, it is true, we are out of recession, but with 1 percent in 1994 we are not yet on the road to normal growth. Employment only takes off again when the economy has recovered. By the end of 1994, I would like to see a reduction in the federal debt accompanied by the first signs of an improvement in the employment situation. Until now, our crime is that we have been over-pessimistic. We have forgotten that there is an economic cycle.... [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Hearing you speak, anyone would think the employers have been overdramatizing things.... [Van Rompuy] The Belgian Employers' Federation (FEB) is still dominated by a few major industrial groups who are justifiably concerned. I do not want to accuse anyone merely on the basis of assumptions, but the employers know full well that the public authorities can impose measures. It is therefore in their best interests to dramatize the situation. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Positive discourse can also help get us out of difficulty.... [Van Rompuy] Very true! We can see a note of confidence returning to consumers and investors. If we have to point out what is going badly, to be truthful we also have to say what is going well. Crisis is also a psychological thing. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Is it to avoid compromising the recovery that the government implemented such a "soft" budgetary control? [Van Rompuy] The social pact, which guided my actions in the government, has turned into the global plan. We have listened, but we have also stood up to them. We have not given in. The country has felt governed despite the various malaises. Look at the figures. The difference between income and expenditure is 17 billion Belgian francs [BFr], while the reduction target is BFr60 billion. With the global plan, the measures applied on 1 April, and the slow economic recovery, it would be unreasonable to take further measures affecting spending power. Budgetary control has made it possible to resolve the problems without overdramatization. The new technique has borne fruit. We will consider the budget for 1995 in the summer. Everything will depend on changes in the short-term interest rate. This has yet to reach its lowest level. The government is banking on 6 percent. Maybe we will go below that, with a stronger franc. [passage omitted]. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] You are starting to plan the 1995 budget. You also mentioned the economic and psychological aspects of budgetary control. In July, a third aspect will come into play, a political aspect with the approach of the local elections. That will expose you taking an even "softer" approach. [Van Rompuy] We will see when the time comes. We must consider the economic situation. Let me also point out one thing: The budget will be worked out between the European and local elections. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] It will, then, be a difficult budget, politically speaking. [Van Rompuy] Everything depends on the gap we will have to make up. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Will you ask the towns and the regions to contribute to this effort? Some people are reluctant.... [Van Rompuy] They will have to make the efforts determined by the High Finance Committee. However, we live in a system where there is no hierarchy of standards, and where the executives and assemblies act totally independently. They therefore will have to participate in the effort of their own free will. We agreed that the different bodies would work together, and that there will be no disputes over the figures and the method if the Finance Committee issues a new opinion. Everyone then will have to accept their responsibilities, and we will see who is responsible if we do not respect the standards laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. The increase in spending of the towns and regions considerably exceeds the spending of the federal authority and even social security spending, which is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue in the future. Of tax and nontax revenue, 60 percent is kept by the federal authority while BFR40 billion goes to the towns, regions, and social security. However, public opinion seems to think that it is the federal authority that receives the full weight of the increase in taxation. We are justified in feeling a little frustrated.
