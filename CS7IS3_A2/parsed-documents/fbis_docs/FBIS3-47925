Giron] [Text] Sen. Blas Ople, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, urged the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) yesterday to anticipate potential vacuums in the region and forge a new solidarity in defense cooperation. Ople discussed the major strategic challenges in both foreign policy and security fields that ASEAN has to face at the threshold of a new century when he keynoted a two-day symposium of the region's leading centers of strategic and international studies, the ASEAN Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) at the Shangri-La EDSA Hotel in Mandaluyong. Dean Carolina Hernandez, director of the Center of Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), led the meeting, which brought together an intellectual powerhouse from ASEAN countries, including Lau Teik Soon, director of the Singapore Institute for International Affairs; Yusuf Wanandi and Dr. Hadi Soesastro of the CSIS in Jakarta; Dr. Kusuma Snitwongse, of the Thailand Institute of Security and International Studies; and, Dato Dr. Noordin Sopiee, of the ISIS in Kuala Lumpur. At the close of the meeting, the chairmanship of the ASEAN-ISIS passed on from the Philippines' Hernandez to Dr. Lau of Singapore. Ople said that while ASEAN welcomes the appearance of a new tranquility brought about by the end of the Cold War in Asia and the Pacific, there is no room for complacency because dangerous new vacuums can immediately arise without prior notice and confront the ASEAN with major threats to its security. "Our six nations ought to be able to envision new conceptual frameworks and a common strategic vision for our collective security," Ople said. "The formation of the ASEAN Regional Forum is an important first step taken by the leaders of ASEAN in that direction." Ople said Japan and China, although they have opened their own bilateral security dialogues, will contest any vacuum that arises in the region or exploit any change or shift in the regional and global balance of power. He said that in spite of the assurances by the United States that its commitment to the security of Asia and the Pacific remained undiminished, "there is a sense in which the defense retrenchments of the United States, involving a reduction of its military spending from six percent down to three and a half percent of gross national product in the next five years, can no longer be reversed." He said while the Pentagon has set a military bottom-line of fighting two wars in separate continents at the same time, the American people and their leaders now accept the limitations of "an imperial overstretch" which saps the resources required for domestic economic and social rebuilding. He said that in spite of the tension in the Korean peninsula, the unsettled conditions in Cambodia, and the potential border troubles in the South China Sea, the security environment for Southeast Asia has never been better, widening "our respective windows of opportunity to engage in sustained economic development unhampered by external security threats." Ople said it is a tribute to ASEAN statesmanship that the grouping has helped contain the potential disruptions of the peace and stability in the South China Sea through creative diplomacy.
