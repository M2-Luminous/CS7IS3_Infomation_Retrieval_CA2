Appropriate directives have been given to heads of workshops and foremen. Workers have been given a choice: Either to put their signatures supporting the "formidable" candidate or to face difficulties promised by managers. Under conditions of general job reductions, many prefer to avoid problems. Thus, the Brest Oblast may successfully continue its "good" traditions and become once again the "cradle" of a new head of state, as it was with Slyunkow [secretary of the Communist Party of Soviet Belarus] and Dzemyantsey [former Supreme Soviet speaker].
