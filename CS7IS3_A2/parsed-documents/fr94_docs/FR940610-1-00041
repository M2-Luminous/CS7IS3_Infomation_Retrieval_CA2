FR940610-1-00041 FR940610-1-00007 Par. 3. The authority citation for part 20 continues to read in part as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 *␣*␣* Par. 4. Section 20.7520&hyph;3 is amended by adding the text of paragraph (b) to read as follows: §20.7520&hyph;3 Limitation on the application of section 7520. * * * * * (b) Other limitations on the application of section 7520_ (1) In general_ (i) Ordinary beneficial interests. For purposes of this section: (A) An ordinary annuity interest is the right to receive a fixed dollar amount at the end of each year during one or more measuring lives or for some other defined period. A standard section 7520 annuity factor for an ordinary annuity interest represents the present worth of the right to receive $1.00 per year for a defined period, using the interest rate prescribed under section 7520 for the appropriate month. If an annuity interest is payable more often than annually or is payable at the beginning of each period, a special adjustment must be made in any computation with a standard section 7520 annuity factor. (B) An ordinary income interest is the right to receive the income from or the use of property during one or more measuring lives or for some other defined period. A standard section 7520 income factor for an ordinary income interest represents the present worth of the right to receive the income from $1.00 for a defined period, using the interest rate prescribed under section 7520 for the appropriate month. (C) An ordinary remainder or reversionary interest is the right to receive an interest in property at the end of one or more measuring lives or for some other defined period. A standard section 7520 remainder factor for an ordinary remainder or reversionary interest represents the present worth of the right to receive $1.00 at the end of a defined period, using the interest rate prescribed under section 7520 for the appropriate month. (ii) Certain restricted beneficial interests_ A restricted beneficial interest is an annuity, income, remainder, or reversionary interest that is subject to any contingency, power, or other restriction, whether the restriction is provided for by the terms of the trust, will, or other governing instrument or is caused by other circumstances. In general, a standard section 7520 annuity, income, or remainder factor may not be used to value a restricted beneficial interest. However, a special section 7520 annuity, income, or remainder factor may be used to value a restricted beneficial interest under some circumstances. See Example 4 in §20.7520&hyph;3(b)(2)(iv) and Example 2 in §20.7520&hyph;3(b)(4), which illustrate situations where special section 7520 actuarial factors are needed to take into account limitations on beneficial interests. See §20.7520&hyph;1(c) for requesting a special factor from the Internal Revenue Service. (iii) Other beneficial interests. If, under the provisions of §20.7520&hyph;3(b), the interest rate and mortality components prescribed under section 7520 are not applicable in determining the value of any annuity, income, remainder, or reversionary interest, the actual fair market value of the interest (determined without regard to section 7520) is based on all of the facts and circumstances if and to the extent permitted by the Code provision applicable to the property interest. (2) Provisions of governing instrument and other limitations on source of payment_ (i) Annuities. A standard section 7520 annuity factor is not to be used to determine the present value of an annuity for a specified term of years or the life of one or more individuals unless the effect of the trust, will, or other governing instrument is to ensure that the annuity will be paid for the entire defined period. In the case of an annuity payable from a trust or other limited fund, the annuity is not considered payable for the entire defined period if, considering the applicable section 7520 interest rate, the annuity is expected to exhaust the fund before the last possible annuity payment is made in full. For this purpose, it must be assumed that it is possible for each measuring life to survive until age 110, because every standard section 7520 annuity factor is calculated on the basis of that assumption. If it is determined that the trust or other fund from which an annuity is to be paid may exhaust before the end of the defined period of the annuity, it will be necessary to calculate a special section 7520 annuity factor that takes into account the facts and circumstances that may exhaust the trust or fund.
