The party will do nothing against Manuel Camacho Solis. He is still a PRI militant. "Camacho, who I respect, decided to resign from his post as peace commissioner. It was his personal and respectable decision, and it is wrong to attribute this resignation to any statement that our presidential candidate could have made on the peace negotiations in Chiapas. The party will do nothing against the PRI militants who belong to the so-called Group of 30. That group "is not our enemy. We live in a pluralistic and heterogeneous society where there is respect and tolerance for the opinions of the citizens, who are free to express themselves. PRI does not agree with their opinions, but they are absolutely free to make them known. The party will do nothing about that." Pichardo noted: "They are free to state their opinion, what happens is that we disagree with some of their positions, although there is agreement on the need for promoting democracy in our country." During an extensive interview, this newspaper asked him: What is the PRI's situation as a result of the attack by the Camachistas, considering that Camacho himself stated in his resignation letter that presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo did not give him a vote of confidence in the negotiations for peace in Chiapas and hints that this was one of the causes of his resignation? [Pichardo] The truth is that there is no attack by the Camachistas. Manuel Camacho, whom I respect, made a decision he attributed, mistakenly, in my opinion, to statements made by our presidential candidate. He decided to resign from his post as commissioner for peace and reconciliation. This is a respectable decision that is personal. "He also said two other important things. He said that he will abstain from any political activity during the rest of this administration. He also said something I believe he said recently during an interview, that he remains a member of the PRI. All this leads to the conclusion that there is no attack by the Camachistas. The party is working hard and showing respect for the current position of Manuel Camacho." [Quintero] Nothing will be done against him? [Pichardo] Not at all. He has a very respectable personal position. [Quintero] Nothing will be done against the Group of 30 militants either? [Pichardo] No. PRI realizes that we live in a pluralistic and heterogeneous society and that the fundamental element is respect and tolerance for the opinion of the citizens, who are free to express themselves. This group of citizens is exercising its constitutional right to meet and analyze the country's problems and to freely state its opinion. "Another thing concerns their positions' being in agreement with the party's position. They are free, and the party is not going to consider this one way or another. They are free to express their opinions. What happens is that we disagree with some of the positions stated by this group, although we all agree that we must work for greater democracy in our country. "I want to tell you that, in the opinion of the chairman of the CEN, the march toward democracy is permanent and endless. No political system in the world can claim it has a perfect democracy. It is always possible to find deficiencies and weaknesses, and therefore it is possible to take corrective action." [Quintero] Is there not too much tolerance for those people? [Pichardo] No. There can never be too much tolerance. We believe they are exercising their constitutional right to meet and to freely express their points of view. This does not mean that we agree with what they say. [Quintero] Do you think there is a campaign against the PRI? [Pichardo] There are political campaigns. They are very intense, not against the PRI, but in the search for political power there is, of course, heat produced by the campaign. [Quintero] Are there campaigns from any specific group? [Pichardo] Not at all. These are different matters. The party has its own dynamics and course, and this group of citizens is free to express its points of view. We do not view its members as enemies or criticize their right to express their points of view. This does not mean we agree with them. They can meet and express their opinion on national problems." Withdrawn Employees Later on, Pichardo Pagaza was asked whether present government employees, who came from the PRI ranks, were not turning their backs on their own party. The Mexican replied: "No. What has happened is that the new legal dispositions establish limits for government employees. Several employees have interpreted those dispositions very broadly, and others, fortunately only a few, have stopped exercising a right that is guaranteed by the Constitution and secondary laws. "Any citizen, including those who occupy a post in government, as long as they do not use their offices' assets and supplies or work during office hours, can fully exercise their right to participate in political activities. Fortunately, many are already doing this; others have withdrawn, but they are smaller in number." At the beginning of the interview held in one of the CEN's private offices at PRI facilities, Pichardo Pagaza said the PRI and its candidate to the Presidency of the republic, as well as the rest of its candidates to other elected positions, are carrying out an intense political campaign throughout the country. "The information, the real situation is that the party is vigorous, well organized, and has overcome the tremendous blow of losing Luis Donaldo Colosio, our candidate for the Presidency of the republic. We have now gathered around Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, who is competing at a national level." He emphasized: "It is the PRI that is campaigning, enthused, facing the future, and convinced that it confronts a very strong electoral competition. The party is in an electoral process where all the parties have equal conditions, where the PRI no longer has a protective mantle, and where there are autonomous electoral bodies that are now geared towards the people. We have a new electoral law and a number of recent factors that have been assimilated by the PRI rank and file. Thus, we are facing a new, unknown process, which is a challenge and a motivation to us." [Quintero] When you say the PRI no longer has a protective mantle, are you referring to the often-criticized PRI-government symbiosis, and does this mean that the PRI will be autonomous and independent from the government? [Pichardo] That is correct. The party is aware that it is necessary that it remain autonomous with regard to the government. Not only must it be autonomous, but it must uphold it vanguardist, advanced position within the party itself. We feel proud when elected PRI officials comply with their civic duties. We also feel compelled, however, to point out the errors, mistakes, and unfulfilled promises of PRI officials who are not meeting the voters' expectations. "You have mentioned an important point, but for many years the PRI was the sole party, and the political struggle took place -- it was an exclusive struggle -- within the party. Conditions have changed, Mexican society has changed, and the PRI is promoting those changes. We are now facing a challenge, but this also means that we must act in a totally democratic manner.... "It means equality of conditions with the rest of the parties and facing impartial electoral institutions where, from the officials at the voting tables to the ones at the highest levels of the Federal Electoral Institute General Council, there are private citizens and not the government or political parties. Far from involving a feeling that we are in an advantageous position, the new situation is a true challenge and positively motivates the PRI and its political competition.
