More than 300 specially designated banks and credit co-operatives were open yesterday, each selling lottery tickets for one of four stocks on offer in the one billion yuan (about HK$885 million) [Hong Kong dollars] issue. The four companies offering shares are Beijing Department Store, Beijing Town and Country Trade Centre, Beiren Co, and Beijing Light Bus Co. Eager investors started queuing for tickets about 6 am and while some pushing and shoving was reported when the doors opened at 9 am, the sale went ahead without serious incidents. Public security officers and municipal officials were stationed at each of the issuing locations to maintain order following a massive government propaganda campaign last week designed to convince residents that everyone had an equal chance to buy shares. "We have done everything in our power to make sure this event goes off smoothly," a city government official said yesterday. "We have certainly learned from the experience of Shenzhen and are confident this issue will be a success." Prospectuses for the four state-run enterprises issuing shares were printed in the BEIJING DAILY newspaper, with detailed explanations of the lottery system and warnings that stock prices could go down as well as up. Sale of lottery tickets will take three days, after which drawing of the winning tickets will be shown on television and the results published in newspapers. Most potential investors interviewed yesterday were happy with the lottery system which requires buyers to place a 200 yuan, six-month deposit at the bank for each ticket, but some felt the system still could be open to abuse. The Beijing Department Store, located in the city's premier Wangfujing shopping district, will issue 50 million shares, but analysts said it was doubtful if the stock would prove popular. Although the store, built in 1955, had a sales volume of 1.1 billion yuan last year analysts say it suffers from poor management and the building needs renovation. The Beijing Town and Country Trade Centre, on the other hand, is likely to attract considerable investor interest. The massive department store located at Gongzhufen serves the rapidly growing residential area of western Beijing and last year recorded profits of 52 million yuan. Town and Country also plans to issue 50 million shares and analysts expect the issue to be oversubscribed. Another sought-after stock will be Beiren Co. China's largest printing machinery producer, which successfully listed 100 million shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange last July. The fourth stock is Beijing Light Bus Co. which produces 17 percent of all China's mini-buses and last year made profits of 22.3 million yuan. Beijing Light Bus plans to issue 40 million shares and invest the capital raised in renovation of its ageing plant.
