FR940207-2-00161 FR940207-2-00075 A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The proposed rule change would allow PTC to establish a method for calculating the percentages ( i.e., margin) to be deducted from the market value of CMO securities, as distinguished from GNMA securities, currently eligible for deposit or which may become eligible for deposit at PTC. Currently, the only CMO securities eligible for deposit at PTC are VA REMICs. 3 3 A REMIC is a Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit. VA REMICs are securities for which the full and timely payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. The Commission approved VA REMICs, guaranteed by the United States government, as eligible for deposit at PTC in Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 30792 (June 10, 1992), 57 FR 27495, and 31914 (February 24, 1993), 58 FR 12295. Subsequent to its initial filing, PTC submitted additional information concerning the method by which margin for VA REMICs will be calculated. See letter from Leopold S. Rassnick, Vice President & General Counsel, PTC, to Ester Saverson, Branch Chief, Division, Commission (January 12, 1993) (containing prospectuses for VA REMIC issues 1992&hyph;1 and 1992&hyph;2, PTC internal analysis entitled ``Margins in Collateralized Mortgage Obligations,'' and sales literature from Trepp Pricing Services, Inc. (``Trepp'') entitled ``CMO/REMIC Valuation Methodology''); letters from Michael D. Frieband, Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, PTC, to Judith Poppalardo, Assistant Director, Division, Commission, and James Hodgetts, Assistant Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank (June 11, 1993, and July 1, 1993) (containing data comparing actual CMO prices to Trepp predicted prices); letter from Michael D. Frieband, dated August 17, 1993, supra note 2 (containing additional volatility information). PTC requires its participants to maintain Net Free Equity of zero or greater in each of their agency, pledgee transfer, or proprietary accounts in order for transactions to be processed. Net Free Equity represents PTC's calculation of the amount of excess equity, available in a participant's account, which PTC may borrow against or liquidate in the event a participant's debit balance is not satisfied at the end of the day. Under Article II, Rule 9 of PTC's Rules, a certain percentage, as determined by PTC (``Applicable Percentage''), of the market value of securities is included in the computation of Net Free Equity. Net Free Equity is calculated as the sum of: (a) The cash balance; (b) The Applicable Percentage of the market value of securities in the account; (c) The value of the optional deposits to the Participants Fund which are allocated to that account; (d) 20% of the mandatory deposits to the Participants Fund for the master account; and (e) Reserve on gain. The Applicable Percentage is determined by deducting certain percentages ( i.e., margin) from the market value of securities. By including only a portion of the market value of securities in Net Free Equity, PTC attempts to limit the risk caused by fluctuations in the market value of these securities. For GNMA securities (other than construction loan, project loan, and mobile home), margins are set at 5%, which is a rate that exceeds their largest historic consecutive two-day downward price movement. Unlike GNMA securities, CMO securities are structured as a series of tranches or classes. Each tranche within a CMO is a separate security with unique characteristics, such as differing payment schedules and price volatility. In addition, historical price data, to determine volatility, exists for GNMA securities, whereas historical price data to determine CMO securities' volatility does not yet exist. For CMO securities, therefore, PTC has developed a model utilizing the yield on Treasury securities to predict the potential movement of a CMO tranche based on the rise or fall of interest rates. Under PTC's model, the largest two day movement for CMO tranches which exhibit positive effective duration was a 35 basis point upward move in the underlying Treasury securities. For CMO tranches which exhibit negative effective duration, the largest two-day move was a 50 basis point downward move in the underlying Treasury security. For CMO tranches which cannot be modeled, PTC will set the margin at 100% ( i.e., the Applicable Percentage will be zero). PTC proposes to establish the margin for each CMO tranche based on this method, rather than assigning a specific percentage for CMO securities, because each CMO security has unique characteristics. Without historical information, such as that available for GNMA securities, PTC believes the use of an analytical model is the best method to determine the expected volatility of a CMO tranche. The margin for each CMO tranche will be set by PTC management, on the basis of the stated analysis and formula, as the CMO tranche is deposited in PTC. Since the proposed rule change provides for the safeguarding of securities and funds within PTC's custody or control or for which it is responsible, PTC believes it is consistent with Section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to PTC. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition PTC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others PTC has not solicited, and does not intend to solicit, comments on this proposed rule change. PTC has not received any unsolicited comments from participants or other interested parties. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of PTC. All submissions should refer to File Number SR&hyph;PTC&hyph;92&hyph;16 and should be submitted by February 28, 1994. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
