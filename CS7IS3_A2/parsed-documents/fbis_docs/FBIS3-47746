Also present were Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai and a representative of the Government Office. Senator Kerry briefed the prime minister on the purposes of his visit to Vietnam, and greatly appreciated the results of his meetings and the meetings of other U.S. delegations with senior officials of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and some offices concerned. He viewed these meetings as discussions of important significance aimed at contributing to strengthening the mutual understanding and promoting the normalization of the U.S.- Vietnamese relations. The senator noted that on the MIA issue, the two countries had engaged in a process of perfect cooperation, and that cooperation is developing its effect. The government and people of Vietnam, he also noted, have tried their best to cooperate with the U.S. side in the search for American missing in action [MIA] as well as in the supply of information on the American MIAs in Vietnam. The issue now is not in the Vietnamese court but rather on the American side. His excellency the senator said: Enduring untold suffering in the past, the Vietnamese people are now cooperating with the U.S. side. They have, however, not been compensated appropriately for what they have done. The U.S. side will continue to struggle within its own ranks to overcome the obstacle -- the MIA issue -- in the normalization of U.S.-Vietnamese relations, trying to achieve rapid progress in the U.S.-Vietnamese relations. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet hailed Senator Kerry and other Americans of goodwill for having expressed their views and working actively to support the normalization of U.S.-Vietnamese relations for the sake of peace, stability, and development in Southeast Asia as well for their cooperation in the MIA issue, thus helping press ahead with gradually-improving U.S.-Vietnamese relations. The prime minister affirmed: It is Vietnam's consistent policy on the MIA issue to do its utmost for humanitarian purposes. Satisfactory resolution of the MIA issue will create mutual understanding and mutual trust with which to resolve other issues related to the interests of the two nations. The prime minister said: Although each country has its own difficulties and advantages, while resolving their domestic difficulties, the two countries should strive to avoid creating impact on each other. Vietnam has been and is doing that, and hopes that the U.S. side will do likewise in order to contribute to creating favorable conditions for the process of normalizing U.S.-Vietnamese relations The prime minister asked his excellency the senator to convey to the U.S. President Vietnam's view that it was time for the two countries to make a new decision on bilateral relations, and the earlier that Vietnam-U.S. relations are normalized, the more favorable will be the conditions created for the development of cooperative relations in various fields in conformity with the interests of both countries. The prime minister also asked his excellency the senator to convey his New Year greetings to the U.S. people. Also, on the afternoon of 14 January, Chairman of the National Assembly Nong Duc Manh received Senator Kerry at his office. Senator Kerry expressed his pleasure over the meeting with the National Assembly chairman and considered that event very important, ushering in opportunities for cooperation between the Vietnamese National Assembly and the U.S. Congress. He also thanked Chairman Nong Duc Manh and the Vietnamese authorities for their hospitality to him and his party, and said that his Vietnam visits had left him with fine impressions of the land and people of Vietnam. Chairman Nong Duc Manh expressed his hope that the results of the visit would contribute to strengthening the mutual understanding between the two legislatures and the two peoples. Prompted by the humanitarian spirit and profound sympathies toward the families of Americans missing in action, the Vietnamese National Assembly and people would continue their cooperation with the U.S. side for the settlement of the MIA issue. The U.S. delegation also had working sessions with Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and representatives of the Vietnam MIA Office. On the afternoon of 15 January, the delegation left Hanoi for Ho Chi Minh City and Danang prior to its departure for home.
