The issue of the Palestinian detainees in the jails of the Zionist occupation authorities continues to be the focus of public activity in occupied Palestine. A general strike was observed today in the West Bank, occupied Jerusalem, and the two Palestinian autonomous areas of Gaza and Jericho to show solidarity with thousands of Palestinian detainees who reject the Zionist conditions for their release. They have been on a hunger strike since last week. Today's strike was accompanied by massive demonstrations in West Bank towns and refugee camps and sit-ins in front of the offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] in Gaza and Jericho. The protesters called for the detainees' unconditional release and criticized the PLO leadership's method of handling the detainee issue. Hundreds of Palestinian detainees in the Zionist jail in Nabulus have also assailed the PLO leadership. In a statement today, they leveled sharp criticisms at Yasir 'Arafat's leadership style which exploits the detainee issue as a bargaining chip. The statement affirmed that the detainees will persist in refusing to sign declarations of support for the peace agreement with the enemy or promise to halt the intifadah as a condition for their release. Ahmad Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] distributed a leaflet in the West Bank blaming 'Arafat's leadership for the continued suffering of thousands of Palestinian detainees in the enemy's jails. The PFLP-GC called on the Palestinian people to continue their intifadah and express solidarity with the detainees by demonstrating and holding sit-ins. The Forces of the Palestinian Alliance that comprise the 10 factions opposed to the peace agreement with the enemy organized a sit-in today for the second day running in front of the ICRC office in Damascus to declare solidarity with the detainees. The protesters delivered a message to ICRC officials, to be forwarded to the United Nations, calling for the prompt and unconditional release of all Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails regardless of their political affiliations. Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, declared in the Syrian capital today that the Palestinian detainee issue is the focus of a fresh popular resurgence inside and outside occupied Palestine. Hawatimah emphasized that the Palestinians are confident now that the peace agreement between the PLO and the Zionist enemy does not serve their interests and cannot survive because of the complex problems hindering its implementation, particularly in connection with the issues of Jerusalem, the detainees, and Palestinian human rights.
