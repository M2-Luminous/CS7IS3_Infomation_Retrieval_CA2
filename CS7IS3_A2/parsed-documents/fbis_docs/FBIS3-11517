The minister admitted that public employees' salaries are low. He added, however, that at the current moment -- when everyone's capacity to sacrifice is being tested -- it is not acceptable that cuts be implemented in the salaries of some and not in the salaries of others. The finance minister said that if the problem in converting salaries into Real Value Units results from the wording of the provisional measure, he will ask President Itamar Franco to write another text. Minister Cardoso today held a meeting with businessmen at the National Confederation of Industries headquarters and tried to calm down the financial market. He denied today the rumor that 30 April will be a bank holiday. According to him, it will not be a holiday because the government does not want to touch savings passbooks or freeze prices: [Begin recording] There will be no bank holiday on 30 April or any other day because we will not touch the savings passbooks or, by no means, impose price controls. We will force prices down, control abuse, but will not control prices or anything else that might affect the people's pockets. There will be no bank holiday; this is a thing of the past and it is over. [end recording] Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso today received the businessmen's support for the economic stabilization plan. They asked the minister, however, to do his best in favor of the constitutional reform because they deem it fundamental for the plan's success. Some entrepreneurs also expressed their support for Cardoso's possible presidential candidacy. The minister, however, said the decision will depend on popular support: [Begin recording] To become a candidate, I need the people's votes. The moment I feel the people really want me to become a candidate and that they feel that by becoming a candidate I am not abandoning the plan, but helping making it successful, then I will be able to decide better. [end recording] During the meeting with the businessmen, the finance minister again asserted that the implementation of the new currency, the real, will be announced well in advance in order not to surprise anyone.
