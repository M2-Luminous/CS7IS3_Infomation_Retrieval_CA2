According to Yushenkov, cutbacks in defense spending at the moment were passing the point after which a breakdown would begin. Deputy Chairman Aleksandr Piskunov said that President Yeltsin supported increasing defense spending. First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin said that over 60 percent of the defense budget went on social expenditure linked to the unprecedented withdrawal of troops from foreign countries, including from former Soviet republics and the construction of housing for officers. Answering an Interfax question on where additional expenditure would come from, Yushenkov said that the income part of the budget could be reconsidered. He said that merely by cancelling privileges in foreign economic activity, income could be increased by five trillion rubles. Certain individual parts of budget could also be reconsidered, he said, such as expenditure on maintaining the state apparatus.
