The presentation of the plan has divided the deputies of the National Front For Change and Democracy Parliamentary Bloc, BP-FNCD, which may split. It is known that the plan is to be discussed very soon during a regular session of the Chamber of Deputies. Edner Jean has filed a report: [Begin recording] [Jean] For Pierre-Canel Rindal, one of the people who signed the parliamentary plan, the sequence of steps of this plan follow a certain political logic. In answer to criticism from certain colleagues, Rindal, a deputy from Carrefour, thinks an easy -- lazy -- solution, which consists of denouncing the paralysis of the Governors Island agreement. [sentence as heard] As a statesman and political figure, Rindal says he went to Washington seeking a well-balanced political equation to unblock the agreement. As regards differences on the strategy for the exiled president's return that are shaking this political bloc, which is close to Aristide, Rindal, who is an influential member of the BP-FNCD, thinks that Aristide's return must be crafted by certain men in situ. [Rindal, in Creole] I think President Aristide has a personal vision of his return. We, as in situ legislators facing a number of realities, have our own way of effecting the return of President Aristide. We also think that today, as political figures, we have come up with a number of formulas with a view to moving beyond the Governors Island agreement, which is paralyzed. Our plan does not aim to replace the Governors Island agreement; rather, it aims to unfreeze the agreement first, so that the different points of the agreement can make their way. [Jean] What is the next step? [Rindal] The next step is the vote by the parliament, so that the Governors Island agreement is released and everyone is accountable for his signature on it. [Jean] Deputy Fignole Jean-Louis is not willing to ratify this plan. Moreover, the parliament does not have the authority to ratify such a plan if it is not presented in the form of a resolution. Fignole Jean-Louis, who is from Mirebalais and who is returning from an extended stay abroad for security reasons, is ready to go over to the opposition and fight this plan, a plan made entirely in America for the purpose of creating a favorable atmosphere for applying Article 148 of the Constitution. Jean-Louis accuses those signing this plan of tagging along behind certain prime ministers. [Jean-Louis] We do not yet know exactly what game is being played right now. The problem is not that they [not further unidentified] want the president to appoint a prime minister. I would not have any problem with that. The problem is that there are a number of proposals that would push President Aristide, as regards appointing a prime minister. If, however, President Aristide could appoint a prime minister within the scope of the Constitution, I do not have a problem with that. The prime minister they want for President Aristide, however, is a prime minister they want to impose on him. Even if they have not yet made the name public, it is a prime minister who tags along behind certain international powers; that prime minister is already primed and will be forced to bring about what the people who primed him want. [Jean] The other [word indistinct] of BP-FNCD prefers to play the role of a firefighter, attempting to contain the various opinions that risk exacerbating relations among the deputies of the BP-FNCD. Deputy Serge Jean-Louis rejects any idea of a split in the BP-FNCD because of the sharp disagreements. Serge Jean-Louis, who is from Marchand, condemns the attitude of most of his colleagues, who are criticizing -- without reservation -- the FNCD legislators who participated in the Washington talks. [passage omitted] One could say that the coming days may perhaps reveal a number of conflicts of political interest that have always divided the parliamentary coalition that backs Aristide's return. The Washington plan, a real seed of discord, risks drawing a dividing line between the FNCD and Lavalas deputies. [end recording]
