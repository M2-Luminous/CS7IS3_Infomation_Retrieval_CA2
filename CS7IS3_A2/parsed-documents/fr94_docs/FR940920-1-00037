FR940920-1-00037 FR940920-1-00007 In addition, a summary of economic impacts (e.g., household, community, and business impacts) is presented that provides projected economic burdens resulting from the combination of the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS and the proposed subpart Eb NSPS. The cost estimates provided in this section are in 1990 dollars, and include costs for emission control and compliance testing. The estimates do not include costs for such things as permitting and enforcement. For further information on the impacts of the proposed NSPS, refer to the document entitled ``Economic Impact Analysis for Proposed Emission Standards and Guidelines for Municipal Waste Combustors'' that is included in the list of items under SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION at the beginning of this preamble. A. Incremental Impacts of the Proposed NSPS over the 1991 NSPS The following is a discussion of the incremental air, water and solid waste, energy, and cost impacts of the proposed NSPS over the impacts of the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS. 1. Air Impacts The air emission reductions discussed below, as well as other impacts discussed in today's proposal, are nationwide impacts that would result from full implementation of the NSPS in the fifth year after adoption. These are incremental impacts of the proposal over the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS. Under today's proposed standards, nationwide emissions of total dioxins/furans would be reduced by about 1 kilogram per year (kg/yr), total mass, over the reductions associated with the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS. Emissions of dioxins/furans on a TEQ basis would reduced by about 10 grams per year (g/yr). On a nationwide basis, dioxin/furan emissions would be reduced by about 33 percent over levels under the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS. Under the proposed NSPS, nationwide emissions of PM would be reduced by about 800 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) over the levels associated with the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS. This represents a nationwide reduction of about 34 percent over the subpart Ea levels. Nationwide emissions of Cd and Pb would be reduced by about 1 and 17 Mg/yr, respectively, over the levels associated with the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS. This represents an incremental reduction of about 53 percent for Cd and 81 percent for Pb over subpart Ea NSPS levels. Nationwide emissions of Hg would be reduced by about 18 Mg/yr over levels associated with the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS. This represents an incremental reduction of about 72 percent over subpart Ea NSPS levels. Nationwide emissions of SO 2 and HCl would be reduced by about 3,000 and 4,000 Mg/yr, respectively, over reductions associated with the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS. Total acid gas emissions would be reduced by about 58 percent over subpart Ea NSPS levels.
