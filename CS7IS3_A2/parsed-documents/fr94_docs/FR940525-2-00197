ACTION: Notice of Determination by NHTSA that nonconforming 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300SE passenger cars are eligible for importation. SUMMARY: This notice announces the determination by NHTSA that 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300SE passenger cars not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation into the United States because they are substantially similar to a vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards (the U.S.-certified version of the 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300SE), and they are capable of being readily modified to conform to the standards. DATES: The determination is effective May 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ted Bayler, Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance, NHTSA (202&hyph;366&hyph;5306). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards must be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishers' notice in the Federal Register of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the Federal Register . G&K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (Registered Importer R&hyph;90&hyph;007) petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300SE passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. NHTSA published notice of the petition on March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12637) to afford an opportunity for public comment. The reader is referred to that notice for a thorough description of the petition. No comments were received in response to the notice. Based on its review of the information submitted by the petitioner, NHTSA has determined to grant the petition. Vehicle Eligibility Number for Subject Vehicles The importer of a vehicle admissible under any final determination must indicate on the form HS&hyph;7 accompanying entry the appropriate vehicle eligibility number indicating that the vehicle is eligible for entry. VSP # 68 is the vehicle eligibility number assigned to vehicles admissible under this determination. Final Determination Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, NHTSA hereby determines that a 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300SE (Model ID 126.024) not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards is substantially similar to a 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300SE originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and certified under section 114 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
