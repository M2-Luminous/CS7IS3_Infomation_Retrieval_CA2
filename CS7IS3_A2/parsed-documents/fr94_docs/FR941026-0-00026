FR941026-0-00026 FR941026-0-00008 •Who Can Receive an Economic Development Conveyance? An LRA is the only entity eligible to receive property under an Economic Development Conveyance. An LRA should have broad-based membership, including, but not limited to, representatives from those jurisdictions with zoning authority over the property. The Secretary of Defense shall officially recognize an LRA for planning and/or implementation through the Office of Economic Adjustment. Consequently, applications submitted by entities other than LRAs will not be considered. •When should an application for an Economic Development Conveyance be made? First, an LRA must be organized and a redevelopment plan created. The Department of Defense's Office of Economic Adjustment can provide guidance and technical and financial support in these efforts. Once a redevelopment plan has been developed and adopted, the LRA can then submit an EDC application to the Military Department responsible for the property. The application should be submitted by the LRA after consultation with the Military Department which shall establish a reasonable time period for submission of the application. The LRA always has the option of acquiring property under the FPASA and thus it may not be necessary to complete an application for an EDC within the stated timetables. LRAs can discuss the various transfer options with the Military Department. •How much property should be included in an Economic Development Conveyance application? The EDC should be used by LRAs to obtain large parcels of the base rather than merely individual buildings. The income received from some of the higher value property should be used to offset the maintenance and marketing costs of the less desirable parcels. In order for this conveyance to spur redevelopment, large parcels must be used to provide an income stream to assist the long-term development of the property. •Why is an application necessary? This Amendment to the interim final rule prescribes that an application be prepared by an LRA as the formal request for property, to better assist the Military Department in considering requests for property under the Economic Development Conveyance (EDC). This information also will provide the basis for the Military Department to respond to its obligations under Title XXIX, taking into account the best community-based information on the proposed conveyance action. A great deal of information necessary for an application is readily available to the LRA through the community planning process and supported through existing DoD technical and financial resources. Beyond the standard planning information collected to date, LRAs should incorporate a business and development component into their overall base reuse planning process as a basis for receiving and managing the real property. This supplemental effort will assist LRAs in identifying necessary implementation resources and establish a community-based proposal for the Military Department's consideration. The Military Departments and the Office of Economic Adjustment will continue to work closely with the affected LRA to ensure that an adequate planning effort is undertaken. •What must an application contain? The application should explain why an EDC is necessary for economic redevelopment and job creation. The application should contain the following elements. 1. A copy of the adopted Redevelopment Plan. 2. A project narrative including the following: _A general description of property requested. _A description of the intended uses. _A description of the economic impact of closure on the local communities. _A description of the financial condition of the community and the prospects for redevelopment of the property. _A statement of how the EDC is consistent with the overall Redevelopment Plan. 3. A description of how the EDC will contribute to short- and long-term job creation and economic redevelopment of the base and community, including projected number, and type, of new jobs it will assist in creating. 4. A business and development plan for the EDC parcel, including such elements as: _A development timetable, phasing plan and cash flow analysis. _A market and financial feasibility analysis describing the economic viability of the project, including an estimate of net proceeds over a fifteen-year period, the proposed consideration or payment to the Department of Defense, and the estimated fair market value of the property. _A cost estimate and justification for infrastructure and other investments needed for the development of the EDC parcel. _Local investment and proposed financing strategies for the development. 5. A statement describing why other authorities_such as negotiated sale and public benefit transfers for education, parks, public health, aviation, historic monuments, prisons, and wildlife conservation_cannot be used to accomplish the economic development and job creation goals. 6. If a transfer is requested for less than the estimated fair market value_with or without initial payment at the time of transfer_then a statement should be provided justifying a discount. The statement should include the amount and form of the proposed consideration, a payment schedule, the general terms and conditions for the conveyance, and projected date of conveyance. 7. A statement of the LRA's legal authority to acquire and dispose of the property. Additional information may be requested by the Military Departments to allow for a better evaluation of the application. LRAs are encouraged to use site information available from the Military Departments, including maintenance and caretaking expenses. •What criteria will be used to make a determination on the application?
