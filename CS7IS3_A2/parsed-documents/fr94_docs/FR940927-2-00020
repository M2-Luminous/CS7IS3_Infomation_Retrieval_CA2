FR940927-2-00020 FR940927-2-00016 [Docket No. 94&hyph;19] L.B.L. Enterprises, Inc. v. Con-Freight Marine Line, Inc.; Notice of Filing of Complaint and Assignment Notice is given that a complaint filed by L.B.L. Enterprises, Inc. (``Complainant'') against Con-Freight Marine Line, Inc. (``Respondent'') was served September 21, 1994. Complainant alleges that Respondent is a non vessel operating common carrier that violated section 10(d)(1) of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. ยง1709(d)(1). Complainant states that Respondent prepared a bill of lading incorrectly showing the Port of Discharge to be St. Petersburg, Russia on two shipments to Riga, Latvia, corrected the port of discharge while the two shipments were in transit without correcting the delivery contact agent which Complainant later found handled shipments only to Russia, refused to reimburse Complainant for costs of a Latvian driver to transport the shipments from St. Petersburg to Riga after promising to do so, and caused both shipments to arrive late. Further, Complainant alleges respondent refused to return a security deposit that was required for release of the second shipment in St. Petersburg, after promising to do so. This proceeding has been assigned to the Office of Administrative Law Judges. Hearing in this matter, if any is held, shall commence within the time limitations prescribed in 46 CFR 502.61, and only after consideration has been given by the parties and the presiding officer to the use of alternative forms of dispute resolution. The hearing shall include oral testimony and cross-examination in the discretion of the presiding officer only upon proper showing that there are genuine issues of material fact that cannot be resolved on the basis of sworn statements, affidavits, depositions, or other documents or that the nature of the matter in issue is such that an oral hearing and cross-examination are necessary for the development of an adequate record. Pursuant to the further terms of 46 CFR 502.61, the initial decision of the presiding officer in this proceeding shall be issued by September 21, 1995, and the final decision of the Commission shall be issued by January 19, 1996.
