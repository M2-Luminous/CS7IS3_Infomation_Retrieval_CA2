Some 150 Chinese and American securities experts, accountants and lawyers attended the one-day seminar, which was jointly sponsored by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Bank of New York of the United States. Fu Fengxiang, vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said at the seminar that China's securities market has experienced fast development since the country started reform and opening 15 years ago. He said that a good environment for securities business in China has taken shape. Fu told the participants that China adopted nearly 20 laws and regulations concerning securities last year. And it is going to promulgate a securities law in the near future to provide better legal protection for the management of securities. He noted that Sino-foreign cooperation in the economic field has expanded from joint ventures to capital investment. China recently issued depository receipts in the United States which have shown positive results, Fu said. Fu expressed his belief that the seminar will effectively encourage Chinese enterprises and their securities to enter the world market, especially the U.S. capital market. Joseph M. Velli, executive vice-president of the Bank of New York, briefed the participants on the U.S. capital market, saying that according to an estimation of his bank, China will become the most important new depository receipts-issuing country. He added that many international companies and individual buyers are "very interested" in China's stocks issued in the United States. J. Carter Beese, commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Edmund Lukas, vice-president of the New York Stock Exchange, and Thomas D. Sanford, vice-president of the Bank of New York, answered questions raised by participants.
