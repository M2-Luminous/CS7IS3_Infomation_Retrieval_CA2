Addressing a meeting with journalists which was held at the government building on the Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment on Friday [4 February], Soskovets focused on the Russo-Georgian package of trade and economic agreements. Soskovets is deeply convinced that both countries seek to find a common approach to the development of industrial infrastructure. "Georgian colleagues displayed a particular interest in Russian enterprises of the fuel-and-energy sector," Soskovets said. He pointed out that a number of Russian joint stock societies expressed the readiness to take part in the modernisation of oil processing complexes on the territory of Georgia. However, Soskovets emphasised that "our relations should develop on the basis of parity and mutual advantage". Soskovets did not rule out a possibility of granting a credit to Georgia worth 20 billion roubles in the near future. He pointed out that the Russian side seeks to connect these funds with the so-called tied credit. Speaking about the economic situation in Russia, Soskovets, who is in charge of issues of the fuel and energy sector, the military-industrial complex and industry in general, said that the state budget remains one of the most pressing problems today. He pointed out that at present, the Russian Government, on the one hand, has been holding consultations with ministries and state committees on the development of the coordinated system of mutual payments between enterprises, and on the other hand, seeks to conduct a tough policy of allocating credits to different branches of the economy.
