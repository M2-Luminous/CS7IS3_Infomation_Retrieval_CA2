As former President Carter was about to leave for Pyongyang, North Korea announced on 13 June its secession from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The United States is struggling to prevent North Korea's nuclear arms development project because it thinks that, if North Korea is allowed "to have its way," nuclear states will emerge one after another, nuclear weapons will proliferate in the world, the system of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and IAEA will collapse, and North Korea's nuclear project will become a serious threat to world peace. In addition to the United States, Russia, Britain, and France, which own nuclear weapons, South Africa disclosed its temporary ownership of nuclear weapons. Also, there is a strong suspicion that such countries as India, Pakistan, Israel, Iran, and Libya either own already or are currently developing nuclear arms. We still remember the news report on the IAEA's nuclear inspections of Iraq. We cannot completely rule out the possibility that North Korea's "nuclear" issue may become an incentive to the ROK and other Southeast Asian nations to move toward becoming nuclear nations. There is a deep-rooted concern in the United States in particular, that Japan, which is well capable of developing nuclear weapons, will acquire nuclear weapons in the future. Japan has been stressing its peace Constitution and three nonnuclear principles. However, U.S. Congressman John Kasich said: "Sometimes, politicians change their fundamental demands. It is impossible to predict how politicians will act when they feel that their countrymen are exposed to a danger." North Korea's nuclear arms development plan is directly linked to a denial of the diplomacy of the Clinton administration, which calls for "post-Cold War changes." The U.S. Government analyzes that North Korea already has one or two "nuclear weapons," which are either completed or still under construction. The United States also predicts that North Korea will be able to extract enough plutonium to make four or five bombs from spent fuel rods, which were recently removed from a reactor, and that a new reactor, which will be constructed as early as next year, will produce enough plutonium to produce from 10 to 12 bombs annually. The United States just cannot leave the North Korean plan to take its own course. The U.S. Government has been patient and trying to settle the issue through dialogue with North Korea because tension will build up on the Korean peninsula and even a military collision cannot be avoided should hard-line measures be taken. If that happens, the U.S. forces in the ROK will be the first to suffer major casualties. Also, there is a fear of radiation pollution if North Korean nuclear facilities are destroyed. The Congress and the public are keeping a strict watch on the Clinton administration. At a meeting of the House Foreign Affairs Committee's subcommittee on Asia-Pacific affairs, Chairman Gary Ackerman addressed severe questions to the State Department. He said: "It was (the diplomatic policy of the past) that if somebody told you at gun point to "give me your wallet," you would say "no unless you show me if the gun is loaded." Even if you demand North Korea, before sitting at a negotiation table, to give up all cards it has, I do not think it will listen." The Cable News Network's recent survey over the telephone shows that 80 percent of the American people, or an overwhelming majority, said yes to the question of whether "the United States should impose economic sanctions against North Korea." Only 13 percent of the respondents were against it and 7 percent said they did not know. Moreover, in response to a question on whether if "military action should be taken to destroy North Korea's nuclear facilities," 46 percent of the respondents said yes and 40 percent said no. However, China, which is supplying oil and food to North Korea, still has not said that it will cooperate with the United Nations in imposing sanctions against North Korea. Although Japan stresses officially that it will act in harmony with the United Nations, it is not actively supporting the idea of banning remittances to North Korea. The Clinton administration's irritation and confusion continue.
