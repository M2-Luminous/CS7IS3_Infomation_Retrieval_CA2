Hebron Council, by Nadav Ha'etzni; date and place not given] [Excerpts] In recent weeks Ron Shachner, the head of the Mt. Hebron Council, has become conspicuous because of two apparently contradictory statements. On the one hand, he publicly condemned the attacks on innocent Arabs in the context of "revenge activities" by the settlers. One the other hand, his name and military rank--lieutenant colonel (res.)--appeared among the 47 signatories of the first petition that defined the settlement evacuation order as clearly illegal. As deputy commander of a reserve infantry brigade, doing half of a job in the army since he is not mobilized, Shachner has been and will always be close to the establishment. It was difficult to draw provocative statements out of him that would contribute much to a journalist's stories. But in light of recent developments, Shachner has also changed his tune. Speaking to him in his office, what is particulary demonstrated is the sense of an internal rending within the public and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. In the course of the interview, he was required to summarize details because of the group of orders close to his brigade. Simultaneously he described scenarios capable of leading in the near term to a confrontation between the deputy brigade commander and those of his soldiers who listen to orders of the Rabin government. "There is a terrible dilemma here," Shachner opens up. "I am a citizen and a soldier in the IDF and for me Israel is a sacred value. But I see before my eyes the Zionist enterprise is tottering, the state is falling from its values and everything sacred. In addition, the government is leading us toward a security disaster not taking recommendations from the IDF and about to abandon the residents of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza to the Palestinian police. We have excellent relations with the army, but the government is passing over the red lines and is liable to place me and my friends in the army on both sides of the barricade." "What we all fear most is civil war. But there are things, from my viewpoint, which go beyond the red line. For example, the evacuation of settlements. I have no doubt that the government is planning this evacuation and I, as a commander in the IDF, previously determined that this is an illegal and unethical order. The evacuation of the camps puts me in a quandry because I think a soldier must do all he can not to participate, for example, in the evacuation of camps in Gaza and Jericho." As a member of the Yesha council administration and chairman of its security committee, Shachner is in charge of planning all their future activities, which will be published this week. For example, the establishment of the "Hashomer" organization to guard the settlements and preparations for the "multiplier operation," by which the settlements are supposed to take control of adjoining state lands. A heavy odor of confrontation and building an alternative to the IDF arose from these plans. Ron Shachner sought to lessen the sting of his words: "The goal of the "multiplier operation" is to show concern that state lands will be preserved for the settlements and on this issue we are stubborn. We will go outside the fences and control the land that was planned for the settlements and is important for their defense. [Shachner] Regarding "Hashomer," the original idea was to join the population from throughout the country that would come and assist Yesha. Beyond this, such things as patrols on the roads likewise have still not been decided. It depends on what actually develops in the area. We are continuing to the the IDF as responsible. We also know that the demand that the IDF transfer security is probable. But it is no secret that those conducting the negotiations are insistent on the IDF establishing minimal terms." [Ha'etzni] For example? [Shachner] The IDF must ensure a security belt flanking the axes and to retain a minimal capability of pursuing attackers and frustrating their attacks in the area. It is known that those conducting the negotiations have already caved in on this issue. We are very concerned. There are severe signs that the government will not accept security recommendations, is not bringing in new senior officers, and is about to create a situation of abandonment. [Ha'etzni] On what are you relying? [Shachner] For example, the subject of weapons and control over them. We asked senior officer in private conversations how they would control 15,000 weapons that are about to be distributed to the Palestinians. We did not receive an answer, only a very grave expression. They told us in essence that they don't know. Today, there is state control over all weapons. In a short time they will deliver huge quantities of rifles without any ability to follow their being stolen or delivered to hostile elements. [Ha'etzni] However, we're not hearing expressions like these from the military leaders, just the opposite. [Shachner] I am receiving from senior military elements a feeling of confusion, concern, and dissatisfaction. They are not kept up-to-date and do not know what will happen tomorrow. I'll give you an example. We sat in a small forum made up of four members with the chief of staff. We asked him, for example, if after autonomy is established in Qalqiliyah, he receives information about a group of terrorists setting up a Katyusha opposite Kfar Sava and getting ready to fire, will the IDF go into Qalqiliyah to prevent this? I didn't get an answer. If there were one or two generals alive today placing their rank on the table and saying: We cannot ourselves accept the responsibility, on these terms, for what would destabilize the state system. To my sorrow, this still has not happened, but I think that this will indeed happen soon. [passage omitted] [Shachner] If the Government of Israel doesn't understand what is about to happen vis-a-vis the Palestinian police, it doesn't understand anything. It is clear that there will be an explosion. I won't open fire just like that, but I won't listen to a Palestinian policeman. If he forceably detains me, I will oppose him with force, and if he draws his weapon, I'll draw mine. How can one nurture the blindness given what is happening? What other proof does the government need? Look, the Fatah hawks have already said they are renewing their attacks; Faysal al-Husayni talks about returning to the rifle; the rebel commander in Lebanon announced that he has infiltrated his men into the Palestine police force. And one of their penitents (as much as he was able) in Gaza fired at soldiers. So what do they expect us to do? We live here and we will continue to live here and defend ourselves. [Ha'etzni] Are there others who are hoarding weapons such as has been ascribed to Rabbi Toledano? [Shachner] I think it's forbidden to break the law. We have enough legal weapons and today we have no need to hoard. However, dealing with the Palestinian police force will be different. What is particularly bothersome are the signals from our government. The police have already confiscated weapons from the residents without justification. Shahal is also trying to set up a police force here whose primary purpose is to pursue us. Similarly, a grave situation is being created as I described. In these circumstances such as these, the acquisition of personal weapons for self-defense is legitimate. [Ha'etzni] Where does all this lead? [Shachner] Look, I condemned and am condemning attacks on innocent Arabs. We are not predators like they are and we have no need to act like that. But I warn the Israeli Government: they caused this situation. "The Committee for Road Security" does not exist. The government created this. The outburst that followed the murder of Mizrahi is an uprising that springs from a feeling of abandonment. If the government doesn't understand this and continues on its current path, this phenomenon will grow worse and lead to anarchy. In the face of Palestinian police force, the psychological barriers that we have today will disappear.
