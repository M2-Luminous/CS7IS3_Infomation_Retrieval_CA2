"The government is extremely concerned about the situation," she told SAPA at the National Party federal congress in Kempton Park. She said there had been reports of union members urinating on patients, emptying dustbins in hospitals, attacks on administrative staff and the damaging of staff cars. "This is totally unacceptable and the public should take notice that the union has lost control of its members. The African National Congress says striking is an essential weapon for negotiation. It says hospitals cannot be categorised as emergency services and that it wants to protect patients". She said it was a fact neither ANC election candidate and NEHAWU Secretary-General Philip Dexter, nor union members cared about the welfare of the patients.
