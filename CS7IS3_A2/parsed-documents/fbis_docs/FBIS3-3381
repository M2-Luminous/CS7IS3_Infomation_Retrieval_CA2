The university was originally named the Central Institute of Nationalities. Last November, the State Education Commission approved a name-change to the Central University of Nationalities. Jiang Zemin, Chinese president and general secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, inscribed the nameplate for the university. At the ceremony, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing unveiled the nameplate. He said that the development of educational services for minority nationalities is important to the revitalization of minority nationalities and the ethnic people's autonomous regions and prefectures. He said that the central university has played a very important role in cultivation of high- and mid-level officials and technical know-how in minority nationalities inhabited areas. He urged the university to make a new start and turn itself into a university with its unique characteristics so as to contribute to higher education among minority nationalities. Set up in Beijing in 1950, the university now has over 20 departments and 30 research institutes with more than 100 disciplines. By the end of last year, more than 30,000 had graduated from the university. Among those who attended the ceremony were Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Cheng Siyuan, Buhe and Tomur Dawamat, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and State Councillor and Minister in Change of State Nationalities Affairs Commission Ismail Amat.
