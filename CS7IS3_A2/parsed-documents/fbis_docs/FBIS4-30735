If a country is small and, what is more, one-third of its nation [allamalkoto nemzetisegenek] lives beyond its borders, it must conduct a particularly active and sensitive foreign policy. Let us now see what the representatives of the parliamentary parties expect from the new government. Here are some recordings: [Szekeres] I think the new government--provided that it is formed by the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party]--will have three simultaneous foreign policy tasks. First, to speed up Hungary's participation in European integration. Second, to settle our relations with neighboring countries. Third, and this is an issue that ranks equal to the first two, to represent the interests of the Hungarian minority living beyond the country's borders, including support for their efforts to achieve various types of autonomy. I think that these three foreign policy goals are interdependent. In other words, neither can succeed without the other. I think this presupposes on the part of the new government a very serious and very firm and proactive foreign policy. [Correspondent] What does the Balladur conference that took place earlier this week indicate? [Szekeres] [passage omitted] It has become clear that in East Central Europe and in the Baltics, where such problems create serious tensions between countries and within countries, and unsolved situations, some kind of coordination process has started now. We have no illusions. Such a process will be very long and will mean very complicated negotiations, but all opportunities must be exploited to permit Hungary and the Hungarian nation that lives inside and outside the borders to be able to digest at last the trauma of the Trianon Treaty, to find at last the modus vivendi in which the Hungarian nation, inside and outside the Hungarian border, can live its Hungarianness to the full and be able to find the balance that must necessarily come about between the majority nations and the Hungarian minority of the other countries. [Correspondent] How will the MSZP address the Hungarian community [magyarsag]? [Szekeres] In accordance with European norms, the new prime minister of the Hungarian Government will be the prime minister of 10.5 million Hungarians. However, at the same time, he will be a representative, in some form, of the other 3.5 million Hungarians living outside the borders. I would very much dislike it if the past four years repeated themselves and the Hungarian organizations beyond the borders were used as a backdrop. I would very much dislike it if the interests of Hungarians became a party political question, for this affects the whole of the nation. Therefore, every element of the issue, that is people acting in cultural life, in government or in the economy, have a role in this. We would like to coordinate and integrate this work. [Correspondent] Will there be a need in the future for the office dealing with the matters of the Hungarians beyond the borders? [Szekeres] We have not been working on concrete government drafts like this yet. However, I think that the cultivation of links -- cultural cooperation and economic links between the mother country and the minority Hungarians -- have to be integrated by all means. An agreement has to be reached about the structural forms of this. In my view, it is not the priority but rather the quality of this task that is important. [Correspondent] Our viewers worry about the future of Duna Television. [Szekeres] No decision has been made yet about television issues, naturally, but I think there is a need for a broadcast that can reach the Hungarians beyond the borders and if possible, the Hungarians spread across Europe. As to the form of editing and method of operation involved, this has to be settled with the profession.
