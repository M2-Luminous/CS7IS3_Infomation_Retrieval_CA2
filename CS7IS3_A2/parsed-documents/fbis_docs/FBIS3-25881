Again yesterday, they repeatedly invoked his name, this time as a moral warning for their renewed assertion that they are the sole masters of a single country -- greater China. On 27 January 1946, the father of the French Fifth Republic [de Gaulle] repudiated Chiang Kai-Chek's China in favor of Mao Zedong's. Thirty years after this mutual recognition, the two states have been through a few "hurdles" before reaching "the age of maturity," said Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on welcoming the delegation sent by Edouard Balladur to celebrate this 30th anniversary. This, he noted, was a "highly symbolic" delegation, being led by Alain Peyrefitte, "an old friend of China's, a member of General de Gaulle's government, a fervent champion, and an important witness" of Franco-Chinese relations, as well as Admiral Philippe de Gaulle and Claude Chayet, the first French ambassador in Beijing. The recognition of "Asia's oldest nation-state" by "the Western world's oldest nation-state," said Alain Peyrefitte on unveiling a plaque at the French Embassy, meant that "the state ruled by the Beijing government was the one which embodied the Chinese nation." Courteously reserved on the "meandering" history of relations between Paris and Beijing -- a near-divorce when France condemned the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, almost consummated after the sale of 60 Mirage fighter aircraft to Taiwan -- the chinese minister chose to insist instead on political grandeur and trade relations, those very relations which French firms were denied by a vengeful Beijing two years ago. `Vast Opportunities' "As influential world powers," said Qian Qichen, China and France bear a special responsibility for maintaining peace" and they must "intensify their consultations." As for manufacturers, economic reform offers them "vast business opportunities: We are hoping that more of them will invest [in the Chinese economy]." At a dinner offered by China's foreign minister, Alain Peyrefitte recounted with equal subtlety the successive steps toward "restored trust": the history, the contracts, and human rights. The 1964 "act" "implied neither approval nor disapproval" of the Communist regime, but common interest required such an attempt at "undermining the bipolar world that had come out of Yalta." According to Mr. Peyrefitte, the French will contribute "all the more willingly" to China's economic growth if "they feel they are contributing to increased dignity and freedom for the Chinese people." While unwilling to "impinge on a sovereign state's internal affairs," he thinks that "one must understand" that the country of the 1789 Revolution and the Declaration of Human Rights "cannot be insensitive to matters relating to the respect of individual and group freedoms." However, the "clouds" in the Franco-Chinese relationship are supposed to have vanished on the release of the 12 January communique, in which the French Government was undertaking not to sell any more weapons to Taiwan.
