This emerged during yesterday's talks between experts under the Joint Liaison Group [JLG]. The problems follow Britain's refusal to include a specific undertaking in the agreement stating that $23 billion of borrowing for the project would be treated as corporate debt for which the post-1997 government would have no liability. Britain refused to agree that the JLG airport committee monitor the administration and expenditure of the future airport authority -- a compromise offered by China after its earlier proposal for an independent cost-control body to be set up for this purpose. Britain said such an idea would be against the spirit of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which does not contain such a provision. British negotiators proposed that the government provide more information to the airport committee, instead of giving the monitoring powers to the committee. These problems emerged after experts from both sides began to draft the "basic agreement" after last Friday's airport committee meeting. Both sides have agreed "in principle" to the government's latest financing proposals, which would allow the injection of government equity of $60.3bn and $23bn corporate borrowing by the future airport authority and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation [MTRC]. It is believed Britain had previously assured China that only the airport authority and the MTRC would be responsible for the repayment of debt. Britain has agreed that the basic agreement should be specific about a timetable indicating when the borrowing should be repaid by the two corporations. Britain informed China earlier this week that it preferred not to be specific in the basic agreement about who should be responsible for the borrowing, leaving what China views as a grey area in the agreement. China promptly rejected this. Under the basic agreement, there are two appendices about financial support for the airport authority and the MTRC which have been approved by China. The amount of debt and the Special Administrative Region's responsibility for any borrowing has been China's main concern. Hugh Davies, the head of the British negotiating team, said yesterday: "The Chinese take the view that the MOU's references to debt include debt entered into by the two corporations. That is not our view."
