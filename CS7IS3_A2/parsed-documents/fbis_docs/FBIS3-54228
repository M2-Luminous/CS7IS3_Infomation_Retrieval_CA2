His entrance, as well as his remarks, was met with mixed reactions: applause along with boos. We are tomorrow's soldiers, the students said, asking the prime minister how al-Asad's Sunday [16 January] news conference in Geneva affected his view of the essence of peace with Syria. The prime minister replied that President al-Asad's remarks did not meet his expectations. I was disappointed with the fact that President Clinton alone replied to the question on the nature of peace, Rabin said, but we will pursue the negotiations with Syria because we want to be able to look your parents straight in the eye. Under the Labor party platform, we are committed to act toward peace. To the students' surprise, he dissociated himself from his pre-election statement that the Golan is an inseparable part of the State of Israel: [Begin Rabin recording] You say that before the elections, I promised that the Golan Heights is an inseparable part of Israel. Show me where it was that I promised this before the elections! What did I say? [applause and boos] Never mind, never mind. [end recording] He added: We have discussed territorial compromise, and we will act to achieve it. What are the red lines that warrant Israel's backing out of its agreement with the PLO? In his reply, Rabin warned of the implications of such a step: [Begin Rabin recording] When a legally elected government signs an agreement but does not abide by it, you should know that the next day, Arab countries would see it as a license not to abide by their agreements with us. [applause] Nothing is more serious than that. [end recording] The young people wanted to know how the prime minister will react to soldiers' disobeying orders to evacuate settlers in the territories. Rabin replied that disobedience motivated by political considerations would be the end of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. He chose to conclude with praise for the unique dedication and loyalty of Israeli youths, who go through compulsory army service duty as if they were volunteering.
