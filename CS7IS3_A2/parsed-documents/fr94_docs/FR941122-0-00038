FR941122-0-00038 FR941122-0-00010 Several commenters made specific recommendations concerning the method that EPA should use to apply the unit-specific limitations under Wisconsin's acid rain law. Under the Wisconsin law, each major utility that generates electricity in the State must achieve an annual average sulfur dioxide emissions rate that does not exceed 1.2 lbs per mmBtu starting in 1995 from all fossil fuel-fired boilers under the utility's ownership or control. A Wisconsin utility that meets certain requirements may trade emissions with another Wisconsin utility. One utility accepts_and adds to its annual emissions_emissions from another utility, which subtracts those emissions from its annual emissions and thereby reduces its annual average emissions rate in order to meet the utility-wide limit. Some commenters suggested that, in initially allocating allowances to substitution units in Wisconsin, EPA consider only those Federal and State limitations that are expressed as unit-specific limitations and not the utility-wide limits under Wisconsin's acid rain law. These commenters supported an end-of-year review in which each Wisconsin utility will have to demonstrate whether, if the allowances allocated to its substitution units in Wisconsin are treated as emissions by those units, the utility will still be in compliance for that year with 1.2 lbs per mmBtu limit. In this demonstration, the utility will sum the actual annual emissions of each boiler owned or controlled by the utility, except in the case of a substitution unit where the allocated allowances will be used. Where emissions were traded for the year, traded emissions will be subtracted by one utility from, and added by another utility to, the sum of emissions and allowances. The total will be divided by the sum of the annual mmBtu utilization of all the boilers involved. To the extent that the result exceeds 1.2 lbs per mmBtu, the utility will be required to surrender, and EPA will deduct, allowances allocated to the substitution units for that year. No commenters supported imposing limits on the ability to transfer the substitution unit's allowances prior to the end-of-year review. However, one commenter opposed the use of any end-of-year review to apply the Wisconsin utility-wide emissions limit. The Agency is not deciding in the instant rulemaking what particular procedure will be used for applying non-specific emissions limitations and whether to adopt an approach involving end-of-year review. However, such review may be the best way to take account of the flexibility that the Wisconsin acid rain law and other State provisions provide to individual units in meeting State emissions limitations. The final revised rule, therefore, allows EPA to decide on a case-by-case basis, e.g., in individual permit proceedings on proposed substitution units, whether to require end-of-year review to apply non-unit-specific emissions limitations. The final revised rule also authorizes the Agency to require allowance surrender, and make allowance deductions, by the allowance transfer deadline as a result of such review. 9 9 Contrary to one commenter's claim, the fact that section 402(3) of the Act defines ``allowance'' as ``an authorization *␣*␣* to emit *␣*␣* one ton of sulfur dioxide'' in no way bars the imposition of a requirement, consistent with other sections of the Act, to surrender allowances. 42 U.S.C. 7651a(3). Section 403(f) of the Act states that an allowance allocated under title IV is ``a limited authorization to emit sulfur dioxide in accordance with the provisions of this title.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651b(f). The Agency maintains that it is unnecessary to impose, pending any end-of-year review, limitations on the ability to transfer a substitution unit's allowances. The risk that a substitution unit will not have allowances in its Allowance Tracking System account to cover the deduction is small. As of the allowance transfer deadline, the unit's account must contain, in any event, sufficient allowances to cover its emissions for the prior year. The deduction of allowances resulting from the substitution unit's end-of-year review must be made before the Agency determines whether the unit's emissions exceeded its available allowances. Consequently, the failure of the substitution unit to have sufficient allowances to cover any deduction resulting from the end-of-year review will constitute a violation of §72.41 (and so the Clean Air Act itself) and will result in excess emissions and trigger excess emissions penalties. Not only are limitations on transferability unnecesssary, but also they would reduce the compliance flexibility that Congress intended to provide through substitution plans. The final rule therefore does not impose any limits of transferability, pending any end-of-year review. In sum, the Agency concludes that a substitution unit should be allocated allowances based on the lesser of four emissions rates for the unit: 1985 actual SO 2 emissions rate; 1985 allowable SO 2 emissions rate; the greater of 1989 or 1990 actual SO 2 emissions rate, or the most stringent Federal or State allowable SO 2 emissions rate applicable in 1995&hyph;99 as of November 15, 1990. The first two emissions rates are set forth in section 404(b)(2) of the Act. The latter rates are added in order to ensure, in accordance with section 404(b)(5), that a substitution plan will result in at least the same amount of reductions that would have occurred without the plan. This approach requires the submission to EPA of data on the 1989 and 1990 emissions rates and the emissions limitations for 1995&hyph;99. For the reasons set forth in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60956), the Agency maintains that section 404(b) provides adequate authority to require submission of this data and to use the data to calculate the allowance allocation under the plan.
