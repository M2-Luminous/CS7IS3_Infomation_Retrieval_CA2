The first round of expert talks on minorities took place in Strasbourg on January 24-28. In accordance with the autumn 1993 CE summit in Vienna, these talks are supposed to produce by the end of this year a series of international documents codifying minority rights. "The most active delegation was the Hungarian, whose position could be described as extreme," Rozgonova said, adding that Slovakia had pointed out it preferred to stress individual rights for members of minorities, since protecting individual rights represented the greatest guarantee of a democracy's functioning.
