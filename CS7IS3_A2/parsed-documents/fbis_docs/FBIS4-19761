FBIS4-19761 "drweu078_o_94005" FBIS-WEU-94-078 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 CYPRUS New Unified Defense Area Rearrangement Outlined New Unified Defense Area Rearrangement Outlined NC2204090094 Nicosia I MAKHI in Greek 19 Apr 94 pp 1, 7 NC2204090094 Nicosia I MAKHI Greek BFN ["Special dispatch" from Athens--ellipses as published] [Excerpts] Crete will play an important role in the rearrangement of the armed forces of Greece and Cyprus. Consequently, Crete is the focus of studies and plans by the Greek National Defense General Staff and the National Guard General Staff regarding the doctrine of a unified defense space of the two countries. Revelations by President Glavkos Kliridhis to an expatriate gathering in London concerning the unified defense area have raised questions in foreign military circles. I MAKHI today reveals the implementation of Cyprus' "Defense Shield" (that is, what is allowed...to be revealed), as well as a statement by a high-ranking military source regarding the role of the Greek and Cypriot armed forces in the unified defense area. The decision by the Athens and Nicosia Governments that includes Cyprus in Greece's unified defense area is to begin implementation as soon as possible and to the extent dictated by Cyprus' special defense needs. As military circles in the [Greek] Pentagon revealed to I MAKHI, the decisions made during President Kliridhis' visit to Athens and during Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis' visit to Nicosia are promoted methodically and quickly. [passage omitted] Characteristically, a top-ranking military source told I MAKHI: "Effectively, a defense umbrella will cover Cyprus. The success of the defense doctrine will be based on unified Hellenism, something that means--and it is very clear to the Greek National Defense Ministry--that an offensive action by the Turks provides the legal base for our country (Greece) to attack Turkey from any point, not just from the front that Turkey will open...." Greece will assume Cyprus' air cover by making the most modern equipment available to the Greek Air Force. Crete, which is at the center of the new defense doctrine's plans, will play a significant role in the air coverage. Crete is considered very important for Cyprus (its air cover), because of its position but mainly because Cyprus is impregnable and can defend itself against any offensive action against it. Greece will cover Cyprus' sea areas with the most modern naval ships. Cyprus is determined to contribute decisively to the implementation of the plan for a common defense space with Greece. More important is that "the Cypriot Government made the commitment to participate financially in the armament program." Cyprus will prepare refueling bases for the Greek military planes as well as a naval base at a specific area that has been chosen and is considered ideal for this purpose. [passage omitted] These "war preparations" are not offensive. They are defensive and this has been made clear in every direction, especially to NATO, which is concerned.... In this way, the fronts the Turkish expansionist army must face will increase. The possibilities of a Turkish offensive decrease and at the same time Turkey is under pressure to revise its intransigence on both the Aegean and Cyprus. The goal of every study and plan regarding the unified defense space is to establish Hellenism firmly and increase the negotiating capability of Greece and Cyprus.
