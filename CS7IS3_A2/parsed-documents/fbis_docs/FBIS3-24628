About 50 posts of laser medicine have appeared in Russia over the past three years. In order to put this branch of public health (it is literally occupied by ``healers'' with dubious reputation) under control and ensure the professional training of physicians the Russian Federation's Ministry of Public Health has set up an All-Russia State Research Center with a training base on the basis of the Laser Medicine Research Institute. For bloodless dissection of muscular tissue and the resection of the internal organs (kidneys, gallbladder) the medical workers of the State Centre use the Raduga-1 contact aluminium laser produced by conversion at the Moscow Polyus Scientific-Production Association. The other development project of the defence industry--the Raduga-1F laser produced by the Istok Scientific-Production Association, near Moscow, is used for endocoagulation. Foreign businessmen are greatly interested in the work of the State Centre. In July a contract was signed on the delivery of laser equipment to India, on training Indian doctors in Moscow and on setting up a branch of the Centre in Dharwar. Negotiations are under way with the representatives of the Ministry of Public Health of the Philippines, private clinics from Paris and Madrid and the Turkish Asia Ltd, company.
