We regard this supposition as unfortunate and groundless, the same way as we regard the shrill sound of the government's success propaganda coming from the other side. The fact is that the MNB [Hungarian National Bank] is successful in floating bonds in the international market place, and this fact--indicating confidence in our country--has not been changed even by the extraordinarily grave deterioration of our international balance of payments last year. (...) There is no basis for leaders of a party that prepares itself to play a role in governance, and to direct long-term processes, to make the above-quoted, oddly pessimistic statement."
