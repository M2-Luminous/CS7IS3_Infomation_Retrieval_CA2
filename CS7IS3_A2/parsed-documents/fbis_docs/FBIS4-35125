Science and Technology Minister Israel Vargas announced that the new budget proposal in Congress has raised the funds for his ministry by 6 percent. He considers this increase good, when compared with the 16 to 20 percent cuts in other areas. Brazil has again received sizable funds from the World Bank for the PADCT (Program in Support of Scientific and Technological Development). Those funds come from both the Brazilian Government and the World Bank; but in October 1992, because of the lack of local matching funds, the country received only 3.8 percent of the PADCT appropriation. "The faucet was turned off during the Collor government," remarks Vargas. Now, the percentage has returned to a more appropriate level, on the order of 70 percent, he claims. The government is also negotiating a loan that could amount to $300 million or even $400 million. Some of the funds from the privatizations will go to science as well. At the opening of the "International Seminar on Evaluation of and Proposals for Brazilian Scientific and Technological Development," at the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV), the minister pointed out that private business firms contribute only 15 percent of the costs of research and development in the country. As early as this year, Vargas expects to raise the spending on science and technology by over $700 million annually. Brazil's total spending on the sector stands at approximately $3 billion per year. The ministry's budget amounts to $800-$900 million. The background for the minister's statements consists of three studies on the status of science in the country, the purpose of which was to discuss proposals for the sector's development. Another point stressed by the minister was the improvement in relations with the U.S. Owing to the conflict over the patent law, the computer science policy, and the construction of the Brazilian rocket, which the rich countries fear may become a military missile, the U.S. threatened drastic cuts in the scientific cooperation with Brazil. The conflict has been resolved. Political scientist Simon Schwartzman, of the USP [University of Sao Paulo] and FGV, proposes the "associated laboratories" model, to provide a solid foundation for financing the leading research groups operating at present. Schwartzman points to the CNPq's (National Research Council) estimate that Brazil has nearly 52,000 researchers, but that only a quarter of them (between 12,000 and 13,000) have doctorates, and hence are qualified researchers. Another quarter of that total have only taken a course leading to a degree. Military Research Geraldo Lesbat Cavagnari Filho, a professor at Unicamp [Campinas State University] and colonel in the reserves, advocated the next federal government's continuation of the three main military research and development projects. The three major projects that he cited are the parallel nuclear program handled by the Navy, the goal of which is the construction of a nuclear submarine in the country; the Brazilian Complete Space Mission, including the installation of a satellite launching rocket by the Air Force; and the production of the AMX fighter-bomber by Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company]. According to Cavagnari, all three projects were "mistakes," because the country could have found other means for achieving technological development. However, he thinks that it would be worse to end them now, when they are beginning to bring results. According to the Unicamp professor, the dimensions of the military projects can be gauged by the total cost of the nuclear submarine project: $2.5 billion in 20 years. The launching of the submarine is planned for the year 2005. Another fact demonstrating the sector's importance to the society: nearly 90 percent of the researchers employed by the military are civilians, the cost of whose training has been defrayed largely by the Armed Forces. Another Unicamp researcher, Renato Dagnino, questions the supposed financial benefits accrued from military research, estimating that it consumes 20 percent of the country's total research and development budget. Dagnino notes that, in the U.S., military research carries an even greater weight (approximately 40 percent), but is more effective in terms of value of the product. Whereas, in the U.S., the military industry accounts for 4 percent of the GDP (gross domestic product), in Brazil, during 1987, that percentage was only 0.2 (a result 10 times worse in terms of value of the end product). [Box, p 1-12] Physics in a Critical Situation The picture of physics research in Brazil drawn yesterday at the International Seminar is dismal, as was to be expected. The physicists think that, to revive it, there must be a break in its umbilical link with the university. This viewpoint was upheld by Sergio Machado Rezende, aged 53, a full professor at the UFPE (Federal University of Pernambuco). According to Rezende, 84 percent of Brazilians with doctorates in physics are in universities, and 2 percent are in private business firms. In more industrialized countries, nearly a third are in industry. In the U.S., the proportion amounts to 50 percent. There are 1,350 holders of doctorates in physics in the country; and 33,000 in the U.S. According to Rezende, the only solution is more investment in the sector. Whereas industrialized countries apply $50 per capita annually, here the amount declines to $0.79.
