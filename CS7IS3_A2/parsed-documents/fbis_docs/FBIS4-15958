Energy Minister Algimantas Stasiukynas has told journalist Diana Medeliene about them. [Medeliene] What is your opinion on the memorandum of the Homeland Union concerning the delay in the construction of the oil terminal? [Stasiukynas] The accusations by former Prime Minister G. Vagnorius against the current government contained in the memorandum look rather strange. He himself had enough time and possibilities to resolve this problem. I think that state officials and the public were quite well informed about the process of choosing the site for the oil terminal and about the negotiations with Latvia on the construction of a terminal in Liepaja. However, information is usually acquired by those who want it. If the authors of the memorandum had showed some interest in the conclusions of foreign experts, they would have understood that most of the statements in this memorandum are incorrect. Concerning the value of the state enterprise "Nafta," I would like to say that the refinery is worth more than the total value of its equipment and other assets as it can generate profit. The sale price of analogous West European refineries with considerably more up-to-date equipment does not exceed $200-300 million, because there is a lack of demand. Therefore, statements that "Nafta" is a great asset that can save Lithuania demonstrate that some people are unaware of the current situation in the world oil market. Regarding the terminal in Liepaja, the debate on the possibility of its construction did not interfere with the process of the oil terminal construction in Lithuania. After it had become clear that a large oil terminal cannot be built in Liepaja, we restricted ourselves to the protocol of intentions which envisions that Lithuanian economic entities can participate in its construction on a commercial basis. The statement that Lithuania is depriving itself of finances for the construction of a foreign terminal is absolutely groundless. [Medeliene] Energy specialists are being reprimanded for high prices of energy resources. Society lacks sufficient information about the way tariffs and prices are set. Maybe, it is for this reason that each price hike is greeted with new attacks. [Stasiukynas] I would like to compare the conclusions of the Seimas commission investigating the situation in the energy market with those of experts. First of all, the trade in oil products. Members of the commission have claimed that oil products bought from the Mazeikiai refinery should be cheaper. These products are 15-20 percent more expensive than those bought on the market. Therefore, the production of the Mazeikiai enterprise is sold outside the country. The Mazeikiai thermal electric power station alone has bought petroleum residue from "Nafta" because the two enterprises are technologically connected. The energy system experienced losses due to that. Lithuania has the lowest prices for energy resources by comparison with other similarly developed countries. This means that the energy management is not so bad. It is maintained that the growth of energy prices is the cause of troubles in most industries and agriculture. However, electricity and heating prices have risen two-fold over the entire period of inflation, while those of food, consumer goods, and various services have increased from three to 10 times. Energy prices will undoubtedly rise in the future, but at a lower rate. Incidentally, the energy generated at the nuclear plant is cheaper, because the plant uses nuclear fuel cassettes previously bought at lower prices. We will have to pay much more for them now. In our country, fuel prices account for 86 percent of the total energy costs, while in the West they do not exceed 40 percent. I would like to stress, however, that the rise in energy prices must be strictly coordinated with that of living standards. The steep price rise recommended to us by foreign experts is unacceptable to Lithuania. Speaking about prices for supplying centralized heating, I would like to note that in Europe they are between $40 and $50 per one Gcal [gram calorie], that is, two or three times more expensive than in Lithuania. I regret that our ministry employees provided incorrect information about European prices. In the opinion of World Bank experts and specialists on energy prices, Lithuania's prices are extremely low, while credits will be extended to our country when these prices are economically reasonable. Thus, assessments are quite controversial. Therefore, the government has set up the Commission for Regulating Energy Prices on the initiative of the Energy Ministry, headed by the finance minister, which also includes representatives of all interested offices and organizations. Incidentally, the production of state energy concerns is cheaper than that of private companies. We also share the opinion that industrial enterprises should not pay more for energy than residential units. Last year, residents paid 15 times less (three times this year) than enterprises. They are unable to pay the total price. Therefore, we must preserve compensation for another two or three years. I would like to stress that the setting of energy tariffs is a state policy rather than an economic problem of energy enterprises. One takes into account energy prices in neighboring states when setting tariffs in one's own country. [Medeliene] The press and the press conferences in the Seimas addressed the privatization of energy facilities. There have been different opinions on this topic. How could you explain them? [Stasiukynas] The accusation that there are plans to privatize a small percentage of the assets at energy facilities sounds strange. Every economist should know what percentage of the stockholding at an enterprise accounts for. A very small portion of these assets should be privatized in the first stage. Later, enterprises should be turned into stock companies, issuing their stock, attracting capital for investment, and accumulating working capital. Such enterprises should further remain under state control. [passage omitted]
