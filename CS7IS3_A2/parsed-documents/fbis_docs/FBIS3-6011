"It is not that we yielded to U.S. pressure... but it came after private-level talks made headway," the top government spokesman told a news conference. But he also said, "Frankly, we are delighted at the result." Earlier Monday, a Japanese Government source criticized the U.S. Government for overly intervening on behalf of a specific company. The source said the way Washington helped Motorola Inc. to increase its market share in Japan was something Tokyo would never contemplate. The Motorola negotiations were a matter of private business, and the U.S. Government could not deny it was working for a specific company, he said. The source said he expects the U.S. may take a similar attitude in future trade negotiations. "As long as Japan has such a huge trade surplus, Japan cannot take a tough stance toward such a U.S. attitude," he said. Under the Japan-U.S. accord reached Saturday, Nippon Idou Tsusin Corp. [Japan Mobile Communications Corporation] (IDO) will launch a full-scale expansion of service in the Tokyo and Nagoya areas using the Motorola system. IDO will shift some service now geared to Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. to the Motorola-oriented service.
