He was speaking to journalists at a news conference after his talks with Yasir 'Arafat, chairman of the PLO Executive Committee and president of the Palestinian State. It goes without saying, the Russian foreign policy chief said, that we call for restraint from all sides in the conflict. Kozyrev spoke highly of the initiative by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, with whom he had a telephone conversation this morning. A. Juppe has proposed that Russia, the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations work out, once and for all, a united stand on the conflict in Bosnia. Andrey Kozyrev called this proposal "highly promising and timely." We have long been striving for this, he said, and we hope that under the present critical circumstances our American friends and partners will treat this initiative seriously. Ultimately, this is the minimum we have to achieve -- to have a united and well-considered political stand. This could form the basis for the formulation of demands to the warring sides, and, at the same time, for initiatives that would open up opportunities for them, specifically, the lifting of sanctions as the demands of the world community are met.
