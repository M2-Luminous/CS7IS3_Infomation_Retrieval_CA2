In the past few years, Tibet's literary and art workers have stressed the importance of the people's cultural life. Last year, despite a shortage of funds, Tibet built six county cultural halls, outlined the "Dandelion Plan," formed a regional cultural and art committee for young children, and actively conducted training for budding talents in literature and art. The autonomous region reformed the movie-screening system, consolidated movie-screening teams in rural and pastoral regions, and screened 100 films on patriotism in the entire region. After a year's work, Tibet made further progress in its concept of the reform of the cultural system. Last year, various professional art groups produced 98 scripts and held 435 performances which a total of 350,000 people attended.
