This opinion was expressed by Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Security Council, in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. He reported that the Bosnian question was discussed at a meeting of the Security Council which had heard a report from Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev as well as detailed information about the Russian president's initiative. Oleg Lobov considers that a top-level meeting of the leaders of the world's leading countries and UN and CSCE representatives, with the participation of the warring sides, could yield the most positive results. The Security Council secretary said that at the present time drafting work is being actively carried out on the concept of economic security. It is planned to examine the concept at a meeting of the council in November. Alongside military and social security, economic security is one of the most important areas of the council's activities. The aim of the economic security program, Oleg Lobov said, is to stabilize the situation in the economy and to seek ways out of the crisis. Meanwhile, even before the program is adopted, a number of questions are being urgently tackled. These are questions connected with privatization, providing the Russian populace with medicines, the ecological problem, and land fertility. In the opinion of the Security Council secretary these could be described as global problems.
