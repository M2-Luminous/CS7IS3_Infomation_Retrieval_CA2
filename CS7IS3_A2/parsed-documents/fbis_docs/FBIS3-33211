Another reason for this could be the intervention of "experts," who frequently visit our country for two or three days during which they attend dinners, receptions, cocktail parties, and then feel they have the authority to talk about the past, understand the present, and anticipate the future of the entire region. Despite all their efforts, they have accomplished very little. Panama is not what they imagined under the Torrijos, Flores, Paredes, or Noriega dictatorships. It is not what is conceived through the talent of one limited bureaucrat or another. There are certainly many limitations in our country: the burden of public debt is unbearable, the administration of justice is not perfect, the Legislative Assembly is far from being truly representative, the differences within the government coalition have made it difficult to effectively conduct public administration, and the political class is not precisely knowledgeable. Nevertheless, in Panama today, human rights are respected, the economy is developing, unemployment has decreased, and public security has improved. There is a democratic government system and significant progress has been made in the fight against drug trafficking, gunrunning, and our country is no longer a haven for guerrillas and all kinds of criminals. Please understand this!
