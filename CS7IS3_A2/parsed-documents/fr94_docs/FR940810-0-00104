FR940810-0-00104 FR940810-0-00021 In addition, unless the employer can demonstrate that it is not feasible, the roof level heating and ventilation air intake and discharge sources must be isolated, HEPA filtered, or extended beyond the regulated area, or mechanical systems must be shut down and vents sealed with 6 mil plastic. OSHA has taken into account concerns that isolating air intakes may cause heat build-up in the building (Ex. 7&hyph;7). As for all Class II work, respirators must be worn if material cannot be removed in an intact state, or if wet methods are not used. In addition, regulated areas must be established pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (e). These provisions are similar to the conditions proposed by OSHA which would have allowed an exemption from the proposed negative pressure enclosure requirement providing implementation of specific control methods which would have applied to all non-exempt removal jobs. In the proposal, the Agency stated that it did not believe that requiring use of negative pressure enclosures on roofs would result in more than a de minimis benefit to workers removing roofing or to other employees in their vicinity. That the safety hazards which might be imposed by their use on roofs would outweigh the benefits (55 FR at 29719). The Agency proposed that employers engaged in roofing operations take additional steps to reduce employee exposure to asbestos. These steps included use of dust-tight chutes to lower debris from the roof to the ground, or immediate bagging and lowering of debris rather than dumping it from a height. Wetting would also be required where feasible to reduce contamination. The Agency felt that these measures had been shown to be effective in reducing employee and bystander exposures during roofing operations. There was general support for the exemption of roofing operations from the NPE requirement (Ex. 7&hyph;1, 7&hyph;12, 7927, 7&hyph;36, 7&hyph;39, 7&hyph;43, 7&hyph;52, 7&hyph;95). BCTD acknowledged that negative-pressure enclosures are infeasible for most roofing operations. OSHA also believes that categorizing roofing removals as Class II work is well supported by the record. Some data show exceedances of the new PEL in roofing operations (see Ex. 9&hyph;34 QQ, cited by BCTD, Ex. 143 at 135). Other data show roofing removals, where proper work practices are followed, generate low exposure levels, e.g., data submitted by NCRA, collected by SRI shows many exposures were below the revised PEL, most jobs used wet methods (Ex. 9&hyph;31A). A health survey submitted by the BCTD showed asbestos related diseases and deaths among roofers in the period from 1976&hyph;1989 (Ex. 119 QQ). That study is evidence that proper protective practices are necessary to protect workers. However, diseases resulted from past exposures both removing and installing asbestos-containing roofing without protective requirements and do not necessarily predict worker health from lower exposures resulting primarily from removal work performed more protectively. In addition participants supported required work practices (see Ex. 7&hyph;120, 7&hyph;132, 7&hyph;36). BCTD preferred adoption by OSHA of the recommendations made by the labor representatives of ACCSH which are more rigorous than the work practices proposed by OSHA. The additional practices would include: establishing the entire roof as a regulated area; cutting or removing ACM using hand methods whenever possible; equipping all powered tools with a HEPA vacuum system or a misting device; HEPA vacuuming all loose dust left by the sawing operation; and, isolating all roof-level air intake and discharge sources, or shutting down all mechanical systems and sealing off all outside vents using two layers of 6 mil polyethylene (Ex. 34). As noted above, OSHA has adopted most of these additional work practices in the final regulations. OSHA is not requiring the entire roof to be designated as a regulated area: the portion to be removed may be a small part of the entire roof. The regulated area should encompass that portion of the roof where dust and debris from the removal is likely to accumulate. One issue concerning required controls is whether OSHA should prohibit power cutting on roofing materials containing asbestos. Information in the record is inconclusive on whether power cutting usually results in higher exposure levels than hand cutting. A representative of the National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA) testified that ``we're finding extremely low readings (on the power cutter); *␣*␣* it appears to us that the cutting of the material seals the edges because of the heat of the blade of the cutter, mixing with the asphalt'' (Tr. 2427). Other data were submitted to show that power cutting elevates asbestos fiber levels compared to hand cutting; however OSHA believes that some of these conclusions may overstate the results of limited experimentation. For example, one study was presented as suggesting that power cutting elevated fiber levels over hand cutting (Ex 1&hyph;357). OSHA regards this study as not definitive. The differences in fiber levels in the breathing zones of workers were only marginally statistically significant, and there was another variable in the study's protocol which may have effected the outcome. OSHA recognizes the bound nature of the asbestos in most roofing materials, however, it also understands the physical principles involved in cutting of these materials and that such actions release fibers. Because of this mixed record, OSHA concludes that no prohibition of power cutting is called for as long as the other specified precautions including misting are carefully followed. The standard allows power cutting, but also requires that sections of roofing material shall be cut into the largest pieces which can be feasibly handled for disposal pursuant to the standard. Requiring misting of power tools in all situations except where a competent person determines that misting may decrease safety is expected to help reduce exposure levels from power cutting. The general requirement that all asbestos work be performed wet, unless the employer can demonstrate lack of feasibility applies to roofing operations. A discussion of this provision is found above in the discussion on paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B). As noted there, ``flooding'' is not required; ``misting'' of cut areas is sufficient to control dust.
