To Romania, the proper handling of national minority issues is important because this is a key issue of European integration, the AFD's prime minister candidate Gabor Kuncze and the party's foreign affairs expert Istvan Szent-Ivanyi told journalists on Thursday. They also said problems forestalling smooth cooperation had come up at their talks with leading Romanian politicians. The AFD believes that efforts to improve bilateral relations should be linked together with the cause of the minorities. The Romanian negotiating party promised to open two border posts at Battonya and Mehkerek by the end of June. In accord with an earlier agreement between the two countries, Hungary has made all necessary arrangements for the new crossings, while Romania has done little so far. The delegation also held talks with representatives of Romania's Democratic Hungarian Union (RDHU), county leaders from Harghita and Covasna (which have substantial Hungarian populations), Calvinist Bishop Laszlo Tokes and Catholic Bishop Jozsef Tempfli. The AFD delegates stated that should they be elected to government in May, they would retain all forms of support granted to Romanian Hungarians today. The AFD agrees with the RDHU's position that Romania's efforts to achieve European integration are likely to necessitate the expansion of human and minority rights.
