We warmly congratulate the success of the conference. Over the past five years since the last conference, our country has experienced tremendous and profound changes in various areas -- it has seen political stability, economic development, national unity, and social progress. These world-renowned achievements are the result of the thorough implementation of the spirit of the 14th party congress and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, as well as the result of hard struggle by people throughout the country, including the broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese who have made efforts on various fronts, and the broad masses of Overseas Chinese who have given their support and concern. We sincerely thank them for the valuable contributions they have made to the prosperity and advancement of the Chinese nation. The party and government have always attached importance to returned Overseas Chinese work and have considered the broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Overseas Chinese, and Overseas Chinese as an important force for China's modernization. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out many times that the broad masses of Overseas Chinese hope to see a prosperous and developed China, and he viewed giving play to the active role of Overseas Chinese as an unique opportunity to greatly develop our country. The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese is a people's organization led by the CPC for unity with returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese of various circles; it is the bridge and link through which the party and government foster ties with returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Overseas Chinese, and Overseas Chinese. The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese has already officially become a component of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and has a larger and unique role to play in political consultation and democratic supervision. Our country is currently facing a very important historical period. The development of the situation is raising new and higher demands on the federation of returned Overseas Chinese at various levels, and these federations should, under the leadership of the party and government, continue to develop a patriotic spirit, do a good job in education on collectivism and socialism, unite with the broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese, and arouse their enthusiasm and eagerness to work diligently for the country's prosperity, struggle hard, build the home towns of Overseas Chinese, and build the motherland. The "PRC Law on Protecting the Rights and Interests of Returned Overseas Chinese and Relatives of Overseas Chinese," implemented in 1991, has embodied the government's concern for returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese and has enabled returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese to have a legal basis for the protection of their legitimate rights and interests; the federations of returned Overseas Chinese at various levels should help the government to do a good job in implementing the "PRC Law on Protecting the Rights and Interests of Returned Overseas Chinese and Relatives of Overseas Chinese," and should do a good job in liaison between the government and returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese. The federations of returned Overseas Chinese should go to the grass-roots levels and go deep into the realities of life in order to foster close ties with the broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese, listen to their opinions and reflect their opinions, care for their sufferings, and properly serve them, really becoming the "close friend" of the broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese. The conference this time has commended nearly 1,000 advanced units and individuals and 10 outstanding persons from the circles of returned Overseas Chinese. They are the outstanding elements among the broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese; we sincerely congratulate them, and we hope to see more outstanding elements emerging. One important task that the federations of returned Overseas Chinese at various levels must do well this time is liaison with Overseas Chinese. "Enable the returned Overseas Chinese to play their role as a bridge." They should help the relevant departments to vigorously develop economic, trade, scientific, technological, and cultural exchanges and cooperation with Overseas Chinese for the sake of reform, opening up, and modernization. On one hand, this can help Overseas Chinese to develop businesses and is conducive to the economic prosperity of the countries in which they are residing; on the other, this can promote the development of reform, opening up, and modernization in our country. In order to accomplish their important duties and meet the needs arising from the development of the situation, the federations of returned Overseas Chinese at various levels must vigorously strengthen their own reform and construction efforts. Perfecting organization, training and assigning cadres, improving work style, and straightening out the management system have already become urgent tasks. As far as the future is concerned, by the end of this century, our country will have initially built the socialist market economic system, will have realized the second-step development goal of reaching a comfortable living standard, and will have pushed the country's comprehensive national strength to a new level. In 1997 and 1999, our country will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao respectively and will realize a smooth transition. This represents major progress in accomplishing the great undertaking of peaceful reunification of the motherland according to the principle of "one country, two systems." It is particularly important to do a good job in "Overseas Chinese" work at this critical time when the country confidently strides toward the 21st century and unity, prosperity, and civilization. It is hoped that the federations of returned Overseas Chinese at various levels will shoulder the important duties entrusted to them by the times, unite with the broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese, and, under the leadership of the party and government, work together wholeheartedly to make a larger contribution in the struggle for the motherland's peaceful reunification and prosperity.
