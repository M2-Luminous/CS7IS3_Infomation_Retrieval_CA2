Hence, he added, I would like to emphasize the following points in the name of the Lebanese Government: 1. Lebanon in its entirety stands unified against the Israeli aggression. The martyrs who fell in al-Biqa' are martyrs of all Lebanon; they fell as they defended Lebanon's unity, safety, dignity, and sovereignty; 2. Lebanon engaged in negotiations in order to liberate its lands from occupation. It will not waive the right to liberate the land and exercise sovereignty, even under military and terrorist pressure and despite Israel's acts of piracy. Lebanon will hold on to the positions it opted to assume with its brothers, primarily sister Syria, until the Israeli occupation fully withdraws; 3. The new aggression in al-Biqa' is aggression against peace that undermines the regional peace process. Lebanon will not agree to be one of the victims of aggression against regional peace. Hence, it is entitled to consider any measures to protect its existence, sovereignty, and the dignity of its people; and, 4. The international community, particularly the states sponsoring the regional peace process, are invited to adopt a clear-cut stance in this connection to put an end to the Israeli aggression and rescue peace. The Lebanese Government will shoulder its responsibility in that connection and will do everything possible to explain its stance at international forums.
