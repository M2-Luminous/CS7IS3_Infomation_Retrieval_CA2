Bratislava has reacted very sensitively to signs of "discrimination" within the Visegrad Group. It has not responded positively to the reserved stance of Czech politicians towards the Visegrad Group, or to efforts at taking an individual approach to the West. The Slovak Foreign Ministry has been stressing the multilateral character of the envisaged meeting of the Visegrad countries' top representatives with U.S. President Bill Clinton, which is to be held in Prague on January 11-12. By its recent approval of Slovakia's association with the EU, the Slovak parliament seems to have clearly expressed its support of the strategic goal of attaining full membership in the EU and other West European structures, including NATO. However, more exact conclusions on a consensus of Slovak political parties regarding the goals of Slovak foreign policy can probably be drawn only after the debate on the speech of Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik, slated for January. Slovakia did not reject the U.S. initiative "Partnership for Peace," but at the same time indicated that the initiative did not fully correspond to its idea of joining NATO. "We understand (the initiative) as a certain temporary phase which will eventually lead to our full membership," Moravcik told the government daily REPUBLIKA. At a press conference after his recent visit to Germany, he praised the "Partnership for Peace" as a sign of the differentiated approach to the East and Central European applicants for cooperation with NATO, which gives priority to the Visegrad countries. Moravcik rejected any attempts to discriminate against Slovakia within the Visegrad Group. At the same time he said he hoped the NATO countries' stands would be more accommodating, also in view of the results of the Russian parliamentary elections. In an interview with the U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON POST, Slovak President Michal Kovac said he intended to present his own plan for acceleration of the Visegrad countries' joining NATO. Kovac's spokesman, Anton Bodis, added that the proposal was not to be a counter-proposal to the "Partnership for Peace," but a possible alternative. "President Kovac welcomes the U.S. project... the Slovak Republic unambiguously sticks to this initiative and wants to participate actively in it, however, it sees the real and definitive solution in full-fledged NATO membership," Bodis told CTK. "The president has an idea of quicker integration of Slovakia and other Central European countries into NATO. The first step would be their admission to NATO as political members along with offering them security guarantees. After fullfiling the obligations to follow from this, the Visegrad countries could become full members of the NATO military organisation as well," Bodis explained. He added that full integration into the NATO military complex demanded a certain amount of time and the compatibility of the relevant military systems to NATO standards. He quoted Kovac as saying that in the process of joining NATO, the Visegrad Four countries should be considered a regional whole, which necessitates these states' greater mutual cooperation. "He, Kovac, does not believe that the Visegrad countries' individual admission to NATO, at intervals of several years, would help improve the stability of Central Europe," Bodis said. However, even the stand of Slovakia's government camp on NATO is not united. In late November 1993, the government daily REPUBLIKA cast doubts on the statements of Slovak politicians regarding the necessity for Slovakia to join NATO, as well as on their efforts to do so along with Slovakia's Visegrad partners. "In no way can Slovakia's striving to join big politics through a group that is not favourable to us, and in which every member country pursues only its own interests, be considered a success for Slovak foreign policy," REPUBLIKA wrote, referring to Czech politicians' reserved stance towards the Visegrad Group. However, it is not ruled out that such criticism of Slovak foreign policy stems more from the internal situation in the country's governing Movement For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), especially given Moravcik's (HZDS) recent reservations about the policies of HZDS Chairman and Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar. REPUBLIKA quoted Moravcik as saying that so far, no signs had emerged within the Visegrad Group or NATO regarding whether the Visegrad countries should join NATO jointly or separately. However, he added that the cooperation between the Visegrad Four would be more acceptable for both NATO and the EU, and "our countries might be admitted at about the same time." The present situation in Slovak-Hungarian relations seems to have caused another slow-down of the cooperation within Visegrad. Rudolf Chmel, the last Czechoslovak ambassador to Hungary, said these relations destabilised the situation in the whole region. Both Hungary and Slovakia have not yet concluded any inter-state treaty, which should, according to Bratislava, include the confirmation of the two countries' present borders, so that Bratislava's often voiced fears of a "Greater Hungary" could be dismissed. Hungary has made the treaty conditional on the conclusion of a bilateral agreement on the status of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia. Bratislava refuses to accept this, fearing possible separation tendencies on the part of the minority. The question of the Gabcikovo waterworks on the Danube River also remains an open problem, which is burdening mutual relations. The dispute over the opening of new Slovak-Hungarian border crossings, which Bratislava has made conditional on Budapest's approval of the readmission agreement on returning immigrants, led to the postponement of Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky's planned visit to Slovakia. Peter Weiss, leader of Slovakia's strongest opposition party, the Democratic Left Party (SDL) said that the settlement of Slovak- Hungarian relations was the basic condition for the country's NATO membership, as "NATO will not admit neighbours who are at odds with each other." It seems that further development of Hungarian-Slovak relations depends to a large extent on the result of the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Hungary. However, the present tension over the Hungarian minority's claims to participate in the administration of southern Slovakia does not indicate either any prospect of a prompt settlement of the disputes or normalisation of relations between Bratislava and Budapest.
