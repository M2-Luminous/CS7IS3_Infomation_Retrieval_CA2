Romanenko, Samara State University; UDC 621.382] [Abstract] This article presents a study of the electrophysical properties of silicon MIS structures with dielectric films of disprosium and lutetium oxides manufactured with high-temperature (1323-1593 K) oxidation of rare-earth metal films. Rare-earth metal oxide films have a specific resistance on the order of 10[.sup]17[/] _O_ cm, a large specific capacitance (3X10[.sup]4[/]-3.6X10[.sup]4[/] pF/cm[.sup]2[/]), small dielectric loss tangents (0.4X10[.sup]-3[/]-5X10[.sup]-3[/]) and a high electric strength (2X10[.sup]6[/]-4X10[.sup]6[/] V/cm). The volt-capacitance characteristics method shows that the MIS structures, compared to thermal silicon dioxide structures, have a substantially lower built-in fixed charge in the dielectric, and have a large breakdown voltage. The dependence of depth of bedding of the p-n junction on diffusion time of disprosium into silicon is determined at various diffusion temperatures. The depth of bedding increases nonlinearly as the time and temperature of diffusion increases, and this figure varies from 0.5 to 2.5 ï¿½m. Diffusion coefficients are determined for disprosium and lutetium atoms in single crystal silicon. Diffusion coefficients increase from 3X10[.sup]-13[/] to 10[.sup]-11[/] and from 10[.sup]-12[/] to 4.2X10[.sup]-12[/] cm[.sup]2[/]/s as temperature increases from 1373 to 1593K for disprosium and lutetium respectively. MIS structures with rare-earth metal oxide films have a positive fixed charge in the dielectric which is a factor of 4-7 lower than in thermal silicon dioxide structures.
