FBIS4-51854 "dreas086_c_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 North Korea Paper on Kim Yong-sam's Political Funding Paper on Kim Yong-sam's Political Funding SK0405105294 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1032 GMT 4 May 94 SK0405105294 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["True Picture of 'Upright Politics'" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today comments on the fact that the traitor Kim Yong-sam raked up a fabulous amount of political fund around the "presidential elections" at the end of 1992. The news analyst says: At the time of the "presidential elections" Kim Hyon-chol, the second son of Kim Yong-sam, received 120 million won from traditional medicine manufacturers through lawyer Yi Chun-pom and wrote a memorandum promising them to resolve their "civil petition." The opposition parties contend that Kim Hyon-chol's name was inscribed on the bills that Yi Chun-pom received and they were offered as fund for "presidential elections", not as lawyer's fees. This shows what base means the traitor Kim Yong-sam employed in collecting political funds, mobilizing even his son behind the scene, while publicly promising that he would not receive political funds and would pursue "no costly politics" at the time of the "presidential elections." An opposition party of South Korea is demanding "parliamentary investigation into state policies" and an explanation by the "president" for the clarification of the truth, saying that eight billion won of the 22,700 million won of secret fund created by the Chongu Construction Company which undertook the transfer of the Sangmudae Training Center found its way into the "Democratic Liberal Party" of Kim Yong-sam on the threshold of the "presidential elections." The scandal of Kim Hyon-chol and the political fund scandal involving the Sangmudae prove once again that the traitor Kim Yong-sam bought the "presidential" seat with political fund. It is shameless of Kim Yong-sam to advertise "upright politics." A true upright politics can be realised only when the money-lover Kim Yong-sam is ousted and an independent democratic government is established.
