Tello underscored that Mexico wants an end to the U.S. Border Patrol's xenophobia against illegal Mexicans and it wants respect for the human rights of immigrants, regardless of whether they are legal or illegal. The U.S. Government on 3 February released a new immigration program to control the crossing of illegal Mexicans through the border between the cities of Tijuana, in northwestern Mexico, and its neighbor, San Diego, in the United States. The measures include the incorporation of 1,010 Border Patrol officers, construction of double walls along the dividing line, the installation of sophisticated equipment to detect illegals, and the deportation of illegal criminals. "The Mexican Government remains concerned about the hardening of the measures against immigrants in the border area, because the problem will only be resolved in the long term and with specific rather than police measures," the foreign secretary said. On 8 February, Tello met with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, who informed him of the measures her government has decided to take. Tello indicated that the Mexican Government is analyzing the measures announced by its neighbor and those already implemented along the 3,000-km border because they cause "permanent irritation in bilateral relations." The request for the modification or suspension of the measures will be presented during a bilateral Mexican-U.S. meeting to be held in Neuvo Laredo, Mexico, on 7 March. According to researchers of the Northern Border College [Colegio de la Frontera Norte], at least 150,000 illegal Mexicans annually cross the border into the United States in search of better job opportunities. The researchers said the city of Tijuana, Baja California, is the area through which 80 percent of the Mexican illegals cross, although they are generally arrested and deported to Mexico in their initial attempts.
