There is no doubt that this is a maximum position. Almost simultaneously, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev presented in the U.S. magazine, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, similar, but a bit more vague ideas about the future role that Moscow is striving for in the CSCE. In addition, the following things are remarkable in his article: - The demand for the recognition of Russia as a superpower, which advocates, just as does the West, democracy, human rights, and responsible international action; - The term "NATO-mania," which Kozyrev uses in connection with Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, but without citing these states by name; - The West should recognize Russia's "problems with Georgia and Tajikistan" and support the Russian role. Only if the need for close cooperation in the CIS is recognized, can a repetition of the Yugoslav tragedy be avoided. Kozyrev equates the nature and structure of the CIS with those of the EU; - The safeguarding of the rights of Russian minorities in the "near abroad" is a real problem for Russia. Both Russian ministers expressly do not speak about the security interests of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary (the so-called Visegrad states), and the three Baltic republics. However, their statesmen are very worried about domestic developments in Russia, which they fear might lead to an imperialistic foreign policy and endanger the independence of their states. They watch the current Partnership for Peace with suspicion, because here Russia is placed on the same footing as they are. So far, the West has, however, shied away even from promising the four Visegrad states NATO memberships or a security guarantee. The EU does expect to accept them as members within a few years, but their future role in the framework of the intended "common foreign and security policy" of the EU remains unclear for the time being. The West is facing a dilemma: On the one hand, it is in the interest of all Europeans to effectively ensure the security of the Visegrad states (and the three Baltic republics). For them, a security policy condominium of the West with Moscow must not come about, because the Poles, but also the Hungarians (because of 1956!) and the Czechs (because of 1968!) would reject Russia's position as a guarantor power. Neither have the four divisions of Poland been forgotten in Warsaw, in which not only Moscow but -- in addition to Vienna's participation three times -- also Berlin was involved every time, nor has Prague forgotten the invasion of German troops under Hitler and its consequences. On the other hand, Moscow's demand for the recognition of its status as a superpower and for institutionalized cooperation with the West is sensible. However, neither the North Atlantic Cooperation Council nor the Partnership for Peace are suitable for that as long as they both put Russia on the same level as small states. Conversely, the Russian proposal for giving the CSCE executive powers rights to the fringe of the Pacific Ocean is unacceptable; one just has to think of the effect on China. In a few years everyone will recognize that the United States, China, Russia, Japan, and the EU are superpowers. All five must learn to respect each other in every way as big powers. The North Atlantic Cooperation Council, which was established upon proposal by the United States, and the Partnership for Peace may have been useful as improvised interim solutions. Now, however, this concept rather proves to be a knot that must be untied. It is time to invite both Russia and China to fully participate in the annual G-7 meetings, the so-called international economic summits. This would serve both mutual understanding and Moscow and Beijing's legitimate need for recognition. Furthermore, the current system of security agreements between the West and Moscow must be supplemented with a general strategic consultation and cooperation treaty between Russia and the West. The NATO Consultation Council would then remain an episode. Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia will soon become members of the EU. Russia is not happy about this, but it cannot object. It is only logical to put these states under NATO protection. But do not water down NATO and the Atlantic alliance! Kozyrev has repeatedly warned against a return of the centuries of Russian imperialism to get foreign policy successes from the West, which are necessary for the reform forces in Russia. However, despite all Russia's current economic and political weaknesses, the West cannot avoid the actual recognition of this gigantic country's historical, current, and future role as a superpower.
