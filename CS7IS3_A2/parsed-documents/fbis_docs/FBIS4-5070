He said that to remove the danger of a nuclear war and ease the tensions on the Korean peninsula where an acute military confrontation continues is an important question directly linked to peace and security of the world at present. Charging that the United States is committing insincere act, deploying Patriot missiles in South Korea by reversing the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, he said: "The Norwegian Communist Party strongly opposes the shipment of new mass destruction weapons to South Korea." He held that the United States must not resort to "sanctions", but work for a peaceful solution of the Korean question through dialogue and negotiation. "If the United States think it will be able to bring the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to its knees by strength, it is a big mistake," he said, and added: "The United States must abandon its anachronistic dream."
