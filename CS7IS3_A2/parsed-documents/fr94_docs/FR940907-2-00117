Brief Description Of Projects Approved For Collection Only : Planning for extension of runway 6R/24L, Central aircraft deicing area, Runway deicing fluid storage tank. Brief Description Of Project Disapproved : Emery cargo apron purchase. Determination : Disapproved. The FAA has determined that the Emery air cargo apron purchase to extinguish the exclusive use rights is not eligible under AIP eligibility criteria, based on the following: 1. The construction, alteration, or reconstruction of aprons that are predominantly for the exclusive use of a tenant or operator not furnishing an aeronautical service to the public are ineligible for Federal participation under AIP. The existing apron would be utilized by tenants not furnishing an aeronautical service to the public (aircraft maintenance hangars). 2. The extinguishment of a lease is AIP eligible if it is an incidental cost to the purchase, relocation, or demolition of a non-eligible structure located on the airport, and when such a structure constitutes an airport hazard or impedes eligible airport development. This does not apply in this situation. Therefore, the cost of extinguishing the exclusive use rights is not eligible for Federal participation. 3. Paying Emery Worldwide to relinquish their exclusive rights to the existing apron is tantamount to reimbursing Emery for the construction costs of the apron. Airport development costs incurred before the date of execution of a grant agreement covering the development are not eligible for Federal participation. 4. The payment to extinguish the exclusive use rights of the Emery apron is not AIP eligible; therefore, not PFC eligible.
