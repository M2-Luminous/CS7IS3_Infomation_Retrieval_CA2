It was therefore natural that journalists at a meeting in Zvezdnyy Gorodok attempted to tease out all the details of how the cosmonauts feel. There was no hint of the slightest complaint, and immediately after the news conference Aleksandr Serebrov went off for another swim in the sports pool. Incidentally, this was 50-year-old Serebrov's fourth flight already, and two of the expeditions turned out to be lengthy. He now has several world records to his credit, the most impressive being 10 space walks. One of these -- when the orbital station was carefully examined from all sides during the "Panorama" scientific experiment -- gave grounds for assuming that Mir will "survive" until the joint missions with the Americans in 1997. Even this time, incidentally, Serebrov and Tsibliyev conducted experiments in growing biological crystals under a commercial order from the American firms Boeing and Payload. As a check back on Earth has shown, the crystals obtained are of a distinctly high quality. By the way, there should be no delusions about the scientific intensity of the expedition. Crews, including this one, have to spend a considerable proportion of their time on preventive work -- essentially do-it-yourself jobs. Therefore, it seemed to me, Serebrov is somewhat skeptical about the idea of a fifth flight, which, on the one hand, would enable him to become undisputed record-holder but, on the other, would be of little interest to a specialist in the current situation. But we do have an achievement for the Guinness Book of Records. Serebrov conducted studies involving a microaccelerometer and thereby, in orbit, helped his latest terrestrial research student, Yelena Bogdanova from the "Energiya" Science-and-Production Association, in her preparation to defend her dissertation. This flight was also unusual in that the crew's relationship with Mission Control Center was contract-based. In the event of a mistake either side would have had to repay up to 30 percent of the cost of the spoiled segment of work. Any change of program proposed by Mission Control Center required legal coordination with the crew's agents on Earth. It did not get to the point of financial penalties during this expedition, but there were a dozen instances when an official document was written at Mission Control Center to broaden the crew's functions and exempt them from any claim in the event of any kind of failure. Serebrov and Tsibliyev are unanimous that the contract system is still rough and and imperfect but that even in this form it imposes a discipline and is a great help in work. The cosmonauts' were pretty pessimistic in their assessment of the situation in the country which they left more than six months ago, saying that nothing has changed here since Gogol's time. Gaydar's exit from the government provoked particularly gloomy thoughts among the cosmonauts. On the way to the swimming pool I managed to get a word with Aleksandr Serebrov on a delicate matter -- the recent pre-launch conflict between cosmonaut physicians Valeriy Polyakov and German Arzamazov. Serebrov noted that their relationship is a precise repetition of the theme of "Two Captains" [Dva Kapitana; 1944 Veniamin Kaverin novel paralleling the lives and conflicts of a pre-revolutionary explorer and a young Soviet airman]. The most curious thing is that just before the replacement team arrived Serebrov, without having any information from Earth, predicted a probable clash between the contenders for a record one and one-half year flight. Incidentally, it is premature to make final judgments in this unpleasant episode. After our first item the "troublemaker" German Arzamazov contacted the editorial office. His story differs from the official version. Incidentally, Serebrov's astonishing prediction testifies that what happened cannot be described as a nervous breakdown, as it is being depicted.
