FR940526-0-00056 FR940526-0-00021 11. Section 646.27 is redesignated as §646.28; §646.25 is redesignated as §646.27; and a new §646.25 is added to read as follows: §646.25 Commercial trip limits. Persons who are not subject to the bag limits and who fish in the EEZ on a trip are subject to the following vessel trip limits. (See §646.23(a)(1) for applicability of the bag limits.) (a) Snowy grouper (whole weight or gutted weight, that is, eviscerated but otherwise whole). (1) Until the fishing year quota specified in §646.24(b) is reached, 2,500 pounds (1,134 kg). (2) After the fishing year quota specified in §646.24(b) is reached, 300 pounds (136 kg). (b) Golden tilefish (whole weight or gutted weight, that is, eviscerated but otherwise whole). (1) Until the fishing year quota specified in §646.24(c) is reached, 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg). (2) After the fishing year quota specified in §646.24(c) is reached, 300 pounds (136 kg). (c) Reduction of trip limits. When a commercial quota specified in §646.24(b) or (c) is reached, or is projected to be reached, the Assistant Administrator will file a notice to that effect with the Office of the Federal Register. On and after the effective date of such notice, for the remainder of the fishing year, the appropriate trip limit applies. (d) A person who fishes in the EEZ may not combine a trip limit under this section with any trip or possession limit applicable to state waters. (e) A snowy grouper or golden tilefish taken in the EEZ may not be transferred at sea, regardless of where such transfer takes place; a snowy grouper or golden tilefish may not be transferred at sea in the EEZ, regardless of where such snowy grouper or golden tilefish was taken. (f) Snowy grouper or golden tilefish in excess of an applicable trip limit specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section may not be sold, purchased, traded, or bartered, or attempted to be sold, purchased, traded, or bartered. 12. In §646.26, a new paragraph (d) is added to read as follows: §646.26 Area limitations. * * * * * (d) Habitat area of particular concern (HAPC). (1) The Oculina Bank, which is a coral HAPC under §638.23(c) of this chapter, is bounded on the north by 27 ○53 ’N. latitude, on the south by 27 ○30 ’N. latitude, on the east by 79 ○56 ’W. longitude, and on the west by 80 ○00 ’W. longitude. (2) No fishing for fish in the snapper-grouper fishery may be conducted in the Oculina Bank HAPC; such fish may not be retained in or from the Oculina Bank HAPC. Fish in the snapper-grouper fishery taken incidentally in the Oculina Bank HAPC by hook-and-line gear must be released immediately by cutting the line without removing the fish from the water. It is a rebuttable presumption that fishing aboard a vessel that is anchored in the HAPC constitutes fishing for fish in the snapper-grouper fishery. (3) See §638.23(c) of this chapter for prohibitions on fishing with bottom longlines, traps, pots, dredges, and bottom trawls in the Oculina Bank HAPC.
