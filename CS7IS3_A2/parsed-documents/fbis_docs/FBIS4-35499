Talking to newspersons in New Delhi today, the party spokesman, Mr. V.N. Gadgil, said it is significant that five of the Lok Sabha constituencies, which Congress-I has won, are all rural constituencies and thus prove that rural people and farmers have rejected the opposition propaganda about Dunkel proposals. Describing by-elections as trend setter, Mr. Gadgil, however ruled out the possibility of early general elections in the country.
