Despite the police minister's recommendation to tighten the closure in the territories, the government took no decisions on this issue. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports from the Prime Minister's Office: [Begin recording] [Segal] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat will set up his residence in Jericho by the end of May, according to Minister Yosi Sarid. Sarid bases this assessment on the progress made in the negotiations between Israel and the PLO. Sarid added, however, that 'Arafat must reduce the level of terrorism, otherwise terrorism will reduce him. In today's cabinet session, the cabinet was briefed about the grave attack in Ari'el, which the ministers called a shocking attack. The prime minister decided not to discuss the issue of a closure. Despite the police minister's recommendation to tighten the closure, the government took no decisions in this issue. This is what Minister Amnon Rubinstein had to say following the session: [Rubinstein] The prime minister did not recommend reimposing or exacerbating the closure, although the issue is hovering in the air. It was said that if the closure is reimposed we have to prepare for it properly, a thing we failed to do last time. It is also feared that a closure will exacerbate the situation in the Gaza Strip. [Segal] Rubinstein said that according to figures submitted to the cabinet this morning, 19 Palestinians were murdered by other Palestinians during the first two weeks of the month. 'Arafat will have to deal with this difficult situation. [passage omitted]
