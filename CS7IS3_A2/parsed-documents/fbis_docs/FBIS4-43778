They could have stopped the massacre of our people by exercising pressure on their murderer friends, but they did not do so. So what do they want now? That we help them ease their bad consciences? That is a bit too much. If they think they can hoodwink us with a humanitarian aid charade, they are very mistaken. If they set foot in Rwanda -- and last time they did they stayed on for four years -- we will make them regret it bitterly." Speaking over the phone from Brindisi, Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] spokesman Innocenzo Kabera did not even attempt to use diplomatic tones. He went straight to the heart of the matter. It was enough to whisper the word "French" to see him blow his top. [Caprile] Why, then, are you so hostile to France, Mr. Kabera? [Kabera] Because we cannot forget the fact that, if all that is now left in our country is heaps of corpses, if thousands of children have been wounded in their bodies and their minds, we owe this precisely to the French. It was they who first trained, and then armed and supported the government's troops, the death squads. What are they coming for? To stop the massacre? Too late, it already took place. In all the towns we conquered, we found nothing but dead people. So, are they coming to negotiate so that an agreement can be reached between the parts? Come off it! What sort of credibility can accomplices in genocide have in peace talks? Furthermore, whom are they coming to negotiate with? Not with us, certainly. [Caprile] So you do not want the French. What about Italians, who over the past few days have been discussing whether or not to send a blue helmet contingent to Rwanda? [Kabera] I have been living in Italy for years. I can say I know Italians well. I know that, from Lebanon to Somalia and Mozambique -- wherever they went -- they worked well, but if they should embark on a joint operation with the French, we will have no choice: We will fight against what we consider occupation forces in our country. [Caprile] Yet Italy has already fully proven its good faith through Mariapia Fanfani's two missions. [Kabera] I repeat: We feel genuine friendship and gratitude toward Italy. We may even trust Italians, but we will not if they come led by the French. [Caprile] So, are you not opposed, in principle, to 5,500 UN blue helmets being sent? [Kabera] Of course not. We cannot but agree with the UN initiative, provided that it is strictly neutral. The UN Security Council has voted a resolution to send troops capable of ensuring protection for the civilians who are at risk. We agree with this. But the French should not be part of the mission. They are not neutral. For them, humanitarian aid is just a facade. They only want to come to enable the butchers of our people to save face, they do not want to come to help suffering people, but only their friends, who are our enemies. [Caprile] What does "help" mean in your view? [Kabera] As everybody knows, this war flares up periodically. This means that if the government's army is not disarmed, you can be sure that, within a year or two, it will begin again. [Kabera ends] As further proof that the Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels are absolutely determined to prevent French blue helmets from being sent to Rwanda, Kabera announced a great protest demonstration to be held in Rome in the next few days. "We will take to the streets," he explained, "to let people know about the crimes committed by [French President] Mitterrand and company during the genocide of our people."
