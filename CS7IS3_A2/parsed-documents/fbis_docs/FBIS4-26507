The PEOPLE'S DAILY, the party mouthpiece, quoted Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, who is heading a central government task force to southwestern Guangxi, as expressing his satisfaction with relief efforts after touring badly hit areas for two days. According to a ministry of civil affairs statement released to foreign news organisations Wednesday, 719 people have died in two weeks of severe flooding that has caused economic losses of some 30.54 billion yuan (3.51 billion dollars) in the six provinces. Central Hunan has been worst hit with 190 fatalities, while 174 people have died in southern Guangdong, 141 in southwestern Guangxi, 80 in southeasten Fujian, 68 in eastern Zhejiang and 66 in southeastern Jiangxi as of Wednesday, according to the ministry's figures. In a similar statement revealing the extent of the disaster earlier in the week, the ministry appealed for foreign aid for relief efforts. Chinese citizens, meanwhile, have been given few details of casualties and economic losses, fed instead a daily diet of propaganda extolling local governments' commitment to helping local residents and the heroism of People's Liberation Army soldiers on the front line of relief work. Zhou was quoted as saying the main tasks were ensuring food supplies for local people, stepping up efforts to restore transport links and carrying out effective disease prevention work to stop the outbreak of any epidemics. "Southern China's flood season has only just begun, we must prepare with a long-term flood prevention attitude and by no means treat the matter lightly," the PEOPLE'S DAILY quoted Zhou as saying. The central government had as of Wednesday released six million yuan in relief aid, divided equally between Guangdong, Guangxi and Hunan. The paper said that in Fujian there had been "severe losses in human life and property," but gave no precise details. Local officials were again quoted as stressing their courageous efforts at bringing relief to citizens, saying special funds had been released and eight task forces dispatched. Some 10,000 soldiers, police and local paramilitary officers and 3,000 vehicles are taking part in the relief work, it said.
