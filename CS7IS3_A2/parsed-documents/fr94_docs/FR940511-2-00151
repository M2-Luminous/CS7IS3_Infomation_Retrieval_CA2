ACTION: Determination of CARP arbitrator list. SUMMARY: The Copyright Office of the Library of Congress is publishing the list of arbitrators eligible for selection to a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP) during 1994. This CARP arbitrator list will be used to select all arbitrators required for any royalty fee distribution proceeding initiated under 17 U.S.C. 802 and beginning during calendar year 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 11, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marilyn Kretsinger, Acting General Counsel, U.S. Copyright Office, Library of Congress, Washington, DC 20540, (202) 707&hyph;8380. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993, Public Law No. 103&hyph;198, 107 Stat. 2304 (1993), creates a system of Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels (CARPs), administered by the Librarian of Congress and the Copyright Office, for the distribution of copyright royalty fees collected by the Copyright Office under the various compulsory licenses of the Copyright Code, 17 U.S.C., and for adjustment of compulsory license royalty rates. For royalty rate adjustments and distributions that are in controversy, section 802(b) of the Copyright Code requires the selection of a CARP consisting of three arbitrators from ``lists provided by professional arbitration associations.'' The Librarian selects two arbitrators, who in turn select the third to serve as their chairperson. If the two arbitrators cannot agree, the Librarian is instructed to select the third arbitrator. List of Nominated Arbitrators To implement the CARP selection process of section 802(b), the Copyright Office recently issued a set of interim regulations. 59 FR 23964 (1994). Subpart A of part 251 of these regulations describes the selection and organization of the CARPs. 37 CFR part 251. For 1994, arbitration associations were asked to submit a list of persons qualified to serve on a CARP, as described in ยง251.5, by May 6. The regulation required that the submitting arbitration association supply the following information for each person: (1) The full name, address, and telephone number of the person. (2) The current position and name of the person's employer, if any, along with a brief summary of the person's employment history, including areas of expertise, and, if available, a description of the general nature of clients represented and the types of proceedings in which the person represented clients.

(4) A statement of facts and information which qualify the person to serve as an arbitrator under ยง251.5. (5) A description or schedule detailing fees proposed to be charged by the person for service on a CARP.
