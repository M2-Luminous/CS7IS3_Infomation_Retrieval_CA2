They show that the cost of NHS management rose from £25.7 million in 1987 to £494.2 million this year -- an increase of £468 million or 1,800 per cent. An analysis of the figures by Labour show that annual bureaucratic costs -- including administration, clerical and management costs -- have risen over the same period from £1.44 billion to £3.02 billion, an increase of 110 percent. The proportion of spending on administration, clerical and management costs has risen from 8.7 percent of the total NHS budget in England in 1987-88 to 10.8 percent in 1992-93. Mr. David Blunkett, Labour Shadow Health Secretary, claimed that greater bureaucracy and increased administrative costs were a direct result of the introduction of the internal market -- the commercialised contracting system within the NHS. He said it had been commonly accepted before the Conservatives came to office that NHS management and administrative costs amounted to about six percent of total NHS spending. "A rise to nearly 11 percent over 15 years is a staggering indictment of the Conservatives mismanagement and misuse of resources." A spokesman for the Department of Health said that Mr. Blunkett was only looking at the "input" side of NHS statistics without considering the output it achieved. He said: "For every 100 patients treated in hospital before the reforms, the NHS now treats 115 and it will rise to 120 next year. The NHS spends £100 million every day and if it is to treat more patients and improve the quality of care, the money has to be properly used and management plays a vital role in that process." Mrs. Bottomley argues that the increase in management is caused to some extent by staff such as senior nurses being re-designated as managers under the reforms. She also says the Government has acted decisively to cut bureaucracy -- regional health authorities are about to be abolished with the loss of 2,000 staff. District health authorities, totalling 192 a few years ago, are already down to 145 and will fall to only 94 in coming years. In a counterblast to Mr. Blunkett's comments she accused Labour of failing to produce a promised document on its health policy: "Instead of attacking the health service, Labour should deploy their time explaining how they would match the improvements in the quality and quantity of patient care achieved under the Conservative reforms." The skirmish between the two parties is in preparation for a Parliamentary debate today initiated by Labour on the level of NHS bureaucracy.
