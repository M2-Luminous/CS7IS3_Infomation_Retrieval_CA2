In his roundtable talks with reporters that day, Minister Kim said that "after its ratification at the National Assembly, the government will sign an agreement on the formation of the World Trade Organization [WTO] during the nation-ministerial conference in Marrakesh," and that "this is not related to UR renegotiation but rather a matter of domestic procedures of ratification." Minister Kim said: Every country has its own policy different from that of others regarding the signing of the World Trade Organization agreement. Therefore, the government has so far prudently calculated the loss and gain of the agreement during the meetings of related ministers. As a result, it has boldly decided to sign the agreement after its ratification at the National Assembly. He said, however, that "regardless of the change of the signing form of the agreement, the government will officially participate in the World Trade Organization system, an order of international trade," and that"it is the government's firm will." He added that "the ROK, which has so far achieved economic development through free trade, must not be isolated from the international community because of its failure to participate in the World Trade Organization," and that "it would never be a good choice if the government brings international isolationism on itself."
