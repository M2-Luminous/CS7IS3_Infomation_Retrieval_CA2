Can you accept the responsibility for the Turkish military continuing to use German weapons against the Kurdish population in its own country? [Kinkel] Of course not. But there is no definite proof to support this accusation. I have had all the photographic evidence examined by the Defense Ministry. No conclusive evidence was found that would indicate that weapons supplied by Germany had been used in internal altercations in Turkey in a manner contrary to our agreement. Had we had any proof of this, the sales would have been banned for good. [SPIEGEL] Independent observers have seen with their own eyes Turkish military unimogs made by Mercedes, small arms made by Heckler and Koch, and Kalashnikovs and armored personnel carriers from former NVA [National People's Army] stocks, in the Kurdish region. Has all of this just been faked? [Kinkel] I would not want to say that. At any rate, I have seen no convincing evidence. We really did not act rashly, instead we deliberately suspended the sale of arms following the most recent accusations and have carefully examined the photographic material we were given, with the known results. [SPIEGEL] Only the conclusion differs completely from statements made by independent arms experts and former NVA officers, who positively identified eight-wheeled BTR-60 armored personnel carriers as former NVA vehicles based upon their special design features for German roads. [Kinkel] According to the Defense Ministry, these features, like outside mirrors or white crosses on the backs of the vehicles, are not proof of German origin. They could also, quite obviously, have been put on vehicles that were sold to Turkey from other, for example Russian, stocks. Or the Turks may have put them on themselves. In addition, not one of the photographs we were presented with indicates that it was taken during a military deployment. [SPIEGEL] German representatives attest to the fact that they detected poorly overpainted GDR symbols on some armored vehicles. [Kinkel] Again: The Defense Ministry has said that this proves nothing regarding German sales. I cannot enter into criminal investigations and assessments at this time. [SPIEGEL] Is it not politically naive to sell 256,000 Kalashnikovs and 5,000 machine guns to a government that has been criticized for its human rights policies, trusting that they really will not be used in the civil war? [Kinkel] The Federal Government has always made it clear--most recently in a policy statement I presented--that human rights violations are occurring in Turkey, now as before. We are constantly pointing this out to Turkish politicians and are doing everything we can on this issue. That is why I do not allow myself to be saddled with it personally. But you must also see that we have been on friendly terms with Turkey for decades, and it is a politically, economically, and culturally important partner. It is a partner in NATO and since the abandonment of the East-West conflict has taken on an important new function as a bridge to the Islamic, to the Asian world. In addition to this, Turkey has its problem with the Kurds--and it is not the only one--and, since the most recent municipal elections, it is also facing a fundamentalist threat. All of this must enter into a well-balanced German policy on Turkey. [SPIEGEL] Taking into account the danger that Bonn will become jointly responsible for the civil war in Turkey? [Kinkel] Such criticism is unwarranted. The issue of the Kurds is a very difficult one for Turkey. Unfortunately there is little that can be done to help them with it. They must handle it themselves, but in conformity with the rule of the law. We Germans cannot solve Turkey's problems from here. But during difficult times our friends and partners also deserve our support. [SPIEGEL] You are the one who propagates the idea of NATO being a community of values that should defend freedom and democracy. [Kinkel] Yes, I do. Unfortunately a pluralist stance, such as you represent for ethical-moral reasons--and on that point we are in complete agreement--is not possible in the area of foreign policy. For example, we have NATO commitments with respect to Turkey. It simply is not possible to say we no longer want Turkey as a NATO partner. That would be a fatal decision given the current political situation. [SPIEGEL] Now you are making German influence less than it is. [Kinkel] I do not think so. It is becoming increasingly difficult for me as foreign minister to remind others of human rights violations when we ourselves are not able to maintain order in our country. More and more often I am reminded by foreign countries of how things were prior to 1945 with the unlawful German state and the holocaust. I am asked how things were until 1989 in the other part of Germany; was that not an unlawful state? And how are things now with the violence and murderous acts perpetrated by the radical right in Moelln and Solingen? I know of what I speak because in Turkey I stood at the open graves of those who had been murdered in Germany. That is why we should be a little more careful and hesitant to point a finger.
