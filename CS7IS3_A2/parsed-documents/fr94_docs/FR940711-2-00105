ACTION: Notice of Social Security Ruling. SUMMARY: In accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), the Commissioner of Social Security gives notice of Social Security Ruling 94&hyph;4p. This Ruling states the Social Security Administration's longstanding policy of giving adequate written notice of a determination of overpayment and the right to contest such determination and of providing the person from whom we are seeking recovery with an opportunity for a face-to-face oral hearing before we deny that person's request for waiver of recovery of the overpayment. This policy is based on the 1974 court decision in Buffington, et al. v. Weinberger, No. 734&hyph;73C2 (W.D. Wash. October 22, 1974), and Supreme Court decision in Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682 (1979). EFFECTIVE DATE: July 11, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joanne K. Castello, Office of Regulations, Social Security Administration, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235, (410) 965&hyph;1711. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Although we are not required to do so pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(1) and (a)(2), we are publishing this Social Security Ruling in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1). Social Security Rulings make available to the public precedential decisions relating to the Federal old-age, survivors, disability, supplemental security income, and black lung benefits programs. Social Security Rulings may be based on case decisions made at all administrative levels of adjudication, Federal court decisions, Commissioner's decisions, opinions of the Office of the General Counsel, and other policy interpretations of the law and regulations. Although Social Security Rulings do not have the force and effect of the law or regulations, they are binding on all components of the Social Security Administration, in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), and are to be relied upon as precedents in adjudicating other cases. If this Social Security Ruling is later superseded, modified, or rescinded, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register to that effect.
