This happened on 6 June when the former soldiers mutinied and abandoned the assembly area, demanding an immediate demobilization and a speedy return to their homes. The police failed to control the situation, much less the UN personnel stationed in the area. The mutineers inundated the city, blocking the main road and exit of Mocuba both in the north and south. They destroyed a private vehicle, burned three houses, and disrupted the central market, causing considerable losses to the vendors. The wave of violence did not last more than an hour, because the population, seeing that the security forces were unable to contain the disturbances, organized itself and wielding hatchets and sticks, responded in kind. One soldier was killed and others seriously wounded, according to official reports. Meanwhile, unofficial reports say that two soldiers died and dozens others were wounded. In less than an hour the situation was under control and life returned to normal. Our reporters visited Mocuba 24 hours after the incident and the atmosphere was good. It was as if nothing abnormal had happened. [passage omitted]
