It goes over a process to evolve. Camp David confabulations spanned the distance between Cairo and Tel Aviv. More recently, the lawns of the White House witnessed the handshake between the Israeli Prime Minister and the PLO chief. The visit of Robin Raphel, head of State Department's South Asia Bureau, to the subcontinent is the beginning of another exercise. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott comes to promote it. Finally, if all goes well, there may be a meeting between Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on the lawns of the White House in the presence of beaming and clapping President Clinton to parade `the results'. lt is not that America is fumbling for what it is seeking; it is only that it wants to show that `the results' came forth gradually into being. Process is the key word, not pressure or prize, although the United States makes a liberal use of it. For reasons it does not hide, the Clinton administration has decided to cap nuclear programmes both in India and Pakistan. The visit by Raphel and Talbott are part of an exercise to bring it about. The assumption is that both New Delhi and Islamabad will give in to Washington's thinking. Starting with Islamabad, America has offered the bait of 38 F-16s, which Pakistan is keen to acquire. (It made tne payment of $680 million nearly two years ago). The Clinton administration has said that it will make one-time exception to the Pressler amendment which forbids any military assistance or the sale of weapons to a country which possesses the nuclear device. The price demanded is the capping of nuclear programme by Pakistan. Benazir realises that it cannot sell the proposition to a nation which has been told and retold that it is better to eat grass than to skimp on manufacturing the bomb. On the other hand, Benazir very much wants the F-16s. She has reportedly conveyed to Washington that she may be able to persuade her people to accept the proposition if India too caps its nuclear programme. What leverage does Washington have with New Delhi to effect it? And why should Rao put his head on the block? America is getting together a package containing ``incentives'' which Talbott will spell out during his visit to India. Rao has also been invited to Washington from 6 May to meet Clinton and Congressmen. To ensure that Rao does not reject outright the invitation, the Hindujas in London have been brought into the picture. Anticipating India's demand that China, should also cap its nuclear programme America proposes convening a larger meeting, including Russia and China, for arriving at some consensus. Both India and Pakistan will be invited. It is difficult to imagine China agreeing to any curb when it has not accepted even a moratorium on nuclear tests. But the Clinton administration's eyes are set on India and Pakistan, not China. It expects that the meetings in Washington, preceded by the process which Raphel and Talbott have set into motion, will yield some `results'. If, despite Raphel's offensive observations, Rao could order red carpet treatment for her in the face of foreign office's opposition and even ask the Home Minister, S. B. Chavan, to meet her, the Prime Minister can be probably propitiated by the fuss America intends making during his visit. All this is understandable from Washington's point of view. But the interests of New Delhi are not served by America's moves. Whatever agreement or concession in the nuclear field is envisaged, it should be offered directly to Islamabad. The principle of bilateralism, which has been established through the Simla Agreement to settle mutual differences between India and Pakistan, should not be diluted. By giving any function to a third party, particularly America, New Delhi may set a precedent which may one day be used in respect of Kashmir. Why America has been singled out is because it is clearer than before that Washington wants to have a role in the region. Maybe, it is anticipating China's disintegration after Deng Xiaoping's death. Maybe, it is opposed to India emerging as a regional power. Maybe, it has developed a vested interest in Kashmir. Unlike the Bush administration, the Clinton administration has different strategical considerations. Because of these considerations, Washington's tilt towards Islamabad is visible. For it, Pakistan is a dependable country where the army's hold makes things far easier than those in democratic, uncertain India. Raphel has given a peep into one aspect of America's policies by hinting at an independent status for the state of Jammu and Kashmir. However, America's UN representative in 1949, Henry Austin, during the discussion on Kashmir at the UN, said that the state's ``sovereignty'' had passed on to India. Washington has come a long way since. Raphel is only annoyingly enthusiastic about-putting things across. But before she made them public she tested them at the Carnegie Institute on a group of American scholars working on the subcontinent. She said that America would treat India and Pakistan at par. When a lady scholar said that the policy reminded her of the days of Dulles, Raphel did not contradict her. If Rao still wants to go to America, he is at liberty to do so. But please save us the humbug that the visit is meant to further consolidate the relationship between India and the United States.
