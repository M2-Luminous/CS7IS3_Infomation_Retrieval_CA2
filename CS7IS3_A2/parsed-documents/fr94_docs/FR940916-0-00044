FR940916-0-00044 FR940916-0-00016 (x) Preferred Mortgage. With respect to a Preferred Mortgage, one commenter stated that the reference to 46 CFR 221.43 is incorrect and suggested that it should refer to section 221.31. MARAD Response: The reference to section 221.43 is incorrect, and it should be to 46 CFR 221.23(d). Furthermore, MARAD notes that the interim final rule inadvertently deleted former provision (s)(4)(vi). That provision has been restored in the final rule and is redesignated as paragraph (x)(1)(iv)(F). Also, paragraph(x)(3) has been amended to recognize that a Mortgage or other security interest on a foreign-documented Vessel can qualify as a Preferred Mortgage pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 31301(6)(B). Section 298.2(bb). Most commenters objected to the provision precluding U.S. citizens from owning Eligible Export Vessels. They viewed the provision as discriminating against U.S. citizens and giving unfair preferences to foreign owners. Almost all of those objecting argued that the prohibition against U.S. citizens owning Eligible Export Vessels went beyond the provisions of the statute and some argued that it was inconsistent with the intent of Congress to eliminate ``burdensome citizenship requirements.'' By contrast, one commenter contended that the prohibition of ownership by U.S. citizens was consistent with congressional intent. Some argued that the statute eliminated all citizenship requirements except for fishing vessels and oceanographic research or instruction or pollution treatment abatement or control vessels. Some commenters were concerned that MARAD's regulatory stance would limit the customer base and improperly restrict, rather than expand, the true scope of the Shipbuilding Act. One commenter asserted that the proscription of U.S. ownership could be easily evaded by imaginative corporate structuring and the use of charters. Finally, it was argued that MARAD should encourage U.S. ownership of Eligible Export Vessels as a matter of national security. MARAD Response: There is no statutory preclusion to U.S. companies participating in the Eligible Export Vessel program. The Vessels will be delivered in the United States from a U.S. shipyard to a buyer for operation in worldwide trade under the documentation of a country other than the United States, as the statute requires. A number of ``American'' companies are, in fact, multi-national companies, and regularly order Vessels from foreign shipyards. Congress intends American shipyards to enter into the international market, and no sound reason exists to preclude U.S. shipyards from competing for this portion of the international commercial business. Accordingly, MARAD has removed the prohibition on U.S. ownership from the definition of an Eligible Export Vessel. Section 298.3‚ê£Applications Certain shipyards were concerned about the disclosure provision in subsection (d), Confidential information, concerning the disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA''), 5 U.S.C. 552, for two reasons: (1) That in international circles, financing applications are treated with strict confidence; and (2) the added expense of lawyers' fees for opposing a FOIA request render the Title XI programs non-competitive. MARAD Response: MARAD has no authority to amend the FOIA or the Administration's policy that it is to be liberally construed in favor of disclosure. On the other hand, while MARAD has not modified this section, it will continue to refuse to disclose information that is deemed by MARAD to be confidential, pursuant to legal authority interpreting the meaning of FOIA exemption (b)(4), because it would be likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom it was obtained. MARAD is, of course, also bound by the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, for unauthorized disclosures by Government officials of proprietary information that is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA, which, among other things, makes it a criminal act to release certain financial information such as a company's balance sheets, bids, or other proprietary information. With respect to paragraph (e), Priority, some shipyards expressed concern that it accords unjustified priority to (1) ``naval and military auxiliary'' vessels, (2) Vessels seeking domestic Title XI financing (in that MARAD must review applications for financing for Eligible Export Vessels in light of those for domestic vessels), and (3) shipyards engaged in naval vessel construction as well as pilot programs for shipyard modernization and vessel construction. MARAD Response: As a matter of maritime policy, MARAD accords priority for ``naval and auxiliary'' Vessels only in the domestic Title XI program. As for any impact on domestic Vessels, MARAD is required by statute to review applications regarding Eligible Export Vessels in light of the same standards as apply to Vessels to be documented under U.S. law. See section 1103(g)(1) of the Act. Any relief in this regard must come from Congress. Regarding the priority for shipyards engaged in both naval construction and pilot programs for shipyard modernization, such priority reflects the intent of Congress in facilitating the conversion of shipyards that have previously engaged in naval construction to commercial activities. The Title XI legislation is part of the National Shipbuilding Initiative, which also includes a technology development program for innovative commercial ship design and production processes and technologies. MARAD intends to administer the Title XI program in a manner that achieves the purposes of the National Shipbuilding Initiative.
