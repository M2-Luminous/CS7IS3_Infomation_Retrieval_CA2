S. Bazilevskaya and S. G. Skolotiyev, Geology Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 551.35] [Abstract] Hydrothermal activity and manifestations of ferromanganese ore deposition were studied in the region of the juncture of the southern segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge with a fault zone at 15ï¿½20'N (Cape Verde fault). A diagram of the work region is given showing two intersections of the rift zone of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge by the Akademik Nikolay Strakhov research ship. Along these intersections samples were taken which revealed significant changes in Fe-Mn encrustations. This zone is characterized by the presence of traces of hydrothermal activity, but it varies greatly from place to place. It is clear that anomalies in the composition of Fe-Mn deposits can be used in detecting endogenous activity on the ocean floor, but the problem of the reasons for these anomalies is more complex. In discussing this problem it is noted that in contrast to iron, much of which is removed from the geochemical cycle due to the formation of insoluble sulfides, the cycling of Mn in the ocean is much different. It does not form insoluble minerals but passes into solution and reenters sea water. Most of the Mn bound in Fe-Mn deposits was regenerated from ancient sedimentary deposits. This is attributable to the fact that any tectonomagmatic events on the ocean floor, from local manifestations of volcanism, spreading and subduction to global changes in the position of the continents on the planet, are always accompanied by the appearance of reduction conditions favoring the migration of earlier deposited manganese. The process of oceanic Mn accumulation is unique; it creates a background against which not only all events on the ocean floor occur, but also against which the maintenance of chemical equilibrium in sea water is dependent. The role of oceanic Fe-Mn deposits in maintenance of the ecological purity of the planet is comparable to the role of forests on the land. A study of the composition of the Fe-Mn deposits not only makes it possible to clarify problems involved in ore formation, but also provides additional possibilities for characterizing tectonomagmatic conditions in active regions on the ocean floor.
