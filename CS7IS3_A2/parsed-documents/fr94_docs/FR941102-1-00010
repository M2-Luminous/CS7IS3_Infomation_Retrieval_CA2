FR941102-1-00010 FR941102-1-00002 The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption `` ADDRESSES ''.

The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1.

Section 39.13 is amended by removing AD 92&hyph;08&hyph;07, Amendment 39&hyph;8218 (57 FR 13004, April 15, 1992), and by adding a new airworthiness directive to read as follows: Beech Aircraft Corporation: Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;12&hyph;AD; Supersedes AD 92&hyph;08&hyph;07, Amendment 39&hyph;8218. Applicability: The following model and serial number airplanes, certificated in any category: ␣ 1Models 1Serial numbers 35&hyph;33, 35&hyph;A33, 35&hyph;B33, 35&hyph;C33, E33, F33, and G33 CD&hyph;1 through CD&hyph;1304 35&hyph;C33A, E33A, and F33A CE&hyph;1 through CE&hyph;1192 E33C and F33C CJ&hyph;1 through CJ&hyph;179 H35, J35, K35, M35 N35, P35, S35, V35, V35A, and V35B D&hyph;4866 through D&hyph;10403 36 and A36 E&hyph;1 through E&hyph;2397 A36TC and B36TC EA&hyph;1 through EA&hyph;471 Compliance: Required initially upon the accumulation of 1,500 hours time-in-service (TIS) or within the next 100 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, unless already accomplished, and thereafter as indicated. To prevent spar carry-through structure failure, which could result in severe structural damage to the wing, accomplish the following: (a) Inspect the wing front spar carry-through frame (web) structure for cracks in accordance with the instructions in Beech Service Bulletin (SB) No. 2360, dated November 1990. (b) If cracks are found in the bend radius and not in the web face in the areas of the huckbolt fasteners during the inspection specified in paragraph (a) of this AD, accomplish the following at the time specified in accordance with the instructions in Beech SB No. 2360: (1) For cracks up to 2.25 inches, accomplish one of the following as applicable: (i) If not more than one crack on either side of the wing forward spar carry-through frame structure bend radius is found, prior to further flight, stop drill each crack at the crack ends. Within the next 200 hours TIS and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 200 hours TIS, reinspect each crack for progression and repair accordingly. Upon the installation of the applicable P/N 36&hyph;4004 Kit, the repetitive inspection time may be extended to 500 hours TIS. (ii) If more than one crack is found on either side of the wing forward spar carry-through frame structure bend radius, prior to further flight, install the applicable Beech P/N 36&hyph;4004 Kit, and reinspect thereafter at intervals not to exceed 500 hours TIS. (2) For cracks between 2.25 and 4.0 inches, accomplish one of the following as applicable: (i) If not more than one crack on either side of the wing forward spar carry-through frame structure bend radius is found, prior to further flight, stop drill each crack at the crack ends, and within the next 100 hours TIS, install the applicable Beech P/N 36&hyph;4004 Kit. Reinspect thereafter at intervals not to exceed 500 hours TIS.
