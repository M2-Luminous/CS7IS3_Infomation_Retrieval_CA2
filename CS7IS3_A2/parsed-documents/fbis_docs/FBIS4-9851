According to the report, which the government has not denied, Menem assured Kantor of two things: a) that the government has the "unanimous support of pro-government legislators," and b) that he expects to approve the bill "before mid-1994." Despite the president's optimism, the future of the bill does not seem very clear, if regarded from the viewpoint of Congress. Threats and "Advantages" In order to exert pressure for the passage of the patents law, Washington has recently resorted to two weapons: commercial sanctions, and exclusion from NAFTA. In Chile, a little more than two weeks ago, Kantor explained to Menem that if there is no news on the subject by 30 April our country will be included on the list of countries that do not protect intellectual property, something that will, fatally, entail serious sanctions. Ten days later, Argentine Ambassador to the United States Raul Granillo Ocampo informed LA PRENSA that the Menem administration has decided to promote a patents bill with features identical to those demanded by the United States, which is the only possibility for joining NAFTA. Even though Congress is not working because of the electoral campaign, the news has reached the Senate, in whose hands remains this bill whose approval Washington has awaited in vain for years. Yet the reaction of the few pro-government lawmakers who could be found did not seem favorable to the expectations of U.S. medicine manufacturers, despite the intense lobbying that top White House officials have been doing in their favor. Why? First, because the possibility of being included on the list of "sanctionable" countries has not caused too much concern. For example, Brazil was at one time included on the list, and was excluded when it signaled that it had began to look into the matter. On the other hand, most of Argentina's enormous commercial deficit comes from its trade with the United States. This means that in order to defend some hundreds of millions of dollars for its pharmaceutical industry, the Democratic administration will expose several billions to the risk of a bilateral short circuit. As for joining NAFTA, the situation is also complex. All legislators are aware that if the bill is approved the way it was submitted by the executive branch -- that is, the way Washington wants it -- a cash prize will be given to the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, without an immediate matching benefit for our country. In fact, becoming a member of NAFTA -- a common market made up of the United States, Canada, and Mexico -- might be possible only in the medium term. The Balance of Power Within the Government However, the reasons, arguments, rebuttals, and counter-arguments -- no matter how convincing -- have little weight at the time Congress makes decisions, when votes are the really important matter. And those votes, at least in the Peronist Party, are tied to a balance of power within the government, in which there are some who support the patents law and others who have so far successfully tried to delay it. Those who claim to know the events behind the scene at Casa Rosada make assurances that Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo belongs to the first group, while Presidential Secretary Eduardo Bauza is in the second. What is the lesson of this situation? That the majority want to delay the bill. There is tangible evidence. For a long period the bill was retained by the Commission of Industry in the Chamber of Deputies. When ex-Deputy Jorge Yoma took up the task of expediting the study of the bill, he had smooth relations with Terence Todman, then U.S. ambassador to Argentina. Whenever he was consulted off the record, Yoma predicted: "One of these days we will go to the Olivos residence with the congressional bloc leaders, Carlos will tell them `go ahead, boys,' and we will rapidly approve the bill." But this meeting never took place. Finally, one afternoon, at the Hall of Lost Steps in government house, Yoma confessed: "No, brother, I gave up the patents issue. No one paid any attention to me, and I went to see Bauza and I told him: "Please, fellow, do not send him (Todman) to me any more." Shortly afterward, Alberto Iribarne -- currently the deputy interior minister and at that time the chairman of the Commission of Industry -- had a surprise. The opposition was pushing a bill to abstain from debating on the patents law unless the United States and the European Economic Community [EEC] eliminate the agricultural subsidies that are harming Argentina. At the time of the vote, Iribarne was practically alone, because the Peronists supported the opposition initiative. Even the ultraliberal Federico Zamora agreed to put aside the unrestricted property rights issue, in the face of the need to defend the agricultural sector. The United States and the EEC never eliminated the subsidies. After this experience, the government submitted the bill to the Senate, where it was once again shelved. The Peronists put the subject in the hands of Radical Civic Union member Jose Genoud, and this made it clear that the executive branch was exerting no pressure to have the bill approved. The situation seems to have changed now, but nothing seems to indicate that the law will be approved the way the U.S. pharmaceutical industry wants it. On the contrary, based on the available signals, the text of the law might follow not the government model but the GATT agreement, a position that is supported by local laboratories but is rejected by foreign manufacturers.
