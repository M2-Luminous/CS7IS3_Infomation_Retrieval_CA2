Two leading Moscow newspapers, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA and NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, citing unidentified circles, reported that Chernomyrdin was about to resign for health reasons. In that case, First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets or former Russian Security Council Chairman Yuriy Skokov could succeed him. Chernomyrdin said in Germany, however, that he was in good health, and there were no indications that he might be weary of his position.
