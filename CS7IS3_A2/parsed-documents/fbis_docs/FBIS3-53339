The evidence, he said, can be found in Israel's continuing implementation of measures isolating Jerusalem from the rest of the occupied territories and its rejection of any demands for the reversal of these measures. The Israelis, he said, are still using the Palestinian detainees and deportees as hostages to blackmail the Palestinian side. The official, PLO Executive Committee Member Sulayman al-Najjab, who was talking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, said that, during the recent negotiations, the Israelis hinted that they were willing to release a new batch of detainees if the Palestinians accepted the recent Israeli proposals on supervision and control of the crossing points and bridges. On the results of the latest round of negotiations held by the liaison mission recently in Cairo, al-Najjab said: "That round did not achieve any tangible progress because the Israeli side retreated from its previous positions adopted in Paris and Tunis." [passage omitted] The Israeli Government, al-Najjab said, is now acting without regard or consideration for the Declaration of Principles and behaving as if that agreement did not exist. Al-Najjab stressed that the security issue, which the Israeli side uses as a pretext, insisting on the article in the agreement which gives it responsibility for external security, does not concern Israel alone, because it is a matter of mutual concern. He said that the Israeli side overlooks a fact which is linked to and not less important than the security issue, namely the stipulations in the Declaration of Principles agreement regarding the Palestinian right to control the parts of their homeland from which the Israeli Army withdraws and which, in the first stage, are the Gaza Strip and Jericho area. [passage omitted] Al-Najjab added: We cannot forfeit this acquired right because that would not only make the withdrawal meaningless but would also clearly set a ceiling for the entity which we aim to set up, making it just autonomy under full Israeli control with no prospect of development towards independence. [passage omitted] Al-Najjab called on the Arab and international parties concerned with the peace process and its success to take the necessary steps to make the Israelis change their position and respect the provisions of the Declaration of Principles agreement and its implementation dates. He affirmed that, in maintaining its intransigent position, Israel tries to exploit the poor coordination among the Arab parties participating in the peace process. [passage omitted] Al-Najjab urged the U.S. Administration to take firmer stands against Israeli policies and to take a more comprehensive view of the nature of the obstacles preventing progress in the negotiations instead of maintaining the current U.S. position which fully adopts the Israeli viewpoint. In conclusion, al-Najjab stressed that the Israeli position threatening to torpedo the negotiations should be a new incentive for the Palestinians to close their national ranks, eliminate all the loopholes that have emerged, and open the way for national dialogue on two fronts, the first being the front of the forces which support the agreement, and the aim here should be to enhance the Palestinian leadership's performance, develop the PLO's methods of work, and increase participation of representatives of all Palestinian groups and forces inside and outside the occupied territory in the current political process and in the process of national reconstruction. The second front, he said, is that of the Palestinian patriotic forces opposed to the agreement with whom dialogue should continue because the disagreement between the two fronts is about the means and not the aims.
