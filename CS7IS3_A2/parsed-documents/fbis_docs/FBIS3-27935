The most powerful candidate as his successor is believed to be 60-year-old Tadashi Tsuda, former administrative vice minister of Home Affairs and current chairman of the Association for Promoting Internationalization of Local Governments, several government sources said on 29 January. Ishihara took his post when former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita came to power in November 1987. Since then, he has been in office over six years and two months, making his term the longest one compared with those of successive chief cabinet secretaries. He once showed his intention to resign when the coalition cabinet was established. However, persuaded by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Ishikawa has decided to resign hopefully after the political reform bills are enacted. Strong candidate Tsuda joined the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1955 and served as the administrative vice minister from June 1989 to July 1990.
