Approximately 50 percent of the respondents consider the visit by the U.S. President to be an expression of appreciation for President Vaclav Havel. Approximately the same percentage of the respondents consider this event to be an important step that should lead to the strengthening of trade and economic relations between the Czech Republic and the United States.
