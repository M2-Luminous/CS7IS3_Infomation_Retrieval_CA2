He stressed that it is necessary to strictly ban driving up prices to collect commodities for export and ban underselling of goods. He noted that the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation has invited bidding for trading a dozen commodities for export. This practice has produced good results and proved to be useful in bringing forced price rises of commodities collected for export and underselling under control. It is imperative to sum up these experiences and to popularize the practice as soon as possible, the vice-premier said. He also stressed that effective measures should be taken to prevent the property of state-owned foreign trade enterprises from being drained off. Vice-Premier Li made these remarks during his April 29-May 3 survey tour of south China's Guangdong Province. During his stay in Guangdong, the vice-premier visited the 75th China Guangzhou Export Commodities Fair, Huangpu Customs, a free-trade zone, the new Zhuhai Airport and some state-owned enterprises. He made an all-round investigation into the implementation of some reform measures. He said that in order to build the basic framework of a socialist market economic system, the Chinese Central Government has taken a series of reform measures in the systems of finance and taxation, banking, modern enterprises, investment, foreign trade and foreign exchange. Judging by the situation in the first four months of this year, all the measures have fared well. He urged leaders at all levels to pay close attention to the issue of revitalizing large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. He also discussed ideas on revitalizing state-owned foreign trade enterprises with local officials and entrepreneurs. On the development of special economic zones in the future, the vice-premier said that they should follow international conventions to further improve their environment for investment and lay the emphasis on attracting investment from large multinationals. He stressed the necessity of constantly fighting against smuggling and the importance of running the free-trade zones well. He also brought special attention to education, saying that universities should try to find an effective method for arousing the enthusiasm of all circles and strengthening domestic and international cooperation to raise educational levels and train personnel suited to the development of a socialist market economy.
