Forum participants exchanged experiences in doing a good job of enterprise ideological and political work in the new period and discussed and studied the question of how to strengthen and improve enterprise ideological and political work while establishing a socialist market economic structure. During the forum, Yin Kesheng, secretary of the provincial party committee, and Wang Hanmin, Standing Committee member of the provincial party committee and vice governor, spoke. Yi Kesheng pointed out: Ideological and political work is our party's fine tradition. In carrying out the drive for reform and opening up to the outside world and developing the market economy, we should vigorously propagate the party's line, principles, and policies, enhance the consciousness of enterprise staff members and workers and their willingness to get involved in reform and working for development rather than relax our efforts or weakening ideological and political work in the slightest degree. At the same time, those doing ideological and political work should be good at summing up advanced ideas and deeds among the masses of people and give them wide publicity so that they will become powerful driving forces. In his speech, Wang Hanmin said: Current enterprise ideological and political work confronts new developments and problems. There have been complexity and liveliness in real work and ideological conceptions. Under these circumstances, party committees at all levels and enterprise leading comrades should have a full understanding of the urgency and arduousness of strengthening and improving ideological and political work at present. In practical work, on the one hand, they should develop the spirit of pressing forward in the face of difficulties and working with perseverance and unswervingly push reform ahead; on the other hand, they should foster a rigorous and ample scientific approach, promptly solve problems, and try their best to put an end to the situation in which those doing ideological and political work are lacking in initiative and overcautious and take an inactive and wait-and-see attitude. Party and government organizations, trade unions, and the Chinese Youth League organizations in enterprises should work together, heighten their fighting spirit, carry out enterprise ideological and political work in a down-to-earth manner, and contribute to the continuous deepening of reform, economic development, and social stability. Also present at the forum were Xiao Xiangcheng, member of the provincial party Standing Committee member; Wang Enke, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the provincial people congress; and Ma Tingxiao, vice chairman of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Tian Yuan, director of the provincial party committee's propaganda department, and department deputy director Luo Chengyuan also spoke at the forum.
