The plan shall describe the methods to be used to recruit within the provider community, and how it plans to describe the incentives and obligations (both financial and otherwise) for participation in the clearinghouse.

(iii) A fair housing counseling program to be given all prospective renters and homebuyers who use the clearinghouse's services to search for dwellings located within areas in which their race or ethnic group does not predominate and in areas where they would be otherwise least likely to apply for housing without special outreach activities due to factors pertaining to the racial or ethnic composition of the neighborhood. (iv) A goals statement on ensuring increased housing choice and causing deconcentration by race and income in different sections of the community. These goals may be stated in terms of achieving socio-economic changes, e.g. , in the racial/ethnic composition of particular neighborhoods or projects, or of getting individual homeseekers to feel that their housing options were increased by availing themselves of the services offered by the clearinghouse. The goals can also be stated in terms of bringing about changes in the attitudes and practices of financial institutions, real estate offices, apartment management companies and other entities that make decisions about their customers' housing choices. (v) Description of the structure of a consolidated areawide database for multifamily housing units offered by the clearinghouse's fair housing center.

The proposer shall also describe the mechanics of actual tenant selection, e.g. , selection by the fair housing center staff or by the individual apartment management company or landlord; the procedures to be used by the clearinghouse in processing applications from individual apartment seekers and the arrangements to be made with participating multifamily project managers with respect to referrals from the clearinghouse and the actual selection of tenants; (vi) Descriptions of activities appropriate to the single-family market, to be included by applicants who wish to emphasize marketing to the prospective home purchaser. Such activities may include: (A) Testing appropriate methods of involving local financial institutions under the aegis of the fair housing center in activities which will increase the sensitivity and awareness of such institutions and their professional staff about the impact of their lending and mortgage credit review practices upon properties and individuals located in lower-income and racially and ethnically impacted neighborhoods; (B) Testing new methods of marketing to nontraditional home purchasers, e.g. , low-income families, persons with disabilities, and first-time home purchasers who desire to increase their knowledge of the responsibilities of homeownership; (C) Testing a clearinghouse system geared toward referring prospective home purchasers to real estate professionals who will assist them in navigating the home purchase process. (3) A statement of work, a budget_which must include a realistic amount, not to exceed $2,000, in travel costs for financial management training sponsored by the Department_and a timeline for the implementation of the proposed activities, consisting of a description of the specific activities to be conducted with these funds, the geographic areas to be served by the activities, the cost of each proposed activity and a schedule for the implementation and completion of the activities.
