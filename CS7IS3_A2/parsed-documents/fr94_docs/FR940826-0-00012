FR940826-0-00012 FR940826-0-00006 7 CFR Part 982 [FV93&hyph;982&hyph;2FIR] Filberts/Hazelnuts Grown In Oregon and Washington; Establishment of Interim Final and Final Free and Restricted Percentages for the 1993&hyph;94 Marketing Year AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim final rule establishing interim final and final free and restricted percentages for domestic inshell filberts/hazelnuts for the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year under the Federal marketing order for filberts/hazelnuts grown in Oregon and Washington. The percentages allocate the amounts of domestically produced filberts/hazelnuts which may be marketed in domestic, export and other outlets. The percentages are intended to stabilize the supply of domestic inshell filberts/hazelnuts in order to meet the limited domestic demand for such filberts/hazelnuts and provide reasonable returns to producers. This rule was recommended by the Filbert/Hazelnut Marketing Board (Board), which is the agency responsible for local administration of the order. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Teresa Hutchinson, Marketing Specialist, Northwest Marketing Field Office, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, 1220 SW Third Ave., Room 369, Portland, OR 97204; telephone (503) 326&hyph;2724 or Mark A. Slupek, Marketing Specialist, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, Room 2524&hyph;S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; telephone: (202) 205&hyph;2830. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 982 [7 CFR Part 982], both as amended, regulating the handling of filberts/hazelnuts grown in Oregon and Washington. This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is intended that this action apply to all merchantable filberts/hazelnuts handled during the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.
