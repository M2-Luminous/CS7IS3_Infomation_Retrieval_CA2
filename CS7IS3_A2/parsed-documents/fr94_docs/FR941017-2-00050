FR941017-2-00050 FR941017-2-00033 Food and Drug Administration [Docket No. 94G&hyph;0313] Hercules Food and Functional Products Co.; Filing of Petition to Change Process Description and Food Grade Specifications for Pectin AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that Hercules Food and Functional Products Co. has filed a petition (GRASP 4G0411) proposing to change the current process description and food grade specifications for pectins. DATES: Written comments by December 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Blondell Anderson, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;207), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202&hyph;418&hyph;3106. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))) and the regulations for affirmation of GRAS status in §170.35 (21 CFR 170.35), notice is given that Hercules Food and Functional Products Co., 1313 North Market St., Wilmington, DE 19899&hyph;8740, has filed a petition (GRASP 4G0411) proposing to amend the current process description and food grade specifications for pectin under 21 CFR 184.1588(a) and (b). The present regulation incorporates by reference, Food Chemicals Codex, 3d Ed., 1981, p. 215. The petition requests a revision of the description of pectins to harmonize it with the current Codex Alimentarius and a Council Directive of the European Union. The petition also requests a revision of specifications consistent with the Food Chemicals Codex, 3d Supp. to the 3d Ed. A similar proposal has been submitted to the Food Chemicals Codex for consideration. The description and the specification would affirm the GRAS status of three additional types of pectin, namely, amidated high-methoxyl pectins; very low methoxyl pectins; and calcium salt of pectins. The petition has been placed on display at the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and it may be seen between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Any petition that meets the requirements outlined in §§170.30 (21 CFR 170.30) and 170.35 is filed by the agency. There is no prefiling review of the adequacy of data to support a GRAS conclusion. Thus, the filing of a petition for GRAS affirmation should not be interpreted as a preliminary indication of suitability for GRAS affirmation. The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. If the agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the Federal Register in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c). Interested persons may, on or before December 16, 1994, review the petition and/or file comments with the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comment should be filed and should be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Comments should include any available information that would be helpful in determining whether the proposed description and specification should be adopted for food grade pectin. In addition, consistent with the regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency encourages public participation by review of and comment on the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice. A copy of the petition (including the environmental assessment) and received comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Dated: October 4, 1994. Alan M. Rulis, Acting Director, Office of Premarket Approval, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.
