At the same time, 79 percent of those canvassed by OBOP think that Poland should try to get into NATO. Seven percent were against this idea, and 14 percent had no opinion on the matter. The poll was carried out from 4 to 6 February of this year, on a 1,015-person random nationwide sample of Poles over age 15. Fourteen percent of those polled firmly agreed with the view on "betrayal," and 27 percent "were inclined to agree." Nine percent of those polled firmly disagreed with this formula, and 27 percent "were inclined to disagree." Twenty-three percent of those polled had no opinion on the matter. In the opinion of 52 percent of those polled by OBOP, Poland is a sovereign country; according to a further 36 percent, it is not, and 12 percent of those polled had no opinion on the matter. According to OBOP, these results do not differ from a similar poll carried out in March of last year. Forty-two percent of those polled think that entry into NATO will happen in several years' time, and 23 percent in a dozen or so years. In the opinion of 6 percent of respondents, entry into NATO will happen inside a year or two; the same percentage stated that it would never happen. The youngest respondents were the most positive on the chances of rapid acceptance into NATO. Sixty-eight percent of respondents had heard of the "Partnership for Peace" program, and 31 percent of them expressed interest in the idea. Two-thirds of this group think that the partnership proposal will increase Poland's security, and one-quarter are of the opposite opinion.
