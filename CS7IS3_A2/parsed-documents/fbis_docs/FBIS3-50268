Almost 50 percent of respondents to a public opinion poll believe that the present government will stay in power for more than a year. Over the last two years, the number of people who support the idea of increasing the president's influence on the work of the government has decreased. Forty percent of respondents believe that the policy of the government offers a chance for overcoming the crisis, even though since November the number of optimists has decreased quite noticeably (by almost 15 percent). For the first time since the Pawlak government was formed, 37 percent of Poles are of the opinion that this government is neither better nor worse than the previous one; 34 percent believe it is better. This research study was conducted by the Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS] between 14 and 17 January with a representative sample of adult Poles.
