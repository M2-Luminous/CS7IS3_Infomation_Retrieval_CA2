"We express regret and concern over the IAEA inspection team confirming that North Korea has started replacing spent fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor on its own," Foreign Ministry Spokesman Chang Ki-ho said here. The DPRK notified the United States and the IAEA respectively earlier that it could no longer defer removal of the nuclear fuel rods from its reactor due to technical reasons. Chang said that the South Korean Government will await the results of negotiations between the DPRK and the IAEA, then discuss the necessary safety steps after refueling and consult closely with its allies on follow-up measures. "The government is paying heed to the IAEA announcement that there is still room for safety measures if North Korea stops withdrawing at this stage," he noted. The IAEA inspection team said that the DPRK is still in the early stage of replacing spent fuel rods. As the IAEA has proposed sending delegates to discuss safeguards needed in the refueling process for safety reasons, South Korea is asking the DPRK to abide by nuclear safeguards after immediate talks with the IAEA, Chang said. Meanwhile, South Korea decided Friday to consider asking the United Nations Security Council to take additional action if the DPRK rejects the IAEA's proposal to suspend the changing of fuel rods at its reactor and permit complete inspection. The decision was made at a unification and security policy coordination meeting attended by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and national unification board minister, and other related ministers.
