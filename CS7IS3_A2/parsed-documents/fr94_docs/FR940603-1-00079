The Contractor further agrees to prosecute diligently and to complete clearing in strict accordance with the Specifications and Drawings within XXXX ( XXXX ) calendar days (excluding Sundays) after Commencement Date. (b) The time for Completion of Clearing shall be extended for the period of any reasonable delay which is due exclusively to causes beyond the control and without the fault of the Contractor, including acts of God, fires, floods, inability to obtain materials and acts or omissions of the Owner with respect to matters for which the Owner is solely responsible: Provided, however, that no such extension of time for completion shall be granted the Contractor unless within ten (10) days after the happening of any event relied upon by the Contractor for such an extension of time the Contractor shall have made a request therefor in writing to the Owner, and provided further that no delay in such time of completion or in the progress of the work which results from any of the above causes except acts or omissions of the Owner, shall result in any liability on the part of the Owner. (c) The sequence of construction shall be as set forth below, the numbers or names being the designations of extensions or areas (hereinafter called the ``Sections'') corresponding to the numbers or names shown on the maps attached hereto, or if no Sections are set forth below, the sequence of construction shall be as determined by the Contractor subject to the approval of the Owner. (d) The Owner may from time to time during the progress of the work on the Project make such changes in, additions to or subtractions from the Specifications, Drawings and sequence of work provided for in the previous paragraph which are part of the Contractor's Proposal as conditions may warrant: Provided, however, that if any change in the work to be done shall require an extension of time, a reasonable extension will be granted if the Contractor shall make a written request therefor to the Owner within ten (10) days after any such change is made. And provided further, that if the cost to the Contractor of completion of the Project shall be materially increased by any such change or addition, the Owner shall pay the Contractor for the reasonable cost thereof in accordance with a Contract Amendment signed by the Owner and the Contractor, but no claim for additional compensation for any such change or addition will be considered unless the Contractor shall have made a written request therefor to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such change or addition. (e) The Contractor will not perform any work hereunder on Sundays unless there is urgent need for such Sunday work and the Owner consents thereto in writing. The time for completion specified in subsection (a) of this Section 1 shall not be affected in any way by inclusion of this subsection by the Owner's consent or lack of consent to Sunday work hereunder.

(b) The Owner reserves the right to require the removal from the Project of any employee of the Contractor if in the judgment of the Owner such removal shall be necessary in order to protect the interest of the Owner. The Owner shall have the right to require the Contractor to increase the number of its employees and to increase or change the amount or kind of tools and equipment if at any time the progress of the work shall be unsatisfactory to the Owner; but the failure of the Owner to give any such directions shall not relieve the Contractor of its obligations to complete the work within the time and in the manner specified in this Proposal. (c) The manner of performance of the work, and all equipment used therein, shall be subject to the inspection and approval of the Owner. The Owner shall have the right to inspect all payrolls and other data and records of the Contractor relevant to the work.

The Contractor shall have an authorized agent accompany the inspector when final inspection is made and, if requested by the Owner, when any other inspection is made.
