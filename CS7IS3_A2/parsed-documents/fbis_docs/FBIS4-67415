Yesterday, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with multilateral financial institutions (MFIs) and the Land Bank of the Philippines for the launching of a phaseout program for Ozone Depleting Substances. Under the MOA, MFIs like the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank are to provide funds to local appliance manufacturers for a shift from the use of ozone depleting substances to non-ozone depleting substances. Manufacturers concerned are those producing refrigerators and air conditioners that use CFCs such as freon and fire extinguishers that use halon. The MFl grant amounting to some $7 million will be loaned to the private sector via the Land Bank. In his speech at the signing of the MOA, President Ramos stressed his government "has always stood firm in giving top priority to the improvement of the environment," even as he urged Congress to consider as priority measures those concerning environmental protection.
