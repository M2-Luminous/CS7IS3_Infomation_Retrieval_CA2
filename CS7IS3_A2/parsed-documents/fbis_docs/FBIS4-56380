In his now classic column in LA PRENSA, Javier Gonzalez Fraga stated last Sunday that the future opposition to capitalism would no longer renounce its economic principles, but would try to criticize it from the inside, in effect acknowledging its economic success. The alternative presented by the Argentine left, on the other hand, was based on a virtual replacement of private activity by the state, although it maintained the notion of private property. The choice was clear: capitalism or socialism. The economy would function on the basis, not of the free market, but state planning. Terms such as privatization, deregulation, liberalization, strong currency, and competition were not in the left's vocabulary. On the international level, they identified with the democratic socialist movements that were implementing planning policies. The Weimar Republic in Germany, the first Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in Mexico, which reformed its country's constitution, the postwar British Labour Party, and Salvador Allende's government in Chile could be considered valid points of reference. At present, the state vs. market debate appears to be dominated by capitalism, insofar as it has recovered academically and has triumphed in the sphere of economic policy. Governments are no longer advocating more state and less market, but instead are trying to expand the market. And the governments labeled socialist are also participating in this era, applying capitalist models. The question, then, is this: Where do leftists in our country fit into all these changes? Inside and Outside In theory, it could be said that there are two successful political movements of the left (and the elections this Sunday will serve as a measure of how representative they are): the Grand Front (FG) and Socialist Unity. Their economic proposals are marked by criticism of the capitalism of President Carlos Menem's government. Both maintain that the Cavallo Plan does not have social measures to protect the most defenseless segments of society. "It is for the benefit of a few," agree Alfredo Bravo and Carlos Alvarez. When asked by LA PRENSA if there are indeed fresh winds blowing in the left and if Felipe Gonzalez is an example of that, the first convention candidates almost agree. "Each situation must be considered separately," says Bravo. "Spain is not the same as Argentina. It is impossible to imagine Spain outside of the European Community, so Gonzalez has been forced to accept some economic freedoms that I would not accept." "Chacho" Alvarez, on the other hand, contends that "although the countries' circumstances are different, I should point out that Felipe Gonzalez's social democracy has failed to achieve a society without poverty." A comparative analysis reveals that the Grand Front's economic proposal differs from that announced by Socialist Unity. The latter's representatives stated at the outset of our dialogue that if they were in power, they would review all privatizations, and they would not under any circumstances accept the current market economy. The Grand Front is not so radical: "We have not yet defined an alternative economic program," says "Chacho" Alvarez, "however, we believe that stability is one of the government's great achievements. If we were called upon to run the government, we would maintain it. We also think that economic activity should be assigned a very significant role in the economy. We favor economic policies that view the market as a complement to the state. For example, in the case of the economic liberalization, Argentina should gain competitiveness to export more goods." Each of them appears to have different cricitisms. While the socialists under Bravo's leadership criticize capitalism from the outside, the Grand Front prefers to do so from the inside. In this regard, there is one fact that "Chacho" Alvarez may perhaps have realized, and that is that to win elections, it is necessary to move toward the center, and especially toward what society thinks. Today, Argentine society is imbued with the ideas of economic stability based on price freedom. In short, neither of the two lefts will defend free-market economics, and both advocate policies for employment, housing, business-labor-government coordination, nationalizations, and market control, plus broad social policies aimed at promoting the most backward sectors. They differ, however, on how much state intervention there should be. This proves that the triumph of capitalism has left different impressions on the Argentine left, and that its leaders have not reacted in the same ways. [Box, p 10] Anibal Ibarra: "The State Is Not a Corporation" Grand Front Councilman Anibal Ibarra believes that his party is in the center-left. "We do not identify with any international model, however," he told LA PRENSA. "In general, we aspire to achieve monetary stability, but with a state presence in the economy, complemented by the private sector," the councilman concluded. With respect to the privatizations, Ibarra favors them, but with limitations: "We want to privatize only those areas that are not so economically and strategically important that they affect the control of the national government." When asked what those sectors might be, he responded that hydrocarbons, telecommunications, and air traffic should not be privatized. He also maintains that the state cannot be run as if it were a big company that must yield profits. "The state is not a corporation that is merely interested in the bottom line. There are social gains that cannot be assigned monetary value." "If we were in office, we would administer public resources by spending money on clothing for children rather than compact discs," concluded Anibal Ibarra cheerfully. [Box, p 10] Norberto Laporta: "Stop the Neoliberal Advance" "There is a new left that must try to stop the neoliberal advance. Our thinking is in accord with the position of Michel Rocard in France, who contends that although socialism has changed, it should not borrow principles from neoliberalism." This was the opening salvo in LA PRENSA's dialogue with Norberto Laporta, Buenos Aires city councilman for Socialist Unity. As for the national situation, the second convention candidate of that same party argues that the privatization process was handled wrong. "The government sold the state for a song," explains Laporta. The councilman also outlined his position on social issues: "The government's neoliberalism amounts to the repeal of the workers' conquests, given that capital-labor relations continue to be exploitative. The current government's capitalism is Manchesterian in nature." Laporta believes there are three economic spheres: public, private, and mixed. "The public sector includes strategic economic activities such as public services, petroleum, and the airlines. In the mixed sector there are initiatives that are important for the economy, but they are not of the caliber of the first group. And finally, the strictly private sphere encompasses the rest of the economy," explained Laporta. [Box, p 10] Carlos Alvarez: "The Stability Is Undeniable" The creator of the Grand Front says that after the elections (today), he will get to work on an economic program for governing, first the federal capital, and then the country. Speaking about the economy for the first time, Alvarez outlined his party's future economic proposal: "We are going to maintain stability, although we will add social measures to it; we will not reverse the privatizations, and the opening up of trade will be accompanied by a policy of complementarity between the state and the market." [Bruno] How do you define the Grand Front? [Alvarez] The Grand Front occupies the center-left portion of the political spectrum. I define it as an open political alternative that is recovering values currently being lost in Argentina. I do not know if proposing the modernization of the economy with the inclusion of social programs means being to the left of the government. We do indeed contend that Argentina needs to be more equitable and more balanced. [Bruno] Do you identify with any socialist movement in Europe? [Alvarez] I think there is a crisis of paradigms. Marxism has failed. The authoritarian socialisms collapsed. Social democracy has failed to achieve more equitable societies, and there is also a failure of the idea of market fundamentalism, the corollary of which is the rise of racism and xenophobia. Our challenge is to construct a new paradigm, and there is no reason why it should resemble any of the options that are dominating the international scene. [Bruno] If you were in charge of the public administration, what model would you promote? [Alvarez] In principle, it is difficult for us to place ourselves in different situations. Today we are expressing Argentine society's demand for a political force that can be effective when it comes time to control the excesses and abuses of power. I should point out, however, that we must draw up an alternative economic program for after the constitutional convention elections. Our growth is based on gradualism. First we must institutionalize the political strength of the Grand Front. [Bruno] In that connection, what truth is there to the rumors that you are working on a minicabinet for an eventual mayoral candidacy? [Alvarez] I am not married to any candidacy. I do want to be a part of a political movement that will provide an alternative for government. In that regard, we have been up front with the socialists, proposing that they head the list in these elections. We are going to work on the issues that are important to the city, however, because people will not vote for us to govern the country if we cannot first show that we can run a local government efficiently. [Bruno] But they will not vote for you to run the city, either, unless you tell them what you are going to do ahead of time.... [Alvarez] That is right. We must present a clear alternative for administration and government, and at the same time prove that corruption is not a matter of a few scattered officials lining their pockets fortuitously. Corruption is systemic, structural, and it is affecting services that are essential for improving our quality of life. For example, the most pessimistic estimates peg this dirty money at $4 billion a year. [Bruno] One indication of the Grand Front's economic policy is its assertions that stability is an accomplishment that it intends to maintain. [Alvarez] It would be crass of us to deny that there is stability. Nevertheless, we believe that although the stability is an incontrovertible fact that is beneficial for society, we must bring to the fore the issues that it cannot resolve by itself. [Bruno] Do you believe in privatization? [Alvarez] I believe that we must look at each privatization individually. It is an instrument that we cannot ignore. I think that there is no Cavallo model. There are instruments. So we will analyze each instrument, one by one. With regard to the privatization instrument, we have no ideological prejudices that cause us to oppose it. But we still must analyze each privatization, one by one. For example, we believe that the privatization of the airline was very badly handled, because we ended up with a single flag airline in foreign hands. We know, however, that we will not have a chance to review it, although we would like to discuss its efficiency, the quality of service, and the rate structure. In short, we agree with the way some of the privatizations were carried out and not with others. We also do not think it prehistoric to question whether the state could have run a profitable company effectively, as is the case in other countries in the world. [Bruno] What about the economic liberalization? [Alvarez] The external liberalization is aimed at improving the competitiveness of the Argentine economy. We can propose another liberalization model that looks at how the most advanced countries in the world set up industries so that they can be competitive and gain a market position that they do not now have. The idea is to find an economic design with complementary roles for the state and the private sectors, in which the state provides orientation and infrastructure and seeks out competitive niches. If we leave everything up to the spontaneous development of the market, Argentina may end up without any production of high-value-added goods. I do not see anything wrong with the state helping private industry. [Bruno] Could the government of Patricio Aylwin be a reflection of your policies? [Alvarez] The Chilean model was phased in gradually. First they achieved economic efficiency, although with a much less dogmatic vision. For example, they have the Chile Foundation, which helps small and medium-sized companies become competitive in the world. But I think there was also some neglect of the sectors that remained on the sidelines, excluded from the ideological reconversion. In this regard, it seems to me that Argentina would not have to wait for a new government to become aware of this situation. [Box, p 10] Alfredo Bravo: "We Would Review all Privatizations" In a tone sharply critical of the government's economic policy, Deputy Alfredo Bravo of Socialist Unity told LA PRENSA that this plan ignores the individual. "It takes into account only concepts like efficiency, surpluses, and competition." When asked about the socialist movement in the world, and specifically about Felipe Gonzalez's economic policy, the deputy responded that socialism has not changed. "To determine whether there have been political mutations, we must place ourselves in the situation of each country. For example, Felipe Gonzalez was forced to introduce economic freedoms in Spain that I would not accept. But he had to do it, since it was a prerequisite for joining the European Economic Community." [Bruno] How would you sum up the socialist program? [Bravo] First of all, we believe that the dogmatic part of the Constitution should be amended. We advocate the recognition of the rights of workers, children, women, and the elderly. In the educational sphere, our program calls for free education as a constitutional right. If the spirit of the Constitution of 1853 was liberal and that of the Reform of 1949 was social, the spirit of our program is socialist. On the worker's side. Furthermore, it is obvious that there are some concepts that were impossible to get through in 1853, such as democracy and social rights. Our reform program is to the left of the government and of the Radical Civic Union (UCR). We socialists have always occupied that position on the political and economic spectrum in Argentina. [Bruno] Is there a new concept of socialism in the world? [Bravo] It is not that socialism has changed, but it has adapted to the specific situations present in each country. The circumstances of Felipe Gonzalez's government in Spain are different from those of the socialist movements in Latin America. It is impossible to imagine Spain outside of the European Community. And joining the European Community has necessitated the acceptance of economic freedoms that I would never accept. [Bruno] Where do you stand on the old "state vs. market" debate? [Bravo] I think that the state should regulate the economy. In an effort to give priority to social issues, I think it is necessary for it to intervene in economic activity by monitoring private companies and promoting worker participation. I favor direct productive activity by the state. [Bruno] What is your opinion of the Cavallo Plan? [Bravo] The Cavallo Plan is devoid of social content. We think it is a program that considers only efficiency, surpluses, and competition, and ignores the most important issue, the individual. If we were in power, we would carry out social measures, and we would review all privatizations. The roots of the socialist movement are Marxist. Nevertheless, this does not mean that we would adopt all the precepts of Marxism, or that we are Marxists. For example, it was Alfredo Palacios who did the Spanish translation of "Das Kapital" that was used to train many socialist leaders.
