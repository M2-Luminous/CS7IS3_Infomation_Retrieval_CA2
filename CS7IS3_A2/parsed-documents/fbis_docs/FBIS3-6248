He said: As already reported, four immediate steps of simultaneous action for a package solution of the nuclear issue were agreed upon at the DPRK-USA contact in New York on February 25. The contents of the agreed conclusions are suspension of "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises, resumption of working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys between North and South of Korea, inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure continuity of safeguards and the holding of the third round of DPRK-USA talks in Geneva on March 21. The agreement is strictly based on the principle that the DPRK and the United States must simultaneously do what they are obliged to. After the publication of the agreed conclusions we have completely fulfilled our obligations with regard to the steps of simultaneous action. We have accepted inspection of the seven declared sites enough for the continuity of safeguards within the time agreed upon with the IAEA, and unilaterally taken a broad-minded and magnanimous position at the inter-Korean working-level contact, thus opening a firm prospect for the exchange of presidential envoys. But the United States has not fulfilled its obligation concerning the steps of simultaneous action. When the United States announced it would suspend the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers in 1994, it raised unreasonable preconditions--satisfactory inspection by the IAEA and realisation of the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and South of Korea. Even now when the inspection by the IAEA for the continuity of safeguards has ended and several rounds of inter-Korean working-level contact have taken place, the United States persistently insists on the preconditions, saying that the inspection by the IAEA is not satisfactory and the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and South must be realised. The IAEA itself recognizes that the recent inspection was carried out on the basis of full discussion between its inspectors' group and the operators of the DPRK's nuclear facilities and that the problems raised during the inspection were smoothly resolved under the agreement of the IAEA. As for the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and South, it is on the verge of realisation, far more progressive than is signified in the agreement of the New York contact between the DPRK and the United States, though the agreement provides only for resumption of working-level contact. Nevertheless, the United States has insisted on unreasonable preconditions. It is unjustifiable in every respect. It is patently contrary to the agreed conclusions reached at the New York contact between the DPRK and the United States that the United States has raised as a precondition of the talks the realisation of the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South, which is not included in the conclusions. If the United States persistently imposes unreasonable preconditions on the DPRK, while failing to discharge its obligation concerning the steps of simultaneous action, we cannot but refrain from taking an action unilaterally. It is clarified in the conclusions that it is necessary for the implementation of the conclusions to carry into practice every step of simultaneous action. So, if the U.S. side failed to discharge its obligation, the conclusions would become invalid automatically. We already stated at the New York contact that if the United States failed to fulfill its obligation, we will consider the DPRK-U.S. talks to have been foiled and take appropriate steps. The future developments depend on the U.S. attitude.
