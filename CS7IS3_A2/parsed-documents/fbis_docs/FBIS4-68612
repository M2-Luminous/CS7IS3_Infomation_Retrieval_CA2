Likhachev" (AMO ZIL) has demanded that the president and the government "find an opportunity" for financing the enterprise annually (up to 1998); otherwise the enterprise faces the threat of "a social explosion." The question of financial support for the privatized enterprise is to be examined today at a meeting of the government's Committee on Strategic Matters under the chairmanship of First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets. It is clear that concession to pressure from the ZIL administration will be a signal for a frontal assault on the budget by those directors who are not prepared to accept the market rules of the game. The AMO ZIL (about 3 billion rubles [R] of charter capital), which manufactures trucks, as well as refrigerators and microwave ovens, was privatized in accordance with the first version of benefits, as a result of which 40 percent of its shares were acquired by the enterprise's employees (25 percent of them are preferred shares). After the checking privatization, the largest blocks of stock (about 20 percent of each) were concentrated in the ZIL administration and the "Mikrodin" Trading Firm. A block of similar size was reserved for investments and is under the jurisdiction of the privatization organs. According to Vladimir Nosov, the ZIL chief engineer, the plant assembles 180 trucks per day at a price of about R14 million each, and it needs state support so much that the enterprise's managers "stand watch at the telephone so that they do not miss a call from the government." At the same time, Yevgeniy Brakov, the "president and general director," personally is looking over the lists of those invited to the stockholders meeting which opens today in Luzhniki (the AMO ZIL has about 180,000 stockholders); a call from the government and the stockholders meeting may bring a fundamental change to the ZIL director's position. The productivity of the enterprise's principal output has dropped by 80 percent over the year and the number of industrial personnel has been cut back by 14,000 (about 15 percent of those employed). Brakov himself links the slump with "the government's poorly planned domestic policy." It follows from this that President Boris Yeltsin and First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets are in debt to the ZIL. Letters of ultimatum are being sent regularly to the Kremlin and the White House (Soskovets received the last one on 18 April) with the demand that "funds be found" to add to ZIL's working capital and for budgetary financing of its investment programs (over R100 billion annually up to 1998). In addition, Brakov is insisting on tax holidays for the enterprise, as well as the introduction of a favorable investment exchange rate for the ruble against foreign currencies to pay for contracts. At the same time, the ZIL board of directors is not concealing the fact that the enterprise already has "a large debt to the budget and nonbudget funds" (from his February letter to President Yeltsin). However, the main obstacle to further subsidized financing of the enterprise by the state, in the opinion of the enterprise management, is "the connivance" of vice premiers Aleksandr Shokhin and Anatoliy Chubays "to abolish the domestic automotive industry and open a market for imported equipment" (from Brakov's April letter to Soskovets). Indeed, in Chubays' department, which oversees the management of state proportions in the privatized sector of industry, they do not consider the ZIL claims to be justified, since they consider the reason for the crisis at the enterprise to be primarily "the inability of the enterprise's managers, who are accustomed to working 'under the government's tutelage,' to adapt to market conditions." In particular, Alfred Kokh, deputy chairman of the GKI [State Committee on the Administration of State Property], reported that the enterprise's capacities are designed for 200,000 trucks. In his words, however, the management "deliberately cut back" output to 34,000 vehicles, since it was "not in a position to restructure the system of product sales based on such a large batch of trucks (no less than 100 units)." The GKI believes it is precisely the enterprise management's policy which is adding to the unemployment. In this connection, the GKI plan for the ZIL's financial normalization is based on utilization of the enterprise's internal reserves and retention of the existing ownership structure. This differs not only from the plant management's proposals, which are totally oriented toward state support, but the plan of Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, who is demanding 20 percent of the enterprise's stock in exchange for helping it. Basic Proposals for Financial Normalization of the ZIL: --Pesident and General Director Yevgeniy Brakov: to provide for budget financing of the enterprise's investment programs until 1999 and to introduce tax holidays for the ZIL, as well as a favorable exchange rate against foreign currencies to pay for contracts --The State Committee on the Administration of State Property: to introduce outside management of the enterprise, to add to its working capital through the sale of administration buildings (the plant management, in particular), and to form a dealer network --Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov: to lease land to the ZIL for 49 years for mortgage operations in exchange for 20 percent of the enterprise's stock; to defer payment to the city budget until the end of 1994 (about R63 billion).
