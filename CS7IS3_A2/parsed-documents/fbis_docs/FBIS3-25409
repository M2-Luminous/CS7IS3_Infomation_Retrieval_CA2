He warns that disaster awaits South Africa if the wretched election is not called off. The so-called "mother of all elections in South Africa," which, due to an overwhelmingly euphoric reason, has to take place in an attempt to come out of apartheid, will destroy South Africa if it is not called off, Kleynhans said. All indications are that less than 50 percent of the alleged 22 million voters will vote in this election. The NP [National Party], IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], ANC [African National Congress], and the SACP [South African Communist Party] are, according to their own admissions, generally unprepared for the election. The Conservative Party is on record as saying that it will not take part in the damned election, while the patriotic sector of the Afrikaner/Boer nation unanimously rejected on 29 January any participation in the election. The Zulus and the Tswanas are determined they are not going to vote. The parties keen on participation have already proved that they could never -- within three months -- be able to educate the 9 million illiterate voters and the 17 million voters who have never voted before. Besides, they will not even be able to reach all the new voters. Victimization De Klerk said his target is at least 3 million black voters. To date he cannot in any way rely on any black voters, because as soon as the communists come forward with full scale victimization -- as has in the past been done without exception in every African country -- de Klerk will probably not even get a single black vote. The ANC has held several mass meetings, but has as yet not reached the millions of rural blacks through those meetings. The overwhelming majority of potential black voters still have to be "taught" to go to the polling booths. At this stage, rural blacks have no election machinery that encourages and organizes them to vote. The mother of all elections must take place because of a euphoric consideration to leave apartheid behind, but without the very important prior education of the illiterate portion -- namely, 9 million members -- of the voters' corps. The chances are already 100 percent that the percentage of people voting will be very low, and this will affect the credibility aspect of the election. I anticipate the result to be so bad that it will shock the entire world. At the same time the black voters will be so shocked by the election results that they will most probably veer away permanently from the elected government and rather resort -- like elsewhere in Africa -- to anarchy to achieve their objectives. Voter Education Fails All so-called "voter education" [preceding two words in English] programs have so far been entirely unsuccessful in improving the political knowledge of the nine million illiterates. In any case, this education does not bring over a single convincing message to the millions of blacks which will satisfy what they are striving for. Call Off Election De Klerk's only logical step, which he can still take in the midst of the prevailing anarchy, is to call off the election, otherwise CHAOS will be the result of the election and not peace as has been promised. Unprepared The NP is currently further from preparedness than a year ago. Wherever de Klerk goes, ANC supporters turn the meetings into chaotic gatherings. In his quest to please voters, de Klerk has chased away the NP's white supporters or he has made them lose interest. The days when tens of thousands of volunteers helped to campaign for the NP are no more. The NP's best chance to recruit blacks is in the rural areas where the ANC is not making an impact. De Klerk has invited foreign observers to South Africa to show them how he is phasing out apartheid. They must see for themselves "how a miracle is being achieved in a general election in South Africa." [passage in quotes published in English] The outside world has been invited to be spectators of the big farce of an election. If the election is not called off, de Klerk will learn the hard way how stupid he was to try and force 17 million voters, who have no idea what elections are about, into a unitary election. Disaster Of course it will spell disaster for de Klerk and company to cancel the election. But it will bring a greater disaster to them if they go ahead with the election. Because for the blacks, who are supposed to benefit from the election, the latter will bring unprecedented misery, Kleynhans said.
