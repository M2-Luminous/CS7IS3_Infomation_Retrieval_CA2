FBIS4-13165 "drnes074_l_94010" FBIS-NES-94-074 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Rabin Interviewed on Settlement Policy Rabin Interviewed on Settlement Policy TA1504143294 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1505 GMT 13 Apr 94 TA1504143294 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Karmit Gay, Sheli Yehimovich, and Shlomo Raz on 13 April; place not given -- recorded] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Yehimovich] The Jewish settlers were once favored by the government, even when your party was in power before. Now they have been somehow pushed into a corner. Naturally, they are not all made of one skin. They are not all Barukh Goldstein. Many of them have a different world view. Do you intend at any stage to resume a dialogue with them, to hold a closer and more frequent dialogue with them? [Rabin] In a democratic state, it is legitimate to support or oppose the government policies. Staging legal demonstrations is legitimate. It is not legitimate to make threats or issue warnings about use of force. It is certainly not legitimate to issue halakic decrees urging soldiers to disobey orders. To me, this is most grave. It is inconceivable to call on soldiers of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] -- which, as the military, is subject to the democratically and legally elected government which issues legitimate orders -- to disobey an order. Had we accepted the principle that anyone may decide for himself what is right and what is not -- whether he is a rabbi or a public figure -- hundreds and thousands of soldiers would have refused to serve in Lebanon and hundreds, if not thousands, would have refused to serve in the territories. I believe the Jewish nation has a right to settle in Eretz Yisra'el, but according to a concept. When I was prime minister between 1974 and 1977, I prevented the establishment of a Jewish quarter in Hebron. I believed it to be a mistake. This is what Qiryat Arba' is for. I opposed setting up Jewish settlements in areas densely populated by Palestinians. I agreed to the establishment of settlements in the 'Etzyon Bloc, in Qiryat Arba', in the Jordan Rift Valley, and on the outskirts of Netanya, such as Alfe Menashe and Elqana. I never wanted settlement in the heart of the Palestinian population in Judaea and Samaria, between Ramallah and Nabulus. Jewish history mentions Nabulus but, for example, Ashqelon, Qiryat Gat, and Ashdod are situated on historical Philistine land. Today, they are rightfully part of the State of Israel. I do not suggest that we view the Bible as the book of maps of the Jewish state. To me, the Bible is the book of religion, real values, real codes, tradition, and the history of the Jewish nation. This is how I studied it, and not as the book of the precise maps of the Jewish state. [passage omitted] [Raz] Does the way the settlements are spread out not make it very difficult for the current government to make decisions regarding the future of the West Bank? [Rabin] This is the reason we chose the path we did. The path started at Camp David, with the idea of autonomy for the Palestinians, and continued in the negotiations at the Madrid conference, where the word autonomy was erased, not by us, but by the Arab side at the very beginning of the negotiations that led to the convention of the Madrid Conference. The word autonomy does not feature in any of the papers that accompanied the letter of invitation to the Madrid Conference. The word autonomy does not appear in any paper presented by Israeli Governments -- and I stress governments in the plural -- during the negotiating process. It was replaced by Self-Government Arrangements for the Palestinians. This is what we are dealing with. I believe our approach is correct. I know there is a serious problem. We must change the reality on the ground before we approach the issue of the permanent solution. I believe that the reality of settlements located in areas densely populated by the Palestinians -- and I am not referring to Greater Jerusalem, the 'Etzyon Bloc, or the Jordan Rift Valley -- the reality in which settlements are spread out among such a dense population does place a burden on the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], which must provide them with security. If I take the size of the force currently situated in Hebron.... [pauses] This is no simple matter. Nonetheless, it is our duty to defend all the Jewish settlements. This is also in accordance with the Declaration of Principles for the interim period. We have reached an agreement with the PLO that the Jewish settlements will remain in place, and we.... [Gay, interrupting] But there is a settlement in the heart of Hebron which you personally said is a mistake.... [Rabin, interrupting] I opposed it, but now it exists. I have said this before, and I am willing to repeat: Given a militarily strong Israel, I would not want to remove a settlement for security reasons, but I am willing to remove settlements for peace. There is a precedent. In order to achieve peace with Egypt, we not only returned everything we had conquered from Egypt in the Six-Day War, down to the very last inch of sovereign Egyptian soil, but we also uprooted every sign of Israeli presence in the Sinai: the entire area of the Rafah enclave, Yamit, Ofira, and so on. The precedent of the price of peace was determined, to a large extent, when we made peace with Egypt. We hope to change it. Again, given our military might and even if the price is a painful one, I say yes to evacuating settlements for peace and no to evacuating for security reasons. [passage omitted]
