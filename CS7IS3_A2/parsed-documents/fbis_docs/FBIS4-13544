You are very welcome, my dear brothers and sisters, servants of the nation. May almighty God accept your services for the hajj, which is one of the most important obligations for Muslims. May God assist you and bless you for your efforts and enable you to perform and revive your great and lofty obligation. I deem it my duty to thank all those working for the hajj affairs, particularly those who spend hours of their time throughout the year to ensure that this religious obligation is performed properly. [passage omitted] The obligation to perform the hajj is truly a unique obligation. There is no other obligation similar to the hajj among all the Islamic instructions. It is particularly important. Its spiritual aspects are highly significant. [passage omitted]. The worldly aspects of the hajj are also unique. That is, it is an obligation not confined to an individual or a nation. It covers the entire Islamic world. Almighty God has chosen a period and has invited everyone to meet in one place during this period. These are the days of [exchanging] knowledge. It would have been possible to invite everyone to gather at this place [on various occasions] throughout the year. But almighty God has a purpose in inviting everyone to come to a particular place for a few days each year. This is the basic and important point. It is obvious that God's objective is to enable Muslim individuals to meet each other and to feel united. That is, the feeling of togetherness, the magnificent feeling of seeing a gathering made up of various nations and races. If God had not had such a feeling in mind, there would have been no need to assign a few days every year for hajj rituals. Well, what is the objective when every nation of the Islamic world dispatches some of their people to a particular place on a particular day to meet one another? The answer should be clear to every Muslim who knows the meaning of Koranic and Islamic concepts. Imam Sadeq [the sixth Shi'a imam], peace be upon him, has said: What you want to know is in God's book. Almighty God invites a congregation comprising all Muslim nations to gather during this period. "Then pass on at a quick pace from the place, whence it is usual for the multitude" [Koranic verse] That is: Move together, come out together, and perform your rituals together. What is the objective of this gathering? Why should the Muslim people of the world come together? Is the objective just to come together, to stare silently at one another, and then to return home? So why should they gather in one place? Is the objective to gather round and resolve their disputes? What! In such a gathering? The close concentration of all Muslim nations in one place, and a holy place too, pursues only one objective and can only have a single meaning; and that is: They are asked to gather round to take a positive step on the fate of the Islamic ummah. That is, to do a job. The job will be different when the Islamic nations develop. We hope such a day will come. On such a day, the elected members of these nations will convene at a big majles comprising several thousand people, in that place [Mecca] to pass a resolution. The articles of such a resolution will then be ratified by the pilgrims, representing various states. The resolution will then be communicated to the governments and the nations. This would be the best alternative. Unfortunately, this is not practical today, because the nations have not made sufficient progress in this field yet and the governments are not assisting them either. What is the essential task there in Mecca as long as there is no possibility of taking practical decisions during the hajj rituals? The essential task of the nations is to show their concern regarding the problems of the Islamic world in whatever way they can, to stress their unity, and to show their disavowal of the enemies of the Islamic world. This is the least one can expect and can perform in hajj rituals as determined by Islam. We have not brought the disavowal [part of the rituals] from outside to incorporate it into the hajj rituals. This is part of the hajj rituals, this is the soul of the hajj rituals, and it is the true meaning of this immense gathering. Some individuals enjoy saying repeatedly, in their press, in their comments, and when they wish to sting us, that we have politicized the hajj rituals. What does it mean, politicizing the hajj? If it means that we have incorporated a political concept into the hajj rituals, the answer is that for those who fail to see this political concept of hajj, we pray that God may cure them so that they can see it. How is it possible that someone familiar with Islam, familiar with the Koranic verses on hajj matters, and familiar with the importance of unity can fail to understand that this immense gathering pursues the objective of realizing lofty political and divine political concepts concerning all Muslims. It is for unity, it is to resolve the difficulties of the Islamic world, and it is to unite and bring hearts closer. However, if the objective is to make the hajj rituals a means of preventing major powers from realizing their tyrannic policies, then we accept this. Those who are somehow involved in hajj matters should not compromise this beloved obligation of the Muslims with international politics. We are in favor of this. Anyone who politicizes the hajj with such objectives would betray the hajj. The problems of the Islamic world are important. Gentlemen, where else can these problems be raised? Where else can the Muslims join their united cry against so many dastardly acts that the Muslims are subjected to in the world today? Where else can they unite their cry to reach the world and reach the ears of the treacherous policymakers? Where else, but during the hajj rituals? See for yourself what they are doing to Muslims in Europe. The events in Bosnia and, especially, the recent week's developments in Gorazde, really make you want to cry. Words cannot express the gravity and immensity of this tragedy. Whatever we say, it is not enough. The leaders of the world's arrogant powers are watching the victim that is being slaughtered before them and they are just waiting to see when he will pass away. The victim is the Muslims of former Yugoslavia. What is their crime? They are Muslims. This is not a new idea -- I said it myself in my hajj message three years ago -- but then they used to deny it. Now, the big mouths of arrogance themselves are saying that they must not be helped because they are Muslims. They have been forced to admit it. Their crime is that they are Muslims. It is because a Muslim nation, in the heart of Europe -- I am not saying a Muslim government -- it is not clear that if Bosnia had had a government, it would have been a totally Islamic government; they had, after all, lived under the weight of a communist government for 50 years, more or less -- before that, too, they lived under the rule of corrupt Ottomans and the like, or under some corrupt European governments, European empires such as the Austrian empire, and so on. They could not have created an Islamic and a Koranic government overnight after all. No one could have expected that. The thing which has so angered the world, that is, that global arrogance which has sole mastery over the world, with regard to the suffering and defenseless Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina is the existence of a country that has a Muslim nation. That is what they cannot bear to see. This is the situation of Muslims in the world today. In these circumstances, international organizations -- worst of all and most despicable of all, the United Nations -- have behaved in the most abominable way. I want to tell you this: Let the secretary general who stands at the head of the United Nations know that he has acquired such a terrible reputation among Muslims that he will never be able to clear his name again. Muslims can see.... The world's Muslims can see what is happening in Bosnia. Muslims came forward and said: Let us go there and help these people, since the other side is receiving help anyway. However, they were told that such a thing was not possible. The Muslims then said: Then let us send them arms. They were again told that such a thing was not possible either. On the surface of it, of course, the West wants to say that they were not giving weapons to any side. Well, of course! One side has already inherited all the weapons which used to belong to the former state of Yugoslavia, that is, the same state which for many years lent military support to the Iraqi regime by giving it tanks and other equipment. The Serbs have all these weapons at their disposal today. However, the other side, that is, the unguarded people of a town and the women and children living there, are empty-handed. So what do they mean when they say that we have given no arms to any of the parties involved? They are deceiving world public opinion when they say that they are not helping any party. An armed party is standing against an unarmed one, and instead of either taking the weapon away from the armed party or giving weapons to the unarmed party, you just stand aside and say that you are not helping any side. This means in effect that they are just sitting and waiting for the fall and demise of the unarmed party. They are in fact waiting for the time when the Muslims fall. They said that they would send UN forces. The Islamic countries said: Let us go there as part of the UN forces in order to act as a shield. They replied: No, not possible! They did not allow any one -- not only from the Islamic Republic of Iran but from any other Islamic country -- to be sent to the area in order to act as a shield. What is the meaning of this? This means that they wanted to instruct the soldiers whom they sent to the area to go there and back the Serbs. Naturally, they could not ask the same from a Muslim soldier, and this is why they did not allow Muslims to take part. A disgrace such as this reigns over the order which they seek to create in the world today. Look at the behavior of the United States, the false promises they gave to the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the absolute refusal to help, and finally the behavior of international organizations and a number of European countries and Britain. Muslims remain oppressed in Bosnia, just waiting to be massacred. What can the world's Muslims do about this? Is there a way better than hajj? What makes the arrogant powers tremble with fear is the masses of people, otherwise they do not care one bit when a few governments gather in a conference in some corner of the world and issue a resolution. They would not care if a hundred resolutions are issued. How many resolutions have been issued so far against the usurper Zionists? They have been so much hot air and have achieved sweet nothing. What really makes the arrogant powers tremble with fear is the presence of the masses, and where can this presence materialize better than in the hajj? Two million Muslims from all Islamic countries will gather there, and if you ask any of them about their feelings toward Gorazde, they will say they want to go there and defend the oppressed Muslims of the world. Would it not be a pity if we were to lose this valuable congregation, which is capable of bringing so much blessing and saving the lives of so many Muslims? Is this what politicizing the hajj means? Is this why they object to the Islamic Republic of Iran politicizing the hajj? Disavowal means this: Disavowal means that the people gather together there and chant against the executioners who wear neckties and well-ironed suits and who sprinkle aftershave over themselves, who massacre the people in the most savage way, and against those who support them, who rule in their favor in the international organizations. This is the meaning of disavowal. Can the hajj be complete without this? Is a hajj without disavowal a hajj? Let the people who are familiar with the Koran and Islam answer this. Let them answer fairly. This is what the imam [Khomeyni] meant when he said that a hajj without disavowal is not a hajj. This is what he meant. Disavowal is a part of hajj. It is essential to it. And the presence of Muslims in the hajj must be a meaningful presence. Otherwise, if it were just a question of spirituality and the chanting of God's name, people could do it in their own homes. "And proclaim the Pilgrimage among men: they will come to thee on foot and mounted on every kind of camel, lean on account of journeys through deep and distant mountain highways." [Koranic verse spoken in Arabic] This would not be necessary. If gathering together was not significant, it would not be necessary to proclaim the Pilgrimage among men. It would be enough to say: Whenever you have the chance during the year, at any time, go to Mecca. It is precisely for this reason that they have said that everyone must come together. It is because even chanting God's name must be done with others; even circling around the Kaaba of God must be done with others. [passage omitted] Of course, what others do during the hajj is not our business. We simply do what duty requires us to do; we will do what we have to do, with God's help. What others do with regard to oppressed nations is not our business. Of course, when I say what they do is not our business, I mean that the inaction of others will not stop us. Of course, we will try, just as, thanks to God's help, our government and officials have tried to encourage other nations to help the suffering Bosnians. If they help, so much the better; otherwise, we will do it ourselves. And, God be praised, so far, the various organizations of the Islamic Republic and every individual have really spared no effort. They have done well. They must do even more. At this moment, too, the Red Crescent must do whatever it can in the hope that it may be able to provide some assistance to those beseiged and suffering people in terms of food and basic needs. Every faithful and devoted combatant youth, whether from the army, the Islamic Revolution Guards' Corps, or the Basij must declare their readiness so that, the minute they say we are allowed to go there, the minute the way has been cleared, they can be off. [Crowd chants] [passage omitted] The nation of Iran severed the thread of fear from the major powers, and now it can stand firm and steadfast. This has now become a lesson for other nations, as you can see that today the youth of the world are chanting in the name of Islam. Everyone thought that 15 years since the victory of the Islamic revolution and five years since the demise of his holiness the imam [Khomeyni], the enthusiasm of Muslim nations toward Iran and the Islamic revolution would fade away. This enthusisam, however, has clearly increased as each day has gone by. Each day the problem that global arrogance faces has become more serious. It was not us who did this. It was, in fact, God and his will. The Iranian nation, aided by God and divine successes, paved the way for this divine triumph. Our nation accomplished this by its compassion, its sacrifices, its efforts, its blood, its faith, and its unity. You must preserve unity. The enemy is highly intent on creating discord among a nation which constantly champions the cause of unity. All of you -- various groups, sects, cities, and individuals -- must remember this. The enemies would really love to be able to say: Here you are then! So this is the same Islamic republic which used to talk so much about unity, but is now suffering from disunity from within! They would really love to see such a situation. However, thanks to God's special attention, they have so far not succeeded; and with God's assistance and through the vigilance and alertness of you, dear nation, they will never succeed in this.
