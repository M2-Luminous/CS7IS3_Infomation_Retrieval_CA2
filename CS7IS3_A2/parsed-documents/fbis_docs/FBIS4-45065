These pens have expressed their apprehension that the new method will open the door to favoritism in selection and will lead to village isntability and that the appointed mayor will owe his loyalty to the government alone because the government is the party that appoints him. These people who have become accustomed to shuffling the cards are really amazing. The village mayor and chief are two administrative officials serving security. Therefore, they have no parliamentary capacity. Because democracy means government of the people by the people through their deputies and because the village mayor and the village chief are two public employees, exactly like a precinct commander or a police station chief, one is required to make a complete distinction between democracy and a civil service job whose main task is to preserve security and stability. There is absolutely no connection between village mayors and chiefs (both of whom are civil servants) and democracy. If the method of election had been embraced in the past, then a mistake was made and this mistake must be corrected. The village chief and mayor do not rule. The elected local council does. The chief and mayor are civil servants appointed by the Ministry of Interior to preserve public security. Is a civil servant chosen by election? Moreover, the mayoral election process itself has not been taking place in a sound manner that reflects a village's wish. Rather, the process has been governed by clannishness and by strong influences, not to mention the rancors, disputes, and conflicts to which mayoral elections have led and which pose a threat to village security. Therefore, appointment will certainly lead to stability and security, and not vice versa. Besides, how can one say that appointment will lead to favoritism and to the selection of favorites, and not the right people? There are specific controls and rules that require that those who seek the position of village mayor or village chief meet certain general prerequisites. Furthermore, special conditions are established to compare candidates and there are three committees that participate in the selection process to ensure that the best are selected. In addition, the opportunity to contest an appointment is available. Is it mpt strange that the opposition would criticize a mayor's response to government demands and his cooperation with the various government agencies? Are the village mayor and village chief not public employees appointed by the government? Does the government work for anything other than the masses' interest? The opposition seeks to depict the government as a party that always stands in the way of the people's wishes and interests. This is untrue and illogical and it reflects illwill. Interior Minister Major General Hasan al-Alfi has underlined a noteworthy point in the new village mayors and chiefs law, namely that the mayoral election system does not guarantee the mayor's continued presence in his village in order to carry out his duties. Most mayors have lived in provincial capitals, contenting themselves with the honor of the position. Meanwhile, villagers had to go to the mayors wherever the latter happened to live. In addition, an elected mayor did not receive an adequate monetary recompense to help him devote his time to the duty of the mayoralty. This contrasts with the appointment system which establishes a monthly recompense of 150 pounds which, along with the minimum income he receives by law, will help the mayor devote his full time to the duties of the job.
