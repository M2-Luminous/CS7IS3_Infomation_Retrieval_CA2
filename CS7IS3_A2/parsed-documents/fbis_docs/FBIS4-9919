FBIS4-9919 "drlat065_k_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-065 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 SOUTH AMERICA Argentina Twelve Hurt, 6 Arrested in Jujuy Demonstrations Twelve Hurt, 6 Arrested in Jujuy Demonstrations PY0504025194 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 0058 GMT 5 Apr 94 PY0504025194 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS Spanish BFN [Excerpts] San Salvador de Jujuy, 4 April (NA) -- The demonstration by Jujuy's Public Workers Union Front (FGE) [Frente de Gremios Estatales] that was convened for today to protest the veto by the executive branch of a salary increase approved by Congress left 12 people injured, six of them policemen. The police arrested six individuals. The public workers protest ended, just as did last week's demonstrations, in serious clashes that included attacks with rocks, the throwing of tear gas, and rubber bullets. The incidents were not circumscribed to Plaza Belgrano, located in front of the legislature, and where the marchers concentrated, but extended to other neighborhoods and to the bus terminal. Here there was another clash between police and workers, who burned and destroyed a police station. In the morning Governor Carlos Ficoseco released a decree vetoing the salary increase approved by Congress. This was the cause of the protest. The governor presented an alternative bill granting salary increases to public workers. [passage omitted] Jujuy police were reinforced with National Border Police and Salta Police agents to prevent possible incidents such as the one that occurred on 29 March. Governor Carlos Ficoseco began his speech at the legislature shortly before 1830, while outside the number of protesters convened by the FGE increased. Ficoseco's speech was scheduled to start at 1700 but started one and a half hours later. Meanwhile, police and public workers clashed outside. A group of demonstrators tried to enter the Congress building, which had strong police protection, but were repelled by police with tear gas and rubber bullets and forced to withdraw by some 200 meters. The anger of the demonstrators, and the unrelenting police persecution, forced workers to seek refuge at the local bus terminal, where they burned and completely destroyed the police station located in that area.
