With regard to the national budget, it was determined that it has presented positive signs during the first two months of the year. Holguin was the only province to register an improvement in its own income. The analysis on self-employment established that some craftsmen employ other people in their production, using energy and raw material of doubtful origin. It was also mentioned that in many cases it is not a craft activity, but rather an industrial activity. With the purpose of detecting any undercover illegality, the participants at the meeting agreed to review all licenses granted those calling themselves craftsmen. Another important point of the discussion was the sale of vehicles received as incentives and the illegal buying and selling of homes. The analysis determined that intellectuals, laborers, cadres, and public officials have been involved in buying and selling cars and motorcycles. It was recalled that the state has a legal and moral right to appropriate these goods because their owners signed and accepted a contract stipulating that the state has preference over the vehicle when the owner no longer has use for it. Regarding houses, its was also pointed out that the existing law, which states that the right to own real estate must not become a mechanism of gain or exploitation, is being violated. It was explained that rigorous action will be taken in the event of these illegal acts and that sanctions will be extended indefinitely and constantly reviewed to prevent future occurrences.
