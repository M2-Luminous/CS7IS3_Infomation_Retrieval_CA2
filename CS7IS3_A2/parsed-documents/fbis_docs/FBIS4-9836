In condemning this villainous crime, National Police authorities hereby report they are already searching for the parties responsible for this crime in light of evidence gathered at the scene of the crime. The police are also receiving support from the Guatemalan Armed Forces. The National Police Criminal Investigation Department is working arduously to locate, in the shortest time possible, those individuals responsible for this crime and to turn them over to the appropriate courts of law. Because we live in a democracy and because Mr. Gonzalez Dubon's activities were transparent, he readily refused to be escorted by security guards which, unfortunately, proved to be advantageous for the criminals. The security forces will utilize all of their expertise in investigating this murder. Nevertheless, the Guatemalan people's cooperation is being requested to expedite the investigation. All Guatemalans are also urged to provide any evidence that may lead to identifying the murderers.
