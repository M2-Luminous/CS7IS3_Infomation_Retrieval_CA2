He said: We sharply denounce this barbaric bombing, regarding it as a crude encroachment upon the sovereignty of Lebanon and a grave challenge wrecking the Mid-East peace process. It is due to the unjustifiable pro-Israeli policy of the United States that the military offensive of Israel on Lebanon has not come to an end. This was made plain by the attitude taken by the United States toward the recent bombing case. The United States, while crying for "sanctions" against the DPRK by bringing to the United Nations Security Council its "nuclear issue," which is not a matter for argument, as often as it pleases, connives at the military outrages of Israel which deserve denunciation and sanctions and tries to hush them up, ignoring the just demand of many countries. If the United States is really concerned for world peace and security, it must not unreasonably take issue with our peaceful nuclear activities but pay primary attention to checking the aggressive acts of such countries as Israel, which are virtually disturbing world peace. The Israeli authorities must stop the aggressive acts against Arab nations and withdraw from the occupied Arab territories without delay. Our people will as ever express firm solidarity with the Arab people in their just struggle to resolve the Mid-East problem in a fair and peaceful way.
