Tsai] [Text] Taipei, April 23 (CNA) -- Taiwan has decided to sign government procurement agreements with contracting parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) this year in order to facilitate its entry into the Geneva-based world trade regulating body. The cabinet-level GATT task force gave the green light to the plan late Friday [22 April]. The task force comprises officials from the Council for Economic Planning and Development and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Previously, Taiwan rejected such agreements because of the great number of state organizations involved. Although the government agreed to the plan, it will seek to exclude the International Telecommunications Administration, Taiwan Power Company, Chinese Petroleum Corp., and China Steel Corp. from the procurement agreements, informed sources said. Abrupt market opening might trigger unfair competition and thus adversely affect these state-run companies, the sources noted. Under the new plan, they pointed out, the government will substantially revise its current procurement practices to come into line with the GATT codes. For example, they elaborated, the base price for open tenders will be lowered from the current NT$ [New Taiwan dollars] 50 million (U.S.$1.88 million) to NT$4.7 million (U.S.$177,000). Moreover, all the bidding procedures will be completely open and transparent, they said. Taiwan, which was accepted as a GATT observer in September 1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of this year. All GATT signatories are set to become members of the World Trade Organization, which will be given tougher enforcement powers to supersede GATT and will start operations between January and July next year.
