Increasing Joys and Temptations [Text] Deng Xiaoping's policy of "without reform and opening to the outside world, China will come to a dead end" is being implemented by Taiwan firms. In 1992, the China mainland's imports and exports totaled more than $1.6 trillion. The value of its exports surpassed that of Taiwan for the first time, 3 percent of it coming from Taiwan firms. The longing of Taiwan firms for growth fits together nicely with the mainland's battle to escape from poverty. Like it or not, the travel to the mainland of Taiwanese to work is an unstoppable trend. For the next generation, daddy will not only no longer return home for supper, he will spend the whole year on the mainland. Suffering Taiwan cadres are leading young and industrious mainland workers. They are using their accumulated management experience and the newest plant equipment to give a new performance of Taiwan's barehanded rise of 20 years ago on the opposite shore. The time is autumn 1993. The place is the China mainland. The main performers are a group of Taiwan traders who are building factories anew on the China mainland. In this vast land that requires risk taking to overcome difficulties, and that has been described as the great west, the longing of Taiwan traders for growth nicely coincides with the mainland battle to shed poverty. By comparison with the stagnation in Taiwan, several locations on the coast of mainland China are filled with a strong will to grow, and foreign visitors arrive in an endless flow. Every day Shanghai's Hilton Hotel is overbooked by 80 or 90 guests. An Min [1344 3046], the director of the Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao Office of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] says extremely ambitiously: "China's economy must mesh with the world's." (On the China mainland, Taiwan traders may meet many patriotic, strongly ambitious, and outstanding officials like An Min.) An Min notes with pleasure that China's imports and exports during 1992 totaled $1.6 trillion for tenth place in the world, suddenly surpassing Taiwan by more than $10 billion. (During 1992, the value of exports exceeded that of Taiwan for the first time.) An Min said that in 1992 Taiwan firms contributed 3 percent of the China mainland's total imports and exports. A Hong Kong scholar believes it was more than that. The succession of performances of Taiwan firms in pursuit of growth on the mainland have directly or indirectly hastened the rapid growth of the China mainland economy. The rapid increase in Taiwan firms' investment in the mainland has had an impact on Taiwan's industry that has spread as well from manufacturing to the financial and advertising businesses... At 9 o'clock at night, in a brightly lighted factory five hours away from Shenzhen by car -- the Chongde Shoe Factory located in the Lianhuashan Industrial Zone of Dongguan in Guangdong Province (a joint venture of Taiwan's Chunt'ai Shoe Factory and a Japanese Shoe Factory) -- 800 female workers' hands and feet are busy machine-sewing shoes. No one speaks. The only sound is the cicada-like chirping of the sewing machines. Looking at the factory, which sparkles like crystal, the factory's new general manager Lin Wu-luan, soliloquizes: "They laugh saying I am crazy because I want them to increase their output 20 percent. Work that can be completed in 8 hours, they want to take 10 hours to do." He and four other cadres from Taiwan live in the factory area. They make the factory their home, and they take turns on patrol. (Suffering cadres and hardworking female employees: Isn't this a portrait of Taiwan 20 years ago?) Scene 2: The Sorrows and Joys of Pioneers At Kunshan City, a two-hour automobile trip from Shanghai, fields of yellow-flowered rape and winding ditches appear everywhere. This is a fine river and lake region south of the Chang Jiang. This tract of rape is awaiting the arrival of a foreign trader to develop it for a factory site. Fuch'ang Textiles, Liuho Machinery, Nanhsin Electronics, and Amalgamated Enterprises from Taiwan have all established plants here. The 42 year-old Cheng Pao-t'ang from Jumbo Industries in Taiwan is in charge of nine cadres who are in process of building a factory that will produce 1.5 million bicycles per year (to reach in a single action a scale that took 21 years in Taiwan). Today is Sunday. It is also the national anniversary of the Republic of China. Very early in the morning, Cheng Pao-t'ang listens to a radio broadcast from Taiwan, but the signal is jammed. But work is more important than anything else, so the holiday-less Cheng went on patrol at the plant site very early to solve problems as they occurred. At 5:30 every morning, he climbs to the top of a hill alone. At 7:30, he goes to work, and at 10:00 or 11:00 o'clock at night, he is on plant patrol. Because of the press of work, Cheng Pao-t'ang does not think of his aged parents or his three growing daughters back in Tachia Town in Taiwan. He says, "We started from scratch here. It is a mission and a challenge." Nevertheless, looking out into the twilight outside the office window, he cannot help but frequently wipe away tears from behind his spectacles because he is unable to look after his parents and daughters. Returning to the dormitory, he eats dinner with 10 cadres sent from Taiwan. In order to welcome the guests, he has specially bought Dazha crabs from Yangcheng Lake in Kunshan for dinner. One of the group, a 30-some year old cadre remembers the famous remark of chairman of the board Liu Chin-piao: "Males have to be ruthless to succeed." The homesickness of the group is assuaged only by this sentence of the boss. The leftover contestants apartments in Beijing's Olympic Village have now become high quality apartments leased to foreign firms. The 10 cadres in Beijing live a collective bachelor life here. "The general managers of a Chongqing plant and a Chengdu plant, which are under construction, also live here. They go to work and come back from work together, and after eating the evening meal, their sole common topic is the amounts completed. Around 8 o'clock on this night, general manager Chang Sheng-chi receives a telephone call from Tianjin for the purchase of some instant noodles. Since they began to go into production at the beginning of the year, one after another of the wholesalers in north China have lined up, cash in hand, to buy them. They have come from Tianjin, Jinan, and even as far away as Harbin. "The figures are what keep the five of us going," says Chang Sheng-chi, who comes from Tainan, but who already speaks with a Beijing accent after living in Beijing for a year. Scene 3. Exploring the North It takes about two hours to go from Beijing to Tianjin via the newly opened express highway. The port of Tanggu in the Tanggu district of Tianjin on Bohai Bay is a coal exporting port. The smell of coal is everywhere, and yellow saline soil is everywhere too, just waiting for someone to reclaim it. A Taiwan trader in Tanggu claims to have inside information that direct flights will begin between Tianjin and Taipei in May 1994. The Tianjin Municipal Government has already drawn up beautiful long-range plans for the yellow soil that include a financial zone, an industrial zone, and economic relations and trade zone. The Tianjin Huana International Vacation Village Company is developing a golf course in the planned financial district. All around is yellow mud. It is difficult to envision this areas as a bustling financial services area, and it is also very difficult to envision a golf course in a financial services area. A Taiwan trader in Tianjin said incredulously, "Tianjin freezes in winter. How can grass be grown?" Pointing to a barren tract beside him, The Huana general manager, Lin T'ien-chueh, who comes from Taiwan, said happily, "We open next year. Pretty soon, three regiments of people's armed police, 3,000 men in each regiment, will be working three shifts a day on this construction site. Within a short time, the dust will be flying as huge forces battle night and day like tanks in a decisive battle." The most dangerous places are the safest places and vice versa. The more chaotic a place, the easier to see opportunities for discussions. On the mainland, some Taiwan firms like Huana dare to take risks to overcome difficulties. They are taking the route of armed forces and people's armed police. Lin T'ien-chueh has asked the director of the Chinese Communist Hainan Island Office, Li Da-xiao to take charge of the work. His units are also a part of the Chinese Communist military's benefit protection group. Li Da-xiao says in an aside: "Taiwan is part of China. When Taiwan compatriots come here to work, they are returning to the motherland to engage in construction. They are developing strength for the motherland." Starting Life Over Again Lin I-liang, the Tianjin general manager of Unity, which is located not far distant, who came to Tianjin just half a year ago, saw his life go from simplicity to complexity. Formerly, his life centered around Tainan County and Tainan City. His life was extremely simple. All he had to do was tend to his work, and all was well. Now, he has to make sure that mainland staff and workers do not smoke or spit in the plant, and he has to remove refuse from the plant area to turn it into a garden with a wayside pavilion. (Unity in Tianjin is a joint venture with the old flour mill owned by the Tianjin Sugar Refinery.) Lin I-liang hopes to turn into magic the mess that exists in the plant area's refuse-filled out of the way corners. When he was a manager in Tainan, he often spent his spare time drinking tea and chewing the rag with several good friends. Now, on his day off, he plays golf with ranking Tianjin cadres to talk about matters. "They really treat me very well. We are on very close terms," says Lin I-liang from whose mouth Taiwan dialect formerly issued, but from which the tongue-twisting Beijing dialect now comes. At dusk, Lin I-liang carries back to his hotel for the evening meal some cold food that the plant cook made for lunch. "When I went to work for Unity at age 26, I gave my all for the job. Now that I have to give my all on the mainland at age 50, it's really strenuous." He sighed saying, "Since I signed on to this ship, I have to figure out a way to make it run." Like it or not, people traveling from Taiwan to the mainland to work is an irresistible trend. For the next generation, daddy will no longer just not come home for dinner, but he will spend the whole year on the mainland. The understanding of the next generation that is educated in Taiwan will begin to be confused. The textbooks may call the Chinese Communists communist bandits, but daddy will have gone to do business with the communist bandits. Actually, economics knows no national boundaries. Nor can firms who seek continuous growth easily put their country ahead of profits. The amount of Taiwan firms' investment in the mainland during 1992 was second only to their investment in Hong Kong and Macao. It was greater than their investment in either the United States or Japan. An Min says that as of now, Taiwan firms have formally invested in a nominal 12,000 different projects on the mainland totaling nearly $11 billion. If the unofficial projects are added in (investment by Taiwan firms registered under foreign firm names), the number is 20,000. The statement of a Beijing official has the typical Chinese great nation haughty tone. He said, "Forty years ago Taiwan carried away a lot of gold from China. It is only right that it should return to the motherland to make a contribution now." As he continued to speak, he happily revealed a secret. He recently signed contacts with two big Taiwan firms. The Ever-Increasing Investment Craze The speed and intensity of Taiwan firms investment in the mainland is like the spread of lotuses on the Kaohsiung River. Overnight the lotuses choke the river creating a peril. Zhang Zhiqun, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office in the Shanghai Municipal People's Government pointed out that since Deng Xiaoping's travels in south China during 1992, Taiwan firms' investment in Shanghai has increased enormously. During 1992 alone their investment was greater than the total for the previous 10 years, and investment during the first half of 1993 has been greater than for all of 1992. The scale of investment is also becoming greater and greater. An Min, who remembers figures very clearly, said that not only has the level of technology risen, but the average per project investment has also increased from $900,000 prior to 1991 to $1 million today. When Taiwan firms invest in the mainland, they bring the quintessence of concentrated experiences to the mainland. The scale of their plants is absolutely several times what it is in Taiwan, and the equipment is also new and better. Take the Yuyuan Shoe Company, a mainland joint venture of Taiwan's P'ao-cheng Shoe Company and a Hong Kong firm, which set up the Yuyuan Shoe Factory in Dongguan before the June 4th incident of 1989. The plant area, which is located on a river, occupies an entire street and has 20,000 staff members and workers. It is more imposing than Taiwan's nearly 10,000 employee China Steel Plant. What was "Taiwan's best" a decade ago, has moved here. Pao-cheng's plant at Zhongshan in Guangdong is even larger with 50,000 staff members and workers. Its Zhuhai plant has 5,000 staff members and workers. Yuyuan Shoe Enterprises is now listed on the Hong Kong stock market. Within just two years, Unity Enterprises has also set up seven bases on the mainland. A cadre in a mainland general merchandise and textiles group explained why investment in the mainland is becoming greater and greater and deeper and deeper: "In the beginning, investors were fearful. After the situation became somewhat clearer, investment became greater and greater," she said. We know when the enemy does not know. The mainland authorities know all about Taiwan firms' investments. Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation made 100 speeches during the first half of 1993 in which it called upon firms to augment the registration of Taiwan firms' investment in the mainland, but no more than 12,000 projects were registered. At the end of October, Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs announced the astounding results of a survey. Citing the results of a Ministry of Economic Affairs "survey report of the operating intentions of manufacturing industries," for 5,000 manufacturing firms, it said that during the past three years 64 percent of the domestic concerns that invested had invested in mainland China. According to central bank statistics, during the past four years, more than $10 billion has flowed out of Taiwan to the mainland, but only slightly more than $6 billion has flowed from the mainland to Taiwan. This is an adverse balance of more than $5 billion. The frequency of Taiwan firms' economic relations and trade between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits has tightly bound Taiwan's and the mainland's economic contacts into a destiny community. Hong Kong Chinese University researcher, Chien I-yuan, has found that Taiwan showed a $9.48 billion favorable balance of trade for 1992. Its favorable balance of trade with Hong Kong amounted to $13.6 billion. Without its favorable balance of trade with Hong Kong, Taiwan would show an unfavorable balance of $4.1 billion. Unless one goes to China, it is difficult to understand why Taiwan firms want to go so far from home to invest in the mainland. What one sees on the mainland is everyone focusing on money. There is a general determination to battle their way out of poverty. From north to south, everywhere large tracts of land beckon. Any time of the day one can see crowded, impoverished masses telling people they need work. A mainland survey shows 20 million staff members and workers, and their families, have a monthly income of only 50 yuan (about NT$200). They live in poverty. Many state-owned enterprises cannot continue operation. Every unit must think of ways to create income in order to sustain itself. Some state-owned units have also allowed people to leave their posts (leave their jobs temporarily) to get a fresh start. One Shanghai intellectual said that a Shanghai textile mill has cut half of its staff and workers. Even research units like the Shanghai Social Sciences Institute have let go one fourth of their staff members and workers. Boundless land and unlimited manpower is what Taiwan does not have, and these are also powerful attractions for Taiwan traders to invest in the mainland. Following the travels of Deng Xiaoping in south China in 1992, the China mainland clearly announced that reform and opening to the outside world would continue unchanged for 100 years. This more powerfully attracted Taiwan traders to go to the mainland. At the same time, Taiwan was endlessly quarreling over political rights issues; no clear-cut and concrete economic policy was in sight; and no fresh political climate or quality of life was provided. Roaming Mainland China north and south in a strong search for growth opportunities has taken deep root in the minds of Taiwan traders. While Taiwan was marking time in place, many Taiwan traders regarded opening up new territory on the mainland as an experience and a challenge. Risk Taker's Paradise The China mainland is also a risk taker's paradise. People can come here to try out new brands. Unity, whose "Chef Kang's" Instant Noodles have the greatest brand name recognition on the mainland, does not produce instant noodles in Taiwan. On Taiwan, Unity is a food giant, but on the mainland everyone can begin to compete from a zero starting point. On the matter of profits and losses, a conclusion is very difficult. In some cases, losses have mounted, but others say they recovered their principle within three years. In most cases, however, more and more investment and more and more expansion is required. Some firms have expanded southward. An example is "Chef Kang," which started out in Tianjin and Jinan, and which is now looking for a plant site in Guangdong. Some have expanded from the seacoast inland. An example is Chun-t'ai Shoe Industries, which expanded from Dongguan and Qingdao to Chengdu. Unity Enterprises has cast its net everywhere, east and west, north and south. Just as enterprises must grow, people must also have a sense of accomplishment. "Taiwan has a lot more brilliant people than the mainland, but I can realize my dream here," said Lin T'ien-chueh, a Taiwan trader in Tianjin from Taiwan's Lien-t'ai Gongguan. "A person always hopes to leave behind something that will not be easily forgotten." Lin T'ien-chueh's feelings are typical of Taiwan traders. Taiwan traders appeals to Taiwan traders is another reason for the snowballing increase in the number of Taiwan traders investing in the mainland. At the present time, Tianjin has 1,200 Taiwan firms. Lin T'ien-chueh has steadily acquainted Taiwan traders with investment in Tianjin. Lin T'ien-chueh said that Ch'eng-chou Electronics, T'ien-sheng Ying-chia Radio Telephone, Jou-Ch'ing Facial Tissue, and T'ai-chung Precision Machines all have Tianjin investment plans. Investment also has a mass psychology aspect: "A large group of Taiwan traders, Japanese, and Koreans are aboard an airplane. If the Taiwan traders do not come, the mainland will develop without them," said Ch'en Te-hsing, chairman of the board of Fuch'ang Textiles, which is well-known for the production of high quality ready-made clothing, as he sits in Shanghai's old Mianjiang Hotel eating Dazha crabs while listening to Strauss piano music. This also explains why Taiwan traders are flocking to the mainland. Ch'en Te-hsing, who was introduced by a professional colleague who invested in Fuzhou early, recently began a cooperative venture with the Shanghai Jinshan Petrochemical Plant for the production of ready made clothing. He went into business with it because his professional colleague's cooperation with it had been happy. If a business does not move ahead it moves backward. Businessmen find marking time in place very difficult to bear. The deputy manager of Unity Enterprises in Beijing, Lin Fang-i, said that "Business must continue to go on. They should not come here because they cannot succeed elsewhere. They must come to make their business grow." Standing at the Unity Industries plant, which is beginning to rise on the salt lands, the place seems familiar to him. it is because the heads of the Tainan group come from the saline lands of Beimen Village in Tainan County. The Hope of Setting Up Shop The lure of the mainland market of 1.2 billion people is hard to resist. Furthermore, although mainland per capita income is low, 980 million people on the mainland have annual incomes of $7,000 or more. "I would be happy doing business with just 50 million people," one Taiwan trader said. "The interesting thing about the mainland is that one cannot look at it in terms of Taiwan's experience. All the finest things in the world occur here," said Sung T'ieh-ming, the chairman of the board of Taiwan Aomei and of China Aomei. What he means by the Taiwan experience is step-by-step development. On the mainland, the gap between the poor and the rich is wide, the land is vast, the population is large, and it is both extremely poor and extremely rich all at the same time. The mainland's internal and external sales market holds boundless charm, but management problems are numerous. If one went to the mainland in 1989 (before the 4 June Incident), and then went back four years later, even though the mainland's basic problems (population, and education) still remained, the speed with which several locations in coastal areas are prospering would astound one. The Shanghai subway, which was started later than Taipei's, had trains running on a section in less than a year. One can see everywhere on the China mainland the expression of Deng Xiaoping's statement that "without reform and opening to the outside world, China faces a dead end." This clear-cut policy is being put into effect by Taiwan traders. One can see Taiwan products everywhere on the mainland. Above Beijing railroad station, Wei-ch'uan Food Products' large yellow balloons frequently sway in the air. On signs at bus stops along straight and long eastern Changan Avenue, Unity Instant Noodles also proclaim their good taste. Beside the airport, a Lien-hua Electronics Corporation sign, which declares itself to be China's Largest Integrated Circuit Plant shares its glory with tourists coming and going. On Shanghai's most crowded street, Nanjing Road East, Acer Computer's neon sign adds brilliance to the night scene. Until relations between both sides of the straight are clarified, propelled by profit, Taiwan firms will dare to go the limit. Many people question whether firms interests are the same as the country's interests. Many worries are cropping up... Do Firms Have No Motherland? "If things go on this way, Taiwan will be hollowed out," said Wu T'u, the manager of the Hong Kong branch of South China Bank with extreme concern. Like other Taiwan banks, South China Bank went to Hong Kong to handle the letters of hypothedation of Taiwan firms that went to the mainland. The Hong Kong branch, which opened for business only in September, brought in 1,300 customers within a month. Wu T'u has grounds for being worried. He said that in Shenzhen alone there are more than 1,000 Taiwan firms, and nearly 1,000 in Dongguan. "A small area has so many Taiwan firms, and China is so big..." Hong Kong Chinese University researcher Chien I-yuan conducted an analysis in terms of economic theory that shows how Taiwan's economy may be sucked dry. Chien I-yuan said that national income is the mark of economic strength, and that national income is the sum total of consumption, civilian investment, government expenditures and exports minus imports. The reduced investment in Taiwan may produce a domino effect. If employment opportunities decrease and consumption decreases along with it, and if government revenues decrease, and if their is an outflow of capital, in particular, public finance will become increasingly distressed. "Unless Taiwan reinvigorates its economy, Taiwan will really be sucked dry, and the economy will be done for." Looking at the Wanchai sea front in Hong Kong, Chien I-yuan could not help sighing, "Should Wang Yung-ch'ing [3769 3057 1987] go to the mainland, Taiwan will be really dry." Many Taiwan firms are not that pessimistic. They feel that the money will return to Taiwan. The roots remain in Taiwan. A Hong Kong financier does not feel this way. His analysis is that the China mainland is formidable. So many Taiwan firms go to the mainland, a small number of them failing. But how will the steady expansion and the deepening investment of Taiwan firms in the mainland turn? The mainland began by providing concessions in coastal areas to attract foreign firms, and now it is providing concessions inland. Taiwan firms cannot stand such deadly temptation. "Taiwan firms themselves know very well what they should do, but they do not do it. If they return to Taiwan, they cannot survive," this financier pointed out. Chien I-yuan's analysis is that Taiwan firms entered the China mainland because they were "attracted from the outside and pushed from the inside." By attracted from the outside he means the Chinese mainland's large land area, cheap labor, and policy of openness. By pushed from the inside he means Taiwan's insufficient land and manpower, an inefficient administrative system, and deterioration of the social order. One after another, Taiwan firms took the course of seeking a second youth on the mainland. The taking away of capital has already resulted in a capital shortage in Taiwan, which delays the upgrading of Taiwan's industry. Domino Effect One can already see some evidence of the impact on Taiwan of the departure of Taiwan firms. Without manufacturing industries, there can be no service businesses. One Taiwan financier pointed out that with the departure of Taiwan firms, finance and banking shrivels more and more. Formerly, finance and banking grew at a 2 to 3 percent rate. With the departure of Taiwan firms today and the increase in new banks, local banks find it increasingly difficult to operate. Consequently, they have begun to pressure the government. Banks want to enter the stock market. The departure of Taiwan firms has also produced a marked slump in the advertising business. A person from Associated Advertising said that in order to invest in the mainland, it is very easy for Taiwan firms to cut their Taiwan advertising budgets, because by cutting their advertising budget by NT$30 million, they can invest in a plant on the mainland. When Taiwan firms invest in the mainland, human talent is also replaced. One Taiwan trader noted that in the future when local mainlanders are able to take over in Taiwan firms' mainland plants, Taiwan cadres will be replaced. This will mean a substitution of human talent. More frightening is the clash between businessmen's interests and the national interest. Chang Jung-fang [1728 2837 0023] of the China Economics Institute pointed out that Taiwan's present mainland economic relations and trade policy is the public policy about which there has been the most controversy and the least consensus for the past more than 40 years. Both sides of the Straits conceal the benefit from their frequent economic and trade contacts. However, because of the Chinese Communist's strong political goals whereby administration is legalized rule of men, not only is Taiwan's political sovereignty threatened, but economically though "Taiwan traders may benefit for a short time, they will not necessarily benefit over a long period," said one observer. Chang Jung-Fang noted that under the one-country two-systems policy goal, the Chinese Communists are actively employing economic and trade methods, and the intensification of economic and trade relations between the two sides of the Straits to attain the goal of unification. Once Taiwan's economic chip and advantage continues to erode, Taiwan's security coefficient will inevitably decline. Who Bears Responsibility? In a report, Chang Jung-Fang said that a Chinese Communist internal document said explicitly that "our trade with Taiwan is for the purpose of promoting economic contacts between the mainland and Taiwan to unite industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan to create conditions for the unification of the motherland." This report pointed out that the Chinese Communist's present method is to hope to combine with Taiwan traders, to use the people to pressure officials, and to use businessmen to encircle the government, and to use Taiwan businessmen's expectations that the three opens [the opening of postal, trade, and navigational ties between Taiwan and Mainland China] will lower costs as a motivation for forcing Taiwan to accept a one China principle. This is tantamount to businessmen transferring external costs to the backs of 20 million people in order to benefit themselves (when costs occur for which they themselves are not required to bear responsibility). In reality, Chinese Communist activities inside Taiwan have not relaxed with advances in relations between the two sides of the Straits. They have only changed from an effort to take the island in one big gulp to nibbling away. The China mainland has never abandoned Taiwan. In Beijing An Min said, today there is no talk of force against Taiwan, but overall one may say that we are duty-bound to defend the territory of the country! Some people believe optimistically that Taiwan traders may spread Taiwan's experiences on the mainland, or use economic strength to transform the mainland peacefully. The fact is that the longer Taiwan traders stay there, the more uneasy they become. In a society that depends on the rule of men, commerce has no guarantees. Taiwan traders who have just arrived on the mainland, particularly in north China, feel that high ranking characters are very friendly and are on very good terms with them. However, the longer they stay in the south, the more disappointed they become. In Guangdong Province, for example, although they sign agreements to lease plant buildings for 10 years, they are forced to move in less than four. In addition, after several years, the price of land for which an agreement has been signed may be raised and more rent collected. PLA units may drive vehicles into the plant at any time before the New Year to ask for goods free of charge. When a Taiwan trader is killed on the mainland, the Chinese Communists "may brazenly refuse to provide particulars of the case," one Taiwan trader complained. Even though Taiwan traders in various places have tried to organize Taiwan trader associations, the Chinese Communist's Taiwan office either wanted to take part, or refused approval. One Taiwan trader said the Taiwan Office "only approved lateral, but not vertical ties" among Taiwan traders in all jurisdictions. People who have had no contacts with the Communists find it difficult to understand the experiences that the Chinese Communists have accumulated during the past half century, or the number of stages in united front work. One high ranking official in united front work directed against Taiwan said that the Chinese Communist's united front tactic throughout has been, first, to make friends to win confidence, and then do "work." No Distinction Between Politics and Economics A Japanese commentator who visited a finance and economics official in Taiwan said that Taiwan has always maintained the inseparability of politics and economics, but as the Chinese Communist economy has begun to become strong in recent years, its political attitude has begun to harden. It began with the nuclear testing in Xinjiang... Actually, Chinese Communist officials plan to dovetail economically with the world, but they do not want to dovetail ideologically with the world. In Beijing during October, signs about bringing the Olympic Games were still up, and the express highway from the airport to downtown Beijing, which was completed more than a year ago, was built to obtain the right to sponsor the Olympic Games in 2000. Finally, when the opportunity was lost because of the human rights issue, people in Beijing were infuriated. An Min said angrily, "Today's world is not a fair world. The Olympic Games standards are the white man's standards." By comparison with the mainland, Taipei's ideological standards are closer to the world standards. Every time they return to Taipei, many Taiwan traders feel much more relaxed as soon as they step from the airplane, because they can breathe a free atmosphere. If you stand back a little to look at Taiwan, you see that it has some valuable things: its atmosphere is becoming increasingly free; it better respects human rights; and it has greater freedom of the press. One problem is that ever since the lifting of martial law, Taiwan has stagnated for a very long time. This applies to economic reform, to political clean-up, to National Assembly efficiency, and to the quality of life. One Taiwan trader in Hong Kong suggested that the Taiwan government should wake up to the present state of affairs. It should talk less and do more. National Assembly efficiency, in particular, should be improved greatly... Taiwan needs more self-examination and action. If it is to retain Taiwan firms, Taiwan has to provide an environment that permits the rapid growth of enterprises, particularly for the countless medium and small enterprises. It must permit the people to live reasonable and tranquil lives.
