This was reported yesterday by Aleksey Kudrin, Economics and Finance Committee chairman. It is possible that St. Petersburg will once again be among the "clients" of a special government fund which up until 1989 subsidized the city's transportation expenditures. However, municipal transport will only receive government support if 40 percent of expenditures for its upkeep are paid for by ticket sales. As for the bus production that is supposed to be started up by KaMAZ and Kirovskiy Zavod in the town of Gorelovo, that project will very likely be included in the federal list of facilities eligible for priority funding (at least according to a proposal submitted by Russian vice-premier Aleksandr Shokhin). Viktor Chernomyrdin also announced that in the near future the government will pay off last year's indebtedness for the city's Metrostroy company, a debt that currently stands at R19 billion [rubles]. A total of 170 billion "federal" rubles are supposed to be allocated for subway construction here in 1994, but only R8 billion has been made available thus far. (By way of comparison, the Moscow subway system has received funding of R1.1 trillion.) Of the R32 billion allocated by the government for the preparation and conducting of the Goodwill Games, only R18 billion has been transferred to the city budget. As Aleksey Kudrin noted, even those funds have not reached their proper destination, and at this time sports facilities are being built and renovated at the city's expense. In addition, Aleksandr Shokhin intends to attempt to get the funding increased to R49 billion. Additionally, the Russian Government will consider whether to provide tax incentives for the importation of the imported products required for the Goodwill Games.
