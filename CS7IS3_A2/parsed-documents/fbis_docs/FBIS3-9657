The areas surveyed by the poll were political options, the popularity and notoriety of the principal Romanian political personalities, the standard of living and quality of life, the economic and social policy of the government, and mass media consumption. The poll was conducted among a representative sample of 1,100 persons with a margin of error of 3 percent. The question referring to the direction in which our country is heading is a question that is usually included in all questionnaires examining the current problems of countries and it is meant to establish the mood among the population at the time of the poll. In the years 1990, 1991, and 1992, Romania seemed to be the most optimistic country in the world, as 70-80 percent of the population believed that the country was heading in a very good direction. Currently, things seem to be getting back to normal, Teodorescu emphasized, as, according to international standards, it is normal that the majority of the population should be dissatisfied. Regarding the quality of life, the things the Romanians are dissatisfied about are quite clear, and they refer to the lack of cleanliness of streets and public places, the way in which local administration bodies exert their duties, the level of incomes, and political life. In that context, the performance of Parliament and the government are considered to be very low. Referring to the mass media, Teodorescu said that there is only one daily that really has a nationwide circulation, covering the whole territory, and that is EVENIMENTUL ZILEI. Local dailies rank second. The publications further down the list are ADEVARUL, ROMANIA LIBERA, and GAZETA SPORTURILOR. The first channel of the Romanian Television has an audience of 85 percent. The first channel of Bucharest Radio Network has an audience of 71 percent, followed by the programs of its local radio studios with an audience of 29 percent, and by the local cable television programs. Foreign radio networks and private radio networks have not gained as much in popularity as was expected. Regarding the popularity of political personalities, for the first time ever the Emil Constantinescu [Democratic Convention of Romania chairman]-[President] Ion Iliescu twosome has been surpassed in popularity by the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Adrian Nastase, who was favored by 55 percent of the persons polled. He is followed by Emil Constantinescu with 45 percent, President Ion Iliescu with 44 percent, Petre Roman [Democratic Party-National Salvation Front chairman] with 41 percent, Corneliu Coposu [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party chairman] with 39 percent, and [Civic Alliance Party Chairman] Nicolae Manolescu with 33 percent. Regarding the political parties for which the persons polled would cast their votes, the parties belonging to the Democratic Convention of Romania are heading the list with 37 percent, followed by the Social Democracy Party of Romania with 24 percent, and the National Romanian Unity Party with 6 percent. The question intended to establish the polled persons' readiness to participate in an election was answered affirmatively by 80 percent, which proves that there is an interest in political life and a conviction that voting is important for the way Romania will look in the future.
