SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The MMS prepares EA's and FONSI's for proposals which relate to exploration for and the development/production of oil and gas resources on the Gulf of Mexico OCS. The EA's examine the potential environmental effects of activities described in the proposals and present MMS conclusions regarding the significance of those effects. Environmental Assessments are used as a basis for determining whether or not approval of the proposals constitutes major Federal actions that significantly affect the quality of the human environment in the sense of NEPA section 102(2)(C). A FONSI is prepared in those instances where the MMS finds that approval will not result in significant effects on the quality of the human environment. The FONSI briefly presents the basis for that finding and includes a summary or copy of the EA. This notice constitutes the public notice of availability of environmental documents required under the NEPA Regulations. Dated: April 25, 1994. Chris C. Oyens, Acting Regional Director, Gulf of Mexico OCS Region. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10811 Filed 5&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;MR&hyph;M
