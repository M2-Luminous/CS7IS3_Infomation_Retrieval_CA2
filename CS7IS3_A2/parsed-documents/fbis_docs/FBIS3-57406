Prosecutor General Arturas Paulauskas said over 60,000 crimes were reported to law enforcement institutions last year and this was the highest figure throughout Lithuanian history. The crime rate went up by 6 percent last year, but increased by as much as 25 percent a year earlier, he said. In Paulauskas' words, the preventive detention law allowed to strike a heavy blow on organized crime, to break up a number of criminal gangs and to arrest underground bosses. But around 63 percent of crimes were not disclosed and sources that supply weapons to criminals were not destroyed. The number of premeditated murders, robberies, economic and financial crimes continued to increased, he said. The collegium's meeting was attended by President Algirdas Brazauskas, who pointed out that the press "amuses" itself by writing about corruption and abuse of authority among officials. He urged law institutions to respond to such accusations "in a legal way" and as soon as possible. The president said law institutions should establish closer cooperation among themselves and assured the meeting's participants that the state "does not and will not grudge" money to ensure law and order. Bickauskas, who was present at the meeting, said an outbursts of crime was provoked by Gorbachev's perestroyka. In the lawmaker's opinion, "an absolute denial of Soviet laws" at the very start of Lithuania's national revival transformed into "denial of order," while constant changes in the legislation "stimulated legal nihilism." The parliament vice chairman said law institutions "began to waver politically under pressure from both the left and the right, and gave up fearing they might be called the nation's enemies." Bickauskas said the struggle against organized crime must continue, data bases about mafia must be created and agents must be infiltrated into criminal structures.
