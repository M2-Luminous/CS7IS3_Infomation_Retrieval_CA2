As of 1 April there were 740 Russian citizens (including 282 children) and 450 foreigners in Russia registered as being infected with HIV. But when you consider that the period between infection and the development of the outward signs of the disease averages seven-eight years and the special survey in 1993 covered 25 million Russians, then registered cases constitute only 15-20 percent of the true number of Russian Federation citizens infected with HIV. Some 110 of those infected have died. In terms of the number of people infected or sick, the situation in Russia today corresponds to the situation in the United States in the early eighties. There are fears that in 10 years' time we could reach or even exceed the current level of incidence of the disease in the United States (1.5-2 million people infected). As is known, a law "On AIDS Prevention" was adopted in the Soviet Union back in 1990. Why do we need a new legislative act? The main reason is that the situation is rapidly changing for the worse. For example, the problem of the increase in the number of children infected as a result of medical negligence (remember the recent Elista affair) has become topical only of late, and only in our country. There is a subjective reason too: The previous law (which is still in force) contains substantial shortcomings. The very term "the disease AIDS" is inaccurate: On the one hand, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is the final stage of the disease that begins with HIV infection; on the other hand, AIDS can be caused by other factors as well -- exposure to radiation, for example. The 1990 law contains articles that are questionable from the viewpoint of the observance of human rights. Practice has shown in recent years that the provision concerning the citizen's duty to undergo a medical examination "if there are sufficient grounds for supposing that the person is infected with HIV" has led not only to compulsory examination ("sufficient grounds" has sometimes been interpreted very freely by physicians), but to considerable economic losses (total expenditure on "examination" in 1993 constituted approximately 50 billion rubles). One other obvious defect of the law was the lack of clarity over the position of infected foreigners. According to the statistics, HIV infection was found to be 100 times more common in foreigners living in Russia than in Russian Federation citizens, although the requisite legal mechanism for their deportation does not exist. The main purpose of the new draft law is to legislatively confirm the state's duties in relation to the prevention of HIV infection and the treatment of and provision of social assistance for the victims. Antidiscrimination measures for people infected with HIV and their families and social guarantees for medical staff at risk of infection also need to be enshrined in legislation. There must also be tougher sanctions against medical staff responsible for infection. According to the draft law, "a medical examination to ascertain HIV infection is carried out if a person voluntarily requests it or with his consent." This is the only wording that corresponds to generally acknowledged international law standards today. Only foreigners, blood donors, and some categories of professionals -- surgeons, for example -- are liable to compulsory examination. If infection is establishad, the state has the right to deport foreigners, while Russian citizens are "subject to monitoring at a special clinic and to treatment only with their consent." They are entitled to all types of free medical assistance in outpatient clinics and hospitals, including free return travel to the place of treatment. A large section of the draft law is devoted to social protection for people infected with HIV and for their families. In particular, they are not allowed to be dismissed from work or turned away from work or from medical, educational or children's institutions. There are special articles stipulating the rights of parents with infected children (being able to stay with them in hospitals, retaining their continuous service record with the payment of benefits in the event of their leaving work to look after a child, top-priority provision of separate housing); social protection for people in medical and other professions at risk of infection. Finally, a special article in the draft specifies the duties of the state in relation to prevention of the disease, in particular making medical examination, including anonymous examination, accessible to all. According to the members and experts of the State Duma Committee on Health Care, the proposed draft law needs to be fine-tuned: For example, social guarantees for people infected with HIV through the fault of medical staff and sanctions against the latter need to be specified. In May the draft law "On Preventing the Spread of HIV in the Russian Federation," finalized taking into account all the observations, will be submitted for discussion by the State Duma.
