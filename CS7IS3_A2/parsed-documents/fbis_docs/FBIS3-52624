This is a clear indication of the impotence and decrepitude of the U.S. foreign policy as regards international affairs in the post Cold War era. THE WASHINGTON TIMES newspaper carried an analytical article with repetitive remarks regarding Iran which is evidence of the blind hostility and animosity of the U.S. echelons with regard to Iran. It appears that the U.S. analysts are seeking to compensate for the utter humiliation that they had to endure in their current defeat by initiating another psychological war! The analyst of the aforementioned newspaper has cited a Pentagon source stating: "The U.S. planning for a possible clash with Iran began quite a while ago and war with Iran is inevitable, as Iran is considered a potential enemy of the United States; Washington takes Iran's strength very seriously." The Pentagon official has not specified the time frame for this war, but has stated: "The Pentagon echelons are assuming that there will be a juncture when Iran will take some action that will necessitate a reaction on the part of the United States." In attempting to justify these allegations by the Pentagon officials, the newspaper analyst mentioned various instances that could prove to be possible pretexts for the United States to embroil itself in a conflict with Iran, such as an attempt against a CIA official's life, Iran's uncompromising attitude toward the Zionist regime's compromise [with the PLO] and has stressed: "Apparently, the United States is the only country in the world that takes the threat of Iran seriously." According to THE WASHINGTON TIMES, this U.S. Department of Defense official claimed: "In the past two years, Iran has purchased weapons worth billions of dollars and, apart from the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf, Iran is the strongest country in the region today." This official has expressed his concern over the mounting spiritual clout of Iran among the Muslim countries of Africa and Asia, and even in Europe, stating: "The religious decree against Salman Rushdie is so harsh that it forced the U.S. President to apologize to the Muslims for the few minutes of his meeting with Rushdie in the White House." As to the fact that plans for a possible U.S. clash with Iran began quite a while ago, there is not the slightest doubt. One can say that these plans began on the morning of the victory of the Islamic Revolution and since the inception of the Islamic movement, in fact. In the course of the last years, U.S. officials have always considered war with Iran imminent and have even experimented with it in instances such as the "Tabas incident." [attempt to liberate the U.S. hostages] Thus, the mention of such allegations is not new for Iranians, as Iran's stance on a confrontation with the United States is too clear to require any such pretexts. Therefore, what purpose does the repetition of such remarks serve, especially claims such as "Iran purchased billions of dollars worth of weapons..." and so on? It appears that the U.S. has had failures one after the other in trying to forge its "new world order." The resulting vacuum in the bipolar world has motivated the residual elements of the Cold War in the United States to try to compensate for their failures and to fill the existing vacuum by carving out a new pole. It is for this purpose that they are after Iran, as they have admitted themselves that "Iran's spiritual clout among the Muslim countries of Africa, Asia, even of Europe is a source of concern." Even though Iran has sought to forge new relations with the West and to mitigate the existing tension, such propaganda fanned by the U.S. media indicates that the Westerners--the Americans in particular--are not willing to learn a lesson from the past or to comprehend the changes that have emerged in Iran and the world. They still think that by indulging in belligerence and propagandistic blackmail, they can pursue their illicit interests. Such experiments have lost their novelty for Iranians and only strengthen their determination on the path to a confrontation with the Americans. When the hungry Somalis can send the bodies of American soldiers home, the more war-experienced people of Iran are well aware of their obligations. Today, more than ever before, the remarks of the imam become clear to intelligent people: "The United States cannot do anything wrong to Iran." The U.S. officials and analysts are requested to attend to their insolvent economy instead of voicing such claims and allegations in the media and they should challenge their Asian and European rivals instead. Of course, in order to succeed in this battle, the United States should reappraise its relations with Third World countries. Third World countries in general now tend to lean toward Japan and Europe, which can only expedite the U.S. defeat on the international level. It would be well worth their while for the U.S. officials to think of peace rather than warmongering and not to dissipate their resources in wars in Iraq, Somalia, and so on. The wise learn from their mistakes and do not repeat them. If the U.S. officials insist on repeating their errors, the Iranian people are ready to teach them a lesson that they will never forget.
