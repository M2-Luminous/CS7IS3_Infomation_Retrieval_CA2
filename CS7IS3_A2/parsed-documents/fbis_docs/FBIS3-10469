There will be no mention in the PT's platform for governing of a moratorium on the external debt. "New financing for the production sector will be assured only if we renegotiate our debt," said PT Deputy Aloizio Mercadante from Sao Paulo, at the lunch he attended with Lula. Mercadante, who is also an economist, made it clear that the party knows that a unilateral moratorium, should Lula become president, would not help the country at all. Tapped by the PT candidate to take the lead in drafting the economic plan for the would-be administration, the congressman said that "the moratorium is not a banner, but a political instrument." According to him, although the question of a moratorium is controversial, the platform will not deal with hypothetical situations. Coordinator Mercadante was assigned to present Lula's economic program to the businessmen. It is already known that the PT president was extremely irritated by the preliminary proposals in the platform, such as the debt moratorium, and decided that Mercadante will be his strongman and economic spokesman in coordinating the plan. The deputy's presence at yesterday's lunch and his participation in the discussion served notice to the party. To Mercadante, the external debt issue is not the main item on the internal agenda. However, that does not mean Brazil will not demand more compatible terms of payment, and it will be tough in negotiations with its creditors. "If it is compatible with a resumption of growth, we will work out the debt payments at a new level," he said. "It is not true that the entire external debt is to be paid under the conditions in the loan agreements," he argued. And he urged that dialogue and credibility be the hallmarks of the negotiations. The PT deputy also talked about Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic plan. He said his party opposes it, although it believes the fiscal adjustment is needed. And he advocated a far-reaching tax reform. "Hardly any of the cuts in public spending have actually been made, and the Social Emergency Fund took money from education, social security, and unemployment insurance." Meanwhile, the expenditures by the judiciary and legislative branches have increased. "Fernando Henrique has broken the force of the wind," he added. As for the internal debt, Mercadante insisted that "unilateral actions are not part of our scenario." According to him, negotiations must be held to stretch out the terms of the debt. "The states must respect the loan agreements and fulfill them." In his opinion, Brazil will become modern not only by opening up its markets, but by redefining public policies, financing, and incentives to modernize and improve efficiency. Economic stability and an end to inflation are vital. "Stability is not easy to achieve, because you have to confront powerful interests in business sectors that are accustomed to earning without producing."
