FR941207-0-00110 FR941207-0-00019 4. The NPRM suggested that, instead, such LPTV and translator stations could file for renewal twice during the transition period to the new schedule, once at their normal renewal time (for a short term license) and again when the full service stations in their states became due for renewal. This alternative would avoid conflict with Section 307(c), but concerned some of the commenters because it would force some licensees to file for renewal in as short a period as eight months, entailing additional administrative and cost burdens and providing additional opportunity for renewal challenges. Such parties believe that the additional risks and burdens outweigh the benefits to be gained from allowing full service station licensees to file full service, low power, and translator renewal applications at the same time. 5 The Commission believes that substantial savings to the Commission, broadcasters, and the public can be realized by conforming the renewal dates for translator and low power television stations to those for full service stations of the appropriate service ( i.e., radio or television) in the same state. We expect these savings to include a streamlined renewal process, the elimination of needless paperwork burdens and a reduction in the incidence of filing errors. Accordingly, we will grant translator and LPTV applicants filing for license renewal a short term renewal with the license period extending only until the end of the license period for full service stations of the relevant type located in the same state; at that time they will have to file again for a full term license renewal. The Commission recognizes that this action will require two renewal applications to be filed by some translator and low power licensees within a brief period of time. However, this is a modest, one-time cost that is more than counterbalanced by the long term savings that will accrue from the synchronization of renewal schedules and consolidation of forms that this action will achieve. Additionally, the Commission believes that the fear expressed by some commenters that accelerated renewal filings will be subject to increased renewal challenges appears to be one more of perception than substance. Only 3 challenges to LPTV station renewals were filed during the last renewal cycle (1991&hyph;1994); two of those were subsequently withdrawn. In the 1988&hyph;1991 renewal cycle fewer than six challenges were filed against translator applications. 6. Although, as discussed in detail in the full text of this decision, there does not appear to be any way to avoid the above-described one-time additional short term renewal for translators and LPTV stations located in some states without violating either Section 307(c) or 309 of the Communications Act of 1934 as amended (the Act), to alleviate the extra burden on some licensees, pursuant to Section 8(d)(2) of the Act, the Commission will waive the application fees for any translator or LPTV license renewal application that is required by this action to be filed within 26 months of the station's most recent prior renewal filing. In situations where full service stations must file for renewal prior to translator and LPTV stations in their state, the Commission will permit but not require the translator and LPTV stations to file an early renewal to place them on the same renewal schedule as full service stations in their state. The Commission strongly encourages translators and LPTV stations to file coincident with the corresponding full service stations for that state. By doing so, translator stations commonly-owned with primary stations in the same state which rebroadcast the signals of the primary station can realize the benefit of filing for renewal on a single application form in the upcoming renewal cycle as opposed to waiting until the following cycle. Licensees of translator and LPTV stations that do not elect to take advantage of this option will be required to file for license renewal at the time presently required by their license authorization. In this latter case, shorter term renewals will be issued for periods to expire coincident with the expiration date for full service station licenses in that state. 7. In a related matter, one commenter, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) requests that the Commission, in modifying FCC Form 303&hyph;S, include a certification that the applicant has complied with all relevant FM translator rules, particularly those relating to funding and support. In amending the Form 303&hyph;S as a result of the instant proceeding, the Commission will add to the form a certification related, but not identical, to that requested by NAB. Administrative Matters Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 8. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605, it is certified that this decision will have an one time negative impact on some small television and FM radio translators and low power television stations. As detailed in the full text of the Report and Order, low power television and FM radio and television translator licensees whose licenses expire before the renewal date of their full service counterparts in the same state will have to file for renewal twice, once at their normal time and once when the full service stations in their states are due for renewal. To alleviate this burden, the Commission will waive the application fees for any translator or low power television license renewal application that is required by this action to be filed within 26 months of the station's most recent prior renewal filing. The Commission believes that the advantages of allowing FM and television translators and low power television licensees to file at the same time as their full service counterparts in the same states outweigh the one time administrative burden necessary to bring such stations into their full service counterparts' renewal cycle. The full text of the Commission's final regulatory flexibility analysis may be found in paragraphs 11&hyph;13 of the text of the Commission's decision. Ordering Clauses 9.
