Guided by identified drug-trafficking patterns, public security organs in southwest border provinces and regions, and those along the southeast coast -- such as Yunnan, Guangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong -- stepped up reconnaissance, and border and coastal interceptions, thereby solving cases, boosting the number of cases solved in the first quarter and achieving a greater rate of crime-busting than the same period last year. Yunnan solved 900 drug cases in the first quarter, seizing more than 700 kg of heroin; and solved a major drug case involving over 10 kg of heroin on each of six days from late March to early April. Guangxi and Guangdong public security organs solved more than 400 drug cases and arrested a number of drug traffickers from outside the borders in the first quarter. Aimed at stopping criminals from taking advantage of the increasing social intercourse between the two shores of the strait to traffic drugs, Fujian public security organs increased efforts at cracking these cases, solving 22 drug- trafficking cases in the first quarter, seizing close to 40 kg of drugs, and arresting 57 suspects, some of them of Taiwan origin. In their struggle against drugs, public security organs made a point of mobilizing and relying on the masses to launch a people's war against drugs. On 22 February, a peasant in Lijiang County, Yunnan Province, picked up a bundle of sugar cane on a road and found in it 51 g of heroin wrapped in a plastic bag. He reported this immediately to the public security organ, which investigated and followed the lead, thereby solving a major drug case. The Ministry of Public Security recently issued notices commending public security organs for the brilliant results they have scored in the battle against drugs.
