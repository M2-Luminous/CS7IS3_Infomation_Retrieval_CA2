[Fourniou] [passage omitted] In Gisenyi, the Meridien Hotel has become a rear base of the provisional government. All the ministers have a room there, and to meet the prime minister we will need to be escorted. Far from Kigali, dressed in military fatigues and sitting in an armchair belonging to this hotel, he will tell us that the aim of his army was never to exterminate the Tutsis: [Begin Jerome Bicamumpaka, identified as prime minister of Rwandan interim government, recording] There was no deliberate desire by the government to exterminate any ethnic group. I think this is when people have been talking of genocide. That there should be a war, that there should be a war that could be described as ethnic or otherwise--this is not the first time that such a phenomenon has been seen in the world. So there was an ethnic clash, it is true, but there was no deliberate desire by one group to exterminate another. [end recording] [Fourniou] Yet, outside the hotel we found men from the regime's militia, the Interahamwe, the ones responsible for numerous massacres of Tutsis, the personal guard of the minister of defense, who has also retreated to Gisenyi. At the head of 40,000 men, for him the enemy is not only the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] and the Tutsis: [Begin recording] [Augustin Bizimana, identified as defense minister of the Rwandan interim government] I am not saying that we are just fighting the RPF. We are fighting Uganda. [Fourniou] You consider you are at war with Uganda? [Bizimana] With Uganda, yes. As minister of defense I can say this quite openly. We are at war with Uganda. We know that there is support from Belgium. We know the Americans--initially and wrongly, they were mistaken--supported the action by the RPF. [end recording] [passage omitted]
