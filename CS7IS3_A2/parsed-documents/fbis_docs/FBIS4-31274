But the number of those who no longer identify with their Slovak origin is twice as large. However, the Slovak minority in Poland does not represent a problem on the scale, for example, of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia. "During the reform of the entire state administration, we were practically left to our own devices. We do not have any rights guaranteed by the Constitution and a law on minorities does not exist in Poland," Lubomir Molitoris, secretary of the Central Committee of the Cultural and Social Association of Czechs and Slovaks in Poland, said about the present position of the Slovak minority in Poland. Some protection is somewhat noticeable in the sphere of education, where a Ministry of Education decree is in force on the principles of minority education and maintaining a national identity.
