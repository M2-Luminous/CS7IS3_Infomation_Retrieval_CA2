FR940613-0-00065 FR940613-0-00015 FHWA Response: The court concluded that ``the `A' frame is the safest *␣*␣* mode of transportation for loading and shipping panels,'' but its evidence on that point was meager. The issue of safe transportation of concrete panels was discussed at some length in the SNPRM (see 58 FR 11455&hyph;11457). As we noted there, a single panel, mounted horizontally, would improve the vehicle's braking capability and reduce its susceptibility to side winds. Two such panels obviously constitute a divisible load, and a ``safety'' rationale for doubling the weight of a divisible load is not persuasive. Black Hills Trucking now contends that one panel cannot be carried horizontally because it ``is not constructed to stand up to forces coming through its sides,'' or vertically ``because it is not heavy enough in proportion to the `sail' area exposed to side winds which destabilize the load.'' The apparent fragility of these concrete panels does not make two of them any less divisible. Furthermore, the Great Plains experience winds high enough to overturn tractor trailer combinations and double-stack container trains. The interests of safety are better served by halting trucking operations under those conditions than by doubling the weight of the cargo in an effort to anchor the vehicle. The Rocky Mountain Prestress decision is not binding on the FHWA. To the extent this rule requires Wyoming to adopt and enforce a new definition for purposes of issuing nondivisible load overweight permits for the Interstate System, it is no longer binding on the State either. The 1979 decision was based upon the State's arbitrary and capricious administration of its own permit law, in particular its failure to apply that law consistently to all motor carriers and commodities. At the time, there was no Federal law on nondivisible loads. Congress enacted nondivisible load provisions for vehicle weight in 1982 and for vehicle length in 1991. Proposed regulations to implement that authority have been subjected to extensive comment and discussion in this rulemaking. Wyoming, like the other States, will be required to adopt the new definition for Interstate operations. That definition will result in greatly increased nationwide uniformity in the treatment of nondivisible loads. Wyoming will have no more administrative discretion than any other State. A judicial challenge to the FHWA's definition of a nondivisible load would therefore confront a legal and factual situation completely different from that which existed in 1979. Emergency Vehicles: Section 1023(e)(1) of the ISTEA prohibited the FHWA from penalizing States that allow emergency vehicles to use the Interstate at weights in excess of Federal axle and Bridge Formula limits. The exemption was in effect for 2 years after the date of enactment of the ISTEA and expired on December 18, 1993. Section 1023(e) also required a study of State laws and permit practices to determine whether statutory changes were needed to accommodate emergency vehicles. To carry out the study, the FHWA requested comments on a variety of questions (57 FR 46941, October 13, 1992). The information submitted indicated that most fire trucks exceed the Federal single- and/or tandem-axle weight limits (20,000 and 34,000 pounds, respectively). These vehicles are rarely short enough to violate the Bridge Formula, however, and almost all of them have gross weights under 80,000 pounds. Technological developments in the manufacturing sector combined with the equipment preferences of fire departments are driving up the size and, especially, the weight of fire trucks. On the other hand, tandem and tridem axles are not favored because they reduce the maneuverability these vehicles need to reach burning buildings. Some States exempt fire equipment from normal weight limits, and others issue blanket overweight permits. The Caltrans reached a compromise with fire officials that will require the latter to observe specific axle limits for various types of vehicles and to make purchasing decisions accordingly. The U.S. DOT's report was transmitted to Congress on September 7, 1993. It recommended that Congress take no further action because the matter could be resolved by an FHWA policy statement. On November 9, 1993, the Federal Highway Administrator informed the FHWA's regional offices, and through them the States, that ``the FHWA will not withhold Federal-aid funds from States which issue nondivisible load permits to emergency vehicles equipped for their intended use. We will not require that the vehicles have a full crew or be operating under emergency conditions. States may set whatever permit terms, conditions, and fees they consider appropriate.'' The Federal Highway Administrator added that this policy ``is compatible with the Agency's draft definition'' published on February 25, 1993, in the SNPRM and that if it ``in any way conflicts with the definition ultimately adopted through the rulemaking process, appropriate action will be taken to amend or rescind the policy.'' The Federal Highway Administrator's decision was based upon conclusions set forth in his November 9, 1993, letter: Some States may have refused to issue nondivisible load permits to emergency vehicles because much of their equipment is readily detachable. Fire trucks often carry firefighting teams, water, hoses, axes, respirators and other devices; advanced life support vehicles typically carry at least two paramedics (one of whom drives), defibrillators, oxygen tanks, stretchers, and medical supplies. In one sense, ancillary equipment and personnel are ``divisible'' parts of the load, and removing them might lighten an emergency vehicle enough to restore compliance with Interstate weight limits. Doing so, however, would defeat the purpose of these vehicles and make it impossible for them to respond effectively to emergencies. New vehicles may even be overweight as they leave the final stage manufacturing facility, either because the base vehicle is particularly heavy or because ancillary equipment is supplied with it. The equipment that could be removed from emergency vehicles to reduce weight is essential to the services they are designed to perform. These vehicles and loads are functionally if not physically nondivisible, and I believe the States should have the option to treat them as such.
