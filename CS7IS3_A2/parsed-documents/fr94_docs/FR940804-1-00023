FR940804-1-00023 FR940804-1-00009 A description of the essential habitat, need for special management considerations, and impacts of designating critical habitat for Johnson's seagrass, as well as the proposed action, are described in the following sections. Essential Habitat of Johnson's Seagrass The biology of Johnson's seagrass is discussed in the proposed rule to list the species as threatened (58 FR 48326, September 15, 1993) and includes information on the status of the species, its life history characteristics and habitat requirements, as well as projects, activities and other factors affecting the species. The current status of Johnson's seagrass is presented in the EA prepared for this critical habitat designation. The physical habitat that supports Johnson's seagrass includes both shallow intertidal as well as deeper subtidal zones. The species prospers and is able to colonize and maintain stable populations either in water that is clear and deep (2&hyph;5 m) or in water that is shallow and turbid. In tidal channels, it inhabits coarse sand substrates. Based on published reports and discussions with seagrass experts, the distributional range of Johnson's seagrass is limited to the east coast of Florida from central Biscayne Bay (25 ○45 ’ N. lat.) to Sebastian Inlet (27 ○50 ’ N. lat.). There have been no reports of healthy populations of this species outside the presently known range. Although the species occurs throughout the Indian River Lagoon and Lake Worth, the five specific areas proposed for critical habitat encompass the largest known contiguous populations of Johnson's seagrass. While a population within Biscayne Bay has been confirmed by literature and observation, it is discontinuous from the other areas where the species is found, and the area has not been studied or delineated. The species is patchily distributed within its range. The dimensions of patches range from a few square centimeters to approximately 327 square meters. The survival of the species likely depends on maintaining its existing viable populations, especially the areas where the larger patches are found. The Sebastian Inlet population is believed to be the northern limit of its distribution and includes the largest known patch of Johnson's seagrass. The other areas proposed for critical habitat designation represent the core range of the species. Spread of the species into new areas is limited by its reproductive potential. Johnson's seagrass possesses only female flowers; thus vegetative propagation, most likely through asexual branching, appears to be its only means of reproduction and dispersal. If an established community is disturbed, regrowth and reestablishment is extremely unlikely. If extirpated from an area, it is doubtful that the species would be capable of repopulation. This species' method of reproduction impedes its ability to increase distribution as establishment of new vegetation requires considerable stability in environmental conditions and protection from human-induced disturbances. Based on the best available information, the essential features of the areas proposed for critical habitat designation include adequate (1) water quality; (2) salinity levels; (3) water transparency; (4) and stable, unconsolidated sediments that are free from physical disturbance. Need for Special Management Consideration or Protection NMFS has determined that the essential areas and features described in the previous section are at risk and may require special management consideration or protection. Special management may be required because of the following activities: (1) Vessel traffic and the resulting propeller dredging and anchor mooring; (2) maintenance dredging; (3) dock and marina construction; (4) water pollution; and (5) land use practices. Activities associated with recreational boat traffic account for the majority of human use associated with the proposed critical habitat areas. The destruction of the benthic community due to boating activities, propeller dredging, anchor mooring and dock and marina construction was observed at all sites during a study by NMFS from 1990&hyph;1992. These activities severely disrupt the benthic habitat, breaching root systems and severing rhizomes and significantly reducing the viability of the benthic community. Propeller dredging and anchor mooring in shallow areas is a major disturbance to even the most robust seagrasses. This destruction is expected to worsen with the predicted increase in boating activity (Pat Rose, Florida Department of Natural Resources, personal communication). Trampling of seagrass beds, a secondary effect of recreational boating, also contributes to disturbing seagrass habitat. Populations of Johnson's seagrass inhabiting shallow water close to inlets where vessel traffic is concentrated will be most affected. The constant sedimentation patterns in and around inlets require frequent maintenance dredging, which could either directly remove essential seagrass habitat or indirectly affect it by redistributing sediments, burying plants and destabilizing the bottom structure. Altering benthic topography or burying the plants may remove them from the photic zone. Decreased water transparency caused by suspended sediments, water color and chlorophylls could have significant detrimental effects on the distribution and abundance of the deeper water populations of Johnson's seagrass. Evidence from a distribution survey in Hobe and Jupiter Sounds indicates that the abundance of this seagrass diminishes in the more turbid interior portion of the lagoon where reduced photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) limits photosynthesis. Other areas of concern include seagrass beds located in proximity to rivers and canal mouths where low salinity, highly colored water is discharged. Freshwater discharge into areas adjacent to seagrass beds may provoke physiological stress upon the plants by reducing the salinity levels. Additionally, colored waters released into these areas reduce the amount of sunlight necessary for photosynthesis by rapidly attenuating shorter wavelengths of PAR. Also, continuing and increasing degradation of water quality due to increased land use and water management threatens the welfare of seagrass communities. Nutrient overenrichment caused by inorganic and organic nitrogen and phosphorous loading via urban and agricultural land run-off stimulates increased algal growth that may smother Johnson's seagrass, shade rooted vegetation and diminish the oxygen content of the water. Low oxygen conditions have a demonstrated negative impact on seagrasses and associated communities. Special consideration and protection for these and other habitat features will be evaluated during the section 7 process and in development and implementation of a recovery plan. If adequate protection cannot be provided through consultation or through the recovery planning process, separate management actions with binding requirements may be considered.
