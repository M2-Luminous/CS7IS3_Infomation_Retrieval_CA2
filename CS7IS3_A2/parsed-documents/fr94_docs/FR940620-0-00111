FR940620-0-00111 FR940620-0-00029 Comment. Several correctional administrators indicated that the proposed definition and use of the term ``secured entrances'' is inconsistent with industry usage of the term. Specifically, entrances located within secured perimeters, and thus considered ``secured'' by corrections officials, may in fact serve visitors and other members of the public. Basically, the terms ``secured entrance'' and ``public entrance'' are defined to be mutually exclusive in the guidelines when this is not necessarily the case in practice. Response. The Board considers distinction between entrances used by the public and those used by inmates or detainees necessary to ensure an accessible route into the facility for inmates, particularly in those cases where visitors and inmates use separate entrances. ADAAG 12.2.1 has been revised to clarify that entrances serving the public, including those that are secured, are required to be accessible by ADAAG 4.1.3(8). Security requirements at such entrances have been taken into account as further discussed below. The requirement for the accessibility of entrances used by inmates and detainees but not the public has been relocated to ADAAG 12.2.2 to distinguish them from entrances considered public entrances covered in ADAAG 12.2.1. The provision's heading has been changed from ``Secured Entrances'' to ``Other Entrances.'' The requirement that, where entrances serving inmates or detainees only are provided, at least one be accessible is substantively similar to the proposed provision. Thus, while the term ``secured'' has been removed from this provision it still covers the same type of entrances as the proposed requirement. The term ``secured'' has been retained in ADAAG 11 which covers judicial, regulatory, and legislative facilities since commenters did not express any concern about its usage with respect to such occupancies. 12.2.1␣Public Entrances Comment. A design firm discussed certain security considerations that may conflict with full compliance for doors and entrances. According to this commenter, secured entrances or sallyports may be equipped with swinging doors weighing between 300 to 500 pounds that would need power assist openers and closers to meet the requirements for door closers in ADAAG 4.13.10 (Door Closers) and the maximum 5 lbf opening force required in ADAAG 4.13.11 (Door Opening Force). In addition, this commenter noted that some accessible types of door hardware used to meet ADAAG 4.13.9 (Door Hardware), such as lever handles, are considered a security threat in that they can be more easily removed or broken and used as a weapon. Response. In the proposed rule, the requirement for access through or around security systems or screening devices included an exception for doors at such locations. Under this exception, doors operated only by security personnel were exempt from the requirements for maneuvering clearance at doors (4.13.6), accessible door hardware (4.13.9), opening forces (4.13.11), and specifications for automatic doors if provided (4.13.12). This exception has been revised to apply to both entrances used by the public and those entrances used by inmates or detainees. This revision is consistent with an exception in ADAAG 11.5 (Restricted and Secured Entrances). In addition, a reference to the requirements for door closers (4.13.10) has been added to the exception. While the exception as proposed was limited only to doors operated by security personnel, it is implicit that the security considerations raised by comments also apply to those doors that may not be operated by security personnel. Consequently, the exception has been broadened to cover not only doors and doorways operated by security personnel, but also those doors and doorways subject to security requirements that prohibit full compliance with these provisions. This would apply to those doors that may be operated by visitors or inmates, as well as security personnel. The independent use of doors is, of course, a critical component of accessibility. This exception applies only where security requirements prohibit compliance with the specific provisions listed. Where security requirements prohibit full compliance, the applicable specifications are to be met to the maximum extent feasible. 12.2.2␣Other Entrances This provision requires that where entrances serving only inmates or detainees are provided, then at least one must be accessible. Comment. One commenter stated that the entrance required to be accessible under this provision should count as part of the total number of entrances required to be accessible under ADAAG 4.1.3(8). Also, the Illinois Department of Corrections noted that State correctional facilities typically do not provide entrances used only by inmates and recommended clarification that in such instances, an additional accessible entrance for inmates or detainees is not required. Response. The requirement that at least one accessible entrance used by detainees or inmates be accessible applies only where such entrances are provided. It does not require that such an entrance be provided where none is intended for a facility. Entrances that are used by both inmates or detainees and the public are considered public entrances and subject to ADAAG 4.1.3(8).
