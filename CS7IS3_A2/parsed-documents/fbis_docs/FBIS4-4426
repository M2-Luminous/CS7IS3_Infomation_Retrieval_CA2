What is your goal? [Yamaguchi] My life work as a politician is to create two major political powers to run Japan's politics. My effort in the Shyinjiyu [New Liberal] Club were not successful, but the experience should be utilized now because we are undergoing a period of confusion. I am often criticized as a puppet of Mr. Ichiro Ozawa, but, actually, Mr. Ozawa and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa are working on my behalf. (laughter) [Obata] Then, what is your tangible plan for the "new party"? [Yamaguchi] The coalition parties should work together starting with a joint policy study group, and then the group may discuss the "new party." Even if coalition parties unify their floor groups in the process, cooperation in the Diet may not immediately result in tie-ups in election campaigns. In this sense, the formation of the joint floor group seems to be a waste of time. The Democratic Socialist Party's action plan is calling for a "unification of all coalition parties," and I think this is the most favorable direction. Some newspapers said lower house candidates cannot receive multiparty support unless they join the policy study group. This is nonsense. [Obata] Yet, some coalition parties are wary of the study group since it is likely to be developed into the "new party." [Yamaguchi] While the Sakigake [Harbinger] takes a prudent stance toward the policy study group, I do not see any difference in policies between the Sakigake and other conservative parties. The Sakigake's attitude is really rigid, and it seems to me that the party is trying to demonstrate its presence. Yet, I will call for the Sakigake's participation again and again. [Obata] What would you do if they refuse the study group to the end? [Yamaguchi] We will keep sending a message calling for cooperation and unity. However, if they really do not understand that, the coalition would inevitably have a bipolar structure of "united reformists" and "social-democratic liberals." In that case, the two groups may jointly support the coalition government without discussing unnatural unification. The position of "social-democratic liberals" may be like that of Germany's Free Democratic Party (FDP), which takes part in a coalition government led by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU). However, Japanese voters are severer than Germans. Such a minor power would be certainly weeded out. [Obata] It appears you are really frustrated with Sakigake. What is your comment on this point? [Yamaguchi] The coalition won in the Ishikawa gubernatorial election. While the victory was won by the unity of coalition parties, only Mr. (Masayoshi) Takemura (chief cabinet secretary and head of the Sakigake) does not acknowledge this. We cannot fawn on him forever. While Mr. Takemura says "a merger between the Sakigake and the Japan New Party should be discussed before the study group," Mr. Hosoakwa made that promise before he was inaugurated as the prime minister. Now that he has much heavier responsibility to lead the nation, he cannot afford to stand by old friends. [Obata] How would you involve the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in the second stage of political realignment? [Yamaguchi] Members of the LDP Dietmen's League for Promotion of Political Reform took cooperative attitudes toward the coalition when the political reform bills were enacted. Now we need an interparty mechanism for tax and economic reform. Mr. (Michio) Watanabe is a man capable of leading the entire political circles on economic policies. I have great expectations for the meeting between Prime Minister Hosokawa and Mr. Watanabe, which was reportedly held last month. Of later Mr. Yamaguchi has been actively working to pave the way for the political realignment. He calls himself a "catalyst" for the realignment. In our interview, he stressed: "I am not obsessed with any status or power. I can leave Nagata-cho when I carry out this task." Some politicians say "it is questionable if he really can accomplish such a difficult task." He is facing a crucial moment to demonstrate his real value as the "political catalyst."
