Mr. Peres made these remarks on the eve of the resumption of the talks in Taba. In its weekly session today, the cabinet heard a briefing on the issue. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports from the studio: [Raz] [passage omitted] Israel is not prepared to change the Cairo understandings, either with regard to the crossing arrangements on the bridges or the scope of the withdrawal in Jericho. This position was unequivocally reaffirmed by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. [Begin Peres recording] The Cairo understandings do not include 'Arafat's observations, that is as clear as day. As for the Cairo understandings, there is the document we issued and the observations of Nabil Sha'th -- and they do not differ all that much from each other -- and this should be the basis for discussion. [end recording] [passage omitted] In anticipation of the meeting between Clinton and al-Asad, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin remarked that if the Syrians link peace to the normalization of relations with Israel this would be a change. If al-Asad chooses to maintain the current vagueness, then nothing will have changed, the prime minister said.
