[passage omitted] Gianfranco Fini, head of the Italian neofascists, told LA STAMPA yesterday: D-Day brought freedom back to Italy, and I welcome it as a positive event, but was it not also the day when Europe lost its cultural identity? How does Jacques Delors react to such words? [Delors] I was very angry when I read that. So far, I have followed the usual rule and -- as president of the European Commission -- I avoided commenting on what happens in Italy. All the more so, because I think that if we comment beforehand, we are likely to spoil the chances of those who want to limit the possible resurgence of neofascism. But now we must not only be very vigilant, we must be both vigilant and worried. He also added that until 1938 -- when Mussolini passed the racist laws -- fascism could not be considered as something negative. He also added that there are moments when freedom is not the main value. At this point, I got very worried. [passage omitted] [Sinclair] Something else on Italy: You agree with the criticisms and reservations expressed by Francois Mitterrand rather than the good conduct report issued to Berlusconi by Bill Clinton two days ago? [Delors] Why did Bill Clinton do that? Because, according to his analysis, he thinks that within the government coalition there are people who can stop the rise of neofascism. This is why he is giving his support to the coalition forces just a few weeks after the elections. Maybe in many months' time he will act differently. It will all depend on what those people will do and say. [Sinclair] [passage omitted] Jacques Delors, I would like you to watch with us the interview which Bill Clinton gave to TF1 -- I can see you getting your notes out -- to TF1 and "Seven Out of Seven." This is the only French television station to which he decided to speak before his trip to Europe. The interview, which he gave me, took place in Washington, at the White House, on Friday 27 May. [passage omitted; recording of interview with President Clinton, who answers questions on U.S. policy on Bosnia, Rwanda, and Haiti, and on relations with Russia, and stresses desire for a strong Europe] [Sinclair] Jacques Delors, I saw you listening very carefully and taking notes on the interview. We will look at several points shortly. Regarding the last question: I am in agreement with Francois Mitterrand, says Bill Clinton -- do you really think America wishes to have a strong Europe, or is this diplomatic language? [Delors] I had doubts for years, but after my talks with President Clinton I am certain that he wants a strong Europe. Of course, the United States remains a top power. It is difficult to carry out certain actions without it, but we have come back to the thinking of those who wanted a strong Europe, although one has to deserve it. Let me give you an example. [Sinclair] You are saying that we have to deserve it? [Delors] Yes, we have to deserve it. Let me give you an example. There are 300,000 American soldiers in Europe. There will be no more than 100,000 in 1995, or little more than that. Are we in a position to form a European army, a pillar of the Atlantic Alliance, at the service of the UN resolutions to ensure that peace, the freedom and independence of peoples is respected? This is the question which is put to us. [Sinclair] And what is your reply, in your opinion are we ready or not? [Delors] We are not yet quite ready, but it is not by rejecting what has already been accomplished in the construction of Europe that we will make progress toward this objective. [Sinclair] Russia might be present at the July G-7 meeting. [passage omitted] [Delors] I would personally include other countries in the G-7. [Sinclair] Which countries, for example? [Delors] I think there should be an African country like Nigeria; China, when it respects democratic rules, India and Mexico. [passage omitted]. As for Russia, I think there is quite a contrast between Russia the big political power and Russia plagued by all its economic problems. But I think Russia the great political power is now working for peace. [passage omitted] On the other hand, I am very worried about the economic situation. [Sinclair] You are very worried about today's Russia. But this renders its associate membership in the G-7 a rather complicated matter, since the G-7 focuses on the economy. [Delors] This is why in Naples we will discuss the economy among ourselves and we will publish a document with the forecasts concerning us. The day after, Yeltsin will come for the political meeting. There is a difference between the economic and political parts of the meeting. [Sinclair] [passage omitted] A word about the countries of East Europe, which are asking with increasing frequency to be linked to Europe tomorrow and NATO perhaps sooner. We have seen in Hungary that the voters voted for the communists. The communists are back, they voted democratically for the communists, and that is true. Will those linked in the long term either to Europe or NATO not be adding political instability to economic instability? [Delors] Well, first of all, one has to know those communists, and let us leave their past aside, and furthermore some of them are very young, like the prime minister of Poland -- and I have made a mistake, as he is from the Peasant Party, but he governs with the communists. [Sinclair] In Hungary we have seen some of these figures returning. [Delors] Yes, in Hungary, but they are extremely competent men, but in order to join the European Union one has to fulfill three conditions: First, to be a multiparty democracy; second, to honor human rights as a whole; and third, to have an economy which is not dwarfed, which will not be crushed by the more efficient economies of the West. These conditions remain. However, at the moment the biggest problem of the countries of East Europe, apart from the economy -- although we are helping them as well as we can -- the biggest problem is that of security. These countries have the feeling of living in a lack of security because the problems of minorities arise, border questions have apparently not always been solved, and then there is the contamination of the Bosnian affair, and, you see, I am convinced that if the European Union did not exist then war would already have spread throughout the Balkans, and this should not be forgotten either. [passage omitted] [Sinclair] Do you agree with Bill Clinton who is now saying that the Bosnia arms embargo should not be lifted? [Delors] Bill Clinton brilliantly explained to me in May 1993 why we should lift the embargo. I understand that he is now embarrassed. But when today I hear what our negotiators are saying -- David Owen in particular; he is there and has been following the events for three years -- I fear that, given the Serbs' potential strength, if we lifted the embargo this would help the Bosnians and we would really have massacres. Maybe it was our fault, although the French minister of foreign affairs rightly recalled that we French have many troops deployed there and that the European Union has given 60 percent of the humanitarian aid, more than anybody else [sentence as heard]. We cannot forget that. In spite of all that, we must today consider what the situation is. [Sinclair] And what would happen if the Bosnia negotiations failed? [Delors] If the negotiations failed we should maybe consider lifting the embargo. But I think that lifting the embargo means that Western countries would inevitably have to intervene. We must understand this. It is not possible to wage war by proxy. If we gave weapons to the Bosnians and they were crushed.... [Sinclair, interrupting] They want weapons, not men. [Delors] Yes, indeed. But if they were crushed, it would be an even greater victory for ideology. I think that on the basis of the peace plan put forward by the European Union -- it is not perfect -- and things being what they are, we could have a peace solution. Not a very stable one, it would be somewhat precarious. But there is a condition: The ideology of ethnic cleansing must never be approved and in Serbia they have understood what this means. A peaceful Bosnia could cooperate with and be helped by the Europeans. [passage omitted]
