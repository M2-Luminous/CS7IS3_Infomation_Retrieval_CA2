He then said that he "will make every possible diplomatic effort for this draft resolution to be adopted." In an emergency meeting with reporters on the morning of that day, Minister Han said the above and added: "Our government's intent has considerably been reflected in the draft resolution." [Unidentified reporter] What is the composition of the draft resolution worked out by the United States? [Han Sung-chu] It is composed of a preamble and 20-point text. It can be summed up into the preamble and seven sorts of sanctions. [Unidentified reporter] Is the Russian proposal for eight-party talks mentioned in the draft resolution? [Han] It does not directly mention the Russian proposal but specifies that international talks could be promoted if North Korea meets the demands expressed in the resolution. [Unidentified reporter] Does it include any warning to North Korea of sanctions that may be imposed on it if North Korea declares its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty? [Han] Yes, it does. For example, suspension of remittances to North Korea and the freezing of assets are mentioned. [Unidentified reporter] What is China's reaction to it? [Han] I think China was notified of the U.S. draft resolution on the evening of 15 June our time. However, I have received no information on China's reaction. At present, it is hard to predict the Chinese reaction. What China must immediately decide is whether it will discuss the resolution with members of the UN Security Council or will express its own position on the draft resolution first. I think we shall learn it soon. [Unidentified reporter] How much has our intent been reflected in the draft resolution? [Han] The draft considerably reflects the result of working- level discussions by the ROK, the United States, and Japan that was confirmed during my recent visit to the United States. It contains effective constitution [hyogwajogin naeyong]. I think it will be a very strong means of pressure if it is adopted as it is. [Unidentified reporter] What influence has North Korea's declaration of its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency exerted upon the draft resolution? [Han] It accelerated the speed of working out the draft, rather than influenced its contents. [Unidentified reporter] Do you think the UN Security Council will proceed with the adoption of the draft by putting it to a vote? [Han] We have to see the result of further discussions on it. However, whether it will be put to a vote or not depends on North Korea's attitude, not on further discussions. [Unidentified reporter] The draft resolution contains an item forbidding the export of weapons. I wonder if it includes the authority to search ships. [Han] Embargo means more than the ban of exports. As is seen in all other resolutions on sanctions, a formula on the details of sanctions in this draft will separately be prepared. [Unidentified reporter] What sanctions can we exercise? [Han] Since it is based on international cooperation, I think we have to play a big role when the draft is adopted. We will have many to do so diplomatically and bilaterally [with North Korea]. [Unidentified reporter] How are behind-the-scene contacts between the United States and North Korea going? [Han] Although U.S. media report that they have contacts behind the scene, there has been no enveloped move between them. [Unidentified reporter] What is your opinion on the nullification or abolition of the declaration on denuclearizing the Korean peninsula that is included in the draft on sanctions? [Han] The government has mentioned that it is difficult to implement the declaration on denuclearization, but it is not reconsidering it. It is the government's basic principle that the declaration on denuclearization should be implemented.
