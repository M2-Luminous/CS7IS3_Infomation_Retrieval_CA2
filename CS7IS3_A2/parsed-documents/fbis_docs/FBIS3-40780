But having congratulated itself on emerging as "the single biggest party" in the country and for its overall poll percentage of 36.14 (a good 10 percent ahead of the nearest rival, the Congress), it went on to draw some "lessons" from its electoral defeat. Over-confidence, too much emphasis on national issues during the poll campaign, lack of discipline in some State units were among the factors held responsible for the debacle. Advani's note: Significantly, the key to the party's stand towards its electoral debacle came from a three-page note for consideration of the party's national executive committee which Mr. L.K. Advani, party president, sent from his confinement in Pipri, where he is under judicial custody in connection with the Babri demolition conspiracy case. Mr. Advani noted that the party had set a high target for itself, that of capturing power in five States. That has not happened. "The sprinter has failed to break another record." But that the BJP is still "numero uno" is not doubted by him, although he admits that it was inadequate compensation for the electoral defeat. The "apt comment" on the elections would be "loser stands first," Mr. Advani said. The task before the party, he advised the national executive, chaired in his absence by the senior vice-president Mr. Sundar Singh Bhandari, was to "so fine-tune our approach and strategy" that the present disappointment with the November Assembly election results proves a fleeting phase. Quite unequivocally, Mr. Advani said the setback in the election was not a setback for its ideology, for its support base had increased. "The enlargement of the party's popular base is proof that the party's ideology of cultural nationalism continues to gather more and more adherents," Mr. Advani stated. General secretaries' report: Today on the last of the two-day meeting of the national executive the party discussed not only Mr. Advani's note but also a report on the recent elections prepared jointly by the party's five general secretaries. The report, which has been by and large accepted by the executive, has concluded that several factors may have been responsible for the poor performance. These have been identified as over-confidence and complacency, failure to project unity at the organisational level in some of the States, tough and unpopular measures taken by some of its State Governments, too much emphasis on national issues rather than important local issues during the election campaign, and lack of adequate attention being paid to the backward and scheduled caste factors. Till late this evening the executive committee was discussing the draft political resolution which will be released tomorrow. However, it is learnt that the resolution will by and large reflect the position that the party has not fared badly, that its dizzy growth has been momentarily slowed down, that the general direction of the party and its main ideology needs to be strengthened rather than diluted, and that the task before the party is to rededicate itself to this task. Changes suggested: As a result of the experience from this Assembly election the general secretaries' report has suggested some changes in the method of selecting candidates. It has suggested that the party should invite applications from candidates only for those constituencies where it proposes to drop a sitting MP [member of Parliament] or MLA [member of Legislative Assembly] or change the candidate which had last fought elections from there. It also has a word of caution for future BJP governments--not to take too stiff and unpopular measures too soon--for the party has identified this factor as the main reason for its rout in Himachal Pradesh. The main discussion on the general secretaries report and the poll debacle was initiated last night by Mr. Sunderlal Patwa, former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh and the man most maligned in party circles as the villain of the electoral defeat in that State. Today's deliberations suggest that the party is opposed to singling him out or making him a scapegoat for the debacle, for after all in Himachal Pradesh the party suffered a complete rout. Madhya Pradesh was not the only State unit which was "sure" that the party would win hands down. In Uttar Pradesh, the report recorded, the party office-bearers had from the start of the campaign talked about "280 seats in our pocket." The party has been critical of this kind of complacency and has warned that in future too there could be new political alignments and the party would have to prepare itself well. PTI reports: The BJP is likely to call off its boycott of Parliament from tomorrow, the leader of the Opposition, Mr. A.B. Vajpayee, indicated. He said a final decision would be taken at the Parliamentary Party meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning. He said the boycott issue was discussed at length at the national executive and it was felt the party had registered its protest in Parliament against the continued "illegal detention" of its leaders in the Ayodhya case.
