Thirteen full and six half cantons accepted the referendum, which corresponds to 16 "canton votes" and, thus, a clear "yes" to the ban. A total of 52 percent of the Swiss voted for the referendum. Up until now, Switzerland has had a 28-tonne limit for trucks and a ban on night driving. The transit traffic ban says that as of 2004, goods may be transported through Switzerland only by train and that no new roads through the Alps may be built.
