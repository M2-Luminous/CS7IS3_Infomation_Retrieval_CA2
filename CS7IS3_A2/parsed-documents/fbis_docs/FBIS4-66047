The balance of forces between Guerraists and renewalists is virtually the same as before, and Alfonso Guerra currently controls 42 percent of the party, while the renewalists hold 58 percent. This balance is also apparent in the makeup of the Federal Committee, which will be completed with the holding in the summer of the three remaining regional congresses -- the Canary Islands, La Rioja, and Navarre -- although these federations' results are not decisive as far as the distribution of forces is concerned. Ignored So the failure of integration is one of the main conclusions that have been reached following the holding of the PSOE provincial and regional congresses. Renewalists and Guerraists have ignored the "integration efforts" made by Organization Secretary Cipria Ciscar, who has done his utmost to achieve this aim with his interventions in the federations. The process of the regional and provincial congresses shows that Guerra dominates six federations -- Galicia, Murcia, Cantabria, Aragon, Extremadura, and Asturias -- while the renewalists have achieved ascendancy in the Balearics, Castilla-Leon, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha, and Andalusia. Nevertheless, the last-mentioned federation -- the PSOE's largest and most important -- is divided into two, as is the case in Madrid. Strictly speaking, integration has really worked only in Valencia and the Basque Country. The three remaining provinces -- La Rioja, Navarre, and the Canary Islands --will have to be added to the renewalists' tally. The members of the Federal Committee, on which Alfonso Guerra has succeeded in "narrowing the gap" in the balance of forces to a substantial extent, have also been selected in this process. Lists Committee This fact assumes particular importance as regards the future, since it is the Federal Committee that will have to approve the lists committee that will designate candidates for the 1995 municipal and autonomous community elections, as well as the pacts policy to be followed by the PSOE. All this makes it clear that the division in the PSOE still exists in a ratio that is virtually the same as that estimated before the 33d congress, at which the renewalists' aim of crushing the Guerraists was not achieved. The integration advocated by Gonzalez has come to nothing, and the trial of strength between the two sectors still exists. The Guerraists are satisfied at having succeeded in "holding on to 42 percent," while the renewalists, although emphasizing the victory of holding the majority in the party, criticize themselves somewhat for having been unable to reduce their rivals to a minority.
