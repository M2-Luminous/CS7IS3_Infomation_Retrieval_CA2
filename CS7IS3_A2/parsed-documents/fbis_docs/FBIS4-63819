[passage omitted] [Correspondent K. Mazheyka] At this moment, as you are watching this report, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who arrived in Brussels an hour ago, is setting out our conception of partnership. [Begin Grachev recording] I have simply brought Russia's vision of the Partnership for Peace. The first section is political partnership. The second section is military partnership, and the third section is a miscellaneous one. These are the specifically worked out parameters of our partnership. We shall propose that our representatives and the special representatives of the NATO countries draw up a broad-scale agreement. When it is ready, we will sign two documents: a general conception of the partnership and the agreement that will be drawn up if the NATO members accept it. [end recording]
