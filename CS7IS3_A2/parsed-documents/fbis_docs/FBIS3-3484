Is this good or bad? This has been a controversial, hot topic for a long time. During the current sessions of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] and the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], this topic has not only remained hot but has also become a more serious one. NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members have linked the proper handling of the rural labor force to the work to improve peasants' lives and to stabilize the overall situation. The NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members believe that the "tide of workers" is a sign of the historical progress of China's traditional agricultural society being transformed into a modern one. They said: In a sense, the trend is reasonable as well as inevitable. However, while the flow of workers has created huge material wealth, it has brought with it or given rise to some social problems. To properly solve the employment problem of the more than 100 million surplus workers currently in rural areas, we cannot simply set our eyes on moving them to cities -- we should simultaneously organize peasants' migration and provide them with jobs in their hometowns, and we should come up with new ideas and develop various industries and trades. "The homeland is as good as the outside world," said Deputy Shen Zhifeng, who is mayor of Shijiazhuang city. Over the last few years, Shijiazhuang has encouraged peasants to develop high-yield, good-quality, and highly efficient agriculture. Currently, the city has 1 million mu of high-efficiency cash crops and more than 12 million chickens, rabbits, cattle, and pigs. Last year, the per capita income of the city's peasants increased 100 yuan over the previous year. Shen Zhifeng said, "Once there are more opportunities in rural areas and people's incomes are higher, who will be willing to leave their dear ones at home and go to cities to take their chances?" Hebei Province is only one example. Deputy Shao Qihui, who is governor of Heilongjiang Province, said: In the northeast, thousands or tens of thousand of peasants now have become better off by breeding fish, raising hunting dogs or deer, or growing flowers, and some of them have made tens of thousands of yuan or even hundreds of thousands of yuan a year. To properly solve the problem of the surplus work force in rural areas, we must take into consideration the entire rural economic development situation and broaden the scope and increase the depth of agriculture. Deputy Tian Chengping, who is governor of Qinghai Province, considered the development of village and town enterprises as a "huge water reservoir" for absorbing the rural labor force. He said: The economic gap between the eastern and western parts of the country is the cause of the outflow of peasants from the central and western parts of the country, and it is also a potential solution to the problem of the surplus rural work force. If the source areas of the "tide of workers" can quicken the pace of village and town enterprise development, taking the local reality into consideration, and starting from developing relatively simple industries that require little investment and yield quick results, then they not only can boost local economic development but also can create millions of jobs. By dealing with rural problems through another approach, we will be able to see that even now there are many opportunities for success in rural areas. It is clear that as long as one can meet the demands of the market, can come up with new ideas, and is willing to work hard, peasants also can find a way to become better off in their own home areas.
