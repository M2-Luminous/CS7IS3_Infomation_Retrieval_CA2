SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A SIP revision was submitted by the State of Alabama on November 13, 1992, to satisfy the requirements of section 182(a)(3)(B) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) (November 15, 1990). The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, Appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal was found to be complete and a letter dated December 24, 1992, was sent to Mr. Richard Grusnick, Chief of the Air Division in the Alabama Department of Environmental Management indicating the submittal was administratively complete. There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically, the state must submit a revision to its SIP and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements for reporting. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability, definitions, compliance, and specific source requirements detailed below. A. SIP Revision Submission. The State of Alabama submitted their emission statement regulation on November 13, 1992, which meets the emission statement requirement. B. Program Elements. The State emission statement program must, at a minimum, include provisions covering applicability of the regulations, a compliance schedule for sources covered by the regulations, and the specific reporting requirements for sources. The emission statement submitted by the source should contain, at a minimum, a certification that the information is accurate to the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement. These requirements can be found in subpart D on page 2, of section 2, of chapter 11, in the Alabama SIP.
