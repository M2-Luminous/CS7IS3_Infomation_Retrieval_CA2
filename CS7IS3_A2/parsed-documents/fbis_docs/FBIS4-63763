This is the third serious fire at the Black Sea Fleet in the past year and the second in the last 10 days. This time the fire occurred at a fuel and lubricant depot located in the city center near the city's oil tanks. It was only thanks to prompt action by firemen that the fire did not spread to the oil tanks. The scale of the damage and causes of the fire are being established. As firemen told KOMMERSANT-DAILY, a report about a fire at a military depot located 150 meters from the city's oil tanks came in at the central control point of the Vladivostok Fire Security Department. According to the firemen, non-disposable fuel and lubricants were stored at the depot: cannon grease, machine oil, and other types. Ivan Kopot, deputy chief of the Fire Safety Department, said that the Vladivostok oil tanks are a transshipment point for fuel deliveries to the entire Maritime Kray and are also used for filling vessels, including oil tankers. The fire was rated at three on the scale of difficulty (out of five). Ten fire engines and a fire train were sent to the area. The work was complicated by the fact that water in the hydrants on the storage premises was so polluted that the fire engine hoses were repeatedly blocked. However within an hour the seat of the fire was localized and soon it was extinguished completely. It is noteworthy that the two previous large fires at the Pacific Fleet depots cost fleet commanders Gennadiy Khvatov and Georgiy Gurinov their posts.
