This is because this committee, which includes several Saudi lawyers, academics, and men of religion who oppose persecution, corruption, and violation of human rights in Saudi Arabia and whose members are subjected to various forms of murder, imprisonment, torture, and pursuit, is crying out day and night, collecting evidences and facts, and presenting documents on the Saudi regime's violations of human rights. Yet the imperialist West turns a deaf ear to these violations and laments human rights in other countries where individuals live in dignity and honor and work for their countries' development and progress. For instance, we hear Max Van Der Stoel [UN rapporteur on Iraqi human rights] howling about alleged human rights violations in Iraq and Sudan, yet he and his overlords know that human rights are violated only in countries under imperialist domination, and that the Saudi regime provides one of the outstanding examples of real and serious violation of human rights. The human rights committee in Saudi Arabia strives to achieve certain basic demands for the individual, and one would assume that these demands are achievable at any time and place. However, the savageness of the Saudi regime and the imperialist regimes' condoning of the savageness and tyranny to which individuals are exposed in Saudi Arabia has encouraged Fahd's regime to continue persecuting the Arab masses there. Human rights standards are supposed to be the same everywhere in the world. They are also supposed to be harmonious with the World Declaration of Human Rights and other UN conventions and to be applied correctly, not selectively. Therefore, violating these rights in Saudi Arabia and lamenting them in Iraq, Sudan, and other countries, as Van Der Stoel and others in the U.S. State Department would have it, is unacceptable under any circumstances. Moreover, they cannot convince anyone and their actions cannot but be disapproved and ridiculed by all free men in the world. A review of the world's record on human rights will reveal many Western scandals in this regard. The imperialist West defends the most oppressive and terroristic regimes in the world. It defends the Zionist entity, which kills Arabs en masse, plunges them into prisons and detention camps, blows up their homes, burns their farms and plantations, and expels them from their country, Palestine. The imperialist West also defends the Saudi regime, which throws strugglers into prisons or drops them from planes to be devoured by ravenous beasts in the desert. The Saudi regime also bans the freedom of speech and the establishment of political parties. Saudi Arabia has not witnessed any real parliamentary system expressing the demands and aspirations of the Arab people in the Arabian Peninsula. Furthermore, the Saudi regime is not known to respect public opinion. This Western political hypocrisy expresses the barbaric mentality of imperialism and its disregard for human rights when the matter concerns those who are outside the circle of imperialist domination. This is well understood by freedom-loving peoples, which is why they are always struggling to achieve their basic human rights away from the mentality and aggressive plans of the imperialists, who only care about their interests and commercial markets; indeed, everything commercial.
