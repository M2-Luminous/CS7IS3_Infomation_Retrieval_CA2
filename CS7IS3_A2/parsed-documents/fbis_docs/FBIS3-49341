Szilvia Enkakarov reports from the scene. [Enkakarov] The organizers somewhat miscalculated the number of participants of the general assembly when they predicted 1,400-1,500 people. A few minutes before 1300 hours, there were massive queues in front of the sports hall's entrance, despite the fact that the hall was already hopelessly full. Before the beginning of the general assembly, some 3,000 people entered the sports hall. Among the guests are representatives of the government office headed by Ludovit Fliegel. Teodor Kriska and Roman Filister from the presidential office are also attending. [passage omitted] In his opening speech, Istvan Pasztor, mayor of Komarno and chairman of the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny Ostrov, greeted those present and read out the letter of Ms. Catherine Lalumiere addressed to the Komarno general assembly. It emerged from the letter that observers of the Council of Europe could not take part in the event because, in a few days' time, on 17-18 January, a four-member expert committee will visit Slovakia to learn about the Slovak Republic's plans for administrative and regional division. The agenda read out by Istvan Pasztor was adopted by the participants. According to the agenda, the general assembly's four main topics are the legal situation of local governments, Slovakia's administrative and regional reorganization, the constitutional status of the Hungarians of Slovakia, and the report on the initiative for the association of the elected representatives of Southern Slovakia. The mayors and representatives present will be given the opportunity to express their views in the debate. They can analyze the topics they are most interested in, in three-minute-long speeches, said the mayor of Komarno. The mayor concluded his speech with the following thought, which received great applause: "Our aim is not to pull the country apart but together to try to solve our country's problems within the country's borders." Speeches are being delivered at the moment. At the end of the general assembly, a news conference will be held in the Komarno town community center at 1700. My next report from the scene will be at 1730.
