He rejected as groundless allegations that it is possible to dismantle the submarine missile launchers and assemble them again for use in land complexes. The vice-admiral said the ballyhoo in Japan around the sale of 12 disarmed Russian submarines to North Korea aims at spreading disinformation. Many experts in the Russian Defence Ministry confirm to ITAR-TASS that they shared the vice-admiral's view. According to them, Japanese media reports were published in order to alleviate the shock caused by the fact that 70 kilogrammes of powdered plutonium were found in Japan's atomic industry centre, an amount sufficient to manufacture nine atomic bombs.
