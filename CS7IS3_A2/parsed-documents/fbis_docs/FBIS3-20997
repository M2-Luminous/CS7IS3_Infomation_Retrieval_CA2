In fact, at the end of December, the formal acts required by the Italian civil code for the constitution of the sole telecommunications operator, which will have its new organizational structure by 1994, will be completed. Even if the new company, Telecom Italia, does not formally exist, the general lines for its development have already been traced out at STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company]. The plan for the next three years is not, as plans in former years have been, a "company" plan. It has been prepared as a "business" plan in view of the current situation. It is a group plan that will identify itself with the new operator plan. It is not the sum of various company plans, but a plan for a new integrated organization. It contains the basic directives and the stages of realization up to 1996. Italian telecommunications have started to move in two directions in recent months. The first is the legal definition of the form of Telecom Italia, starting 1 January under the convention, and should in any case be finalized by next September. The second will establish the operational structure of the company, with the first three-year plan being constructed "in the laboratory." Though the companies are still separate, STET is busy preparing a plan which is based on the logic of a single organization and not on the simple coordination of autonomous programs. This first attempt is the premise that will make the single plan operational for the next period: the three years 1995-1997. This will be the real organizational plan for Telecom Italia and will be created using this new logic from the beginning. The strategies are being prepared. Successively they will be verified by the units dealing with the individual products, and then nationally. The feedback will be put together to initiate the process of adaptation to actual market requirements. To get an idea of the task awaiting the new single operator we should consider the fact that the number of telephone subscribers in our country will increase from 22.35 million in 1990 (with a density of 39.78 percent), to 25.19 million in 1995, and 29.83 million in 2000 with a density of 52.1 percent. According to forecasts, the percentage increase of subscribers over the decade 1991-2000 will touch 33.5 percent. In market terms, a total of ECU92.562 billion is forecast for the decade 1991-2000. Telecom Italia is being set up to be the sole operator of all the services that are subject to controls at the present time. It is easy to see that when we get to 1998, with the complete liberalization planned by the EEC, the operational structures will have to adapt to the new situation. In fact, the operators for the services to be liberalized will either have structures that are based on existing divisions, or distinct entities will be formed. The operator could have a structure based on operational divisions for controlled services, and perhaps have independent structures for the services that are not controlled. Telecom Italia will come under the STET holding company, so it will be alongside other companies (software companies, manufacturers, etc.). Relationships with the outside world, the general policy, and coordination will be defined at a holding level to make the maximum use of existing synergies. The telecommunications world is complex so it is difficult to outline a definitive policy at this moment. For example, mobile radio services, that is small mobile telephones that are available today using structures of superimposed networks interconnected with the fixed network, still remain an open issue. It is necessary to define regulations for interconnection by evaluating both the technical problems and the economic problems (access charges and others). In any case, with the liberalization planned for the coming years, the operator will be able to offer customers a "package" of services using a single system that is the result of very close integration. Internationalization Telecommunications is moving toward a world that has no frontiers. The most recent forecasts indicate that in 1995 more than half a billion of the 5.1 billion inhabitants of the world will be telephone subscribers, with a density of 11.68 percent. At the start of the new century there will be 5.4 billion inhabitants and the subscribers will increase to 723.4 million, this being a density of 13.32 percent. A percentage increase of 44.7 percent is forecast for telephone subscribers during the decade 1991-2000. Furthermore, processes are under way to open up markets for telecommunications services that will provide interesting prospects for the operators. These facts alone show that operators must undertake a process of internationalization aimed at reinforcing overseas markets. There are two roads that can be followed. The first is tendering for licenses in countries where the system is being privatized. This type of participation would also provide the other members of the group with opportunities. For example, in Argentina, STET, having acquired the telecommunications license for the north of the country, is providing new openings for both manufacturers and for plant installation. The second road is that of the problem of alliances with foreign organizations. This affects all the group, which operates in all areas of the information technology sector, and has areas of convergence between the operators of services, constructors of equipment, and producers of software. In the United States, a colossus like AT&T allies itself with various local partners to offer its own services/products on a world basis. In this context the goal of the operator must be to "serve" business clients, and in particular the multinationals, with a new supply capability. That is to say the operator must be capable of satisfying the communications requirements of its clients with technical commercial structures, and with a portfolio of products/services that can satisfy a demand that is becoming more and more personalized, and that as far as geographical dimension is concerned, often goes outside national boundaries. It is a process that will become more and more important in the world of the future and that will cause a major ferment in the new markets. For this reason the sole Italian operator has launched its own policy of internationalization, as the major operators throughout the world are trying to do. It is an obligatory choice in order to face the opening up of the markets, in which the competition tends to acquire the richest parts, given that the market cannot be defended by staying at home. Telecom Italia, like the other operators, must rapidly insert itself in international alliances where the goal is to protect the world market that will no longer be regional but global at the end of this decade following liberalization. The choices are: 1) To have local distribution agreements for the services of third parties; 2) To be one of those operating at a global level, constructing services together with other administrations. The Italian telecommunications system is classified sixth in the world for volume of business. Because of its size and what it can offer, it cannot remain limited to its own country. The Italian operator cannot just be a distributor at a local level. It must enter into alliances with partners who will contribute to increased competitivity at a world level in order to protect its clients at home, to acquire shares in international markets, and to carry out the role of a global operator with an infrastructure, commercial network, and portfolio of products/services that enable it to acquire competitiveness worldwide. The policy of alliances has been pursued for some time by other countries, and from now on it will be a point of fundamental importance for modern operators. We cannot wait until Telecom Italia is ready with all its structures: for this reason work is already being done so that the new operator can start off with a precise direction for its actions in the international market. The network of alliances should therefore be operative when the new sole operator is officially formed. An essential point is the choice of partners. It is necessary to choose partners that have common objectives, in order to combine capacities and resources, and to be able to increase presence on the market. The characteristics of individual operators should be taken into consideration when seeking partners to bring complementary activities together, thereby attaining greater competitive strength. If Italy is to retain its place within the "group of the seven most industrialized countries" the Italian telecommunications system but must be an active, not a subordinate, partner in the new initiatives. It must play a role of equal dignity in the game of alliances that is being defined and must build up relationships with the goal of offering global services: This will start in the first instance with an agreement between operators. Then it will be possible to think about successive agreements with other bodies (for example in the software sector, etc.), to extend the competitivity of the group, utilizing the synergies of an integrated system like STET. The STET group is looking at the future as a challenge that is presenting itself at a moment that is rich both in opportunities and in threats. The opening up of world markets, and their complete liberalization, are fundamental elements characterizing the new scene in which the operators have to move. The STET group, understanding the size of the problem that has to be faced from an organizational point of view, and the strategic choices that are necessary, has already started to introduce greater efficiency and productivity on the operational structures side and to also acquire greater competitivity for the entire range of its products/services through alliances that can ensure suitable complementarity.
