Military officials said northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih were just outside the suburb of Dar Sa'd on Thursday morning after heavy fighting overnight. Dar Sa'd is virtually deserted as residents have fled the suburb in recent days after it suffered sustained shelling and rocket fire. Hospital officials said the three civilians were killed as they queued during the night at one of the city's wells in the western suburb of Mansurah. Northern forces were also within five kilometers of Mansurah, according to southern officials loyal to Salih's former vice president and southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid. But in Moscow the two sides were said to be close to signing a ceasefire later Thursday after talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, the ITAR-TASS agency reported. The news came only hours after the UN Security Council adopted a second resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire and the start of talks. After the vote, UN officials said a southern Yemen representative pledged that Aden would observe a 48-hour ceasefire starting Thursday to allow the delivery of relief supplies. Two explosions rocked the city early Thursday, causing casualties, officials at the Al-Jumhuriyah hospital said, without giving details. More than 424 civilians have been killed and 1,170 wounded since the north began its assault on the city on June 11. Northern warplanes and artillery pounded the port on Wednesday in a day of intense bombardments which killed 20 civilians and wounded 96. Humanitarian workers have warned that Aden is on the edge of a "catastrophe" stripped of water and fuel supplies. Northern troops have cut off the south's access to its oil refinery, destroyed the water pumping station and intense battles have raged at Hiswah, 10 kilometres (six miles) from the city where Aden's main power station is based. Southern forces have dug in on the edge of Aden erecting sand barriers and hollowing out trenches to repel the north's advance. The Security Council also authorized Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to study ways to supervise a ceasefire at its meeting in UN headquarters in New York. The resolution also denounced the civilian casualties and destruction resulting from the assault on Aden, in what was seen as a condemnation of northern Yemen. But US Ambassador Madeleine Albright said after the vote that any ceasefire mechanism should be handled by neighboring states for financial and other reasons. Kozyrev held a series of private and joint meetings Wednesday with Yemen Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah and Salim Salih Muhammad, a representative from the breakaway Democratic Republic of Yemen. ITAR-TASS said some technical details still remained to be resolved but described the accord as an "important step" towards resolving the conflict on the Arabian peninsula. For nearly 25 years, prior to the reunification of North and South Yemen in 1990, South Yemen was an ally of the former Soviet Union. War broke out on May 5 and al-Bid declared a separate state two weeks later, shattering a fragile four-year union between the former Marxist South Yemen and conservative tribal North Yemen.
