FBIS4-1021 "drafr075_c_94030" FBIS-AFR-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA ANC Statement on Alleged Kidnapping in PWV Office ANC Statement on Alleged Kidnapping in PWV Office MB1804190394 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1738 GMT 18 Apr 94 MB1804190394 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Statement issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 18 April] [Text] Re: alleged kidnapping of four people in the ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional offices The officials of the ANC PWV region met this morning, Monday, April 18, 1994, after receiving reports in the news about the alleged kidnapping of people in our regional offices. Officials received information from the security personnel of the region which points out the following: 1. That it is true that people were brought to the regional offices by one of the security personnel employed by the region. 2. That the presence of those people in the building had nothing to do with organisational matters. The individual involved was conducting his own personal investigation after his car was broken into. After receiving the report of the incident, ANC PWV regional officials convened an urgent meeting to consider our response to the situation. It is not ANC policy to hold people against their will no matter what their crime is. We believe any individual involved in any form of crime, should be handed over to the police. The ANC PWV region regrets this incident and condemns it in the strongest terms. The following steps have been agreed upon by the officials: 1. The security person involved is suspended with immediate effect. Internal investigations are continuing, and should any other person be found to be implicated in the incident, appropriate action will be taken. 2. To remain in close liaison with the police and to co-operate with investigations in this matter. The ANC response to this incident demonstrates our commitment to transparent and open government and a clean administration. The same cannot be said of the National Party government. To date, the present government still fails to account to the nation about third force activities, deaths in detention, corruption and maladministration. Our chairperson, Tokyo Sexwale, spoke on Saturday at the Zoo Lake: "All criminal elements, must know that the new government is bad news for them. We believe in a clean government and that we will clean up crime in this province and in the whole country." No member of the ANC is immune from disciplinary action. This type of behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.
