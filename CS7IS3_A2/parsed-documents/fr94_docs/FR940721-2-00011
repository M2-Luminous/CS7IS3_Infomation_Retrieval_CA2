ACTION: Notice of revocation of antidumping duty order. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce is notifying the public of its revocation of the antidumping duty order on photo albums and photo album filler pages from Hong Kong because it is no longer of any interest to domestic interested parties. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David Levy or Michael Panfeld, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230, telephone (202) 482&hyph;4737. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 27, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (58 FR 68391) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping duty order on photo albums and photo album filler pages from Hong Kong (December 16, 1985). Additionally, as required by 19 CFR §353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent to revoke this antidumping duty order on each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested parties who might object to the revocation were provided 30 days to submit their comments. Scope of the Order Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of photo albums and photo album filler pages from Hong Kong. This merchandise is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 3920.00.00, 3921.00.00, 3926.90.00, 4819.50.00, 4820.50.00, 4820.90.00, and 4823.90.00. The HTS numbers are provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The Department may revoke an antidumping duty order if the Secretary concludes that the duty order is no longer of any interest to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping duty order when no interested party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic interested party objects to revocation (19 CFR §353.25(d)(4)(iii)). In this case, we received no request for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested party, as defined under §353.2 (i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping duty order on photo albums and photo album filler pages from Hong Kong is no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking this antidumping duty order in accordance with 19 CFR §353.25(d)(4)(iii). This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of photo albums and photo album filler pages from Hong Kong entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after December 1, 1993. Entries made during the period December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1993, will be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR §353.22(e). The Department will instruct the Customs Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after December 1, 1993, without regard to antidumping duties, and to refund any estimated antidumping duties collected with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR §353.25(d). Dated: July 14, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance.
