Only two hours after adopting the law on restoring the constitutional foundations of statehood on the peninsula, it adopted a resolution on compulsory military service for Crimean citizens. According to this document, sending Crimean conscripts to serve in other regions of Ukraine is halted simultaneously with the adoption of the resolution. They will be sent outside the Crimea only with their consent. The Supreme Council charged military commissars of the Crimean Republic and Sevastopol with ensuring implementation of this resolution. Explaining the adoption of this resolution, the deputies were referring to the bullying of conscripts [words indistinct], as well as an anti-Crimean syndrome apparently widespread in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, predominantly in western oblasts. At the same time, Crimean Military Commissar Oleksandr Volkov, assured that, according to agreements reached with the autonomous republic, conscripts have not been sent to these oblasts for a year and a half. He also noted that the implementation of this resolution is unrealistic due to the lack of efficient material utilization and education in the Crimea.
