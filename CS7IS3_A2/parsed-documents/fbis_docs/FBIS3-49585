This interview is being recorded on Tuesday morning, only a few hours before Bill Clinton's arrival. Do you think that choosing our capital city for the Visegrad Four summit testifies to something that is good for our country? [Klaus] I do not think we should get involved in endless polemics with our neighbors as to why this meeting is taking place in Prague and not in Budapest or Warsaw. This is pointless, and I know that our neighbors are very sensitive to this sort of thing. On the other hand, it is quite obvious, evident, and clear that choosing Prague was not an act of God and that, therefore, the U.S. side had a reason for making this choice. [Stahlavsky] In this context, one should note that the volume of U.S. foreign investment in our country is the second highest. In 1993, total foreign investment amounted to $0.5 billion. Was it enough? [Klaus] I think this was just right, really quite right. I have said repeatedly that it is not the government's job to artificially accelerate or, through various errors, to slow down the influx of foreign investment. This level of foreign investment is absolutely adequate to what the economy needs. I would like to warn, however, against accelerating the influx of foreign capital into nonprivatized enterprises. [Stahlavsky] When I look back at the days past, one of the important events was undoubtedly Slovakia's overdraft on the limit credit in the mutual clearing account with the Slovak Republic, as well as the relatively fast settlement of this overdraft. However, you said that the method of Czech-Slovak clearing is being analyzed, and you did not rule out its reassessment. [Klaus] When speaking about the reassessment or supplements to the system, I am not thinking about abolishing it or changing it in any fundamental way. I think the fast Slovak payment is a signal that the Slovak side really fulfills the things that are part of an already signed agreement. This is something for our citizens to differentiate between. As for the property issue, no agreement has been achieved yet. However, where there is an agreement, the Slovak side meets its obligations with great precision. This was also the case in this particular event. [passage omitted] [Stahlavsky] [passage omitted] At the end of the last year, you indicated that there is a certain revival of useful economic contacts with the countries of the former so-called real socialism bloc. What is your idea of our future cooperation with these countries, especially now, after we, as an unofficial spokesman of Central and East Europe, became a member of the UN Security Council? [Klaus] The contacts of the Czech Government and Czech politicians, as well as the contacts of Czech business with eastern countries, are growing rather than declining. I think--and I repeat this--this is good. The Cabinet has made decisions about a number of trips that should take place this year. I am personally sure about a visit to Moscow. Nevertheless, this will be possible when there has been some stabilization, when it has become clear what the newly established parliament will do, whether the stability of the government will or will not be maintained. In any case, I hope this will be decided within a few weeks, and my visit should certainly take place then. I expect to visit the Baltic republics. I have an invitation from all three governments of these countries. An invitation from Belarus is on my table, as is one from Ukraine. [passage omitted]
