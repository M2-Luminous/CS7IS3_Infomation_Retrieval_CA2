FBIS4-48465 "drafr098_z_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-098 Daily Report 19 May 1994 EAST AFRICA Somalia Aidid, Delegation Return To Mogadishu Aidid, Delegation Return To Mogadishu EA2005101994 (Clandestine) Radio Mogadishu Voice of the Great Somali People in Somali 1700 GMT 19 May 94 EA2005101994 (Clandestine) Radio Mogadishu Voice of the Great Somali People Somali BFN [Excerpts] Mohamed Farah Aidid, USC chairman and leader of the Somali National Alliance [SNA], and USC chairman and his large delegation have returned to Mogadishu after visiting a number of African and Arab countries and participating in the Nairobi conference of Somali leaders. Addressing thousands of people who gathered to welcome him at the 1 July Independence Square, Mohamed Farah Aidid spoke about his visit to Djibouti and Uganda where he attended the Pan-African Movement Congress conference. [passage omitted] He said although a few people believe that a government cannot be formed in the country that is not the case. On the week-long meeting in Addis Ababa between the SNA and the Somali National Movement [SNM] and the movement's stand on the Somali people's unity, Mr. Aidid said the SNA supports the SNM stand as this is a remedy for the Somali people's unity and will serve the aspirations of the people living in the northwestern regions. He appealed for this constructive step to be welcomed. The SNA leader also spoke about the failed preparatory conference which was scheduled to be held in Mogadishu and which, he said, was caused by meetings of the Somali Salvation Democratic Front and the Somali Patriotic Movement, and because of the situation in Kismaayo. The SNA has never requested a postponement of the conference, but only supported the postponement requests from other quarters. He said that Somali organizations, including the SNM, would meet in Mogadishu on 30 May to discuss the government structure to be formed, taking into account each organization's influence. He appealed to those involved in preparing the conference to assist in specific areas, and to try not to interfere in the areas they have not been assigned to. Mr. Aidid called on the Somali people to guard against those who make it a habit to serve foreigners, until a government is formed. He referred to the importance of peace, the peace agreements in the central and northwestern regions, and the Kah Hotel agreement. He wished the outgoing peace conference in Kismaayo success. Aidid demonstrated how self-seekers serving foreigners are responsible for setting the brotherly SNA people against each other. [passage omitted] Mr. Aidid called for the protection of foreigners in Somalia. Speaking on his own behalf and on that of the SNA, Mr. Aidid congratulated the Somali people and the world Muslim community on the occasion of 'Id al-Adha.
