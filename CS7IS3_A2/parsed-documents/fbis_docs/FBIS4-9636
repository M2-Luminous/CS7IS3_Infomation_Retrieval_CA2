What does the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] see as the reasons for this? [Rabar] There seems to be a general agreement that the budget deficit is a result of lost revenue. Is this due to the very little revenue-producing ability of the Hungarian economy or the absence of taxes from the gray and black economy? The recipes for remedying the problems are obvious: Incomes in the economy must be increased, and in the other case, the collection of taxes must be made stricter. The latter would only be useful if the tax system were changed such a way that would make it worthwhile for the entrepreneurs to come out into the open economy. [Correspondent] It seems that the KDNP, like the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], does not advocate the immediate reduction of the budget deficit. [Rabar] We must temporarily put up with the existence of a budget deficit. The current level is obviously too high and cannot be maintained in the long run. However, we have to get out of the vicious circle that there is no income, which in turn increases the budget deficit, so we increase taxes to finance the deficit, and this further reduces the income of the actors in the economy. This can only be broken if we put up with a high budget deficit for a while. However, I would emphasize that the economy can only bear this budget deficit temporarily and to a certain degree. [Correspondent] How would you resolve the financing of the deficit? [Rabar] The deficit can be financed either from domestic or foreign sources. The latter results in upsetting the balance of payments and the economy can also only tolerate this for a limited period of time. However, the current level of foreign currency reserves makes it possible to finance the external deficit. This would give some breathing space to the Hungarian economy and, in the meantime, measures can be used to boost the market. To achieve this, it is vitally important to stimulate savings and investment on the supply side, which can mainly be done through high real interest rates. This has been the practice up to now because the government has tried to keep interest rates high. Savings have increased in recent years but these resources did not reenter the economy. On the supply side, we also need to have an aggressive policy to boost exports. Tax reductions are the most effective way of encouraging investment but this would again result in a temporary growth of the budget deficit. However, when the economy begins to grow, then the tax revenue will also increase. Some kind of interest rate support could be another way of encouraging investment. This means that all or part of the interest on loans taken on for investment is paid by the state. [Correspondent] On the demand side, what kind of measures would you introduce to boost the economy? [Rabar] We would try to increase the purchasing power of those groups of society whose consumption habits do not create too much inflation and do not increase imports. I am mainly thinking of food consumption, which accounts for a large section of spending among the lower income group. Increased food purchases can certainly be satisfied from domestic production; therefore, the increased income of pensioners and large families can have positive effects on the economy. [Correspondent] How, through what measures would you increase the income of these groups in society? [Rabar] It would mainly be worthwhile changing the tax system. We would keep the two-tier value added tax system but we would change the products in preferential categories. This way, we would end up with a price structure that favors products consumed by people on low incomes. It is also possible that after the initial regrouping, parallel to the improved economic situation, we would also reduce the tax level to a certain extent. [Correspondent] To what extent would you change the structure of personal taxation? [Rabar] Personal taxation should be made a direct tool of income policy. The burden on people with lower incomes should definitely be reduced, but I would not like to talk about further changes because we will have to consider the consequences of the changes very carefully. [Correspondent] We have not yet mentioned entrepreneurs. What does the KDNP promise them? I recall that the entrepreneurs complain mainly about high wage costs. [Rabar] We want mainly to lay emphasis on new small and medium-sized enterprises and to encourage the inflow of foreign capital. I agree that social security contributions are high. The stimulation of enterprises is closely linked to the inflow of capital. It is not so certain that the areas where wages are low are more attractive for foreign capital. On the other hand, the structure of incoming capital has to be closely examined. This would show that most of the incoming capital is seeking markets here, rather than investing to create markets or to bring in technology. This means, that, in the long run, Western capital is hoping for markets.
