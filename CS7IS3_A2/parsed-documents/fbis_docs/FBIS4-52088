Would you please appraise the results of these visits? [Nguyen Manh Cam] These two countries have some similar features but have different approaches in their relations with Vietnam. First, Indonesia and Iran are both active members of the Nonaligned Movement. Indonesia, as chairman of the Movement, has made great efforts in carrying out its activities. Second, these two countries have great potential for economic development. The two nations share the same aspiration to expand relations with Vietnam in various aspects. Indonesia has maintained long-standing relations with Vietnam; it has been almost four decades since the establishment of consulates general between the two nations. During this period, Vietnam-Indonesia relations have developed consistently in various fields. Although this relationship has sometimes declined, it has developed vigorously following President Suharto's official visit to Vietnam in late 1990 and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's official friendship visit to Indonesia in October 1991. Since then, Vietnam's relations with Indonesia and the other ASEAN countries have shifted to a new era -- an era of cooperation and development. Over the past two or more years, these relations have developed rapidly. The value of goods exchanged between the two countries reached $255 million in 1993, compared to $192 million in 1991. Regarding economic cooperation, Indonesian businesses have invested in various projects in Vietnam and have been granted licenses [words indistinct]. In addition, the two countries have expanded cooperation in the fields of culture, science, and national defense. We have had relations with Iran for over 20 years -- since 1973. In the past we have not have much activity in economic and trade cooperation because of unfavorable geographical conditions. Over the past few years, however, our trade relations with Iran have improved remarkably. President Le Duc Anh's visit to Indonesia and Iran was aimed at strengthening friendship and cooperation with these countries, especially Indonesia, with which we have consistently maintained a close relationship. As for Iran, through President Le Duc Anh's visit we have built a firm basis for developing relations with this country. During the meetings between President Le Duc Anh and the Indonesian and Iranian presidents, as well as meetings between Vietnamese ministers and their Indonesian and Iranian counterparts, we focussed on discussing ways and means to expand cooperation, especially in the economic domain. In Indonesia, the presidents and ministers of the two countries contended that economic and trade relations are not active enough in view of the political relationship and the potential of the two nations. On this basis, the two countries agreed that efforts must be made in the future to expand cooperation in trade and other domains; first in the exploration for oil and gas, then in the exploitation of coal mines, maritime products, agriculture, and tourism. In our meetings with representatives of Indonesian companies, they expressed their readiness to cooperate with Vietnam and participate in building various electric power plants in our country. I can say that through the visit to Indonesia, we have established a basis and an orientation for further development in relations between the two countries. To achieve this goal, the two countries will sign an agreement in the near future on the avoidance of double taxation to create favorable conditions for the promotion of business activities between the two countries. In Iran, President Le Duc Anh held talks with his Iranian counterpart. Both sides contended that economic and trade relations between the two countries are still minimal, although the bilateral friendship has developed satisfactorily. As a result, both sides should make greater efforts to expand cooperation in the economic and trade domains as soon as possible. There is a great demand in Iran for rice and tea; Iran needs about 500,000 tonnes of rice annually. Both sides agreed that Vietnam can export rice to Iran on a regular basis. Iran would also like to import a large volume of tea from Vietnam. [Nguyen Manh Cam continues] In addition, from Iran we can buy such things as cotton and petroleum products, including asphalt, chloride, and clinker, which is used in the processing of cement. Thus, the two sides have goods for barter trade. Economically, the two sides agreed to cooperate in the field of gas and oil, as Iran's oil industry is a century old and has much experience in this field. Iran is ready to help train cadres for us. Iran also wants to help build an oil refinery in Vietnam. In addition, Iran is ready to cooperate with us in the field of construction, especially the construction of a cement factory, based on its experience in this field. Based on our suggestion, Iran is very eager to cooperate with us in the fields of oil, rubber, tea, and coffee. To make a long story short, Iran is very eager to achieve long- term cooperation with us. This means that our president's visit to Iran, the first high-level meeting between the two countries, laid the foundation for a real and long-term relationship between the two countries. It should be noted that during this visit we were showered wherever we went with the special sentiments of the Iranian leaders and people. Here I would like to recall a highly typical remark by Ayatollah Khamene'i, Iran's highest spiritual leader, on our people and struggle: The Vietnamese people are highly admired because they have demonstrated their very heroic fighting spirit. They have set a shining example for those nations fighting for independence and have contributed greatly to the struggle of the world's nations for independence and freedom. Cooperation between Vietnam and Iran has a very good basis for development. What should be recalled here is that the summit meetings between President Le Duc Anh and Indonesian President Suharto, and between President Le Duc Anh and the Iranian president, contributed to strengthening the solidarity among members of the Nonaligned Movement further so as to realize the Movement's common goal of peace, independence, sovereignty, and development and to contribute to establishing a new world order. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what do you think about the question of Vietnam joining ASEAN, which was raised during the visit to Indonesia? [Nguyen Manh Cam] The fact that we are joining ASEAN as an observer and that we recently participated in a project sponsored by an ASEAN committee will inevitably lead to our country's participation in ASEAN as a full member. This is a logical development in line with the current trend in the region as well as the world. Recently, all of the ASEAN leaders have expressed their desire to see Vietnam obtain full ASEAN membership soon. Because this is compatible with overall developments in the region and the world, we must -- with the support of the ASEAN members -- be prepared to participate in this organization soon as a full member. Just as President Suharto said during his exchange of views with President Le Duc Anh: Vietnam becoming a full member of ASEAN will be very beneficial to regional development. This is compatible with the current trend toward regional peace, stability, and cooperation and is universally beneficial to the development of all nations in the world. [Correspondent] During his visit to Iran, President Le Duc Anh was accompanied by a number of Vietnamese businessmen. Is this a change in the way our country's leaders work when they go abroad? [Nguyen Manh Cam] In the past, our leaders' overseas trips were more politically motivated. In the new situation, overseas trips by high level leaders such as the president, prime minister, and general secretary will not only have political significance -- because they help strengthen the friendship between our country and the countries that our leaders visit -- they will also have very positive economic significance. As economics has become the pressing demand of all nations, visits by our government's high level delegations are usually accompanied by representatives of various public health organizations, corporations, and enterprises. This is because, along with high-level meetings, we also need direct contacts between corporations. This way we will be able to understand the real capabilities of related sectors with which our country can achieve cooperation. That is why representatives of the corporations dealing in those goods Iran wishes to import from us or export to us went along on the trip to Iran. This further substantiated the high-level agreements we reached. Of course, we could not do much on a visit that only lasted for a few days, but at least we established direct contacts to continue our exchange of views and spur bilateral cooperation. This is a change in our working method that suits the requirements of the current situation that is witnessing the growth of various countries in the world. [Correspondent] Thank you, comrade minister.
