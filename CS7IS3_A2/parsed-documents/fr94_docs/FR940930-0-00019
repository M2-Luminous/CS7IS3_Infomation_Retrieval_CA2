ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule revises the on-time flight performance reporting requirements by: Eliminating the exclusion of flights delayed or canceled due to mechanical problems; adding the aircraft tail number, and wheels-off and wheels-on times for each flight reported; adding several definitions; clarifying the reporting requirements for a new flight; and deleting references to obsolete organizational offices. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bernard Stankus or Jack Calloway, Office of Airline Statistics, DAI&hyph;10, Research and Special Programs Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590&hyph;0001, (202) 366&hyph;4387 or 366&hyph;4383, respectively. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 4, 1992, the Research and Special Programs Administration (``RSPA'') issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPRM'') (57 FR 58755; December 11, 1992) seeking public comments on the proposal to improve the on-time flight performance reporting requirements in 14 CFR Part 234 Airline Service Quality Performance Reports. The Department proposed to eliminate the reporting exclusion for flights delayed or canceled due to mechanical problems; to add the aircraft tail number, and wheels-off and wheels-on time for each flight reported; to define ``canceled flight,'' ``discontinued flight,'' ``diverted flight,'' and ``extra-section flight''; to clarify the reporting requirement for a new flight; and, to delete references to obsolete offices. Part 234 requires the largest U.S. air carriers to report their on-time departure and arrival performances for every domestic scheduled-passenger flight operated to or from a reportable airport, with the exception of flights that are delayed 15 minutes or more, or canceled, because of mechanical problems. A flight is considered on-time if the flight departs and arrives less than 15 minutes after its published scheduled times. The Department publishes separate listings for departure and arrival performances. The reporting system developed for the administration of these reporting requirements is called the On-Time Flight Performance System.
