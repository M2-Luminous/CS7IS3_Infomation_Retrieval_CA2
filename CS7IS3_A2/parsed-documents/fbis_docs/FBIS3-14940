Speaking today at a regular meeting with Russian and foreign journalists at the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation, Andrey Kozyrev, who is a deputy, also said that for him and many other Russian parliamentarians the Duma's decision on a political amnesty "seems shameful." "These people," he stated, "should be in prison. They broke the law and should be sent back to prison and tried. And then, perhaps, an amnesty will be extended to them." This is a "mistake by those who released them," the minister stressed, "and I think the Russian president will take the appropriate decision in his own time."
