FR941012-1-00069 FR941012-1-00012 HULs America Inc. submitted a petition to delist isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). IPDI had been listed because it met the criteria for extremely hazardous substance listing, on the basis of two aerosol inhalation-toxicity studies in rats. The 4 hour LC 50 is .26 mg per liter, which is less than the LC 50 of 0.5 mg/liter which qualifies it as an extremely hazardous substance under Agency criteria (51 FR 41574). The delisting petition made the following points. This material is manufactured in a closed system that does not use high pressure, and contends that unusual measures are required to generate test atmospheres containing IPDI for toxicity testing. If the substance is aerosolized, particles would be expected to precipitate out of the air. The material is not volatile under normal conditions. It does not react rapidly with water to generate heat that might cause volatilization. The low vapor pressure led the Department of Transportation to remove IPDI from its list of materials that are toxic by inhalation, according to the petition. EPA disagrees. Petitioner's argument is essentially that the test used to determine acute toxicity subjects the animals to extreme conditions not likely to be found in reality. This, however, is the case for many animal tests used to determine toxicity for regulatory purposes. In fact, a similar case can be made for most LD 50 or LC 50 tests, since the levels at which animals are dosed are far higher than would be delivered in actual conditions. The fact is that IPDI is toxic at low levels, based on an LC 50 , compared to other chemicals regardless of the conditions of the chemical during the test. This qualifies the chemical for listing. Extrapolations from the extreme conditions of testing may then be used to determine regulatory levels. For example, to determine a level of concern for chemicals on the EHS list in calculating threshold planning quantities, as noted above, EPA applies a conversion factor to the acute toxicity tests. Conversion factors may range from one-tenth to one-hundredth of the levels found in the acute toxicity tests. This is explained in the November 17, 1986 Interim Final Rule preamble at 51 FR 41576. For listing purposes, however, conditions of testing are not generally relevant. EPA, however, as noted above, has taken into account physical/chemical properties of IPDI in proposing to revise the TPQ. EPA believes that the data used to list paraquat, azinphos-methyl, fenamiphos and isophorone diisocyanate is sound and that the denial of these petitions is consistent with the listing criteria and TPQ methodology. At this time, the Agency is not planning to modify the listing criteria nor the TPQ methodology. The Agency however, will accept any comments on additional criteria which can be used to increase the usefulness of the EHS list and the TPQ methodology. In the consideration of these petitions, HULs America brought to the Agency's attention that there may be at least three competing products with toxicity and physical/chemical properties very similar to IPDI and, therefore should be treated the same. Huls maintains none of the chemicals should be listed. EPA is requesting information on other chemicals, currently not listed, for which toxicity meets the criteria, and which therefore warrant listing. At this time, EPA is not proposing to increase the number of chemicals on the EHS list; however, in the future it will propose to list chemicals with toxicity information showing that they warrant listing.
