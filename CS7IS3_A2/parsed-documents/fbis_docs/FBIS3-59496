It was true, he said, that there were good reasons for industry's share in research spending having fallen from 62 to 58 percent, but in Japan, for example, industry footed 80 percent of the research bill. "We must devise new approaches," Krueger told DIE WELT. As soon as he had taken office in May, he had appointed a strategy think tank comprising renowned representatives from the worlds of science, the economy, and politics. A priority task was to amend the law -- he referred specifically to the laws on genetic engineering, animal protection, chemicals, and data protection -- so that innovations would no longer be thwarted. A lasting improvement had also to be achieved in the public's attitude to research. Greater openmindedness with regard to research work had to be fostered, although the risks should not be swept under the carpet. Another priority was to convert recent findings into products: "We have outstanding basic research," but there were problems when it came to converting findings into new products. He did not intend to economize on space projects. Unmanned space flight was increasingly approaching the commercial viability stage. However, one country could not shoulder larger-scale problems alone, and Krueger sets his sights on collaboration with the Americans and Russians in this connection. Krueger is satisfied "by and large" with his ministry's budget appropriation. Although it had not been raised, he had obtained an extra 150 million German marks [DM] for work in eastern Germany in the budget debate. He hoped that this would primarily enable him to accelerate industrial research, as only 1.9 percent of exported goods came from eastern Germany. Nevertheless, a sword of Damocles in the shape of a DM5 billion cut in the federal budget hung over his ministerial accounts, although he hoped that his ministry would not be seriously affected by it. He no longer had to put up the funding for the transrapid, but this in itself hardly eased the strain on his budget, as he still had to provide DM50 million a year for the associated research. Moreover, one of his ministry's future priority concerns was to be transport research.
