On 30 and 31 January, accompanied by Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, Ye Liansong, governor of the province, Xu Zhijian, deputy secretary general of the State Council, and Liu Bin, vice minister of the State Education Commission, Vice Premier Li Lanqing visited, in spite of the severe cold, Shijiazhuang city, Baoding city, and Baoding Prefecture to investigate and study the educational work in the countryside and went deep to five primary and middle schools in mountainous areas of Pingshan and Shunping counties to express solicitude for teachers. Whenever he arrived in a school, Comrade Li Lanqing conscientiously inspected schoolrooms and teachers' dormitories, cordially inquired about teachers' situation in work, livelihood, wage payment, and teaching, and sent, on behalf of the State Council, cordial regards to the vast numbers of rural teachers, teachers in mountainous areas in particular, who have long worked silently with all their hearts under difficult conditions. In recent years, leaders at all levels in the province have paid high attention to education, have energetically promoted reform and development in education, have constantly attached importance to rudimentary education, have adopted resolute measures to continuously improve teachers' remunerations, have solved in a timely manner the problem that once emerged concerning teachers' unpaid wages and have been studying ways to formulate a guarantee mechanism to ensure the fulfillment of the rudimentary education target and for eliminating the deferred wage payment to teachers. After hearing this, Comrade Li Lanqing was very happy and fully affirmed it. During the inspection, Comrade Li Lanqing repeatedly stressed that rudimentary education is the foundation of all sorts of education which concerns the quality of education in the entire nation. Because 800 million of China's population lives in the countryside, the difficult and focal points of rudimentary education lie in the countryside. If peasants have no knowledge and no agricultural skills, it is impossible to develop the rural economy or to fulfill the nationwide objective of having the people become relatively well-off. Therefore, governments at all levels and all educational and administrative departments must exert great efforts in conscientiously developing rudimentary education in the countryside. The education in the countryside must be carried out in line with local conditions by giving full consideration to the actual demands and circumstances of the countryside. We should conscientiously study ways to reform the school administration in the countryside. Comrade Li Lanqing fully affirmed Shunping County's methods of adding the content of professional education to train a large number of new peasants, who have both knowledge and agricultural skills, at the present stage of developing rudimentary education in the countryside. He said: In the countryside, it is a good way to give overall consideration to agriculture, science, and education. It will not only be conducive to training more useful skilled persons for the countryside and accelerating the development of rural economy but will also effectively make the nine-year compulsory education universal in the countryside. On the morning of 31 January, Comrade Li Lanqing also talked with leaders of the province, responsible persons of pertinent departments, and teacher representatives on the reform and development of higher education, vocational education, and adult education and listened to their opinions and suggestions.
