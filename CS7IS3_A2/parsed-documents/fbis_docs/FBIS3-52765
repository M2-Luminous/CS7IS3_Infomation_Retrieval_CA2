A foreign ministry spokesman in Islamabad has stated that Algeria, Egypt, and Tunisia had officially requested that Pakistan expel their extremist nationals residing in Pakistan. The spokesman added that "solving this problem is also important for Pakistan." Pakistan is expected to begin its campaign in the next few weeks to avoid the possibility of its name being added to the U.S. list of "states which sponsor terrorism." It is known that the U.S. State Department is now reviewing that list prior to issuing a new list in February.
