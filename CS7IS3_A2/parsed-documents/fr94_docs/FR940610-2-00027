FR940610-2-00027 FR940610-2-00023 Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center; Unsolicited Financial Assistance Award AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy. ACTION: Acceptance of an unsolicited proposal application of a grant award with Texas A&M University. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE) announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.14, it intends to award financial assistance (grant) through the Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center To Texas A&M University for a research effort entitled `` Investigation of the Effect of Coal Particle Sizes on the Interfacial and Rheological Properties of Coal-Water Slurry Fuels.''. ADDRESSES: Department of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, Acquisition and Assistance Division, P. O. Box 10940, MS 921&hyph;188, Pittsburgh, PA 15236. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Cynthia Y. Mitchell, Contract Specialist (412) 892&hyph;4862. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Grant Number: DE&hyph;FG22&hyph;94PC94120. Title of Research Effort ``Investigation of the Effect of Coal Particle Sizes on the Interfacial and Rheological Properties of Coal-Water Slurry Fuels.'' Awardee: Texas A&M University. Term of Assistance Effort: Twenty-four (24) months. Grant Estimated Total Value: $99,670.00. Objective: Based upon the authority of 10 CFR 600.14, the objective of this grant is for Texas A&M University to determine the effect coal particle size on the surface properties and rheology of coal-water slurry (CWS) fuels containing different surfactant. Coal powder samples of different size ranges will be obtained from a single source of coal through sieving. CWS mixtures to be tested will be prepared from these individual samples with known particle sizes. Properties of the CWS fuel samples to be measured will include the apparent viscosity, static and dynamic surface tensions. In order to correlate the measured surface properties and rheological data with the atomization characteristics, a cross-injected spray into convective air stream will be tested. Detailed characteristics of the spray development will also be investigated using a high-speed photographic recording technique. The results of these investigations will provide comprehensive information on the spray development and atomization behaviors that are known to depend to an uncertain degree on the surface properties and rheology. This effort will also contribute to developing guidelines for CWS fuel preparation technology. The potential to achieve the stated objectives is very high. Therefore the proposed effort will present a unique opportunity to expand the fundamental understanding of slurry atomization. Dated: May 26, 1994. Dale A. Siciliano, Contracting officer.
