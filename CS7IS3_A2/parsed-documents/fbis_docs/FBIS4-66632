After a marathon effort in recent months, the League has been able to lay the ground for its fourth conference, renew all of its branches, and--most importantly--reanimate and revitalize its cadres. The "exceptional" in all that has happened is that the League has been able to once again draw attention to itself, after many had dismissed it. The League has salvaged itself despite all that has been said and is being said regarding the holding of its conference, the election of its leadership, and its resumption of regular activity. Moments after the announcement of the final results of the vote [on the composition of the new board of directors], the new board of directors elected a new director by a consensus of all of its members. He is Taoufik Bouderbala, who was the secretary general in the outgoing board. Given Taoufik Bouderbala's previous and current responsibilities, no one is more suited than he to speak of the League's past, present, and future. He granted his first press interview to REALITES [AL-HAQA'IQ], for which we are thankful. Let us listen to him. [REALITES] Now that you have caught your breath after the marathon preparations for your fourth conference, how do you assess the results, before, during, and immediately after the conference? [Bouderbala] My initial, basic assessment is that the League succeeded in preparing and holding the conference and in forming a board of directors according to its bylaws and articles of association. It should be emphasized that preparation for the conference lasted more than four months, during which the previous board of directors held numerous meetings to study the admission of new members, the branches' conferences, and preparations for the conference. The board of directors issued statements inviting all those wishing to join the League, whose precepts are compatible with the League's articles of association, to apply for membership. The board of directors delegated a five-member committee to check the lists of membership applicants submitted by the 41 branches. The lists were then submitted to the board of directors, which held five meetings to check the lists. We made some revisions upon the request of the branches or members of the board of directors. We did not go forward with the conference until after the outgoing board of directors approved by consensus the lists of persons joining all 41 branches. Immediately after that, we established an agenda to renew the branches' cadres. We agreed that this would be done through elections or consensual installation if we were unable to hold an electoral session. However, thank God, we were able to hold 41 general sessions in public places with complete openness, with the attendance of at least three-quarters of the members of the branches, and with the supervision of the board of directors. No pressure of any type was exerted. However, we encountered difficulties in three branches concerning members and the composition of the branch. Some members did not accept the covenant and wanted to hold an electoral session without consideration of the covenant before elections. However, the brothers who were supervising were able, after a dialogue with the members, to install cadres with everyone's agreement (these branches are in Nafta, Jendouba, and Beja). [REALITES] This is not the first time that you have personally participated in a League conference. Did you feel that you were participating in a regular conference? Or did you have a different feeling? [Bouderbala] I felt that we were in an ordinary conference, because we applied our articles of association and all of the requirements of these articles. Hence, we called it the fourth national conference of the League. As for the content of the conference, it concerned the situation the League has been experiencing. The emphasis was on the independence of the League and its decisionmaking, and the need for it to exist, so that it can perform its normal functions. The conferees all indicated that they have no wish to return to the stagnation and paralysis of the League prior to the conference. [REALITES] For the first time in the League's history, a unanimous or near unanimous agreement was not reached regarding the League's board of directors. Two competing lists were submitted to the conference. Do you attribute this situation to the "League Covenant" list's certainty of its absolute victory in elections, which is what actually happened, or to the fact that the competing list, "the Independence List," put forth conditions you considered unfair and impracticable? [Bouderbala] I do not believe that matters were decided before the conference. However, at the conference, some conferees wanted or pretended to forget the League's principles. We have tried to preserve the League's existence without being in a position that would permit any party to infringe on its legal and de facto existence. The conference is not a revocation of the League's previous decisions. All of the parties attempted to uphold the covenant and to agree on a list with a maximum of 30 individuals. However, we found that some parties refused to enter into this covenant or wanted to enter the covenant on their own terms. [REALITES] This conference indicated that there is a majority position and a minority position (almost a third) within the League. How will you deal with this situation in the future? [Bouderbala] In the wake of the conference, we do not believe that there is a minority or majority in the League. The conference is first and foremost the League's conference. The board of directors that was elected is the board of directors of the League, which is to say all of the League's activists. It will not discriminate between League members, and it will transcend all of the competition that occurred between individuals or the two lists during the conference. The competition now focuses on the League's work. The board of directors will continue its work with all of the branches. It will formulate programs in coordination with all of the branches and then announce those programs. [REALITES] The current board of directors has undergone major renewal and rejuvenation. Will this new situation impede the League's activity and spread? [Bouderbala] I do not think so. Renewal indicates the presence of new, exuberant life in the organization. We do not believe that the activists who have borne responsibility for the branches and struggled within them lack adequate experience to continue the struggle along with the "veterans." They have the same experience in the struggle, but on another level. The important thing is to combine all efforts, so that the League can continue its struggle. The League has existed for 17 years. The new members of the board of directors were trained and gained experience within the League. The League has been able to train a generation of activists in its core cadres. These activists have advanced within the League to positions of responsibility. No outside party imposed these activists. They are products of the League. [REALITES] The League now has close to 4,300 members. However, the outgoing board of directors deferred for your consideration the status of 1,800 membership applicants. How will you proceed in this regard, especially given that many have expressed fear that these new members, if they are accepted, will significantly disrupt the balance of power in the League? [Bouderbala] We have agreed on this matter. We said that those who have expressed a desire to join the League must not be disregarded. The outgoing board of directors recommended to the branches' boards that they give priority to admitting these applicants when the admission process begins in 1994. Naturally, only those who fulfill the requirements and criteria we established in late 1993 will be admitted, all within the limits of the branch's capacity. Perhaps the League will in the future--even though it might be premature--create new branches. In this case, priority will be given to these 1,800 applicants, always bearing in mind that any citizen wishing to join the League must fulfill the criteria and qualifications on which we have agreed. Then (starting in 1994), the new bylaws, which were amended in the conference, will be applied to new applicants. Under the amended bylaws, a new entrant must remain a candidate for two years before becoming an active member. After that, the new member can assume responsibility within the branch's board. Then, after being a member for five years, a member can be nominated to the board of directors. [REALITES] What are the most pressing issues now facing you, following the League's year-long period of frozen activity? [Bouderbala] Our first concern is to restore the tie between the board of directors and the branches and to set up the League's structures by delegating committees to submit draft programs in all fields, legal, economic, and cultural. After the board of directors and branches approve these draft programs, they will begin to be implemented. The League's main role is to educate and thus inculcate the philosophy of human rights in all citizens, regardless of their affiliations and theories. This is a difficult task requiring persistence, endurance, and insistence on principle. Parallel with this activity, we will continue to support and defend freedoms, monitor all violations, and undertake all contacts and interventions needed to limit and contain these violations. We will also make efforts to develop human rights projects, following the country's experience regarding the amendment of several laws, especially the Protection [ihtifaz] Law, Associations Law, and Press Law. This does not mean that we will exclude other issues. The League will undertake these tasks simultaneously on all tracks. [REALITES] All of the participants in the conference, regardless of their political tendencies, agreed to reject the amendments introduced to the Associations Law. Do you intend to undertake tangible initiatives in this regard? [Bouderbala] The board of directors adheres to the League's positions that preceded the conference and that were emphasized during the conference. In other words, the board of directors still rejects the amendments introduced to the Associations Law on 2 April 1992. The League has submitted to the administrative court a challenge to the classification decision issued in May 1992. We are waiting for the administrative court's decision. [REALITES] And in the meantime? [Bouderbala] In the meantime, we have been reclaiming our legal existence by: 1. The administrative court's decision, which suspended the classification decision. 2. The election of a board of directors that will make efforts to continue defending this position according to the general bylaws issued at the conference, which affirm the board of directors' decisions that provide the League with a legal existence to continue its struggle. [REALITES] And regarding freedoms? [Bouderbala] The board of directors will continue its efforts within its committees by resuming its reception of citizens and complaints. It will intervene with the authorities and wait for solutions and responses. If it becomes clear that a response or solution is not forthcoming, the League will issue statements to inform public opinion and to alert the authorities. [REALITES] Some members of the League are now expressing fear regarding the League's independence. Is this fear justified? [Bouderbala] For me, the League's independence is a settled matter. The League is either independent or not independent. It will continue its efforts in complete independence. The composition of the current board of directors, like that of previous boards of directors, is the greatest guarantee of this independence. [REALITES] What is the content of this independence? [Bouderbala] It consists of the fact that decisions flow from the board of directors and the members' consciences. [REALITES] Must the League remain a counterbalance in order to guarantee its independence? Or are there other forms of independence that you are now considering? [Bouderbala] The League is a nongovernmental counterbalance. In other words, it is an independent organization. It does not receive orders from any party, including the government, political parties, or any other pressure group. Nor does it issue orders to anyone. Rather, it draws attention, appeals for help, and criticizes if necessary. It always advocates dialogue and tries to preclude a breakdown of the dialogue between different segments of society. The League tries to keep open the channels of communication with all parties, especially the government. The League does not treat anyone, including the government, adversarially. It does not intend to act hostilely toward anyone. Nor does it intend to play the role of opposition, a union, or an association. It believes that each has its role and characteristics in civilian society. [REALITES] The country is approaching legislative and presidential elections in about one month. Is the League prepared for this important political event? [Bouderbala] The League concerned itself in the past with elections, especially the premature legislative and presidential elections in 1989. The League believes that its activists in the outlying areas are tantamount to observers. They perform their regular role of informing the board of directors of any violation that occurs on any day, especially during election days. The board of directors will deal with this subject, and, as usual, it will have its say and adopt positions after studying them.
