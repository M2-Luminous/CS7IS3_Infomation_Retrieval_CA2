By the same token, however, it would be "dangerous" for Japan to adopt a business-as-usual approach in its relations with the United States, Owada said in an address at a Tokyo hotel. Owada issued the note of caution at a gathering organized by the International Friendship Exchange Committee (FEC), a private nonprofit organization. "It would not be good to either panic or be optimistic, but the worst thing would be to begin acting on emotion," he said. Owada blasted what he said was "sensational" media reporting about the February 11 meeting that has given a "mistaken" impression that bilateral relations are "heading toward a crisis" and that a new round of "Japan-bashing" has started in the United States. He said that in dealing with the U.S., Japan must bear in mind that the Clinton administration came to power on a wave of popular sentiment that the new government would focus on domestic woes, especially the country's ailing economy. Owada expressed concern that with economic issues at the forefront of U.S. policy, government officials in Washington are finding it increasingly difficult to consider ties with Japan in a "comprehensive" manner, encompassing bilateral cooperation in the political and security fields. He suggested that their search for an effective way of dealing with the bilateral trade dispute, different from unproductive approaches of the past, has given rise to the idea of using the political and security cooperation as a kind of leverage over economic issues. Owada, who is the father of Crown Princess Masako, also took issue with Clinton's recent remarks that none of the 30 or so agreements concluded between Japan and the U.S. is functioning satisfactorily. "In actuality, this is not the case," he said, calling it an example of a "great misunderstanding."
