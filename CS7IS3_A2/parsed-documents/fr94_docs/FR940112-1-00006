FR940112-1-00006 FR940112-1-00002 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ASO&hyph;14] Proposed Establishment of Class D Airspace: Eglin AFB, FL; Eglin AF Aux No. 3 Duke Field, FL; Proposed Amendment of Class D Airspace: Eglin Hurlburt Field, FL; Proposed Amendment of Class E Airspace: Crestview, FL AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This notice proposes to establish Class D airspace located at Eglin Air Force Base, FL, and Eglin AF Aux No 3 Duke Field, FL. The notice also proposes to amend Class D airspace located at Eglin Hurlburt Field, FL, and Class E airspace at Crestview, FL. As part of the Terminal Airspace Reclassification, the Valparaiso, Florida Terminal Area was to be changed from Part 93 Airspace to Class D Airspace. The change included the revocation of the Eglin AFB, Florida Class D airspace and Eglin AF Aux No. 3 Duke Field, Florida Class D airspace; the modification of the Hurlburt Field, Florida Class D airspace and Crestview, Florida Class E airspace. The Valparaiso, Florida Terminal Area will remain as Part 93 Airspace and this notice proposes to return the affected Class D and Class E airspace areas as they were prior to Docket No. 26968, Amendment No. 71&hyph;19 published in the Federal Register on March 2, 1993.

The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class D airspace at Eglin AFB, Florida; establish Class D airspace at Eglin AF Aux No 3 Duke Field; amend Class D airspace at Eglin Hurlburt Field, Florida, and amend Class E airspace at Crestview, Florida. The intended effect of this proposal is to reverse the action of Docket No. 26968, Amendment No. 71&hyph;19 (58 FR 12128, March 2, 1993) to provide adequate airspace to contain Instrument Flight Rule operations at these four locations. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and Class E airspace areas are respectively published in Para 5000 and Para 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and E airspace listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
