According to the state-run CNB, the Bank of China's branch in Shenyang, China, opened LCs for a Korean exporter K.C. Sunil Co. last year and the CNB purchased trade bills from the Korean exporter in December. After buying trade bills from K.C. Sunil, a small-sized trading company which exports aluminum foil, the CNB asked the Bank of China to honor the LCs opened by the Chinese bank but was rejected. The CNB said the Bank of China refused to settle the payments, citing what it claims to be problems with shipping documents. The incident came to light as a CNB branch manager involved in the transaction jumped to death from an apartment in southern Seoul Friday in despair of the alleged financial fraud. The CNB claimed that it is customary in international banking practices for a bank who issued LCs to honor them if there are no special problems with shipping documents. But the CNB yet failed to illustrate what was specifically wrong in the shipping documents.
