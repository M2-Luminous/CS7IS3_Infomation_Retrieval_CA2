Imset in Ankara on 21 December] [Text] Ilnur Cevik: The point we want to make is this: Now as a result of all of these incidents, there are a people in the Southeast. A people made up of citizens of the Turkish Republic. These people are, unfortunately, being thrown out of their villages in one way or another. And these people, for instance, are increasing the population of Diyarbakir from 350,000 to 950,000. Don't you think this is creating a great social problem for Turkey? Suleyman Demirel: Of course, it will. The social problem is this. (Showing a list of people massacred by the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party]). If these people were not killed in this way, the people there would not leave their settlements and go. It is not the state which is moving them. Cevik: What will be done for these people? Demirel: Every kind of assistance will be given for these people and is already being given even with deficiencies. The state is aware of this issue, and the issue was raised in a very recent meeting. It is not that the state is not sensitive to what is going on in Turkey. We know all of these. What is happening where and so on. But there is an incident. Ilnur, this is what I am trying to explain. These things have not been happening for only a year. Look, so many incidents have happened in the past eight years. In a decade in Turkey, 8,423 acts of violence have taken place--in this region. And in these incidents, 1,997 soldiers of the state are martyred. Why are they martyred? Is the state there to kill the people? No. There is a gang which is killing the state's soldiers, 1997 people. This gang has also killed 2,666 citizens. These 1,997 people are dying so that this 2,666 citizens don't die. Are the soldiers of the state of the Turkish Republic an occupation force there? Cevik: Of course not. Demirel: Of course not. Why are they dying? Because there is a gang against them. With what else could the state of Turkey struggle against this gang? It raids your (military) station. Why does it raid your station? What is the measure to be used against this? Is the measure to withdraw your stations and leave the area to them? We won't do that.. We won't do that in any way. Ismet G. Imset: But Mr. President, there is something else happening in recent days. The stations specifically in rural areas are being closed down and being withdrawn to more concentrated centers. After our recent trip with Hasan Cemal to northern Iraq, coming back to Turkey, we sort of had to force our way into Turkey. The soldiers there said that after 16:00, one could not go out on the streets, that the PKK was in control of the roads, especially the Habur-Diyarbakir road. And, in fact, at around 17:00, they stopped us and looked at us asking whether we were crazy to be on the road. One of them asked, "How can you travel at this time of the night?" And, Hasan Cemal and I were surprised. Previously, we knew that one could not walk outside after 19:00 or 20:00, but we did not know something like this was going on. What you have said is something we want to stress anyway. We want the state to be in the region more than it is. We want the state to be in control of the highways, roads and districts. But this is something which we cannot see much of. As if the state is getting lost. Demirel: Can the state be lost? This is exactly what efforts are being expended to prevent. The state, in that corner of the country, and by making ineffective those who are responsible for all kinds of problems, is working to make justice reign without difference between day and night. Because of this, so many people have been martyred. The state is trying to guard its borders. To guard its people. So many people have died. The state is exerting efforts so they won't die. And for them not to die, children at the age of 20 from this country's Izmir and this country's Tekirdag are going to those mountains. Imset: Sir, there appears also to be issues on the international scale. For instance on Armenia, we have received news that Ocalan is planning to move his headquarters from Syria to that country... Of course, this could be Syrian disinformation. But there is the Armenian issue, the recent developments in Russia. With regard to regional issues, how do you see Turkey's position? For instance, there is something an Ankara taxi driver told us. He thanks God that Ozal is no longer here for, he explained, too many people visited the capital, the roads were jammed but now they are very much less congested. What is happening? Is Turkey's importance in the world being lost? Demirel: Why should Turkey's importance in the world be lost? What is the reason for this? Could an Ankara driver be the criteria for this? Imset: Of course not. I was just going to say that when we talk to foreign officials and ambassadors, even officials we know in Washington, we get the message that Turkey is on the wrong path and that since they are allies, they are planning to warn Turkey especially in the next two-month period. Demirel: What is the wrong path? Imset: Mainly on human rights, sir. Demirel: Are the people who are being killed not human being? Imset: They are, sir, but those killing them are working under the standards of "bandits." But because we are a state we have different... Demirel: What? Should the state not kill bandits? Is this what is being said? Who else but the bandits is the state killing? Cevik: They ask why the state is not protecting the regional people. Demirel: It is because the state is trying to protect the regional people that these people are becoming martyrs. My brother, there is a fire here. Can anyone claim that the forces of the Turkish Republic are turning their guns on the people within this fire? No one can claim this. The state is trying to protect the regional people. I don't understand where we will reach hitting the state from here to there. If these duties cannot be fulfilled, then you will see the chaos. We are saying that these duties should remain to be fulfilled. Now, I don't know who has come and told you these things, in the past six months, 14 foreign state officials have come here and visited Turkey. These were on the level of king, of president and of prime minister. What has Ozal done under this Constitution that once he went, Turkey regressed? There is no need for such arguments and actually I don't enter such arguments. What happened when Ozal was here that is not happening when he is not here? Cevik: In recent days what we have continuously been hearing in Turkey, from officials as well, is that Jalal Talabani is a liar or something along these lines. Is Talabani no longer a credible person for Ankara? Demirel: There is no criteria for credibility. It is not possible for me, as the president of the Turkish Republic, to lend credibility to this or that person. Talabani's statements that they (Ankara) asked us to extend the (PKK) cease-fire are completely untrue. As we have never accepted APO (PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan) as a counterpart, we would never have told Talabani to go and say this to him. We never said this. You are also well-aware of this. Imset: There were reports that APO was arrested. We could not get them confirmed. Have you received anything information on this? Demirel: There is nothing that has reached me to this effect. I am not in a position to confirm or deny the reports. But I don't think they are true. Imset: Do you believe that there has been a change in the attitudes of Syria and Iran? Demirel: I have spoken with the Iranian first vice president. He appears to be very sincere and interested in the issue of cooperating against terrorism. Imset: Then can something really be expected? Perhaps a joint operation with Iran in the region? Demirel: It is possible. These issues are being discussed. Cevik: As we enter 1994, political turmoil is apparent in Turkey. This is especially evident within the country's political parties and, particularly, within the True Path Party (DYP) which is in power. Do you feel that since you have left the prime ministry, Turkey has entered a period of instability? Will there be changes in the political spectrum in the new year? Demirel: There is no instability. Stability is this: The game has its rules and you play by the rules. Fair play. Look, what is being ignored is this--and we have a capability of ignoring good things: In the past 30 years, the election of a president in Turkey has always become an incident. Today, Turkey does not even feel that a president is being elected. Governmental problems used to surface when the president was elected. And they did surface. But weren't they solved there and then? You may like or dislike who comes to power. This is your personal right. But the regime has worked in Turkey. It has produced the government. Turkey has a government. This depends on the trust of the Grand National Assembly (TBMM). The Turkish Grand National Assembly is on top of its responsibilities. And, the Turkish Grand National Assembly has, in the past two years, handled 25 motions, 27 general debates, 39 investigations and 420 verbal questions. In other words, all institutions of the Turkish state are on top of their responsibilities and I believe this is very beneficial. Just go and see whether you would find this in Poland or in Hungary. The Turkish state has institutions, it has a judiciary which everyone should be proud of. It has created this judiciary in 70 years. It has supreme courts, whether you like or dislike their decisions. There is the prosecution whose door you can knock on without having to try to claim your own rights. And, there is nothing like instability in Turkey. Turkey's mission is being fulfilled. Whether good, bad, too little or too much, it is being fulfilled. It has a government, Parliament, police, courts, governors, everything. And, I must say clearly that the value of Turkey must be recognized. But everyone must realize the value of this democracy in Turkey without forgetting what kind of past we have had. Today, just compare the city of Ankara with its population of three million to European cities of the same scale. See what happens. At any time of the night, in this city of Ankara, you can easily walk with your hands in your pockets... Compare Istanbul, a city of 10 million, with cities of the same size. When you compare it, the number of incidents are less than forty-to-one. And, the state is in control even in the most remote corners of the country... The problem is only in the southeast region. Turkey's problem is inside the corridor staring from Tunceli--Tunceli, Bingol, Kulp, Sirnak, Mardin and Hakkari--and connecting to northern Iraq. Until the recent incidents in Adiyaman, there had not been a single occurrence there. In Erzurum and Erzincan, there have been incidents only in the areas close to Tunceli. I certainly do not agree with view that the Southeast problem has spread and become a problem of the eastern region as well. I went to Erzurum where the governor there is quite content with his position. I went to Kars and observed the Liberation Day celebrations. The Turkish state is not a state that is crumbling. It must function in a better way and many things should be improved. But if you say we won't improve, that nothing can be done with us or that neither our democracy or our state is worth anything, such claims simply cannot be. Imset: Recently in a newspaper article, you had made a statement that was said to have been related to the Democracy Party (DEP). There you said whoever sympathizes with the bandits are murderers. Some columnists even commented on this and said it could have been a remark made in error. The DEP is a party that emerged from the elections with 17 deputies. One of them has been killed. When you look at the DEP what do you see? How do you regard this party? Demirel: I don't have to comment on this. Is there any reason? Don't you see what it is? Why are you asking me what the Democracy Party is? Have you not watched its congress? Did you not hear what the man was saying at its congress? Why ask me? Write it exactly like this: The DEP is whatever was seen in its congress. As far as the incident involving the Democracy Party... Would the chief prosecutor have demanded the closure of a party out of nowhere? Cevik: Sir, Ismet wrote an article which was in the form of a declaration asking the Democracy Party to condemn the PKK for the killing of women and children, but they didn't do it. Demirel: Then why ask me? Imset: I asked because of this. Within the Democracy Party there are a group of deputies whom we know are not pro-PKK. In fact, they have sought a dialogue with Ankara, sort of looking for a bailout. But when, suddenly, all levels of the state launched a concentrated effort against the DEP, it gave the impression that the state just wanted the DEP to leave Parliament. Alright, this may be what the public wants and there is a public reaction. But the PKK is also in favor of the DEP's departure from Parliament. When we look at Ocalan's recent orders and his articles, and at his attacks on the Ahmet Turk family, what he is saying is that the DEP should withdraw from Parliament. And, during that time, we were writing many articles in favor of the DEP's continued presence in Parliament because we realized that once the DEP withdrew, it would only serve the aims of the PKK. It appears that we (Turkey) are giving these people the impression that we want to force them up into the mountains. Demirel: Who is providing this image? Imset: For instance the investigations that are being initiated on a legal basis. For instance there are parliamentarians today who have been suspected of very serious crimes, including tax evasion, but they have immunity. Such crimes in the law are referred to as ordinary crimes. On the other hand, there is the Democracy Party. I accept that some are linked to the PKK and I have even witnessed Ocalan sending orders to them, but in the end, the government they entered first was your government. It appears that there is a contradiction. As if all of this activity against them were being conducted simply because the public wants it. Demirel: We have come to the same point again. There is confusion here. There is a judiciary state. Someone commits a crime and the laws agree it's a crime. If nothing is done to him, nothing should be done to someone else who commits a crime. You can't ask for this. Because two wrongs don't make a right. The first is a mistake and the other is a mistake as well. Here, you as a journalist, cannot take on the duty of the judge or prosecutor. You can only report the incident. If you put yourself in the place of the judge or prosecutor after exposing the incident, it is no longer journalism. It takes on a different form. Now the funerals of young children have come to the square of Turkey. Ten to fifteen thousand people participate in these funerals. What I fear is that the situation has gotten worse. Tomorrow, in various parts of Turkey--where citizens of southeastern origin are greater in number than those in the southeast region itself--there may be a demand for them to leave these areas and there are no measures to prevent this. There are measures against the man on the mountain. And I am taking care of this. But now these people have started to shout. You say you have told them to condemn those killings of children, but they have not done this. Alright, these man who cannot even raise their voices against the killings of children, are actually approving the killing of children, approving of the killing of soldiers. And, the soldiers on those mountains at minus 28 degrees are struggling to defend this country. When they return in a casket, the people ask what are these people doing in Parliament. And, tomorrow, the people will create great debates with regard to this Parliament. I told them (DEP) so many times, come here, get up and say we have no relations with this bloody terrorist gang, we condemn these incidents. Are you free enough to say this? Yet, they could not say anything... I declare openly that whoever is supporting those shedding blood or sympathizing with them are the murderers of our martyred citizens. I said this even from the rostrum of the Grand National Assembly. If I don't say this, who will? If you are not going to say anything to those who kill 5-month-old infants, where is your humanity? This is what I am revolting against. Don't misunderstand me. Imset: I think what was unfortunate was that while you were making such statements, the chief of staff announced that the PKK had 375,000 sympathizers. When the two statements came together, the 375,000 became a target. Demirel: It may be. It may be. It may even be higher. What, can I say there is no trouble if you say nothing to those killing five-month-old children and even support them? I am not doing this duty as a president but as a person who has given the best 45 years of his life for this country. The situation is like this. You always take the incident in a single-sided way. Troops went here or there, destroyed one village or another, harassed the people and so on. But the problem is not this. And the result is it appears as though you are not in favor of the other man shedding blood but you do not view it as that much of a crime either. In other words, the argument is "what should this man do? If the state is pushing him to and fro, he has nothing else to do." This is a conclusion which the West is coming to. Don't come to the same conclusion yourself. I must be open, I struggled against the West after the Cyprus issue as well. I can struggle with all of them. Are human beings not human beings? The men say nothing to them. Is this not human rights? I say it again, in England, France and Germany, whatever there is in the form of measures to prevent human rights violations, the same exists in my country as well. What is there? I'll tell you: There is an open regime... I am among the people everyday. Everyone can say anything they want. They can say everything, no one tells them not to. Again there is a free judiciary in this country. If there is a human rights violation, this is a crime. It is no different than attacking somewhere. There is a Parliament. Everything is said there even at this hour. Then there are squares in this country. Appear at the squares and protest against them. Cevik: They would arrest us then, sir. Just try to appear at that square in Turkey! Demirel: You appear there. If they take you away, I'll come and free you. Imset: Sir, the State Security Court even opened an investigation of Dogu Ergil. Demirel: They can. An investigation is something different. A verdict is another matter. A verdict can also be passed. Imset: As long as the State Security Courts are open, of course such a verdict will be passed. You had promises related to these. Demirel: I had no promise on State Security Courts. Imset: You promised to deal with the remnants of the military regime. Demirel: We have nothing against the State Security Courts. Turkey comes from out of chaos. The Turkish courts were courts which could not pass sentences. The State Security Courts are measures born out of this. We have not said a single word that we would abolish the State Security Courts. What would you do? With what would you create a democratic authority? Don't touch criminals! Some people should have criminal immunity! This cannot be democratic authority. The problem of Turkey is the vacuum of democratic authority!Look 6,000 people have been killed in Turkey. How many people were punished? Turkey's problem is that it could not deal with illegalities. It could not make the judiciary function. It caught the man, but watched him escape from prison. Then came an amnesty and everyone came out. The people who are damaged are those killed and their families, but no one is fighting for their rights. A merciful feeling comes at one period, and then everyone starts defending a number of killers. This cannot be democracy. Such a democracy cannot be defended. You cannot make such a democracy function. I'll say this openly; Turkey should not come to the point of where it will miss these days. The State Security Courts can open investigations and put people on trial... Imset: What happened to Ozgur Gundem seems to be an outstanding example of press freedoms. What do you have to say about this? Demirel: I'll give you the note which has been given to me with regard to the search conducted at Ozgur Gundem. Can you defend this? No one can defend this: According to telephone conversations between Ozgur Gundem Editor in Chief Gurbetelli Ersoz and PKK European representative Mustafa Karasu (code named Huseyin) as well as Faysal Dumlayici, who is making press statements under the name of Kani Yilmaz as the ERNK [National Liberation Front of Kurdistan] representative (recorded with permission from the republic prosecutors office), information has been obtained that the newspaper is completely affiliated to the PKK. Under a decision taken by the State Security Court, a search was conducted of Ozgur Gundem and the Zagros printing house, and it revealed the bloodstained diary and the bullet-riddled identification card of private Muzaffer Ulusata, who was martyred on March 9, 1993, in a clash with terrorists in the Findikli district of Sirnak. This is what has been found. Documents showing that articles written by Abdullah Ocalan were published under the name Ali Firat. Documents which show that all of the executives of the newspaper are appointed by the PKK and are people known in the past to have carried out executive duties in the PKK organization. In fact, Editor in Chief Gurbetelli Ersoz is known to have been the Cukurova regional PKK executive in the past. An ERNK invoice of 400 million liras which shows that donations have been collected for the PKK. Now you are calling this a newspaper office and write: "Today them, tomorrow us." Can you defend this? Cevik: But we are not defending this. Sir, when you were prime minister, we wrote about these things and said them. Especially then there were orders being received from the PKK. We were even made into a target. Demirel: What is Ozgur Gundem for you that you show it as an example for democracy in Turkey? Cevik: But sir, something done to one place could be done to another tomorrow. I am talking not only about what has been done to a newspaper. This has been done even to you. Demirel: No sir, I was neither an arsonist... Cevik: But they did it despite this! Demirel: They did nothing to me. What did the man do to me? He forced me to stay in my house. Did I stay I my house? I broke through the walls and came out. I had neither a gun, nor a knife nor anything else. I was only right. I mean this man is going to collect money for the PKK, and the same PKK will go and massacre 29 innocent citizens in the Sunduz plateau. It will kill so many soldiers and then what is being done? What else can be done?
