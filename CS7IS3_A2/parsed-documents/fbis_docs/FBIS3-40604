At the same time, she told the relevant government agencies to become fully active in this area. While chairing a high-level meeting of an antinarcotics task force in Islamabad on 30 November, she approved plans for a strong and effective operation against major smugglers and smuggling in this country. On this occasion, Madam Bhutto said that the drug smugglers must be arrested at any cost, and the government will not accept political pressure of any kind in this context so that this curse can be eradicated from our country. While addressing this special meeting, the prime minister instructed them to deal with the drug smugglers with an iron hand. The government cannot tolerate this ugly crime and curse under any circumstance because this curse has ruined thousands of people and their families. Who does not know that production and smuggling of drugs in our country has caused innumerable social and moral ills here and many people are losing their health and lives. Not only this, members of their family, after suffering from economic and social crisis, lead impoverished lives. If we briefly survey our recent past, we will learn that the drug abuse epidemic that has spread all over our country did not even exist 12-14 years earlier. There was not even one heroin addict in our whole country, and now they number in the hundreds of thousands. The number is increasing rapidly. In addition, we are getting a bad name abroad, and this is not a secret. Those who have travelled abroad well know that every Pakistani is considered to be a drug dealer in Western nations although most of these nations suffer from this curse themselves. It is our misfortune that many influential persons in our country are involved or they are protecting these criminals who are involved in this hated drug trade here or abroad. At times, this involvement enters into our politics because it is not possible to practice politics here without a lot of money, and there is no easier way to collect a lot of money than this trade. A review of the drug trade shows that it is destroying our society here and giving our country a bad name abroad. The previous governments had also announced plans of action against drug smugglers, and the leaders had expressed their determination to use an iron hand to arrest drug smugglers and punish them in order to rid the country of this curse. However, the spout continued to flow right there. The action of the present government to rid society of the curse of drugs and to take action against it is commendable. Still, we must study the reasons for the failure of previous governments in this area. Who are the people who protect these criminals? Why were not the operations launched in the past successful? Until these basic facts are analyzed, every campaign in this area will be unsuccessful.
