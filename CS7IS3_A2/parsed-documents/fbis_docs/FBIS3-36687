This was said to your correspondent by Georgiy Zadonskiy, a prominent parliamentary figure. Exploiting the inexperience of a vast majority of the deputies, he explained, a document was imposed on them without discussion that turns the modest State Duma speaker into its president. He meant the decree "On Providing Support for the State Duma's Activity," which gives Chairman Ivan Rybkin powers to form the chamber's staff. The chief of staff, who, among other things, takes care of the parliamentarians' social and consumer needs, was subordinated directly to the parliamentary speaker, and comrade Ivan Rybkin, whose powers have until recently been limited to a humble steering of meetings, suddenly got powerful leverage for purposefully manipulating the deputy corps from behind the scenes. However decent a figure the current parliamentary chief may have been cutting so far, it is still fresh in everyone's mind how extremely modest Ruslan Imranovich [Khasbulatov] was "at the beginning of glorious endeavors." [title of a novel about Peter the Great] But the temptation "to go down in history" turned out to be too irresistible. This is why the democrats, who initially just stood gaping, are intent on ringing a bell in that regard at the nearest State Duma plenary meeting.
