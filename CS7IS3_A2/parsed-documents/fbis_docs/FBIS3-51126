Abelenda] [Text] Luanda, 10 Jan (PL) -- On 10 January, Angolan Foreign Minister Venacio da Moura described relations between his country and Cuba, which he said are historical and invariable, as excellent. In an exclusive interview for PRENSA LATINA, da Moura said the ties between Luanda and Havana have remained at a constant level, as they are founded on solid relations based on mutual respect between two sovereign states. He added that cooperation continues to be privileged and advantageous, but admitted that due to current conditions, the economic ties have not reached the level both countries and peoples would hope. Commenting on the upcoming visit to Angola this week by his Cuban counterpart, Roberto Robaina, da Moura said it is aimed at seeking new ways to increase future cooperation, taking into consideration the complex situation both countries are facing. He added that Robaina's visit in Luanda will contribute to "keeping alive the flame of solidarity that started when the Cuban and Angolan people together shed their blood in defense of Angola's sovereignty." He stressed that despite the political and economic transformations in Angola during the past three years as a result of changes taking place in the world, the governments of Luanda and Havana have tried to maintain bilateral relations at the same level. We would like those relations to be even better, he said, but the current war in Angola caused by the armed UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] organization, as well as problems in Cuba due to the unjust commercial and financial blockade it faces, to a large extent limit our economic ties. Nevertheless, he added, those difficulties have not prevented our mutual cooperation from growing. In no way have they weakened that cooperation, and they will not be an obstacle to continuing relations on the same path they have followed over the past 20 years, he noted. During the interview, da Moura stressed that the Angolan Government will continue supporting and defending Cuba at all international forums. That has been and will continue to be our government's position, he stressed. Da Moura praised Cubans saying that "their firmness is their best defense against the constant aggressions and difficulties they have faced during the past years." In Cuba's struggle against destabilizing actions a key factor has been the nation's solid leadership headed by President Fidel Castro, da Moura concluded.
