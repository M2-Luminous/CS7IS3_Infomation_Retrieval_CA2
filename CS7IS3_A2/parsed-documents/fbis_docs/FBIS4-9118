On the other hand, Gorazde needs measures that should be taken immediately to save the children, women, and men exposed to intensive fire. Many of them were forced to come out in the streets with choking gas and irritants, and then massacred with mortar and sniper fire. As of yesterday, the aggressor forces have been using surface-to-surface missiles, which have devastating effects. Allow me to remind you that nearly 80,000 people have been forced to go to a very small area. They represent an easy (?moving, target) [words indistinct]. Your excellency, the bloodshed must immediately be stopped with all available means. I am sure that your organization will take action (?in the name of humanity and justice) without delay. The mass killing of the innocent civilians of Gorazde must stop. This was stated in a letter which Haris Silajdzic has sent to Manfred Woerner.
