We ask because your personal political practice substantially differs not only from Polish social democracy and Weiss's Slovak Party of the Democratic Left, but also from the conduct of the CSSD Deputies' Club in parliament. [Zeman] First of all, I start with the assumption that Czech social democracy has, as opposed to Poland or Slovakia, where it was not very strong between the wars, a certain tradition that must be respected but not blindly followed. There was a 40-year suspension here, while the West European social democracies progressed. We are approaching the Western political culture only very slowly, and sometimes the communist way of thinking prevails within us. [German Social Democratic Party (SPD) leader] Rudolf Scharping, for instance, in a televised discussion, described [German Chancellor] Helmut Kohl as an overgrown infant with cottage cheese on his brain, and the German voter takes it as something completely normal. If I used the same expression, I would be marked as a cryptocommunist, at least. [LIDOVE NOVINY] After all, the SPD is shaped differently, and its supporters are not pining for communist "security." Moreover, the alternative you offer is very vague and rather confrontational toward the hitherto changes.... [Zeman] I do not believe it is vague. It is based on the idea of solidarity. There are three maxims in the West European concept: freedom, justice, and solidarity. Every political party, even those that do not really mean it, will tell you today that it advocates freedom. Solidarity is the idea that society should take care of the people who will reach the state of not only social, but also human need. The entire problem rests in the fact that solidarity cannot be just a passive protectionism. We must seek an active policy aimed at the creation of new jobs, the development of the education and health-care systems.... If you set yourself this goal, the question immediately emerges of how to finance it. No program can be complete without answering this question. The difference between social democracy and, say, the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] is quite obvious on this point. Just as we do not say that ecology is only the icing on the cake, we do not claim that the market will solve everything. We want society to have a long-term concept. We need industrial policy, structural policy, exports-enhancing policy, transport, and energy policies. If the government economists occasionally tell us that they do not need it because the market will solve everything, we disagree because we know that it all exists in the advanced economies. We did not make it up. [LIDOVE NOVINY] Nonetheless, the need for a long-term positive perception was also expressed recently by a cofounder of the ODS, Miroslav Macek, in RUDE PRAVO. Likewise, in the right-wing parties, there are, if not trends, then individuals, who perceive certain things in a broader context. In comparison with them, your approach to politics does not belong to the most fortunate ones, particularly, as the public trust in the government is high, and social or economic tremors are not expected. [Zeman] We certainly do not wish for any social or economic tremors. It is irrelevant, however, what we wish. What is and what is not a realistic possibility is important. Yes, the government has the trust of the majority at this time. Although, if you browse through public opinion surveys, you will see that the trust has declined over the past three months. Let us ask, however, whether we are to respond only to the problems that are topical at a given time or also to those that will emerge in the foreseeable future. We have practically no unemployment, or it is very low, but it is becoming a regional phenomenon. While the government economists interpret the low unemployment as something favorable, we claim that it is, in effect, overemployment caused by the stagnation of industry restructuring. At the same time, industrial production is dropping. Another question is linked to the creation of regional development programs--in Ostrava region, for instance. Phasing down programs are occasionally mentioned, but almost no one will say what substitute to offer for the original jobs. That is, if we disregard the various plans for reforestation, grassing over, etc., which are about as realistic as Baudys's plan for a peaceful settlement of the situation in Bosnia. We simply lack a combination of the market and extra- or supra-market mechanisms. That is where I see a specific difference. I read the interview with Mr. Macek. His long-term vision is reminiscent of Khrushchev's Communist Party program: Already this very generation will live in communism. I am repelled by all political parties without exception, which claim that theirs is the only acceptable way. If they offer a bright future and shining tomorrows, I do not care whether the shining tomorrows are communist or market because, in both instances, it is just an illusion. [LIDOVE NOVINY] Nevertheless, people trust the ODS and Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA], and it is, above all, the young and the better educated who believe in them. Does it not prove something? [Zeman] I believe that it is given by several factors. Of course, the declining social economic situation hit the pensioners the hardest. I would say that a certain ebb will ensue. Of course, some young dissatisfied people are attracted by the republicans--precisely by their radicalism. They have simple, understandable answers. Social democracy does not know simple answers. It does not know slogans of the type "the market will solve everything." [LIDOVE NOVINY] Certainly, but we are more interested in the reason for the small number of younger supporters of the CSSD.... [Zeman] Every generation must pass through political puberty. At the beginning of the 1950's, many intelligent young people trusted the communist ideology. Of course, we have not admitted it even to ourselves, and we pretend we were a nation that maintained an anticommunist resistance for 40 years. Well, and now, suddenly, because communism was of course abhorrent, it is only a natural reaction to say that the more the obvious opposite of communism is established, the better for us. I believe that Zhirinovskiy in Russia indicates to us that there is some nonlinear dependence. Extremes meet in a particular manner. The extreme left and the extreme right are often hard to distinguish. [LIDOVE NOVINY] Neither the ODS nor the ODA can be considered the extreme right. Moreover, the people have the opportunity today to compare the communist and the West European models of society according to their own experience. [Zeman] The possibility of a comparison is not given by a trip to the West lasting several days. In a superficial, short-term view, you often realize the actual problems just as little as the Western tourists perceive ours. Anyway, that is not the issue. [LIDOVE NOVINY] Nevertheless, it was precisely the CSSD supporters, together with Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia [KSCM] supporters, who most frequently named [Association for the Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia chairman] Miroslav Sladek in public opinion surveys as the second-most-acceptable alternative. [Zeman] If you want to support your argument by public opinion polls, I must point out that, to the question of which is the second-most-attractive party, the ODS supporters replied that the ODA is, while the ODA supporters named the social democracy. I do not wish to draw any definite conclusions from it, but I rather tend to believe that the support by the younger-age groups for political extremes is caused by a certain impasse, desperate situation. There are also numerous privatization and corruption problems. [LIDOVE NOVINY] Your party claimed that it would consistently determine and disclose corruption affairs, and nothing much has happened.... [Zeman] A lack of information is not an argument. We have published, for instance, the Aero Holding affair. We proposed that an investigation commission be established. The government deputies rejected this proposal. I ask, why? We published the Plzen breweries affair. I am not accusing you of violating Article 102, but, even as we speak, you are at variance with the claim made by Interior Minister Jan Ruml, who publicly declared that the social democracy is responsible for the Wallis affair. Of course, I do not claim that we are. I only say that Minister Ruml believes it. At the time of the Hradec congress, we were assured by the former leadership that we are the wealthiest party, so we assumed that investigation teams composed of lawyers, journalists, and economists would be established. When we learned that we are not able to finance these teams--which we, of course, learned only after the congress--it slowed us down but did not change our attitude. [LIDOVE NOVINY] You said that some parties offer simple solutions. Would you not say that your statement "we are after the government's throat" qualifies for such a denotation? [Zeman] A statement of the "we are after the government's throat" type is used in the West by opposition politicians on a daily basis in an infinite number of variations. I can understand that, in a country nursed on the communist political culture, such a statement seems rather out of place. Nevertheless, let us not be hypocrites. If we keep saying that we want to get closer to the Western political culture, we must understand that a certain, albeit rough, exchange of invectives between the government and the opposition is an organic part of it. I attended a conference of the British Labour Party in Brighton recently. There, [Labour Party Leader] John Smith recommended that the British Conservative Party replace [British Prime Minister] John Major with the winner of the last Liverpool [Grand National] steeplechase--i.e., by a horse. As you might have observed, I have not suggested that Vaclav Klaus be replaced by Zeleznik [Pardubice steeplechase winner]. Hence, I am somewhat more moderate. During the U.S. presidential campaign, George Bush said that his dog Millie understands foreign policy better than Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton, as opposed to Mr. Hruska [district police chief who sued Zeman for comments on his education], did not sue George Bush for damages of $100,000. We may dislike it. Let us ask why we dislike it. Whether it is not just that we are used to an opposition of the National-Front type, but, then, the National Front has never been an opposition. [LIDOVE NOVINY] You claim that your party does not offer simple solutions. It seems, however, that your bon mot attracted more supporters to the CSSD than its complex program. [Zeman] The fact that we are not able to offer simple solutions and that a positive program, of course, is more complex and continues to develop does not mean that we would not use, like any opposition party in the West, also formulations that will point out to the voters that we are a vigorous and aggressive rather than an obedient opposition. After all, you have an example in the parliament of a constructive and accommodating opposition. It is Hirs's liberal, social, national, and who-knows-what party. I do not have the feeling that the Czech political scene can in any way benefit from such an accommodating opposition. An opposition that is not attacking and trying to replace the ruling party in the next elections is not an opposition. It is only a certain modification of that well-behaving National Front type of party. [LIDOVE NOVINY] The claim that coupon privatization is a fraud belongs to the simple slogans. Nevertheless, several hundred thousand more people have registered for the second wave of registration than did for the first wave, and some investors made a nice profit. Would you not say that your conjecture is rather controversial? [Zeman] The enterprises privatized by the coupon privatization methods have two possibilities: The first, less common, has most capital shared by small investors. You will see that, in such an instance, the management virtually cannot be recalled. The other possibility, and one that occurs more frequently, has most of the share capital owned by privatization funds. The privatization fund is, however, a stockholding company in its own right. It has small shareholders exclusively. Thus, the management of these stockholding companies called privatization funds cannot be recalled, either. At the same time, one of the basic principles of the market economy is the right of the owner for an efficient control of the management. Our enterprises are de facto owned by the managers. I do not question their talents or efficiency but, rather, point out that, because of links from the past era, many of these managers are people who were brought up under the former regime and who, under the present system, when no sufficient legislative barriers exist, can have the tendency to bring the enterprise to bankruptcy, start their own company, and operate it at the cost of the quasi-privatized enterprise. They can also reach an agreement with a foreign capital company that does not always come to this country with such good intentions as to bring in the know-how and new technology and utilize the advantage of cheap labor but can be, instead, interested in eliminating a local manufacturer to open the Czech market for its own products. I am not claiming that it always is the case. I would wrong our managers--and I respect many of them. I do claim, however, that it can happen and that it is actually happening already in a marginal number of cases. That is my principal objection to coupon privatization. Yes, let us say that the Harvard Funds or any other fund will pay more for a share than its symbolic book value is. I say--and what? We all live and are going to live in this country. We all are going to depend on the output of our economy--i.e., on the output of the industrial enterprises. If we opted for a privatization method that reduces this output, we will all have to pay for it and will notice it in the lower standard of living, in our real income, and also in what is called the quality of life. [LIDOVE NOVINY] Some time ago, you said that there is no discrepancy between your annual report and the analysis by Mr. Novotny. So, why such a long discussion about something that is not controversial, and why did the Central Executive Committee members receive only the first part of Novotny's material and not the whole thing? [Zeman] One has to realize that material regarding electoral preferences was discussed by the presidium approximately one month after it was received. So, you cannot say that the reaction was belated. This is the part that was put at the disposal of the Central Executive Committee. Regarding the second part, I believe that the discussion should continue. We are seeking ways to make us a more efficient opposition rather than an obedient one. I do not like parties that claim their congress to be the most important event of the year in domestic politics if they state, at the same time, that nothing significant happened at this congress. Every live party should contemplate its mistakes because its eventual successes are brought about by the voters, and, therefore, they do not have to think about the successes. We are perceived as an alternative to the current government policy, and if it is to be viable, it must be continuously cultivated. I pity the parties that do not do it. [LIDOVE NOVINY] On the outside, the CSSD seems to be a party full of controversial and contradicting analyses, materials, and reports. [Zeman] You are starting from two unmentioned assumptions. First, a party, in which there are no discussions and possible alternatives of development or hypotheses are not compared is a better party than one in which discussions are taking place. Second, you believe that, if the deputies' club of a party is assessed in at least two different ways, the party must be worse than one that has a unified opinion in its deputies' club. Both of these assumptions, which you did not mention but are valid, nonetheless, can be questioned. In the Middle East war, only two types of missiles were used. Unguided ones, which could not correct their course during flight--i.e., the Scud missiles. They mostly fell down in the desert and caused only minor damage. The guided, self-correcting antimissile Patriot missiles mostly hit their targets precisely because of the self-correcting feature. The social democrats are trying to be like these guided missiles. That means a missile that corrects its course in flight. We consider the politics of the ruling parties, particularly the ODS, which are often intoxicated by what Fulbright called the arrogance of power, an uncorrected course. So, ask yourself what is more expedient. Is it not to contemplate the possibilities and talk, make a decision, and go on? I myself asked that we take stock of our situation after one year. We could have kept saying how successful and great we are, how the nation admires us, and then come to the Ostrava ice arena [as Klaus did] and learn the opposite. [LIDOVE NOVINY] God forbid that we would think that a party in which there are no discussions, or only one person discusses the issues, is better than a party in which discussions take place. The opposite is true. It seems on the outside, however, that there is not much willingness for discussion in your party.... [Zeman] Two or three months do not solve the problem. Nonetheless, I can say that there is a proposal in my report to the Central Executive Committee that our Central Committee, which has held a 120-member-body meeting for one day every two or three months so far be divided into specific working sections that will deal with certain problem areas. The Central Committee working sections should identify the questions that are felt to be the most burning problems. I completely agree with Ota Novotny on this count, and that is also how I understand his proposal. [LIDOVE NOVINY] You spoke about those simplifying slogans. We believe that your report was a simplifying one. We are referring to the part in which you demagogically spoke about our right wing as having fascist tendencies.... [Zeman] Jiri Vcelar Kotas, who has been explaining to us in this country for a long time what an authentic right wing is, said once that the more right it is the better. That is on the record. I polemicize with this statement because, just as the left wing per se is nothing harmful, while in its extreme form--i.e., the communist form--it certainly is harmful, so there is nothing harmful on the conservative right wing. However, as soon as it reaches the extreme forms--if the space for the application of democratic institutions is reduced, the powers of the Supreme Control Office limited, and if, after the abolition of the Prosecutor General's Office, we transfer to the state attorney system, one of the self-correcting mechanisms is weakened--an intermediate stage ensues. Let us call the first stage an authoritarian one. It is happening again that the posts in the state apparatus are filled according to the party membership and not according to the qualifications. I could name other forms of nondemocratic tendencies. The proof by contradiction means that you try to simulate what happens as you reach the end of this process. Even if the end is very remote. My report says: fascist tendencies in their extremes. That is a common form of expression when you are trying to say how bitter the ends would be precisely because you want to prevent their actually taking place. You try to point out that you have set off on an avalanche slope, for instance, and want to go somewhere else. You are glad when the avalanche does not occur. [LIDOVE NOVINY] Of course, Mr. Kotas does not represent our right wing. He is more of a tragicomic figure.... [Zeman] Our right wing is Mr. Kotas. It was Mr. Kotas who said that the more right, the better. I repeat that this statement is complete nonsense. Mr. Kotas declared himself a right-winger, and, in his time, he was known to a nonnegligible part of the public as a representative of the right wing. I must respect this fact.
