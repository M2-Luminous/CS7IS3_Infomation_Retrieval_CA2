Ghaffari: "PRC-Iran: Strategic Cooperation in the Future"] [15 Mar 94 p 4] [Excerpts] Qian Qichen, deputy prime minister of the PRC, who is also the foreign minister, made a regional trip and visited Bangladesh, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and the Islamic Republic of Iran. His trip to Iran was the most significant of all and it elicited much attention from political circles. Within the context of the PRC foreign minister's visit to Iran, we can look at the long-standing relations between the two countries and the trend toward broadening political and economic relations, as the PRC Government has always had friendly relations with Iran, even in the distant past. [passage omitted] Even though in recent years, cooperation between the PRC and Iran has increased remarkably, it appears that there is greater scope for joint economic cooperation. There is evidence of the two countries' eagerness to expand these relations and the PRC has focused its attention on the Islamic Republic of Iran because it is a large and important country in the Persian Gulf, southwest Asia and the Middle East, which can play an important role in regional developments as a political balance. Reciprocally, as regards its foreign policy calculations, Iran considers the PRC a major country that is undergoing the greatest economic prosperity of the century and one that enjoys immense scope for maneuvering in the political arena of today. The turmoil in the world prior to the Cold War and the elimination of tensions generated by the end to the Cold War; the U.S. domination in the world by a minority [as published]; and the new world order as propounded by the United States are the various phenomena that have heightened the sensitivity of Iran and the PRC so that the two countries have attained unanimity through greater historical understanding and political acumen with regard to the political developments in the region. [passage omitted] As regards the use of nuclear energy in Iran, the United States has fomented tension in the region, implying that the PRC has initiated measures to transfer technology to Iran which is not for economic advantages but for military and political objectives. However, regardless of the tumultuous uproar in the world spearheaded by the United States regarding Iran's program of peaceful and amicable utilization of nuclear energy , the PRC continues its cooperation with Iran. What has been termed PRC-Iranian nuclear cooperation has generated much concern on the part of the Pentagon. The U.S. apprehension can be viewed in the context of two perceptions: first, remarks by Iranian officials have raised questions about Iran's commitment to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and second, the Middle East and the Persian Gulf are regions in which the use of nuclear weapons would be extremely destabilizing. However, the United States, with its usual erroneous appraisals in foreign policy and for reasons of security and intelligence, is not inclined to elaborate on the nuclear issue in relation to Iran, Pakistan, DPRK, and India. Perhaps, according to the perceptions of the Pentagon echelons, the presence of nuclear weapons in the Middle East can be a useful lever and a pretext to exert pressure on these countries at sensitive junctures. However, the vigilant nations that have thrown off the shackles of colonialism and exploitation are well aware that the usurpist Jerusalem regime is the sole nuclear power in the Middle East and it even opposes inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. No Western or American government has ever protested against this regime. However, the United States audaciously declares that Iran's acquisition of nuclear capability may not be imminent but the United States has its own assessment upon which it is not willing to elaborate. It also has no reason to believe that there is no cooperation between Iran and the PRC as regards a military-nuclear program. Simultaneously, the U.S. mass media launched a coordinated propaganda program with similar reports that Iran is seeking to gain a nuclear capability and has the benefit of the PRC's cooperation and collaboration! The United States has constantly used the lever of pressure on various countries so that it can impede their paths of broadening cooperation with Iran. The PRC, which wishes to have deep and principled relations with Iran and in numerous cases pursues an independent policy on the international scene, has constantly been the target of U.S. blackmail. The United States has admitted to exerting pressure on various countries to prevent their cooperation with Iran in the field of nuclear technology and this is only the tip of the iceberg. [16 Mar 94 p 4] After the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the United States directed most of its efforts toward destroying relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and other countries and isolating Iran in the international arena. This can be considered an unchangeable characteristic of U.S. policies. Political circles have described Iran's gaining nuclear capability as an extremely destabilizing factor in the Middle East, adding that the report of nuclear cooperation between Iran and the PRC is being disseminated just when those who participated in the Madrid peace conference have been sentenced to death! [as published] In the same vein, a U.S. nuclear expert stated that Iran and Pakistan have crossed the line toward the acquisition of nuclear weapons and Iraq has done a lot of research in the nuclear field. Had it not been for the Persian Gulf war, Iraq would have succeeded in manufacturing a nuclear bomb. U.S. intelligence officials have apparently reached the conclusion that Iran is seriously and actively seeking to produce nuclear weapons and the PRC is assisting it in this regard. In conjunction with this clamor, THE NEW YORK TIMES commented under the title of "Hot Oil" saying: Most of the leaders of the Islamic Revolution are in favor of gaining access to nuclear weapons and a cautious assessment on the part of the intelligence sources indicates that Iran's nuclear program is currently noncohesive and in its rudimentary stages. The PRC has considerable capability in nuclear technology and the Beijing authorities have officially admitted to the sale of this technology to Iraq, Algeria, and Pakistan. The same newspaper described Beijing-Tehran relations as extremely cordial, adding that in the past 10-12 years, the PRC has sold large quantities of weapons to Iran. Tokyo and Moscow did not wish to lag behind in being affected by this rumor and expressed concern over PRC-Iran cooperation in the nuclear field! They stated that if the above were true they would be forced to take appropriate measures! It is worth mentioning that regarding social and cultural relations as well as in its political balances, the PRC keeps the necessary considerations in mind. This is borne out by the fact that on the controversial issue of exporting nuclear technology to Iran, the PRC stressed that in its exports it firmly ensures adherence to the principles of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency], including the peaceful utilization of nuclear technology and non-transfer to a third country. From this viewpoint, the PRC and Iran, within the framework of mutual relations, have given priority to issues that are far removed from the tension, blackmail, and instability in the region. When the United States realizes that it is not able to mar relations between Iran and the PRC, it will certainly seek other chimerical pretexts for creating obstructions and damaging relations between the two countries. In order to isolate Iran and the PRC on the political and international level, the United States accuses them of violation of human rights. The PRC is charged with maltreatment of the Muslims in its northern province of Sinkiang and of exporting nuclear technology to the countries of southwest Asia. Similarly, Iran is declared an opponent of the Middle East peace trend and is accused of government-sponsored terrorism and similar issues. Despite all this, the PRC and Iran have displayed a high degree of restraint and openmindedness in their foreign policy, which can be considered a principled course in reciprocal relations. The PRC foreign minister attended the 48th UN General Assembly session, at which he described the old order as based on unequal relations and explained that such an order was anachronistic. He added that the world of the future should not merely be geared to the interests and privileges of the greater powers and international affairs should not be the monopoly of the larger and stronger countries. Even though the United States and the former Soviet Union had concurred on the reduction of nuclear arms, the presence of a vast arsenal of non-conventional weapons gives a different message. The policy of force still prevails in the world and the greater countries still exert economic pressure on all countries, thus seeking to increase the chasm between the countries of the north and the south. The PRC believes that conditions should be created for the development of the Third World countries to establish peace and security in the world. Equality among governments in mutual relations and non-intervention in their internal affairs is a principle which--from the PRC perspective--should be applied to all countries without exception. In this regard, the PRC believes that a survey of the human rights situation should not be permitted to tarnish the sovereignty of countries as human rights and basic freedom of human beings should be applied equally to all.
