It was a serious incident stirred up by a small number of lawbreakers. He stressed: The lawbreakers instigated some villagers who were unaware of the true facts to attack the policemen in order to prevent the public security personnel from arresting criminal offenders. When the policemen found that they could not perform their duties, and their lives and safety were threatened, they were forced to take the necessary emergency measures. According to the responsible official of the Public Security Department of Guangdong Province, on the early morning of 1 April, between 0500 and 0600, the Xiayong Town police office subordinate to the Daya Bay Public Security Sub-bureau dispatched 10 policemen to arrest two criminals, Chen Ren-X and Chen X-hui, in Bogang Village. According to information and evidence held by the police, the two suspected criminals were involved in four blackmail cases last July and August and extorted more than 13,000 yuan from their victims. They seriously threatened law and order in the local community. Through careful investigation, the public security organ decided to send policemen to arrest the two people. The policemen acted in two groups, and they caught the two suspected criminals in a short time. Chen X-hui was brought back to the police station first. When the policemen were going to take Chen Ren-X away from the village, he suddenly cried "help!" His younger brothers and sisters-in-law took clubs and stones and chased the policemen. The attackers beat up the policemen -- who had displayed their certificates and the arrest warrant -- and even beat a policeman unconscious. When finding that their warnings were ineffective, another policeman was forced to pull out his pistol and shoot at the leg of club-wielding Chen X-chao, elder brother of Chen Ren-X. This shocked the besiegers and stopped their attack. At 0900 that morning, the police station inspector led several police officers to Bogang Village to explain their actions. On the way to the village, they encountered a number of armed villages who were planning to attack the police station. Persuaded by the police officers, some villagers returned home, but more than 100 people still rushed to the police station as encouraged by Chen X-shan. They demanded the release of criminal Chen X-hui. Leaders of the Xiayong Town Office and police officers of the police station patiently explained what had happened, but the villagers ignored the warnings and continued to storm the police station. Zhang Xinde, chief of the Daya Bay Public Security Bureau, then led a group of police officers to the area and took resolute action to arrest Chen X-shan, Chen X-wen, Chen X-hua, Chen X-jun, and Chen X-ling who took the lead in stirring up trouble, and thus calmed down the incident. The official said that this case of instigating villagers to stir up trouble was very serious. At present, the Daya Bay Public Security Bureau is intensively investigating the case. Those who took the lead in impeding police officers from carrying out their tasks, instigating villagers to storm the police station, and attacking and injuring public security personnel will be punished severely according to the law.
