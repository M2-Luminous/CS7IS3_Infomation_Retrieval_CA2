This act pours cold water on an atmosphere in which a new phase of dialogue finally became possible as North Korea agreed to follow-up inspections, including additional inspections of its radiochemical laboratory, which has been an issue for a long time. North Korea probably has the hidden aim to baffle its counterparts, the IAEA and the United States, by even more complicating the nuclear issue to have a favorable negotiating position. I am greatly concerned about North Korea's act because it is an extremely dangerous gamble that may cause a crisis. The international community, including the United States, repeatedly warned North Korea that if North Korea proceeded with changing the fuel rods on its own, they would suspend dialogue with North Korea and apply sanctions through the UN Security Council. Accordingly, if North Korea's notification to the IAEA that it began changing the fuel rods means a full-pledged change, sanctions against North Korea will become inevitable and the situation on the Korean peninsula will become more unstable. When North Korea agreed to the additional inspections of the radiochemical laboratory and it appeared likely that the IAEA inspection team would enter North Korea on 17 May to start its inspection activities, we expected a small breakthrough in resolving the nuclear issue. Our expectation was based on the view that North Korea would postpone changing the fuel rods to seek a solution to the nuclear problem at the third round of talks with the United States. The contents of North Korea's message to the IAEA leaves room for negotiations. The message says that North Korea will allow the preservation of fuel rods for samples if North Korean-U.S. high- level talks result in a package solution to the nuclear problem. Also, the position of the IAEA and the United States is that they will prepare countermeasures after receiving the results of additional and follow-up inspections, which will be conducted as planned despite North Korea's notification. The IAEA inspection team plans to carry out additional inspections of the radiochemical laboratory in addition to basic activities -- such as replacing batteries and film in the monitoring camera installed at the experimental reactor, whose fuel rods are supposed to be changed this time, and confirming the seals of the reactor. U.S. policy is that after receiving the results of these inspections, it will decide whether to hold the third round of talks with North Korea. North Korea's attempt to change the fuel rods under this situation is not a wise decision although it might be a strategy to lead negotiations in a direction favorable to North Korea. Changing the fuel rods without IAEA taking samples will only increase the international community's suspicion that North Korea is trying to hide its extraction of nuclear materials. In addition, it will make dialogue with the United States, which North Korea desires, impossible and will possibly result in sanctions against North Korea through the UN Security Council. The international community will hardly put up with North Korea's dangerous gamble any longer. North Korea is urged to find a way to negotiations while there is the possibility of dialogue.
