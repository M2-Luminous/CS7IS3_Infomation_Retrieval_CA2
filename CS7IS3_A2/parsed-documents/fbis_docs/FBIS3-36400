Speaking at a news conference held at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry today, the minister emphasized that an important fact about this resolution is that the Supreme Council positively evaluated steps taken by the Ukrainian president and Government directed at implementing recommendations suggested by the Ukrainian parliament, which was reflected in the tripartite declaration and a supplement to it. It should be stressed, Anatoliy Zlenko noted, that by taking back its reservations to Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, the Ukrainian Supreme Council reconfirmed Ukraine's intention to join the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state. He also explained that the fact that the resolution did not contain a decision to join the Nonproliferation Treaty should not be understood as the legislature's negative attitude toward the treaty in principle, but as its intention to examine this issue at a separate session. This proves, Anatoliy Zlenko said, that the issue of joining the treaty has not been taken off the agenda.
