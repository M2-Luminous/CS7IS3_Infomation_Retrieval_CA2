The visit is expected to include the signing of six agreements which will determine the further development of Uzbek-Indian relations, in particular in the commercial and economic spheres. Karimov is expected to hold talks with Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao which will touch upon a wide range of bilateral and international questions. The Uzbek leader is also scheduled to give a speech at a meeting of the Confederation of Indian Industry. As the "NATIONAL HERALD", a paper known to be close to Indian government circles, pointed out, "Uzbekistan desires to cooperate with India in the industrial and trade sectors in order to stimulate its privatisation process and the transition to a free market economy". Therefore the Uzbek delegation includes the heads of recently privatised key enterprises in the Middle Asian republic, according to the paper. In its turn, India is ready to offer wholehearted help to the friendly ex-Soviet republic during this difficult transitional period of economic restructuring, the "NATIONAL HERALD" declared.
