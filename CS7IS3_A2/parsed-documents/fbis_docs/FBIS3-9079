[passage omitted] While there have been reports of previous violations of the cease-fire and the heavy weapons exclusion zone, this would appear to be the first time civilians had been wounded in a shell attack on Sarajevo since early February. The United Nations Protection Force could not confirm Saturday that a shell had been fired but said military observers had been sent to the site to investigate. Major Jose Labandeira, a UN spokesman, said that whatever the cause, it was an "isolated incident". It was very difficult to control all the 40 to 60 millimeter mortars which can be carried around by an individual, he said.
