Unfortunately, there was no such line to purchase the Sokol--only those who wanted to take rides in it. Because of its good qualities and the international acclaim it has garnered, the helicopter competes strongly with others in its class. However, the general crisis in the aviation branch has made the competition considerably tougher. The Sokol is now the best-known Polish aviation product. It comes in many different versions: fire-fighting, luxury, medevac, air-sea rescue, combat, etc. Work is constantly being done to improve it. An important asset of the Sokol is its price: less than half as much as other similar designs. The WSK [Transportation Equipment Plant] PZZ Swidnik, which produces it, is counting heavily on strong export sales. The flattering reviews that have been picked up during the shows and international exhibitions clearly favor this effort. The most reliable market, however, even though it is not as receptive, is the domestic one. The military, the police, and the other state training organizations are now committed customers. Regular orders are growing. The military, for example, is already flying several Anakond aircraft--that is, modifications of the Sokol that are designed for air-sea rescue. Preparations are also being made for the production of a transport helicopter version for the Army that can carry about 15 soldiers. In the combat version, the proposals include the Salamander and the Huzar, which is outfitted with Western equipment and weapons. The Swidnik plant can also make money on the production of the PW-5, a glider that has won in world competition. Cooperation with the company ATR should also yield profits. The modernization of several sections of the plant is just the first result of preparations to manufacture subassemblies for the ATR-72 aircraft. Mielec or, more accurately, the Transportation Equipment Factory in that city, is the largest and best-known aircraft plant in our country. A special economic zone was to be established here as an "incubator" for business, and the production of subway cars for the Warsaw metro has even been undertaken. Finally, the Iryda, the An-28, the M-20 Mewa, the Iskierka, and the Dromader aircraft are also being produced here. Cooperation with Boeing (in the production of aircraft doors) is also raising hopes for the future. The designers are working on several new projects. It will soon be possible to talk about them. Thus far, orders from the military (for the Iryda) have constituted the best source of funds. There are not enough sales of them, however, to finish work on a contract (for the purchase of engines and equipment) amounting to 58 Mewas for a U.S. company. This year the military may also procure 10 An-28 Bryza aircraft. The sale of several tens of Dromader aircraft has also been finalized. It has turned out that all of the aircraft, when properly advertised, still consistently find buyers. Everyone in Mielec is hoping that the worst is now over. Despite what some of our former "politicians" may think, they feel that, in the future, they will no longer be condemned to produce just golf carts. Among other things, historical tradition (the plant dates back to the 1930's) favors the appearance of an aviation plant that will be able to handle government orders and production for export. The PZL [Polish Aviation Plant] Okecie is primarily a manufacturer of aircraft such as the Wilga, the Koliber, the Orlik, and the Flaming. However, the enterprise should most of all tout (if it manages to begin production of it) the widely renowned Skorpion battlefield aircraft. The best-sellers at the moment are the Orlik and the Wilga. There are high hopes for the Flaming, which may break into the U.S.-Canadian market. There is a real chance of selling about 2,000 copies there. Basic information about other Polish enterprises in the aviation industry, along with their production profiles, can be summarized in several sentences. The Institute of Aviation is involved in the development and design of aircraft and engines. The Combine for Standard Hydraulic Parts, PZL-HYDRAL, in Wroclaw produces fuel regulators for turbojet and turboprop engines, hydraulic components, and systems, and turns out heating equipment and electronic gear. The Transportation Equipment Plant PZL-Rzeszow produces a whole line of engines for aircraft and helicopters, as well as various kinds of engine parts. The Transportation Equipment Plant Kalisz also has a similar production profile. A completely atypical aviation plant that is currently experiencing growing organizational-financial difficulties is the Glider Experimental-Production Enterprise PZL Bielsko."The enterprise is struggling to survive. We should recall that the most famous Polish glider designers (Foka, Cobra, Jantar, etc.) once came from there. It is now producing the Puchacz, Junior, and the Jantar Standard, as well as three record-holding gliders: the SZD-55 (15-meter class), the SZD-56, and the aerobatic SZD-59. The search for optimum solutions that could help solve the aviation industry's main problems has already begun. Efforts at cooperation are being renewed, and cooperative ties are being steadily tightened. In the near future, there should be a clearly formulated concept of how military and civilian aviation will develop. At that point, it will be realistically possible to evaluate the prospects for our "wings" and those who build them.
