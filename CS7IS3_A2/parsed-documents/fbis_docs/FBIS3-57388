Olkhovikov promised to present withdrawal timetable very soon, Luks said while adding another meeting would be held after a meeting in Stockholm on Paldiski reactors held from Tuesday to Thursday. The meeting was organised by the Swedish Foreign Ministry and besides Estonia and Russia also experts from U.S., Germany and Finland attend. The deadline for withdrawal is August 31, 1994. Estonian Justice Minister Kaido Kama told a government briefing on Tuesday the government had supported Justice Ministry's proposition to unite Paldiski with Keila, a small town some 30 km from Estonia's capital Tallinn, pending local elections. This would be a step on bringing civil power structures to Paldiski, Kama said. Local elections were skipped in Paldiski last fall due to Russian military presence.
