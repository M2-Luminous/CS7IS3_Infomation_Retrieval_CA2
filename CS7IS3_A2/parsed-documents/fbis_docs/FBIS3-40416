An important part of the DTI's Coal R&D programme, managed by the Coal Team of Energy Technology Support Unit (ETSU), will be the contribution of more than 500,000 pounds towards a collaborative programme on coal research. In addition, ETSU's Coal Team will provide active monitoring of a portfolio of coal-related research grants to ensure the full potential of the research is realised and disseminated as widely as possible.

DTI made a brief reference to the programme in press release P/93/287 dated 27/5/93. 2. The programme will continue under EPSRC after 1 April 1994. 3. Funds and manpower made available from ETSU will enhance the commitment SERC makes to coal and related research which currently stands at around 1 million pounds per annum. 4. Since 1 April 1990, the Coal Team at ETSU have undertaken programme management responsibility for the DTI's Coal R&D programme. This responsibility entails providing necessary technical support in the preparation and development of strategy, and the recruitment, assessment, contracting and management of R&D projects. The Coal Team comprises of Project Managers supported by administration, contracts, finance and technology transfer personnel, all of whom report to the Coal Programme Manager. A significant aspect of the DTI's Coal R&D programme is the support of fundamental research at Higher Education Institutes [HEI] of relevance to the development of clean coal technologies. Co-operation between HEIs, research institutes and industry in this research area has increased considerably over recent years, and the Coal R&D programme seeks to encourage this trend. Closer interaction enables industry to become increasingly aware of the capabilities of the HEIs and, consequently, to identify centres of expertise that are best suited to address specific research problems. In turn, HEIs are able to recognise more clearly industrial requirements and focus their research programmes accordingly. Fundamental coal science research is an international activity and it is important that UK research takes account of international developments and wherever possible is complementary in its approach. A priority for the Coal R&D programme is to continue to encourage UK coal researchers to derive maximum benefit from participation in international programmes. Under the SERC/DTI Scheme, the responsibilities of the SERC are: -- to undertake peer review according to usual practice; -- to award grants according to the standard SERC procedures and subject to normal SERC terms and conditions, except where modified to take account of the monitoring and dissemination activities of ETSU; -- to manage all financial aspects of supported projects. The responsibilities of ETSU are: -- to assess all coal-related applications to the SERC and advise the appropriate SERC Committee of the DTI's priority for funding (based on the relevance of each application to identified priority areas of the DTI's Coal R&D programme); -- to monitor actively the progress of research supported under the Scheme, through meetings between the Grant Holder and the ETSU Project Manager (usually at the Grant Holder's institution), typically held six-monthly; -- to enhance dissemination of basic information and results from each research project supported through the publication by ETSU of Project Profiles, Project Summaries and/or Final Reports.
