Mujalli Nasrawin, a Jordanian who used to be a member of the Ba'th party which rules Syria and Iraq, told AFP that al-Suwaydani was freed on Monday for health reasons. Himself released from a Syrian jail after 22 years, Nasrawin had called Saturday on Damascus to free al-Suwaydani, expressing fears he might die in al-Mazzah prison after having suffered an attack of hemiplegia. Al-Suwaydani, a Sunni Moslem, was army chief-of-staff on the side of Salah Jadid, whose Ba'th party faction clashed with al-Asad's in the late 1960s. At that time al-Asad, an Alawite Moslem, was air force chief under president Nur-al-Din al-Atasi, a Sunni. In 1968, al-Asad ousted al-Suwaydani, who was jailed a year later. In a 1970 coup, al-Asad overthrew al-Atasi to take over as president. Al-Atasi was freed in April 1992 and died last December in a Paris hospital, while Jadid died last August in a Damascus jail. Some 20 political prisoners have been in jail in Syria for more than 20 years, most of them arrested during al-Asad's coup, according to international human rights groups.
