Opening the National Discussions on State Administration yesterday at the Presidential Palace, the president said that society, both urban and rural, is very receptive to almost every policy, strategy, and program initiated by the government. The head of state said that various new forces autonomously dedicated to increasing and expanding development had begun to grow and move in an active way. "The government itself is adjusting to these progressive stages of social autonomy. The way to do it is to continue to implement government deconcentration and decentralization, along with economic deregulation and debureaucratization," he said. At the discussions, which were attended by Minister of Reform for State Apparatus T.B. Silalahi, Minister of Defense and Security Edi Sudradjat, and Minister/State Secretary Murdiono, the president mentioned that the government's mission is basically to foster and create the widest possible conditions and opportunities for the growth and formation of social initiatives and creativity for development. The various groups within society are expected to forge, generate, develop, and cultivate human initiatives and creativity in order to autonomously increase the standard and quality of life, both physical and spiritual. "Given such cooperation, we hope that we can progress rapidly in the years to come," said the president. The president said that institutionally the government is made up of two basic tiers--the governing political tier, which consists of the president, the vice-president, and the ministers, and the state administrative tier, which consists of officials and agencies under the ministers, which serve from the federal level down to the village level. The president said that it is this state administrative tier which professionally prepares and implements a set of policies, strategies and programs, which are established by the governing political tier. Part of the success of national development in the past few decades has come from the dedication and professional skills of this state administrative tier. "We must build up this state administrative tier. The development of the state administration is an integral part of our entire national development," he asserted. In another part of his speech, the president suggested that the development of the state administration is no less crucial to national development than the development of other areas. The development of the state administration, said the president, could only be done after the governing political tier was completely fixed up and it achieved stability in 1969. "Since then we have really been able to build up the state administration so that it can fulfill such an important function. We have all begun to enjoy the fruits of the development of the state administration through the functioning of the entire state administrative apparatus," said the president. However, the president continued, we should not feel satisfied yet. Economic competition between countries will be even sharper in the future. That is why society and the state administration must be able to increase the efficient and effective use of national resources. Before the president's speech, Hendropriyono, General Chairman of the National Discussions on State Administration, reported that 200 people are taking part in the three-day program. The speakers at the meeting will include a number of important figures in the administration, such as Awaludin Djamin, Bintoro Tjokromidjojo, Minister of Defense and Security Edi Sudradjat, and Minister of Education and Culture Wardiman Djojonegoro.
