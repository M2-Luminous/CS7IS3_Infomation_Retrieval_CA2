This was declared during Kozyrev's meeting with electors of the Murmansk region who elected Kozyrev to represent their interests in the State Duma. In Kozyrev's opinion, the process of transition of Russia's northern regions to the market economy is going on slowly. During Kozyrev's meeting with electors it was pointed out that a canned fish factory and another plant were stopped in the region because of economic difficulties. Metal works of the Murmansk region and the Kolar nuclear power station have been operating to half of their design capacity. It may seem a paradox, but Murmansk, a traditional supplier of fish products for all Russia, is currently facing serious shortages of marine products. The situation on the labour market has worsened as well. Every six adult resident of the region is expected to look for a job this year. Young people are abandoning northern areas which face an increasingly difficult problem of financing. Kozyrev believes that a way out of the critical situation can be found by improving the legislature which can be applied to all northern regions of the country. He calls for better use of the regional potential of the Kolar peninsula. [passage omitted]
