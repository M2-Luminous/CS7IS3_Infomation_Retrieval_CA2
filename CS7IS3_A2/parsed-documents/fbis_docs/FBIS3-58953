He said the withdrawal of the 2,500-strong British contingent serving with the UN Protection Force was being seriously considered by the Government. However, speaking on LWT's [expansion unknown] Walden programme, he stressed that no decision had yet been reached. His comments would appear to go further than those of Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd who, on a visit last week to the British UN force, said simply that no decision on withdrawal was "imminent." Mr. Rifkind said British troops had helped saved tens of thousands of lives and any withdrawal move would be taken only in conjuction with Britain's UN partners. "It is certainly an option that countries -- not just the United Kingdom -- are having to look at very seriously," he said. "There are very powerful arguments both for staying in Bosnia and there are some powerful arguments for withdrawing." He denied that his comments were intended to prepare the ground for a decision to pull out that had already been taken. "We are certainly indicating the possibility that that may be the sensible thing to do, but that reflects the reality of what has happened over the last year or so," he said. "We have not even taken any view in principle as to the desirability of withdrawal. What we have said is that the circumstances are deteriorating -- the situation has got more difficult. On several occasions we thought there was a possibility of peace between the various warring factions that would enable the situation to begin to materially improve but that is not happening. "It is therefore inevitable that the countries do begin to address the question as to where the balance of our moral duty -- as well as our political common sense -- lies." He said the UN operation had been successful in terms of distributing aid to thousands of people who would otherwise have starved to death. "At a humanitarian level, the UN has been more successful in Bosnia than in probably any other civil war in recent years around the world," he said. "It is for that reason one can't simply rush to the judgment that withdrawal must be the option to pursue." However, there was an argument that the UN's presence was prolonging the conflict by enabling protagonists, who would otherwise be forced to seek peace, to carry on fighting. "If we came to the sad but undeniable judgment that the UN presence was actually prolonging the war then obviously the course of action we would have to follow would then become much clearer," he said. In reaching a decision, the Government would have to consider whether troops were still able to carry out their mandate to distribute aid and whether the risk to British forces was still "acceptable." Mr. Rifkind defended Lord Owen's role as the European Union's mediator in Bosnia, following the European Parliament vote that he should be replaced. "I don't think anyone could fault the commitment, the dedication and the integrity that Lord Owen has shown during the period that he has been the mediator," he said. "On one or two occasions it has looked as if he might almost have been able to pull off a settlement but what has become sadly obvious is that at this moment in time the will of the three factions in the fighting is not in favour of reaching a settlement." Later, Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said it would be "unthinkable" for Britain to pull out of Bosnia unilaterally and cause the humanitarian operation to collapse. But he told the BBC TV On The Record programme that it was quite possible, once the spring offensive got under way that "the only thing left to us will be to withdraw". He said: "Mr Major might like to reflect that he is not going to be left out of the opprobrium. Here is a Conservative Prime Minister who devalued the pound, raised tax more than Labour and whose total failure of policy has led to British military withdrawal. "I have always said that if we did not act, and act strongly, then at the end of the day we would have no action to take but to withdraw. Any action we now take is more dangerous and more risky than if we had taken it two years ago."
