In a telephone interview with CHUNGANG ILBO on the early morning of 19 May, Spokesman Meyer said: "The three-member inspection team is communicating normally with the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria." He said the inspection team, which arrived in Pyongyang on 17 May and moved on to Yongbyon by automobile, is regularly reporting to the IAEA headquarters every afternoon about its inspection activities. Asked about whether North Korea had begun the replacement of fuel rods in the five-megawatt reactor in question, he said: "The IAEA's official position is that, until inspections are completed, we would not know which is the truth as Pyongyang asserted that it began the replacement of fuel rods while North Korean officials in Vienna are denying this." He said no comment could be given on the scope and schedule of inspections "according to IAEA regulations."
