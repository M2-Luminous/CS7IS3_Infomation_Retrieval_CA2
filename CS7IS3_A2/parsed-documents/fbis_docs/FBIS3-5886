SDP members voiced concerns about the confusion and expressed their skepticism over the rice policy during informal talks following the day's cabinet meeting, they said. Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Minister Eiijiro Hata, who tried to reassure his colleagues about the rice supply, bore the brunt of the criticism. Hata, stressing that the government has secured supplies to the end of August, said the problem is the consumers' rush to hoard domestic rice. "We will try to halt such rush purchase through the blend sales," ordered by the government, he said. The Food Agency recently ordered rice retailers to sell domestic rice blended with imports to stop the rush to the homegrown crop, triggered by the short supply due to a poor harvest last year. Prices of domestically-produced rice have soared since consumers who have found imported rice not as palatable as they want are trying to stock up domestic rice, while some wholesalers are reportedly restricting their sales to boost prices. Kosuke Uehara, director general of the National Land Agency, said during the informal cabinet talks that the confusion might be a product of sloppy management and mishandling on the part of the government. Uehara reportedly said "serious consideration" should be given to securing a self-sufficient supply of food. Kanju Sato, minister of home affairs, said, "the people have lots of anxiety about the blend sales of rice" mandated by the government. He asked whether such a step violates the Antimonopoly Law. Sato also pointed to the absurdity of the government's long-standing policy of reducing rice cultivation in the face of a declining rice harvest, according to the officials. The SDP opposed opening the rice market up until the last minute before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa decided last year to lift the long-standing ban on rice imports in the course of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, at a news conference following the cabinet meeting, admitted that the government, which is responsible for rice supply, cannot be fully immune to the blame for the rice market turmoil. Takemura pledged to consider a cabinet member meeting over the problems as early as next week. At the Diet, Hirofumi Ueno, Food Agency director general, said there is no effective way to stop rising rice prices on the black market. He told a House of Representatives committee that the most important task is to promote smooth distribution of rice through government-controlled channels. He said an estimated 38 million tons out of the 1993 crop are either consumed by growers or sold in the black market.
