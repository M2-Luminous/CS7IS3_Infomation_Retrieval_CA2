FR940124-0-00008 FR940124-0-00001 In addition, the first sentence of subsection (f) (``Whenever an order is issued under this section, *␣*␣*''), authorizes the award of costs and expenses only in connection with proceedings concerning enforcement actions since W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 (``this section'') pertains only to such actions. Section 525(e) of SMCRA, which applies ``[w]henever an order is issued under this section, or as a result of any administrative proceeding under this Act ,'' (emphasis added), is far more expansive in its coverage. Both the plain language of section 525(e) and pertinent case law (e.g., NRDC and Utah International , supra ) extend the reach of paragraph (e) beyond section 525, which pertains only to administrative review of enforcement actions, to administrative and judicial review proceedings under other sections of SMCRA. Therefore, the Secretary finds that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA to the extent that the State statutory provision does not apply to proceedings under sections of the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act other than W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437. Based on the preceding discussion, the Secretary is not approving the introductory clause of the first sentence of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;37(f) (``Whenever an order is issued under this section,''), or the words ``only'' and ``administrative'' in the second sentence of this subsection (``This subsection shall apply only to administrative contested case proceedings *␣*␣*''). 7. Award of Costs and Expenses: Cap on Fees and Costs [W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(g)] Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 by adding a new subsection (g), which provides that attorney's fees, expert witness fees or other fees or costs shall not exceed $50.00 per hour. To the extent that this provision would apply to awards of costs and expenses under subsection (f) of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437, it is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA, which authorizes the award of all ``reasonably incurred'' costs and expenses. An inflexible cap on hourly rates is not in accordance with SMCRA's reasonable cost standard as interpreted by the courts, which generally use the prevailing community market rate to compute award amounts. See NRDC and Utah International , supra . Therefore, the Secretary is not approving W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(g). 8. Right to Intervene in Administrative Proceedings: Chapter II, Section 7, DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure In findings 22.16 and 22.D (45 FR 20977, March 31, 1980; and 45 FR 78674, November 26, 1980, respectively) concerning Wyoming's original program submittal and subsequent resubmittal, the Secretary determined that the Wyoming rules governing intervention in administrative review proceedings did not afford citizens rights of intervention as broad as those in the Federal regulations at 43 CFR 4.1110. Accordingly, in the approval of the Wyoming program, the Secretary imposed a condition at 30 CFR 950.11(c) requiring the State to correct this deficiency. On August 18, 1982, Wyoming submitted a fully promulgated revised version of Chapter II, Section 7 of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure. The revised version includes a new subsection b. of Section 7 that is substantively identical to 43 CFR 4.1110. Therefore, the Secretary finds that the revised rules satisfy the intervention component of the program condition at 30 CFR 950.11(c), and is approving the submittal and modifying the condition accordingly. 9. DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter VI: Informal Review by Director As submitted on August 18, 1982, this new chapter recognizes the authority of the Director of the DEQ to review and modify decisions of the administrators of the various divisions within the Department, including the Land Quality Division. This arrangement is in accordance with standard managerial principles and is analogous to the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to review and modify decisions of the Director of OSM; therefore, it is not inconsistent with any Federal requirement under SMCRA.
