FR941205-2-00013 FR941205-2-00012 [Docket No. RP91&hyph;47&hyph;013] National Fuel Gas Supply Corp.; Notice of Tariff Filing November 29, 1994. Take notice that on November 23, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, proposed Second Substitute Original Sheet No. 216B and Substitute Original Sheet No. 216C. National states that these tariff sheets are filed in an effort to address the concerns of Algonquin Gas Transmission Company and the Algonquin Customer Group related to the flowthrough of upstream pipeline take-or-pay costs charged to National by its former upstream pipeline suppliers. National states that it is proposing additional revisions to General Terms and Conditions Sections 20.2(f) and (g) to further clarify the refund and true-up provisions under Section 20 of its tariff. These provisions were previously revised by National in its November 10, 1994 filing. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C., 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before December 6, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
