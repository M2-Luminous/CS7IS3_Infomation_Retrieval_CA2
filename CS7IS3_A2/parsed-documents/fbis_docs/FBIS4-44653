Renewed operation of the reactor will constitute part of the effort to get control of the nuclear network. The two main objectives are to carry out research into the use of plutonium and to reduce the amount of long-term radioactive waste produced by reprocessing fuel from nuclear reactors, within the framework of the law on radioactive waste management, dating from 30 December 1991. Moreover, Superphenix will make a key contribution towards defining the reactors of the future, destined to burn a higher proportion of natural uranium, which today is only used in a proportion of 1 percent. The reactor will develop as rapidly as possible towards under-production, so as to limit the amount of plutonium produced. With regard to safety, the government has taken note of the conclusions reached by the safety authority, which concluded that the renewed start-up of Superphenix could be authorized on the following conditions: The work aimed at combatting sodium fires must be concluded in a satisfactory way; the start-up must be gradual, progressing in stages; the production of electricity cannot be a primary goal; and, in view of its prototype status, the operation of the reactor can be suspended [at any time]. Research Program Subject To High-Level Scientific Control A steering committee comprising NERSA [European Rapid Neutron Nuclear Center], EDF [French Electricity Company], and the CEA [Atomic Energy Commission] will have to present a knowledge acquisition program taking account of the new guidelines imposed on Superphenix. At the suggestion of the minister of research, this program will be assessed by two scientists, Mr. Dautray and Mr. Detraz. The implementation of the program will be followed by a special scientific committee. Each year, this scientific committee will submit a report on the experiments conducted in reducing long-term waste to the National Assessment Committee, which was set up under the terms of the law dated 30 December 1991. The experiments will have to be authorized in advance by the Nuclear Installations Safety Directorate. Every six months, the steering committee will report to the ministers responsible for research, industry, and the environment on the planned progress and on potential difficulties foreseen in the implementation of the knowledge acquisition program. EDF will not be authorized to issue any orders concerning the level of power at which Superphenix will operate, thereby allowing maximum leeway for the knowledge acquisition program. Taking account of the new guidelines for Superphenix, which will be listed in the authorizing decree, the government will decide whether to go ahead with the administrative procedure. The actual renewed start-up will only be authorized when the knowledge acquisition program has been approved. A statement on this decision will be made by the ministers of industry, the environment, and research on Wednesday, 23 February, at 1130 [1030 GMT].
