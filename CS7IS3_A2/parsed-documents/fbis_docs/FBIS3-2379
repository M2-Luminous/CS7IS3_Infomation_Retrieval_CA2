Speaking to foreign journalists, Francois Marcel Plaisant said just 1.6 percent of Chinese imports come from France. Increasing that number will be one of the priorities of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur when he visits China next month, the first visit by a French premier since 1978. "One of the main objectives of the French government is to bridge the gap between between the French share in world trade and the French share in the Chinese economy," Plaisant said. After more than a year of cool relations following France's sale to Taiwan of Mirage fighter planes, the two countries signed a normalization agreement in January. France promised not to sell any more offensive weaponry to Taiwan, and China indicated French companies were again welcome to do business. French investment in China came to 250 million francs (45 million dollars) in 1992, as against 100 billion francs worldwide. Still, France extended 12 billion francs (2 billion dollars) worth of preferential credits toward China between 1985 and 1992, second only to Japan.
