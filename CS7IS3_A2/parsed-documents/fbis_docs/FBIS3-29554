According to a National Assembly member from the FUNCINPEC Party, after the vendors at Olympic market protested against the Thai Boon Rong Company for greatly increasing the rent of their shops, not only had Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh failed to settle this problem as demanded by the vendors, but he sided with the puppet Hun Sen and Thai Boon Roong Company against Sam Rangsi, vice chairman of FUNCINPEC, who supported the protestors. Phnom Penh residents know well that this Thai Boon Rong Company has joined hands with the ringleaders of the Vietnamese communist puppets, such as puppets Hun Sen and Chea Sim, in amassing and embezzling the wealth of the Cambodian nation and people worth hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. During the elections organized by the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia], this company financed the Vietnamese communist puppets' Cambodian People's Party [CPP] in competition with FUNCINPEC and other parties. Vendors at Olympic market said that if Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh had the courage to arbitrate, this problem might have been settled. A dried fish vendor said that the Prince Krompreah dared not do anything but side with the Vietnamese puppets and this bloodsucking company because he is so afraid of the puppets Hun Sen and Sar Kheng. As a matter of fact, the prince is afraid of this Thai Boon Rong Company because it bought a personal plane for the prince. A National Assembly member from FUNCINPEC added that Prince Krompreah should not have associated and curried favor with the puppet Hun Sen and the CPP. He should not have associated with Thai Boon Rong Company, which subsidized the puppets in carrying out their election campaigns against FUNCINPEC and in killing many FUNCINPEC members. Prince Krompreah's activity has led him to a conflict with traders, the masses in Phnom Penh, and even with his fellow FUNCINPEC members to the point that he even wanted to drive out FUNCINPEC Vice Chairman Sam Rangsi as finance minister. According to reliable sources in the Finance Ministry in Phnom Penh, in addition to Thai Boon Roong, there have also been problems with the French oil company [name indistinct]. The sources said that Sam Rangsi signed an agreement with this company, but the Vietnamese puppets in the two-headed government refused to recognize Sam Rangsi's signature. This is because they want to deal with only a Vietnamese company [name indistinct] through which they can monopolize the profits for themselves and their CPP. Here, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh also sided with the puppet Hun Sen against Sam Rangsi. Almost all the masses in Phnom Penh, including students, civil servants, and traders in market places, have said that members of the two-headed government do not have any policy nor have they done anything for the interests of the Cambodian nation and people. They only want to serve the Vietnamese communists and foreign companies and to gain profits for themselves and their families. This is why all the problems have not been resolved. Some have said that if they were not protected by the Vietnamese police and the allies, these two-headed government members would have been dead from the outset. [passage omitted]
