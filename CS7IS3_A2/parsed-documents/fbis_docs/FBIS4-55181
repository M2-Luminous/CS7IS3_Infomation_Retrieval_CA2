Manolic, former chief of the Croatian secret police, says in his memoirs, which are being published in installments by the Zagreb paper GLOBUS, that about 63-64,000 Croatian regular troops have taken part in the Moslem-Croat clashes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Tens of thousands of Croatian soldiers have been engaged in the Bosnian civil war since its outbreak in 1992. They have first fought within the allied Bosnian Moslem-Croat forces against the Serbs, but since last spring, they have been fighting with the Bosnian Croats against the Moslems. The United Nations have persistently ignored Serb warnings about Croatia's military engagement in the Bosnian war, but only after the outbreak of the Moslem-Croat territorial clashes last spring did U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali admit there were some 6,000 Croatian Regular Army troops also fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "All those (Croatian) soldiers in Bosnia had to be paid as well as the ammunition and logistics costs. The war with the Bosnian Moslems has cost Croatia at least three million German marks a day, and as the war has lasted for nearly a year, the costs incurred to Zagreb can be estimated at about one billion marks," says Manolic. Acting under pressure from the United States, the Bosnian Moslems and Croats in March signed a ceasefire and agreement on setting up a joint federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would subsequently enter a confederation with neighbouring Croatia. Manolic was among Croatian President Franjo Tudjman's closest associates and a member of the innermost leadership of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). In April Manolic and Stipe Mesic, president of the lower house of parliament, publicly accused Tudjman and the HDZ of dictatorship, embezzlement and meddling in the Bosnian war with a view to creating "a greater Croatia" at the expense of the Bosnian territories. Manolic, Mesic and some other HDZ members have left the HDZ and set up a new party -- Croatia's Independent Democrats (HND).
