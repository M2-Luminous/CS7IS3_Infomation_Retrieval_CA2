Entities opposed to intellectual property rights on pharmaceutical products and biotechnology objected to the text recently approved by the Uruguay Round of GATT talks. GATT's "TRIPS" ("Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights") agreement, which in the next few days will be sent to Congress for ratification, was defended by Ambassador Roberto Abdenur, Foreign Ministry secretary general; by Interfarma, the association representing 39 foreign pharmaceutical laboratories; and by Jose Roberto d'Affonseca Gusmao, president of the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI). Senator Jose Richa (PSDB-PR) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party, Parana], Economic Affairs Committee project coordinator, invited entities interested in the subject to present their objections. He said he wants to improve the version of the bill produced by the Chamber of Deputies, and confessed that the project is causing him more difficulties than any other in his 28 years of public life. Senator Antonio Mariz (PMDB-PB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, Paraiba State], rapporteur for the Constitution and Justice Committee, has not yet submitted his report. According to his advisers, the tendency is to leave the bill's discussion until after the evaluation of the GATT agreement on intellectual property has been approved. Meanwhile, this position is not defended by the government. Guzmao has said that "Brazil needs a law that is independent from the GATT agreement." The national pharmaceutical laboratories, represented by Alanae [expansion unknown] and the Brazilian Association of Refined Chemistry [Abifina], want a 10-year grace period for the law's implementation in accordance with the GATT guarantee. The bill, which was approved in 1993 by the Chamber of Deputies, limits the grace period to one year, which is to begin once the new legislation is approved. Abdenur said that "TRIPS is an unavoidable handicap" and "we cannot give ourselves the luxury of ignoring it." He also stressed that it was the result of an international consensus of 125 countries. Congress cannot amend the GATT treaty; it can only approve or reject it. Nelson Brasil, Abifina president, and Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, president of the Brazilian Trade Association (AEB), supported by other organizations, have indicated that it is not the concession of patents that will bring foreign investment to the country, and that only economic stability can do that. Pratini favors the approval of a law that would contain GATT's ideas, and expressed his concern regarding greater U.S. retaliation, which has cost the paper and pulp industry some $300 million over the past few years. If the United States excludes Brazil from the Generalized System of Preferences [GSP] because of the patent problem, Brazil could lose $75 million, he warned. Pratini has called for the approval by Congress of a new trade defense law. On 23 June he submitted a draft bill in this respect to senators and to the ministers for foreign affairs, industry, commerce and tourism, and finance. Francisco Teixeira, Interfarma's representative, who spoke in the name of the 39 foreign pharmaceutical laboratories that are installed in the country, defended the modifications that had been made in the draft bill, such as: clear and ample protection for biotechnology; patent exploitation for locally manufactures and for imports; compulsory licenses only as an exception (calamities, abuse of economic power); banning of parallel imports; and protection for the products that are not introduced into the Brazilian market ("pipeline"). [preceding word in English] The government has already submitted its suggestions for amendments to rapporteurs Mariz and Richa, who have not yet submitted their opinions to their respective committees. The amendments have taken into account the GATT's TRIPS agreement. The Senate's Economic Affairs Committee has received numerous letters from organizations criticizing the patenting of new sectors such as pharmaceuticals, food, biotechnology, and chemistry.
