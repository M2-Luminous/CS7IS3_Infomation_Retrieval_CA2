Perhaps in a thousand years (the embargo could have some effect). But a few years? That is nothing." -- Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia "1.2 million children are starving in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia." -- Vlada Curguz, chairman of the Commission for Cooperation with UNICEF The balance of the United Nations' two-year sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro is suspended between these two recent statements. The leadership and the policy has not changed, while the price was paid -- generally patiently and voluntarily -- by the population. It is doubtful that the citizens are aware of this, because according to Dragan Popadic, professor of social psychology, "the sanctions affect the tissue of society in the same way radiation does: At first glance nothing seems to be changing and life goes on as usual. Like some irradiated organism, society becomes gravely ill without noticing it due to the still existing facade that things are functioning normally." On the second anniversary of an unheard-of international isolation of a country, the Yugoslavs can conclude that, according to calculations of the Center for Development and Economic Policy of the Federal Ministry for Science and Development, they have lost some $45.117 billion. Zarko Katic, minister of transportation in Serbia, claims that this economic branch alone lost some $10 billion. The social product has been halved. This calculation does not include the other expenses caused by the blocked financial assets and property (20 sea and 43 river vessels, and six aircraft, whose value exceeds $600 million), and the loss of capital caused by the conversion of property into consumption. If the sanctions stay in place until 2011 -- the Center assesses -- the cost of the blockade could mount to $147.334 billion. No one has yet calculated what will happen after a thousand years. Infant mortality has climbed to 21.7 percent in 1992, while mortality among diabetics has doubled. Every other child in Belgrade is anemic; out of every 100 children hospitalized in 1989, 1.45 died, while last year this number climbed to 2.07. In the first year of the embargo, mortality among old people increased from 501 percent in comparison to the distant 1986. The number of murders in the same period rose by 49 percent, and suicides by 22.8 percent. With an unemployment rate of 40 percent among the able, working population, Yugoslavia tops the international charts. [passage omitted]
