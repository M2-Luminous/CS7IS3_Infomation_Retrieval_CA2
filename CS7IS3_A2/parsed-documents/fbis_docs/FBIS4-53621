MAFF intends to work out the reform package in July, a year earlier than its initial plan. The reform package includes the following measures: 1) The compulsive allotment of rice production cuts should be discontinued so that farmers can choose between free business and farm subsidies; 2) "black market rice" should be legalized by allowing direct deals from farmers to wholesalers; and 3) an additional rice reserve quota should be provided to prepare for serious rice shortages. In view of public criticism of the food control policy, the government is going to "relax' its control over the rice market for the first time in the last half century. A MAFF source said the reform package includes an "alternative rice-paddy reduction policy." Under the policy, MAFF intends to discontinue its rice production cut policy imposed on all rice farmers at the wholesale level, and to allow the farmers' own discretion on whether or not they cut their production. The government will keep offering subsidies and guarantee the minimum price of products to those who agree on rice production cuts. However, those who pick free production will have to deal with the free market at their own risk. The government hopes most farmers follow its rice production cut policy. When the new policy is implemented, free-production farmers will have no duty to sell their products to the government. This means free production comes with free distribution. Upon the abolition of governmental control over the entire rice market, the free rice market would not be called a black market anymore. Regarding the rice reserve policy, MAFF will provide a new rice reserve quota called the special reserve, which amounts to several hundred thousand tons, in addition to the ordinary rice stock of over a million tons. The special rice reserve is intended for emergencies, livestock feed, and food aid to developing countries. Funds for the special rice reserve is expected to be raised with profits from the distribution of foreign-grown rice imported according to the minimum access accord. The government will continue to compile annual rice supply plans even after the food control policy's revision, aiming at stabilization of the Japanese rice market's demand-supply balance. However, MAFF intends to characterize the rice supply plans just as guidelines for farmers and distributors, and let them submit detailed production and sales plans annually to maintain indirect control over the market. MAFF plans to announce such directions of the rice policy reform in July. The reform measures will be finalized in view of deliberations of the (prime minister's advisory) Agricultural Policy Commission now in session, and, within the summer, MAFF will start compiling a revision of the Food Control Law. Some of the reform measures are expected to take effect in fiscal 1995. In the initial plan, MAFF defined reform of the food control policy as a long-term subject. However, its rigid rice policies are being criticized from various quarters. MAFF decided to work out the reform plan this coming summer since "we have to swiftly prepare tangible reform measures and implement it as soon as possible" (as noted by a senior MAFF official).
