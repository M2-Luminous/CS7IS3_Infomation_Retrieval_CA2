As follows from the appeal, on 10 January Vladimir Klebanov was detained by officers of the 58th militia precinct in the apartment where he lived (which also houses the Central Committee of Free Trade Unions headquarters) for violating the capital city mayor's directive on visa regulations: Klebanov did not have a residence permit. According to eyewitness Tatyana Sevryukova, the arrest was conducted rudely. Vladimir Klebanov was yelled at and not permitted to use the telephone; after being brought to the precinct he was put in a preliminary detention cell along with criminals. Tatyana Sevryukova also reported that currently Vladimir Klebanov is not in possession of his passport, since back in August officers of the same precinct confiscated this document for living in the city without a residence permit and still have not returned it. Therefore the trade union leader, much as he would not want to, could not avoid violating the visa regulations. Nikolay Klimov, passport desk chief at the 58th militia precinct, confirmed that the trade union leader "was kept for some time in the preliminary detention cell," from where he was sent to the city reception center. "I do not know what happened to him after that," said Mr. Klimov. As it turned out, the staff at the reception center also remembers Vladimir Klebanov. "The point is that Mr. Klebanov, member of the Constitutional Conference and chairman of the Central Committee of Free Trade Unions, does not have a job, is not engaged in socially useful activities, does not have a passport in his possession, and therefore is no different from any vagrant. And since he was not born in Russia, the decision was made to expel him from the country," said a ranking staff member at the reception center. True, in the process, in his words, "the expulsion instruction was not carried out exactly." Instead of delivering Mr. Klebanov to Belarus, where he was born (although he does not have either citizenship or a residence permit there), he was sent to Ukraine. Whether he was actually delivered there, the reception center staff does not know. According to Free Trade Unions, however, Vladimir Klebanov "escaped his escort during deportation." According to the statement of Eduard Baykov, member of the Central Committee of Free Trade Unions, Vladimir Klebanov, a noted human rights activist and former prisoner of the Soviet GULAG, experienced in underground work, was able to outwit his escort and once again set himself free. The trade union leader is currently living covertly in Moscow. It is not safe for him, however. At any time there may be another attempt to grab Vladimir Klebanov and try to deport him again. In this connection a number of Russian trade unions issued an official statement that Vladimir Klebanov is a noted human rights activist of the "stagnation" era and the organizer of the first free and completely independent trade union structures in the USSR, for which he was persecuted at the time. He has now been completely exonerated. Persecution, however, continues, as we can all see. This fact, the statement emphasizes, is not only alarming but also an outrage. Especially considering that the recently adopted Constitution proclaims broader than ever human rights. Russian trade unions demand that Vladimir Klebanov be granted "the legitimate right to carry out his public duties." Trade union leaders expect the mayoralty and the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs to conduct a principled appraisal of the incident. And at the same time guarantee to Mr. Klebanov, who has been elected to his position by members of Free Trade Unions, complete safety from a repetition of such arbitrariness and finally resolve the issue of his residence permit.
