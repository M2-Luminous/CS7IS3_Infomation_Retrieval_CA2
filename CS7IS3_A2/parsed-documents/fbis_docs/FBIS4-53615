MITI will set up an investigation committee within the ministry, and at the request of the domestic textile industry, the committee will investigate textile trade to judge whether the domestic textile industry is seriously damaged and hold bilateral negotiations with a trade partner. After the negotiations, it will decide on whether it will restrict textile imports. European nations and the United States have safeguard measures under which they can unilaterally restrict imports of textile products if it exceeds certain volume. In contrast, MITI's procedure places more emphasis on bilateral negotiations rather than automatically and unilaterally taking safeguard measures. Underlying this policy is that Japan hopes to maintain good political relations with Asian nations, which are major textile exporters to Japan. The committee, which will be jointly led by chiefs of MITI's International Trade Policy Bureau and Consumer Goods Industries Bureau, will conduct investigations to determine if it is necessary to invoke its import control procedures. The committee will release its investigation results after hearing opinions from the Export-Import Transaction Council as well as from consumers and the distribution industry. After the investigation report's release, the committee will launch negotiations with a trade partner. Such a procedure will be Japan's own safeguard based on the GATT Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA). Although Japan's procedure meets international rules, it is unprecedented for Japan, who has become the world's second-largest economic superpower owing to the free trade system, to establish a protectionist procedure. However, since the import restriction does not suit Japan's principle of maintaining the free trade system, MITI plans to give priority to taking other measures such as antidumping measures if applicable.
