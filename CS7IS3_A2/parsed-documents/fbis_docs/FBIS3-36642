The Results of the 16th Round of Russian-Estonian Talks Are Very Modest, If Not...."] [Text] Talks between Russian and Estonian state delegations were held in the Moscow region 1-2 February. As Vasiliy Svirin, head of the Russian delegation, stressed, the Russian delegation went to the talks with the intention of working for tangible progress but these hopes were only partly realized. The fruitful first day of the talks was completely nullified by the deadlock on day two. Vasiliy Svirin noted that significant progress was achieved in the preparation of the main treaty on the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Estonia and the terms of their temporary presence on the republic's territory. There is every reason to believe that it will be initialed by the two states' delegations in the near future. The agreement on the social protection of Russian military pensioners and members of their families was examined in conjunction with the treaty on the troop withdrawal. It was a cause of great disappointment that the Estonian delegation adopted a tough and intransigent stance here which made it impossible to achieve even minor positive results. Estonia is demanding that military pensioners who retired after 20 December 1991 leave the republic, regardless of whether they have apartments or not. Taken together with members of their families, that amounts to 44,000 people. Those who were discharged earlier have the right only to apply for a residence permit [vid na zhitelstvo]. However, according to the Estonian Republic Government's decree dated 1 December 1992, this application must be accompanied by the fulfillment of a number of demeaning requirements. The lack of an accord on the Agreement on the Social Protection of Military Pensioners was the reason for the refusal to transfer to the Estonian side the timetable for the Russian troop withdrawal which has already been prepared. The discussion of the problem of citizenship may also be counted among the failures of the latest round of talks. A long time ago the Russian delegation prepared a draft treaty which proposes that Russians living in Estonia and Estonians living in Russia be afforded the opportunity to acquire Russian or Estonian citizenship. But the Estonian delegation again avoided concrete work on this document. The Russian and Estonian delegations also discussed a broad range of border questions. The Estonian delegation blocked all discussion of the question of the land border and is refusing proposals on its demarcation. This is due to the fact that Estonia is continuing its attempts to make territorial claims on Russia. In the words of the Russian diplomat, these claims are futile. Furthermore, Vasiliy Svirin added, if Estonia does not react in the future to proposals to carry out the demarcation of the border Russia will be forced to do that unilaterally.
