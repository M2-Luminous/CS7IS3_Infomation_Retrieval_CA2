Some of these accusations may be made with good intentions, but most of the time they are made with bad intentions. Over the past 70 years, we have heard here and there descriptions of Jordan's role, the tasks it was entrusted to carry out when it was established, and how its role is threatened. We have been listening to analyses that some believe are convincing and with which they themselves are convinced. Brothers and sisters, Jordan has always replied to all this and more with its achievements and the pursuance of its course, believing that homelands are not shaken by injustices and that their marches are not affected by doubts and skepticism. Here we are pursuing the march of good that was started by the great Jordanian Arab people early in this century, united, and in response to the program of the late founder grandfather -- may God's mercy be upon him -- confident in the soundness of our beliefs, and believing in the role we have to play. We have not changed and we will not alter our stand. We have adopted a centrist stand in economy and politics and we thank God that the memory of the Arab citizen records and remembers. It remembers that Jordan is committed to what it believes, and knows that the means it uses are in line with the results. Jordan has never made any secret step, and has proven to all those who watch it that it is the homeland that continues to abide by what is right and which continues to respond to the nation's aspirations. The leader of this homeland, the head of the Al-Hashim family, King Husayn, has raised over the past few years a slogan embodying the revival of unity among us, the slogan of descents and origins. He has also raised the following slogan: Those who tamper with national unity are my foes until the day of reckoning. Brothers, some whisper or explicitly say that Jordan is for the Jordanians. Some prepare studies from time to time about statistics on who is Jordanian and who is not, and who is from a non-Jordanian origin. I find in your conference an opportunity to sincerely clarify this point to you, and to ask: Actually, who is a Jordanian? Does Jordan, in the geographic sense of the word, extend only from al-Ramthah at al-'Aqabah? Is raising the fabricated contradiction between the Jordanian in the east and the Palestinian in the west as innocent as it appears and without ulterior motives? Is there a feeling of dual citizenship that the state has not succeeded in tackling? [passage omitted] Brothers and sisters, we are a sovereign homeland that seeks to attain its interests without fear. We deal with developments frankly and sincerely. We inform all the citizens of what takes place around us. We participated in the peace conference with a popular consensus that was achieved through the national congress. We act with the interest of our country and nation at heart without hesitation, and by scientifically studying every step we make. We do not disparage our national capabilities but work to enhance them. We also do not try to assume more than we can. Homelands are not forged with adventures and slogans. [applause] Brothers, this is a homeland that is realistic and one that can do all that is needed to further enhance its status. [passage omitted]
