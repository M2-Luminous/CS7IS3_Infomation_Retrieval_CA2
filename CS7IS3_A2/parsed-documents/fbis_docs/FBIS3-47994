This was decided at an anti-espionage operations meeting led by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Yi Yang-ho at the Defense Ministry on Friday. Attending were representatives of the Defense and Home Ministries, the Agency for National Security Planning and related government agencies. North Korea has designated 1995 the first year of its unification struggle, and has increased propaganda and agitation campaigns for its armed forces and people to prepare for war, Yi told the meeting. "In the coming year, in particular, North Korea is expected to continue its nuclear development program for the maintenance of the socialist system, increase its war preparedness and step up its effort to create a revolutionary climate in South Korea under a strategy to unify the Korean peninsula under communism," he said. A loose sense of national security is seen in some quarters of society where the possibility of North Korea provoking another war is regarded as an unfounded fear, he said. He then stressed the need for the people, the government and the military to strengthen the total defense system and increase the preparedness for immediate response to provocations by North Korea.
