Latest counts indicate that the Communists and Socialists have won eight and two seats respectively with 19 other mandates going to independent candidates, officials of the district election commissions told INTERFAX-Ukraine. However, a fresh election is to be held in the four remaining districts where none of the candidates has managed to get 50 percent of the vote needed to qualify. By now 78 candidates have gained mandates to the new parliament, 20 of them Communists, four Socialists and two of the Peasants Party. This brings to 26 the number of left-wing candidates who have won seats to the country's new legislature compared with about 15 seats won by members of the nationalist groups. Other winners claim to be independent. A new round of voting to the country's 450-seat parliament will be held in the remaining 368 districts on Saturday and Sunday.
