The car plant has a day-off due to the absence of spares. A rally of participants in a political strike began at 11 A.M. Today [0800 GMT] on Minsk Nezavisimost Square to attract 4,000 local residents, much less than it was expected. People's deputies, representatives of parties, movements and labor collectives demanded resignation of the current authorities, creation of a coalition government and early parliament elections. Speakers of the one-hour-long rally, including representatives of the Minsk tractor plant and Soligorsk miners, criticized the government and the parliament for economic crisis, corruption of high places and low wages and salaries. An average plant salary is enough to buy several kilos of sausages. Then the rally participants moved from the government building to the Supreme Soviet to hand over their demands to parliament leaders. A proposal on universal elections of the Belarussian president will be put forward at a parliament session to begin in a week, parliament speaker Mechyslaw Hryb told a meeting with representatives of the strikers. If the parliament supports the proposal the elections can be held in late May-June. It will also be necessary to adopt a new Belarusian constitution, as the current fundamental law does not provide for presidency. The Belarusian leader said he is ready to initiate a republican referendum on presidential rule. A meeting of the Supreme Soviet Presidium will consider demands of the strikers on Thursday. "If these demands are an ultimatum, I do not accept ultimatums," said Hryb.
