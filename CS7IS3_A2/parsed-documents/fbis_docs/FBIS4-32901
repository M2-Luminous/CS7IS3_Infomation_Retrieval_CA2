It is, as we all know, the election of the person who will govern Colombia during the next four years. The person to whom I will surrender power on 7 August will receive a mandate from his fellow citizens, a mandate -- like the one I received when I assumed the office of president in 1990 -- that obliges and commits him during his administration to seek the welfare of his fellow citizens and a better future for Colombia. That is why today, I want to devote a few minutes to speak to you about what I consider our duty to be next Sunday for Colombia, our children, and our children's children. The first thing I must say to each of you, to every Colombian who is listening, is that we must vote. We must vote with conviction, thinking about the nation's future. We must vote freely, thinking of our families' future. We must vote with solidarity, thinking of the needy in Colombia. We must vote with decision, thinking of the country's peace. But above all else, we must be clear that that vote, that simple action of getting up early in the morning and walking to the polling station, studying the ballot, and choosing each one's preferred candidate, will influence what happens to each resident of this country beginning on 7 August. To not vote, in turn, leaves in the hands of those who vote our personal future, that of our children, our parents and brothers, and our dearly beloved fatherland, which has progressed so much, but which faces so many challenges now and in the future. Therefore, I invite you to exercise this right, which is also a duty of every good citizen. By voting, we help build the future of Colombia. This nation has a strong democratic tradition, which today is applauded and recognized by the entire international community. There is no doubt Colombians have advanced a lot regarding citizens' participation and collective affairs of life. And there is no doubt our electoral organization is one of the most responsible and efficient in Latin America. This democratic tradition will be strengthened if we all vote, and above all, if we all support the National Civil Registry and respect the rules, some of which I will stress today categorically. First, as has been reported, all forms of propaganda have been banned on the day of the elections. That is, in this election, as happens today in most civilized nations, no political propaganda will be allowed, neither moving, nor still, nor audio propaganda. In other words, wearing propaganda t-shirts, using loudspeakers, or putting up posters or billboards about the elections or candidates will not be permitted. Second, this process requires that the media act responsibly and that they respect the legal provisions. The government will not hesitate -- hear me right -- the government will not hesitate to punish exemplarily radio stations or television concessionaires who break the rules. The media cannot broadcast interviews with political-electoral intentions, propaganda, opinion shows, news conferences on election day. They can only provide information on electoral results from electoral officials at polling stations, the National Civil Registry, and its branches. When reporting on partial information, the media must inform the official electoral source. And the media will not be able, under the risk of facing penalties that may lead to the cancellation of the license and concession, to divulge projections or polls on electoral results. Finally, regarding public order, the media will only be able to report information confirmed by official sources. What is more important for news neutrality is that the media will not be allowed to reproduce results issued by international news agencies abroad or the projections made by them on the vote because it would adversely affect the provisions of neutrality. Third, this process requires the absolute impartiality of public employees. Yesterday, the prosecutor general warned government officials about the severe sanctions the Prosecutor General's Office will impose on those who violate the legal norms on impartiality or use in some way public property in favor of any candidate. Presidential delegates, whose mission is to observe the normal development of the elections throughout the entire national territory have been sent to all departments of Colombia. Believe me, the government will persecute and punish those who do not observe the legal norms. Fellow countrymen, allow me one final observation on the elections. We must vote to give a signal to the enemies of peace in Colombia, the violent ones, those who have missed the train of history because they have not had the courage to leave behind their cowardly rifles, attacks, kidnappings, extortions, and their obsolete rhetoric. This message must be heard by them. It must say that the Colombian people demand peace and demand attitudes of peace. It must say, above all, that the people of Colombia support the good things, teamwork, and that they support our future. A copy of an old newspaper, which was in the hands of our ancestors in 1884, some 100 years ago, quotes a phrase mentioned by Simon Bolivar which I believe summarizes what we must all seek on Sunday when we go out to exercise our right to elect a president. Bolivar said: I would trade all my dictates and titles, even that of liberator, for that of a good citizen. If all 30 million Colombians are good citizens, like Bolivar said, if we are good citizens, we will undoubtedly elect a president, who will always seek a more just, equitable, prosperous, and peaceful fatherland for our good and for the welfare of the new generations of Colombians. Good night and thank you very much.
