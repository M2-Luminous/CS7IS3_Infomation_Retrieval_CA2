Japan has expressed support in principle for Washington's draft resolution to be submitted to the UN Security Council in response to North Korea's refusal to permit unhampered inspection of its nuclear facilities. Aoyama Trading Co., a retailer of low-priced men's clothing, imports suits, blazers and other clothing from North Korea for exclusive marketing through its outlets nationwide, taking advantage of low labor costs in that country. Japan also imports mushrooms, crabs, shellfish and other food items from North Korea. Customs-cleared imports of men's clothing from North Korea last year totaled about 9 billion yen, one-third of total Japanese imports from that country. Mushroom imports from North Korea last year, meanwhile, totaled 2.2 billion yen. But an official of a major Japanese trading company, who asked to remain anonymous, said the sanctions would have only minimal effects on Japan's global trade. Japan-North Korea trade last year totaled 52.1 billion yen, only 0.1 percent of total Japanese trade.
