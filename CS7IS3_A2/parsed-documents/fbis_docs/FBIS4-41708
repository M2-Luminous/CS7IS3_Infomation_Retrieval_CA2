He thought that the Russian Far East could solve its problems without federal subsidies. Rybkin currently heads a group of parliamentarians touring Siberia and the Far East. Asked about the proposal, made by Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian parliament, that elections to the the Federal Assembly be put off, Rybkin emphasized that parliament had to earn this honor and that two-thirds of the country's regions and republics had to endorse this step. He admitted that people were obviously tired of elections but said that the logic of life as well as the Constitution were against this step.
