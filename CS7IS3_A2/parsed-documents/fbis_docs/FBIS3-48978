Idesbald van Biesebroeck, a spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), said the truce, signed on December 23 and set to last though January 15, was "non-existent." "The last two days have been very quiet in the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina, except Sarajevo, Mostar and Bihac," he said. In Sarajevo "the situation remains unstable," he said, although there was little or no fighting Monday morning. Heavy arms fire could be heard at the end of the morning from the north of the city, and small arms fire downtown. He said UN observers had counted more than 300 shells fired by Sarajevo's Bosnian Serb besiegers Sunday, countered by some 30 Bosnian army shells in return. In one incident, a Norwegian C-130 Hercules military transport aircraft was hit by small arms fire Sunday as it prepared to land in Sarajevo, UN High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Ray Wilkinson said Monday. The plane was only slightly damaged and the airport remained open. In the past similar incidents have led to the suspension of aid flights into the Bosnian capital. Eighty percent of the shelling targeted military areas north of Sarajevo, including Vogosca, Zuc, and Rajlovac, he said, but added that shells had landed on residential areas, killing one person and injuring seven. In central Bosnia the situation was mostly calm, except for the regions of Busovaca and Dubravica, south of Zenica, 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Sarajevo, Wilkinson said. The region was the scene of violent mortar and small arms clashes between the Moslem-led Bosnian Army and Bosnian Croat (HVO) forces Sunday, he added. In the southern city of Mostar, where HVO forces have been besieging the Moslem section of town, "the level of military activity lowered," van Biesebroeck said. But shooting continued, with the Bosnian Croats firing some 20 mortar shells into the Moslem eastern sector of the city on Sunday. Fighting had intensified in the northwestern separatist Bihac enclave between forces loyal to rebel leader Fikret Abdic and the Bosnian Government forces, with clashes particularly fierce north of the town of Cazin, he said.
