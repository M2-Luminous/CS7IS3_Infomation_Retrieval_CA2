We have invited the responsible persons of the People's Bank of China to answer your questions on reform and development in China's banking system. Attending today's news conference are Zhou Zhengqing, Dai Xianglong, and Chen Yuan, vice governors of the People's Bank of China. [Zhou] Today, I and my colleagues are ready to exchange views with you on issues of interest to you and to answer your questions. [Unidenified correspondent] I am a reporter from JINGJI RIBAO. Governor Zhou [as heard], what do you think of the results of rectifying the financial order and of actual difficulties currently faced by enterprises? [Zhou] As you know, China's economy began to enter a new stage of rapid development in 1992. China's economy grew by about 13 percent for two consecutive years, and new progress has been made by all sectors of the national economy. Of course, some new situations and new problems have cropped up in the course of rapid growth. The main problems are as follows: investment in fixed assets increased excessively. Moreover, the investment structure in this area was irrational. In monetary matters, an excessive amount of currency was put into circulation. Moreover, irregularities such as indiscriminate fund-raising activities and inter-bank lending emerged. As a result, the financial order was plagued by chaos. To deal with these situations and new problems which emerged in the course of economic operations, the party Central Committee and the State Council promptly adopted a measure to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control by stressing the method of deepening reform and of using economic and legal means to rectify the financial order. The chaotic situation in the financial order was quickly reversed. The main indications in the reversal of the situation are: 1. Excessive issuance of currency was effectively checked. The amount of residents' savings deposits rebounded quickly and increased considerably. Last year urban and rual savings deposits rose by 320 billion yuan; 2. We have done well in exercising macroeconomic regulation and control. We regulated the structure and use of loans to ensure that there was capital for key projects of the national economy. As you know, last year there was an ample supply of funds for the purchasing of farm and sideline products, and the practice of writing IOU's disappeared. Ninety-nine percent of the state key projects were ensured of funds. The situation in which large and medium enterprises, including those involved in foreign trade, were short of working funds was alleviated; 3. The exchange rate remained stable. The rate between the U.S. dollar and renminbi remained at 8.7 renminbi to the dollar. 4. Irregularities such as indiscriminate fund-raising activities and inter-bank lending were effectively checked. At the same time, various measures for banking reform have been introduced gradually, and have been implemented very well. [Unidentified correspondent from DPA in English, fading into Mandarin translation] I am a correspondent from Germany. Since China unified the exchange rates, some units have raised their charges by 50 percent. For example, some telephone companies have done so, and the service bureaus for diplomats usually charge in U.S. dollars instead of renminbi. I wonder whether the officials also justify this. There are now two sets of prices in China: one for the Chinese and the other for foreigners. This is obviously against the circular issued by the central bank. My question is: Whether the People's Bank of China has taken some measures to check the practice of two prices? [Chen] We maintain that the unification of exchange rates has not caused price fluctuations in general, but the problem of price hikes did emerge following the unification of exchange rates. Government departments concerned are investigating this problem to ascertain the situation and will launch necessary checks and rectification. Although this problem relates to the reform of exchange rates, it is not completely the Central Bank's responsibility. We have also received some complaints about this problem from foreign banks and organs and have addressed their opinions to department concerned. I hope this problem will be settled properly while reform proceeds further. [Unidentified Correspondent] I am a correspondent from JINRONG SHIBAO [FINANCIAL TIMES]. A package of measures for economic reform were presented successively from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, and banking reform is the most important among them. Vice Governor Zhou, could you elaborate on the focal points of this year's banking reform and tell us what kinds of difficulties may be encountered in the course of implementing the reform? Thank you. [Zhou] The goals for this year's banking reform can be generally summed up as establishing three systems and accomplishing two tasks in real earnest. The establishment of three systems means: 1. Establish a powerful and effective macroeconomic regulation and control system governed by the central bank; 2. Establish an organizational system with state-owned commercial banks as the mainstay, whereas various kinds of banking institutions are also included; 3. Establish a banking market system that is unified and open, allows orderly competition, and is strictly administered. Accomplishing two tasks in real earnest means constructing the People's Bank of China into a genuine central bank and constructing the existing state-owned specialized banks into genuine commercial banks. This is certainly the goal of our reform. To attain this goal, we should advance step by step and pay attention to three issues in the course of proceeding reform: 1. In the course of shifting from the old mechanism to the new one, it is necessary to control aggregate credit and forestall the cropping up of serious inflation. Aggregate credit must be controlled. 3. [as heard] Banking reform must closely keep pace with the drafting of banking laws and regulations and be carried out in an orderly manner. I would like to disclose some information to you: We are now working hard to draft and, by going through legal procedures, strive for the passage of the central bank law, commercial bank law, securities law, law on negotiable instruments, insurance law, and a series of banking laws and regulations in the second half of this year. [Unidentified correspondent] Vice Governor Zhou, I am a Hong Kong correspondent. A great quantity of Hong Kong currency is circulated in the Zhujiang Delta, particularly in Shenzhen and Zhuhai. It has been learned that the People's Bank is going to end situation -- to make the Hong Kong currency flow back to Hong Kong. Does the People's Bank have any measures in this regard now? [Zhou] China has been asserting and reiterating its demand in the reform of the foreign exchange system that foreign currencies may not be used in quoting prices, settling accounts, and may not be circulated in Chinese territory. In handling some specific problems in localities which have frequent contacts with Hong Kong and Macao areas, such as the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, we will take Hong Kong's and Macao's economic development into consideration and take some specific measures to resolve the problems. Hong Kong's financial management authorities have addressed the situation to the People's Bank of China. We have been informed. [Unidentified CCTV Correspondent] I am a reporter from the Central Television Station. A few minutes ago, Vice Governor Zhou said one of the important aspects of the reform of the banking system in China is turning existing specialized banks into state-owned commercial banks. May I ask how do you transform specialized banks into commercial ones? Can you tell us some specific methods? [Zhou] In establishing state-owned commercial banks, first it is necessary to separate the policy-lending functions belonging to state-owned specialized banks. We plan to establish three policy-lending banks to undertake the task of granting loans allowed by policies. Once the policy-lending functions are separated from specialized banks, they should operate step by step in line with the principles commonly practiced by commercial banks around the world and organize their loans and assets in acccordance with the principles of fluidity, effectiveness, and safety. Beginning this year, the Central Bank has distributed relevant regulations and procedures regarding management of the proportions of assets and liabilities and management of risks in commercial banks. Now, the commercial banks should act upon these requirements. First of all, they should start by transforming their operating mechanisms and gradually standardize their activities and improve their management in accordance with the requirement on the management of the proprotions of assets and liabilities and the requirement of the risk responsibility system. However, to achieve the goal of becoming commercial banks, we should proceed step by step. Success cannot come overnight. [JOURNAL OF COMMERCE correspondent in English, fading into Mandarin translation] I am a reporter from the JOURNAL OF COMMERCE. Last year, you said China carried out macroeconomic regulation and control. Is it necessary to further inject money into these state-owned enterprises? And if money is injected, will this lead to the aggravation of inflation? [Dai] The Central Bank has been pursuing a steady and stable monetary policy for years. It has neither adopted a strict policy to limit the growth of the money supply nor has it adopted an easy money policy to ensure steady economic growth. In July and August last year, we adopted a correct policy to appropriately increase loans to large and medium-sized enterprises to undertake the construction of key state projects. As a result, the economy grew steadily. In January this year, we succeeded very well in recovering Central Bank loans. As of now, nearly 90 percent of the currency issued by the Central Bank from 1 January to the Spring Festival has been recovered. We expect all can be recovered by the end of March. [XINHUA correspondent] I am a reporter from XINHUA NEWS AGENCY. Governor Zhou, what specific measures has the People's Bank taken to control inflation this year? [Zhou] An important function of the Central Bank is to stabilize the value of the renminbi. Therefore, we are paying special attention to the current inflationary pressure. To preserve the value of the renminbi, I think, it is -- speaking of the overall economic situation as a whole -- necessary to strictly control the scale of investment in fixed assets. At the same time, it is imperative to adhere to the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation of the economy and to ensure a steady growth in the output of grain, cotton, oil- and sugar-bearing crops, meat, and vegetables so as to develop all sectors of the rural economy. At the same time, it is also necessary to achieve a basic balance between total supply and total demand. To ensure that the value of the renminbi remains stable, we will adopt four measures: First, we will strictly control total credit in society, especially controlling the increase in the total amount of loans for use in fixed asset investment; no one is allowed to exceed the ceiling prescribed by regulations. Second, it is necessary to control the increase of the money supply and to make vigorous efforts to recover currency from circulation. Third, beginning this year, the Central Bank will no longer grant loans to enterprises or institutions with financial deficits. Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen monetary supervision and management to prevent the recurrence of the financial chaos in the first half of last year in which indiscriminate fund-raising activities and inter-bank lending were rampant. I am convinced so long as the Central Bank seriously carries out these four measures, the value of the renminbi will remain stable. [Moderator] The news conference concludes here. Thanks to all.
