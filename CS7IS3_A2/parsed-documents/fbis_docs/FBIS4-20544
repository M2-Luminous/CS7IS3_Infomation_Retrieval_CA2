With 2 weeks to go before a decisive meeting with the European commission, Jean-Marie Descarpentries has decided to break his silence. On 1 March, Bull's new CEO is supposed to explain the recovery measures he envisages and convince European Commissioners who are both irritated and of course skeptical. At stake is an 8.6 billion [French] franc [Fr] recapitalization, decided last fall by the authorities, which touched a raw nerve in Brussels. Patently less than convinced by Paris's pledge that this would be the "very last" capital infusion, the Commission, which has been waiting for Bull's strategic plan since last July, has put a freeze on the second capital tranche, which would supplement the initial Fr4.5 billion released in December 1993. At this point, a public relations campaign would seem imperative for Bull. Since mere protestations of good faith would be unavailing, Mr. Descarpentries went straight to the point in what was his first official meeting with the press since 17 February, when he was named for the job: Bull's privatization is to be launched sometime this year, he said. The head of the state-owned computer group also has a fairly clear idea who the group's shareholders will be 2 years down the road: Employees will own as much as 20 percent; three industrial ("and preferably financial") partners with prior experience in cooperative ventures with Bull will each own 15 percent; the state--"a fabulous shareholder," notes Mr. Descarpentries--will keep as much as a 15 percent interest; and the rest will go on the open market. Privatization would have to be implemented in several phases. For Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the entry of industrial partners is especially opportune because it will be accompanied by a capital infusion, to be effected once the enterprise's balance sheet is rectified. Nevertheless, in the next few months, and as an earnest of its good faith vis-a-vis Brussels, "up to 10 percent of the group's stock" will be made available to employees, and "between 10 and 20 percent" to the first industrial partner. Bull's CEO broadly hinted that Japan's NEC, a longtime partner of Bull--and one that closely followed the state-owned group's recapitalization last fall--strikes him as a solid candidate. He also wants France Telecom, which already owns a 17 percent share in the state-owned computer group, to keep its place at the table. According to Mr. Descarpentries, it is time for the two enterprises, which in the past have had an "almost neurotic" relationship, to turn over a new leaf. "There are many joint projects for us to develop." The third candidate might be Hewlett Packard (United States), with which Bull says it is already discussing various industrial plans. But IBM, which signed a financial and industrial partnership accord with Bull over 2 years ago, is clearly being pushed out of the picture. In private, Mr. Descarpentries is rather harshly critical of that partnership. Also, the Bull CEO mentioned a possible merger of Zenith Data Systems and Packard Bell, with stock in the new entity to be listed on the Paris Exchange.
