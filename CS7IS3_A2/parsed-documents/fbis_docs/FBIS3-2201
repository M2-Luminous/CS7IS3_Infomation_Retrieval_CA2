Currently Beijing's foreign construction market is confined mostly in southeast Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Last year, Beijing signed contracts for 530 million U.S. dollars-worth of construction projects. With a total of 3,200 people abroad, the city completed a business volume of 160 million U.S. dollars. These include construction of a residence area in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, of a flyover in Sri Lanka and of a 180-km highway in India. Wan said that he is hopeful to snatch a sizeable share in the construction market of those more advanced countries as Beijing has the country's best professionals in architecture and construction.
