He does not expect taxes on stock market transactions to result in substantial revenue for the state budget. He is not sure whether it will be possible to lower income tax rates in 1995. Today, Sejm deputies will make a decision on whether Deputy Prime Minister/Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko is to present in the Sejm a governmental economic program for the years 1994-97 called "Strategy for Poland." Last night, opposition representatives in the Sejm Leadership [Konwent Seniorow] spoke out against a suggestion coming from the Sejm speaker for the program to be presented without a parliamentary debate on it. The governing coalition wanted to postpone the debate by two weeks, meaning until after the self-governmental elections. Kolodko announced his Sejm speech a few hours earlier, during a meeting with some economists in Warsaw. 10 Main Points According to Kolodko, the main feature of "Strategy" is an "extension of the economic time frame." The program includes 10 main theses, followed by 10 main programs [programy wezlowe] that elaborate on the theses. Kolodko regards the need to lower the social cost of the reforms as one of the more important issues. This will require concentrating, among other things, on achieving rapid economic growth. Other important issues include: negotiation principles of the distribution of the results of labor, improvement in living conditions, reforms of the center, and increasing the Polish economy's competitiveness. Important Figures Each main program contains criteria of execution. "Strategy" envisages achieving 22-percent growth of the GDP over four years. "This means that the GDP will increase by $365 per resident, reaching the level of $3,500 in 1997," Kolodko said. Over the same time period, consumption will rise by 16 percent and investments by about 32 percent. Unemployment is to go down from 16 to 14 percent. In 1997, inflation should not exceed 10 percent. Economists' Doubts According to the economists taking part in the meeting, it will be hard to achieve the goals set forth in "Strategy." A few of them pointed to the need to conduct a restructuring of state-owned enterprises soon. Professor Pawel Glikman said that, in Poland, capital intensity of production in state-owned industry is four times that of privately owned industry and that, when it comes to the construction industry, it is even seven times higher. Professor Urszula Plowiec warned that Polish enterprises may not meet the challenge of foreign competition once customs duties are decreased by 20 percent next year. The possibility of lowering the unemployment rate was subject to particular skepticism during the meeting. That is because restructuring and increasing the competitiveness of Polish enterprises will require employment cuts. A majority of economists are also leaning toward the view that measures aimed at lowering inflation result in increased unemployment. What Taxes Will Be Like Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko said he is aware that the program is a bit optimistic but that, if a concerted effort is made, it is implementable. When asked about a possible amendment to this year's budget, Kolodko said that, so far, revenue surpluses are not big enough to be able to carry out such an amendment of the budget law. He confirmed that he would like to lower personal income tax rates as early as next year, but he does not know where to get the 3.5-4 trillion zlotys [Z] to cover the decreased budget revenue that would result from such a measure. He was trying to convince his listeners that taxing stock market transactions will not endanger the stability of the Polish capital market, nor will it improve the lot of senior citizens. He expects Z1 trillion from the stock market tax next year, whereas the valorization of retirement pensions by 12 percent to be carried out in June will cost the state budget Z2.5 trillion. President Approved "Generally speaking, I mean in terms of the main directions, Lech Walesa approved the `Strategy for Poland,'" Kolodko stated after a meeting with the president. Kolodko said that the president received the "Strategy" with enormous interest: "He asked me a whole list of specific questions that were geared to making sure that his earlier proposals and suggestions were included in the plan. I think to a large extent they were," said Kolodko.
