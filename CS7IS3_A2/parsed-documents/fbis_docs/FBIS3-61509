To this end, the H-9/III-B inoculated cell line infected with HIV-I (VICh) from Bulgaria cultivated as a suspension in the RPMI-1640 medium (by Flow, U.K.) with a 15% embryonic calf serum is used. The experimental procedure is outlined. Glycerin and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were used as cryoprotectors. The cell viability and HIV antigen expression with various cryoprotectors at different freezing rates and the cell viability and HIV antigen expression at various points during storage are summarized, and the recovery dynamics of virus-producing cells after cryopreservation are plotted. The findings show that the frozen cell concentration does not affect subsequent cell viability; single multinuclear cells which disappeared after freezing, probably due to destruction, were detected on the eighths and ninth day. A comparison reveals that dimethylsulfoxide is less suitable for this conservation procedure. The highest survivability of the H-9/III line infected with HIV-I was observed after freezing in a 10% glycerin solution at a 1�C/min rate to a -70�C temperature with subsequent specimen placement in liquid nitrogen. The cells maintained their original viability and ability to express HIV antigen after an extended (12 months) storage of cryopreserved samples in liquid nitrogen. The above method makes it possible to preserve HIV isolates and HIV-producers for an extended period in labs with a minimum set of cryogenic devices.
