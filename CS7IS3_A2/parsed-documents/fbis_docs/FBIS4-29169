The DPRK's withdrawal from the IAEA will not immediately lead to its official secession from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Pyongyang's decision to pull out of the IAEA is considered an act aimed at upgrading its diplomatic cards by showing the United States and the United Nations its readiness "to withdraw from the NPT anytime." The purpose of participating in the IAEA is to promote exchanges, and to study knowhow and technology for the peaceful use of nuclear power -- which is a different purpose from joining the NPT. Also, according to the rules, the DPRK's withdrawal from the IAEA will not immediately lead to its departure from the NPT. In a government statement, North Korea referred to its "special position" of holding up a decision to withdraw from the NPT. It is necessary for Pyongyang to maintain this special position to continue to reject demands to accept nuclear inspections in accordance with safeguard arrangements, while remaining in the NPT.
