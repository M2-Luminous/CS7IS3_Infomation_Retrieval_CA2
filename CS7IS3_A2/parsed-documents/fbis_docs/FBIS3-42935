The Czech Republic delegation was headed by Aleksandr Vondra, first deputy minister of foreign affairs. Formerly a dissident, after 1989 he became an assistant to Vaclav Havel for foreign policy and subsequently a professional diplomat. Aleksandr Vondra answers OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's questions. [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] The Czech Republic is energetically seeking membership of NATO. Is this not dictated by a fear that some time ahead, in several years, say, Russia might extend its imperial ambitions to the Czech Republic? [Vondra] The debate in the Czech Republic about NATO membership is not dictated primarily by fear. We have other motives, and they are connected with our understanding of what the North Atlantic alliance represents. It was never perceived as a hostile force in my country. Many people saw it as a community defending Western liberties against communism, others saw the opposed military blocs as two mighty fortresses, between which we were situated. Read the Washington Treaty of 1949, and you will see that it says nothing about enemies. It says that the states subscribing to the treaty undertake to guard democracy, Western values, liberty, and the constitutional state. We are a small state, for which remaining neutral and providing for our defenses on our own are difficult. The best means of the defense of democracy for us is membership in a system of collective defense. The sole effective instrument of such defense today is NATO, which for 50 years not only guarded Western liberty and democracy against communism but has maintained also a certain internal order in Europe itself. We, as a country situated right at the center of Europe and cleaving to Western values, are interested in joining the North Atlantic alliance. This is our main mission, and here our position differs somewhat from that of other countries, perhaps. [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Should we understand you to mean that membership of NATO would symbolize the Czech Republic's return to a Europe of which it had always been a part? [Vondra] For us this is a final return to a world to which we have historically belonged. But this step is not simply a symbol. In joining a system of collective security we would like simultaneously to insure ourselves against any extreme contingency. [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Could the Partnership for Peace--if only partially--afford you the guarantees you seek? As we all know, when signing the agreement with Ukraine, Bill Clinton promised it some guarantees, not more closely defined.... [Vondra] Clearly, the guarantees promised Ukraine are not the same guarantees of security that NATO members possess. In my view, it was confirmed in Ukraine's case that it is an independent state, not some temporary formation, as some politicians would like. Even though Ukraine does not have a strong historical tradition of national statehood, it should be respected. That is, I would say that the guarantees to Ukraine are primarily guarantees of political will. As far as the Partnership for Peace is concerned, we have been promised nothing, merely offered cooperation with NATO on an individual basis. And we believe that final membership of the North Atlantic alliance would complete the process, which will take some time. We are prepared to invest resources to ensure that this process culminate in the establishment of the fullest mutual trust and the Czech Republic's official membership of the alliance. Guarantees of the assurance of our national security would thereby be placed on the table at the same time also. [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] And does not the aspiration to such guarantees betray, nonetheless, a fear in the face of the development of events in Russia? [Vondra] No. I believe, moreover, that a unique opportunity connected with the fact that the present-day Czech Republic is not the former Czechoslovakia is, in a sense, opening up before us. However paradoxical, we are now after all situated "further away" from Russia: We are separated by two whole states--Slovakia and Ukraine. Now we need not, as previously, be so afraid, and this could contribute to the greater balance of Czech-Russian relations. Now we can look at Russia more rationally, without the previous emotions, and cooperate. This is a new challenge demanding a response from both parties.
