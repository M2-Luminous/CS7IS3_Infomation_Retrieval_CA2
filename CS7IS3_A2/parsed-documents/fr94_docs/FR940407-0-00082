FR940407-0-00082 FR940407-0-00014 With respect to the level of emissions reductions required from the non-RACT sources, the final rules retain the proposed approach to define such a benefit in terms of the statutory offset ratios in general, although flexibility is provided if exceptional environmental benefits are otherwise demonstrated, with a lower bound for the trading ratio of 1.1 to 1 in such cases. EPA believes that these additional amounts of reductions are required because it is ``reasonable''_within the meaning of the amount of reductions required through ``RACT''_to forego reductions that could be obtained at the RACT source itself only when the trading program will result in an exceptionally strong benefit to the environment. In addition, requiring substantial additional emissions reductions credits from non-RACT sources is consistent with the underlying purpose of the RACT requirement_to assure reductions that result in an important step towards fulfilling the RFP and attainment requirements. The EPA incorporated statutory offset ratios because offsets are an aspect of emissions trading, and thus provide an indication of Congress' view of benefits to the environment to be required in this context of emissions trading. Section 182(b)(2), quoted above, does not alter EPA's analysis. Section 182(b)(2) mandates ``the implementation of reasonably available control technology under section 172(c)(1) with respect to (three categories of stationary sources).'' The EPA interprets the cross-reference to section 172(c)(1) to incorporate into section 182(b)(2) the definition of the phrase ``reasonably available control technology'' and the RACT requirement generally under section 172(c)(1). In addition, the EPA interprets the phrase ``with respect to'' to authorize RACT sources to acquire emissions reductions credits in the manner described above, and not to mandate the imposition of controls directly on the RACT sources. The EPA believes that this provision may be interpreted to identify the source categories responsible for securing RACT-level reductions, and to mandate the time-frame for them to do so; but does not mandate that those sources themselves implement the emissions reductions measures. The EPA believes that its interpretation is permissible under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council , 467 U.S. 837 (1984), because the relevant statutory provisions are not defined in the statute in a manner that makes clear whether sources subject to RACT may acquire the necessary emissions reductions from other sources in lieu of imposing the controls themselves. As a result, the EPA may proceed to interpret the provision in a manner that is reasonable and consistent with the purpose of the statute. (See generally sections 110(a)(2)(A) and 172(c)(6) (authorizing SIP measures to include ``economic incentives such as *␣*␣* marketable permits'').) As discussed above in paragraph IV.A.2., the final rules and guidance require that EIP's be designed to meet the goal of sharing benefits between the environment and the regulated entities. For EIP's that allow trading or other types of compliance flexibility to meet RACT requirements, as with any EIP, the EPA encourages States, to the extent practicable, to meet this benefits sharing goal most directly by requiring increased emissions reductions beyond those that would be achieved through a traditional RACT program. Increased reductions could be created in a number of ways, such as by including more sources in the program or requiring a greater than 1-to-1 trading ratio. Depending on the scope and nature of an EIP, compliance flexibility might include not only emissions trading between sources, but also alternative compliance methods such as pollution prevention, energy conservation, and fuel switching. RACT/non-RACT trading programs must, of course, also meet the other requirements in the final rules, such as those that relate to credible, workable, and replicable quantification methods and to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting that allow for compliance determinations and State and Federal enforceability. The EPA recognizes that several commenters raised concerns about the technical workability of emissions trades involving mobile sources. Congress arguably contemplated that EIP's could incorporate trades involving mobile sources, as indicated by the definition of an EIP in section 182(g)(4)(A) to include ``incentives and requirements to reduce vehicle emissions and vehicle miles traveled in the area, including any of the transportation control measures identified in section 108(f).'' The EPA will address technical concerns raised by commenters when it finalizes guidance on the generation of ERC's from mobile source control programs. Beyond the requirements in the final rules, the EPA is developing more specific guidance on the use of emissions trading to implement new NO X RACT requirements. This guidance will address issues such as setting tradeable NO X RACT limits and baselines, and is consistent with the general RACT trading principles set out in paragraphs III.D.2. and III.D.3. The EPA intends to work with States who want to develop trading-based RACT programs to incorporate the requirements of the EIP rules and related guidance into EIP's that are environmentally sound and administratively efficient.
