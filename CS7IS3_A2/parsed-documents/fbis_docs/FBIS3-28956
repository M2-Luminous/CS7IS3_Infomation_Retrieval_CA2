However, the situation outside the nation was not quiet. In addition to the North Korean nuclear issue to which the world is directing attention, the U.S. trade offensive has been strengthened with each passing day. The import of rice and beef has now become an old story. Following the pressure to open financial markets, expansion of automobile imports and protection of intellectual properties have become the imminent issues. Besides, in a meeting with the ROK minister of commerce and industry a few days ago, the U.S. Ambassador to the ROK made a strong protest against our court's decision to put the representative of the Korean branch of the U.S. Amway Company, who was previously brought to a summary indictment, on trial. He also expressed a deep regret for disadvantages inflicted on U.S. business firms last year by our government reversing its decision to designate firms for the mobile telecommunications project in our country. It was learned that during "talks for economic cooperation" to be held in Washington this week, the United States will demand the positive improvement in the tax system, custom clearance, financial restrictions, and management-labor disputes, as well as for establishment of an organization within the Economic Planning Board to exclusively handle the elimination of trade friction and improvement of the investment environment. In a nutshell, a special institute should be organized as a government office to promptly settle complaints put forward by U.S. business firms now operating in the ROK. It appeared that with the resolution of Uruguay Round [UR] negotiations, the reorganization of the world trade order came to a temporary settlement. However, without even moments for a breath-taking thereafter, we became the target of concentrated fire attack by the United States. The UR agreement is a discriminative and unfair trade order which reflects the interests of only a few big powers. However, since they emphasized that this is the way for removing obstacles laid on the road of world trade, we cooperated by opening even our rice markets on which the nation's life depends. This being the case, those who led this negotiation should direct their utmost efforts on the operation of this system and should wait for its achievements. However, the U.S. attitude totally contradicts this. By taking advantage of the settlement of the negotiations, the United States has launched a concentrated fire attack on its trade partners, in particular, the ROK and Japan. An offensive and defense battle between the United States and Japan over the issue of establishing a so-called "standard of numerical value" to objectively prove the extent of import of automobiles and the degree of opening of insurance markets continued to the current U.S.-Japan summit. However, the two sides failed to bring about satisfactory results. In view of the enormous imbalance in trade income and outgo between the United States and Japan, the U.S. offensive against Japanese markets has considerable persuasive power. However, as for the case of the ROK which suffers red figures in trade with the United States, the indiscriminate U.S. offensive is not only unfair but also insolent. The the United States' act of picking a quarrel over the ROK court's decision for trial and over the postponement of the mobile telecommunications project, which was inevitable after the issue developed into a heated political dispute, makes one doubt its true intent, going beyond pure economic interests. The ROK cannot import as many U.S. automobiles as U.S. imports of ROK automobiles because of the different standard of income of ROK consumers and their requirements, not because of trade barriers. Frankly speaking, it is not likely that the one who wants to buy a high-class U.S. automobile would give up its purchase because of a high income tax imposed at home. We are not in the position to revise our tax system merely for the sake of helping the sale of U.S. automobiles. We hope to maintain sound trade relations between the ROK and the United States and to promote mutual understanding on such relations. However, this cannot be achieved by unilateral pressure by one side and yielding to such pressure by the other. Trade is an economic issue. However, this issue would become very difficult to resolve if the people's ill feeling is involved. We ask the United States to exercise self-control so that ROK-U.S. trade relations would not develop into relations in which people's ill feeling is involved.
