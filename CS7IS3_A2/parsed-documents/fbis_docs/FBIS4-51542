"If we are given a year or so, I think we can prepare a bill. If we cannot resolve the issue, we should be called negligent," said Ishii, a senior member of the coalition's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. Some countries, including Australia, Britain, Sweden and the United States, grant the right to vote to some of their eligible citizens residing overseas and there have been demands from Japanese abroad to guarantee such a right. Ishii also said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE that he hopes the bills on the locations of 300 new single-seat constituencies for the House of Representatives will be enacted in the current ordinary Diet session ending June 29. Ishii played a pivotal role in enacting a political reform package as the head of the lower house special committee on political reform. The bills became law in late January but will not take effect until the locations of the constituencies are fixed. A government panel studying the locations will present its advice in several months, at which time the bills will be drawn up by the government. The package centers on changing the 511-member lower house electoral system from the current multiseat constituency system into a combination of elections from 300 single-seat constituencies and the remaining 200 through a proportional representation system. Ishii said the next lower house election must be held under the new system. "We must not implement a worn-out system again." The minister said he is positive about the introduction of a local consumption tax. "It would go against the current trend toward decentralization if the central government hoarded financial sources," he said. Ishii also said the government is making efforts to draw up concrete decentralization guidelines, based on which the government would submit bills to the Diet by the end of this year. He said Japan's local governments may have to foster administrative reform after the central government goes ahead with such reform.
