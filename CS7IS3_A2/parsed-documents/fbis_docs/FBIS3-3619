DTI Undersecretary Tomas I. Alcantara said the Taiwan Government has agreed to extend loans worth US$10 million through the International Economic Cooperation Development Fund and the Industrial Cooperation Center. The amount, however, could be increased to US$100 million after two years depending on the success of the initial program and on the needs of the users. Under the plan, the amount will be lent to the Development Bank of the Philippines [DBP] for a 10-year period with an annual interest rate of 3 percent and a three year grace period. The DBP will in turn re-lend the money to the private sector for a maximum of five years at lower than market rates, Alcantara said. At least five sectors have been considered for the assistance package, including the metal, tool and die, garment, component manufacturing, and equipment and electric industries, he added.
