Our special correspondent Pavlos Tsoundos has the following report. [Begin Tsoundos recording] The foreign minister agreed on the need to strengthen the EU role in the Bosnian crisis and decided to undertake an initiative for an overall solution to the problem. The 12 agreed that (Hans Koschnick), former mayor of the German town of Bremen, would undertake the administration of Mostar, where fierce fighting took place between Croats and Muslims for control of the town. The 12 also decided to work for the return of the Serbs to the peace process. In its reports, the Greek presidency welcomed U.S. participation in the peace process and described as a positive step the recent agreement for the establishment of a Croatian-Muslim federation. However, the territorial arrangement between Croats and Muslims on the one hand and Serbs on the other hand remains a thorny problem. On the issue of FYROM, Karolos Papoulias, who presides over the Council of Foreign Ministers, briefed his EU partners on the Greek countermeasures against FYROM and they had an initial exchange of views. It is expected that the discussion will continue. A preliminary discussion was held on the critical organizational problem created by the projected EU expansion as of 1 January 1995. The talks are expected to intensify through contacts of the troika-- Greece, Germany, Belgium--with the British and Spanish sides. According to British sources, London remained firm in its position favoring an increase in the number of votes needed for a veto from 23 to 27 in the Council of Ministers after Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria join the EU on 1 January 1995. According to reports, Spain, which was initially aligned with the British position, accepted the increase in the number of veto minority votes provided that it would be in force after 1996 when the intergovernmental session is held to revise the EU institutions. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe noted that some progress was made in the FYROM issue but did not commit himself to the possibility of a final solution to the problem. [end recording]
