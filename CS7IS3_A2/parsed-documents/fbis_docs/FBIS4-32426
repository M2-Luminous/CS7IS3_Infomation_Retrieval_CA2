When compared with 1992, it reached the level of 99.7 percent--that is to say, it was 0.3 percent lower. HOSPODARSKE NOVINY has already reported on these fundamental preliminary data issued by the Czech Statistical Office. In more detailed materials, the Czech Statistical Office notes that the figures for 1992 and 1993 have been rendered extensively more accurate. According to these materials, the GDP for 1993 attained a value of 923.1 billion korunas [Kc]--that is, approximately Kc89,400 per capita. Other facts that were reported regarding these computations by the statistical authorities are also of interest. The implicit deflator (the cumulative price index) of the GDP attained a level of 115.3 points. For purposes of comparison, it is possible to state that the measure of inflation, computed on the basis of the consumer price index (a sliding average for 12 months compared with the same period a year ago), reached a 1993 level of 120.8 percent. From the standpoint of aggregate demand, the slight decline in the GDP was brought about by the gross creation of fixed capital (by declining by 7.9 percent), whereas all other components increased: Consumption by households increased by 1.5 percent and consumption by the government by 1.1 percent, and the asset portion of the foreign trade balance rose 44 percent. A decline in inventories and reserves (approximately 6 percent of the total volume of the GDP) in 1993 was approximately equal to the level of 1992. There was a more express rise in some expenditure components of the GDP (computed in current prices). The share of household consumption rose from 51.5 percent in 1992 to 54.2 percent in 1993, government consumption increased from 23.1 percent to 25.7 percent, and the positive balance of foreign trade rose from 1.2 percent to 3.1 percent. On the other hand, there was a decline in the share accounted for by gross capital formation from 24.7 percent to 23.3 percent. There was a specific increase in the share of inventory and reserve decline, which dropped from - 0.7 percent to - 6.3 percent.
