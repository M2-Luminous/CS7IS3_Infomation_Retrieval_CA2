The text of the message has been issued by the president's press service: "To the organizers of, and participants in, the All-Russia Days of Protection against Ecological Danger; The All-Russia Days of Protection Against Ecological Danger are taking place in our country for the first time, from 15 April to 5 June 1994. I wholeheartedly welcome the initiative to stage them. I regard the action as timely and necessary. Protection of the natural environment is one of the Russian state's priority tasks. To ensure ecological safety, the government is drawing up a long-term state strategy that envisages widespread use of the vast potential of Russia's military-industrial complex. I think it will also be useful to have special ecological subunits within the Russian Army that will be able not only to eliminate the serious ecological consequences of their activities, but also to clean up industrially polluted areas, especially in ecological disaster zones. It is our common duty to combine our efforts and do everything possible to see that our towns and villages are green, and that the air, land, and water at our places of work, in our enterprises, around our own homes and throughout our motherland are pure. Russia needs a program of ecological regeneration. Such a program can only be drawn up by the whole of society--the government, parliament, entrepreneurs, parties, scientists, and public ecological organizations. I support the idea of convening an all-Russia congress on ecology and environmental protection to adopt such a program. Having inherited our native natural conditions from our ancestors, we, the people of Russia, are obliged to bequeath them to our children and grandchildren in all their original beauty. I sincerely hope that the All-Russia Days of Protection Against Ecological Danger will help us all to recognize the importance and responsibility of this task. I wish you success, dear friends, in the noble cause of preserving Russia's natural environment. [signed] B. Yeltsin."
