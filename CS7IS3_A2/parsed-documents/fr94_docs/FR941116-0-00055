FR941116-0-00055 FR941116-0-00011 Only limited additional information is needed in Form No. 6 to permit adequate preliminary review of a pipeline's cost-of-service showings, and to permit shipper comparison of indexed rate changes with changes in costs incurred. Thus, the single new schedule will be added to Form No. 6. The use of trended original cost to establish a rate base for oil pipelines, as required by the Opinion No. 154&hyph;B methodology, entails complex calculations to derive annual figures for equity and equity returns for ratemaking purposes. This calculation will differ from the book equity figures contained in Form No. 6, which are required for financial reporting purposes. To require the display of these calculations in Form No. 6 would be cumbersome and not be of significant benefit in a shipper's determination of whether to protest a pipeline's indexed rate filing. 41 In any event, if a shipper protest results in a cost-of-service justification by the pipeline, the underlying calculations would be available. 41 For a discussion of the differences in the equity and equity return figures contained in Form No. 6 and the use of those figures for ratemaking purposes under the Opinion No. 154&hyph;B methodology, see Supplemental Brief of AOPL filed in Docket No. RM93&hyph;11&hyph;000 on January 21, 1994, at 11&hyph;12. The changes to Form No. 6 will be effective for reporting year 1995. The 1995 Form No. 6 must be filed on or before March 31, 1996. The new schedule appearing on page 700 therefore would not be required for Form No. 6 filings until March 31, 1996, for reporting year 1995. In the interim, a verified copy of this new schedule for calendar years 1993 and 1994 is required to be prepared separately and filed concurrently with the first indexed rate change filing made by a pipeline after January 1, 1995, or by March 31, 1995, whichever is earlier. For index rate change filings made early in 1995, complete data may not be available. In this instance, a 1994 schedule shall be prepared utilizing the most recently available data annualized for 1994. By March 31, 1995, a new 1994 schedule must be submitted, using the actual 1994 data. This will provide shippers with the necessary information for an analysis of proposed indexed rate changes after January 1, 1995, the effective date of the regulations in Order No. 561. In addition, as discussed below, the information on this page will become part of the Commission's evaluation of the effectiveness of the index. Accordingly, the Commission will amend §342.3(b) of the regulations to require a verified copy of a schedule containing the information contained on page 700 for calendar years 1993 and 1994 to be filed with the first indexed rate change filing made after January 1, 1995, or by March 31, 1995, whichever is earlier. In Order No. 561, the Commission stated it would monitor the effectiveness of the index in tracking industry costs. These reviews will occur every five years, commencing July 1, 2000. 42 Page 700, together with other information contained in Form No. 6, will permit the Commission to use the Form No. 6 data to help fulfill this commitment. Since the Total Cost of Service, for example, is derived from all of the components of a pipeline's costs and capital properties, this figure, when used in conjunction with other Form No. 6 information, will provide details on general trends affecting each company. 42 III FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶ 30,985 (1993), at 30,947. B. Other Revisions to Form No. 6 Since the regulatory responsibility for oil pipelines was transferred to this Commission from the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1977, only cosmetic changes have been made to Form No. 6, other than the addition of a Statement of Cash Flows. In addition to the addition of Page 700, which is primarily designed to conform with Order No. 561, the Commission proposed in the NOPR other changes to make Form No. 6 a more useful report. As discussed below, some of the information proposed in the NOPR will not be required by this final rule. AOPL and Marathon 43 argue that the information to be contained on pages 102&hyph;103, Corporate Control, is of no value to the Commission. However, in the Commission's view, it is necessary to have information about vertical control of the pipelines for proper rate regulation to ensure against improper cost shifting and for the purpose of analyzing property transactions between affiliates. The suggestion to delete this information is denied. 43 AOPL, p. 18; Marathon, p. 3.
