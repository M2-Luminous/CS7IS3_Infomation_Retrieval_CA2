In many countries--and this is no secret--other forces decline to concede to the majority party, Calderon Sol stated during a news conference this evening at a Salvadoran hotel. The ARENA candidate insisted, however, he is still awaiting the official results of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] on Sunday's general elections, in which he claimed he received 300,000 votes more than his opponent, Ruben Zamora of the leftist coalition. Calderon Sol also affirmed ARENA has won over 200 municipalities out of the country's 262 and the majority in the 84-seat assembly. The former San Salvador mayor said the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front and its allies, the Democratic Convergence and the National Revolutionary Movement, have an electoral ceiling of 25 percent. After describing the coalition as a leftist potpourri of all tastes and flavors, he acknowledged it represents a segment of society; in this respect, he said, this coalition will play a role, have the right to participate, and can be a democratic opposition. We hope it can. He described as a crass plot the reports by certain sectors of his alleged ties with death squads, which he vowed to fight when he consolidates himself as the winner of the elections and takes office. He added he will support the inquiries on the groups the Joint Group has been conducting since last May and that he will request the cooperation of the Spanish police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Scotland Yard. Commenting on the elections, he termed it a wonderful civic holiday, adding if there is a runoff election, the TSE must resolve the irregularities that took place in the electoral registry and the organization of the elections. If we have a runoff, we have to demand the TSE better organize the elections, as the TSE must assess the problems that arose and ensure a large voter turnout. According to the UN Observers for El Salvador, Onusal, close to 25,000 Salvadorans were unable to vote, because their names did not appear on the electoral lists. It also reported there were other minor incidents.
