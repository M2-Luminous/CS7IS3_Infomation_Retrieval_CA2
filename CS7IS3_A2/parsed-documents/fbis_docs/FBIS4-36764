Our correspondent Ron Nesi'el reports that the reason is concern about attempts to attack Israelis after hundreds of Palestinian prisoners arrived in the town. Jericho itself is quiet. There is a large Palestinian police presence, especially in the area of the mosque, but there have been no reports of disturbances.
