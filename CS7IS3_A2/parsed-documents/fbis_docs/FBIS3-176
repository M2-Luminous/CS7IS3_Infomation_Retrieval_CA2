This emerged after several hours of talks between ANC President Nelson Mandela and his IFP counterpart, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, in Durban on Tuesday [1 March]. "We've laid a solid foundation for possible breakthroughs," said Mr Mandela at a press conference after the meeting. "We have laid the ground plan for future progress." On his party's stance on elections, Mr Buthelezi said: "Provisional (registration) means it leaves our options open. If a solution is found, it makes it possible for us to participate." He said the IFP was determined to contest elections, but he added that his party's demands, as contained in the Freedom Alliance's proposals late last year, had to be met. The Zulu king's demands also affected the IFP's participation in elections: "If we had a federal solution, the issue of the king would not have come up. We can in no way ignore it." The question of provisional registration had to be taken to the IFP's Central Committee for ratification, he said. Questioned on whether the IFP was closer to contesting elections, he responded: "Not at all." On his party's proposals to have the elections postponed, Mr Buthelezi noted Mr Mandela and State President F W de Klerk had made it clear this would not happen. But, he said, "we have not even started campaigning...It's only fair to give us a little space to campaign". Asked about the Freedom Alliance, Mr Buthelezi said he would have to consult his negotiation partners on IFP participation in elections, but stressed the decision to provisionally register for the poll was purely for the IFP. The deadline for registration is Friday. On international mediation, Mr Mandela said this was still under consideration and had to be taken the party's principals. [sentence as received]. Mr Mandela said later it was a "mistake" to think the problems faced by the parties could have been resolved overnight and he remained optimistic about future meetings with the IFP president. Both leaders said it was an "absolute certainty" they would meet again soon to try to resolve their constitutional differences. "In discussions of this nature there can be no deadline. Not even April 27 is a deadline," said Mr Mandela. "We'll continue searching for solutions even after April 27 if we don't reach a solution now." The leaders resolved to redouble their efforts to encourage their constituencies to participate in and support National Peace Accord structures and all peace initiatives. Both parties also agreed to establish a task group to strengthen peace committees and to allow communication between themselves. But the primary responsibility for law and order remained with the government, Mr Mandela and Mr Buthelezi noted in a joint statement. The leaders said they would work together to try to ensure canvassing for their respective views could take place. Commenting on the relationship between the ANC and IFP leaders, Mr Mandela said in spite of their political differences they were "very close friends...I came here in high spirits and I'm leaving the meeting in higher spirits". "It's sufficient for us to say we're satisfied with the progress we've made," he added.
