FR940719-2-00062 FR940719-2-00036 [Docket No. TM94&hyph;5&hyph;34&hyph;000] Florida Gas Transmission Co.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff May 13, 1994. Take notice that on May 11, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT) tendered for filing to become part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets, with an effective date of June 1, 1944: Fourth Revised Sheet No. 8A Third Revised Sheet No. 8B FGT states that section 27 of the General Terms and Conditions of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1 Adjustment to be effective each April 1 and October 1 and that such Charge shall be based on the actual fuel usage and lost and unaccounted for gas and the volumes delivered during the six-month period commencing one year prior to the effective date of the Adjustment. Section 27.A.2 provides that ``Transporter may at any time make a filing requesting a waiver of the stated Effective Date(s) to make an out-of-cycle adjustment.'' Section 27.C further provides that FGT may adjust the Fuel Reimbursement Charge for known and measurable changes. FGT states that the instant filing lowers its Fuel Reimbursement Percentage from 3.14%, established in Docket No. TM94&hyph;3&hyph;34&hyph;000 effective April 1, 1994, to 2.25% which more closely matches volumes retained by FGT with actual operating data. FGT is filing to make the attached tariff sheets reflecting the reduced Fuel Reimbursement Charge of 2.25% effective June 1, 1994. Because FGT will receive nominations for June, 1994 on May 24 and customers must make nominations and upstream supply arrangements including fuel, FGT requests that the Commission issue an order accepting the attached tariff sheets by Monday, May 23, 1994. If an order is not issued by May 23 in time for June nominations, FGT requests that the attached tariff sheets be made effective on July 1, 1994, so that beginning-of-month nominations can reflect the revised Fuel Reimbursement Charge. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capital Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with §§385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before May 20, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate actions to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
