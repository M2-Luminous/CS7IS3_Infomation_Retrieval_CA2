There were only 46 reported cases in 1992. "The increase -- which is very worrying -- is because of the rising incidents among foxes and jackals," said Chief Veterinarian Avner Shimshoni. "It shows that without efforts to reduce the jackal and fox population there is no way of stopping the spread of rabies." Just 15 of the reported rabies cases last year were in dogs; 43 were among foxes and jackals and the rest in other animals including one sheep, an ass, a cat, and cattle. In 1992, 23 rabies cases were dogs and 13 were foxes and jackals. During 1993, 117,129 dogs were vaccinated against rabies -- an increase of 10 percent over the previous year -- but a quarter of the dog population remains without anti-rabies inoculation, Shimshoni noted. The rise in the numbers of dog owners vaccinating their pets is partly a response to the drop in license and vaccine fees in some towns. New regulations in force at the end of 1993 put a maximum price dog license at NIS [new Israeli shekels] 37.5 and NIS 13.5 for the vaccine.
