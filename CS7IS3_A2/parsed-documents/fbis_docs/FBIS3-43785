Yesterday saw the approval of general principles. The relevant public announcement did not please UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, but there was nothing to be done other than instruct the two sides to observe greater secrecy about the talks. Joao Ligio, our correspondent in Lusaka, reports on the peace talks today: [Begin Ligio recording] (?This afternoon), the principles [words indistinct] were discussed [words indistinct] legal framework of the future national police force, its organizational structure, its [words indistinct] consensus [words indistinct] national constitution [words indistinct] plenary [words indistinct] exploratory contacts, by summoning the two sides, thereby forcing them to be on constant standby [preceding word in English]. It might be said that there are no fixed working rules. Beginning with the [words indistinct] the meetings were held separately. The mediators met the Angolan Government team during the morning and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] team in the afternoon. While that went on, UN Special Representative Blondin Beye would meet the side that was not involved in talks. Observers close to the talks say that UNITA has already signed several documents, even though it continues publicly to deny having done so. Such documents reportedly include its waiver concerning the scrapping of the riot police, the regionalization of the police command, and UNITA's integration in the police corps. Those observers have also said that at this stage the two sides are probably trying to bridge the gaps between the amendments that have been made so that a final document can be drawn up. A report came out yesterday saying that discussions had wound up concerning the general principles that will govern the future national police force, but that has not changed the mediators' position that secrecy must continue to surround the talks. The UN special representative has once again asked the two sides to abide by the infomation blackout [preceding word in English]. Such was the emphasis placed on this request by the mediators that this morning officials in the two negotiating teams were even quieter than usual and increased their distance from the media. Their behavior should ensure that, even more than before, the gods alone will know. [end recording]
