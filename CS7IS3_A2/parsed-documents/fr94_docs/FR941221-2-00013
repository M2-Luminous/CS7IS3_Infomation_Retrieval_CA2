FR941221-2-00013 FR941221-2-00009 [C&hyph;201&hyph;001] Leather Wearing Apparel From Mexico; Initiation of Changed Circumstances Countervailing Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of initiation of changed circumstances countervailing duty administrative review. SUMMARY: On August 25, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register the final results of administrative review of the countervailing duty order on leather wearing apparel from Mexico, covering the period January 1, 1992, through December 31, 1992 (59 FR 43815). On December 1, the Government of Mexico (GOM) requested a changed circumstances countervailing duty administrative review. The GOM stated in its request for a changed circumstances review that it had overlooked two exporters when reporting its list of Mexican leather wearing apparel exporters that received no subsidies to the Department. We are initiating a changed circumstances review to reexamine the cash deposit rate for those two companies, Maquiladora Pieles Pitic, S.A. de C.V. (MPP) and Finapiel de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (Finapiel). EFFECTIVE DATE: December 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian Albright or Dana Mermelstein, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On April 10, 1981, the Department published in the Federal Register (46 FR 21357) a countervailing duty order on leather wearing apparel from Mexico. On August 25, 1994, the Department published in the Federal Register (59 FR 43815) the final results of the administrative review covering the period January 1, 1992, through December 31, 1992. In those final results, 65 companies which the GOM certified did not receive benefits from the programs under review received a cash deposit rate of zero. All other companies received a cash deposit rate of 13.35 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments of the subject merchandise, based on the use of best information available. On October 21, 1994, in a submission requesting that the Department administratively correct its final results to include MPP and Finapiel as zero-rate companies, the GOM explained that the exports of MPP were misclassified under an incorrect tariff number and Finapiel's exports were inadvertently registered to a ``non-specified'' company due to clerical errors by Mexican Customs. Subsequently, on December 1, 1994, the GOM requested a changed circumstances review pursuant to 19 C.F.R. 355.22(h) (1994) to review the cash deposit rate applicable to MPP and Finapiel. According to the request for a changed circumstances review, MPP and Finapiel were excluded from the list of GOM-certified zero-benefit recipients submitted to the Department in the recently completed administrative review due to an oversight by the GOM. In its request for a changed circumstances review, the GOM provided company and government certifications that MPP and Finapiel did not apply for or receive any net subsidy during the first three quarters of 1994 from the programs that were previously found countervailable or not-used and will not apply for or receive any such net subsidy in the future, in accordance with 19 C.F.R. 355.22(a)(2) (1994). The GOM also stated that it has taken steps to ensure that the type of oversight which occurred in this case will not be repeated in future administrative reviews. Initiation The Department is initiating this review to examine the cash deposit rate applicable to MPP and Finapiel. If we determine that MPP and Finapiel did not receive a net subsidy on leather wearing apparel during the first three quarters of 1994, we will change the cash deposit rate for those companies to zero and instruct U.S. Customs officials to collect zero cash deposits on shipments of this merchandise exported by MPP and Finapiel. The Department notes that the GOM misclassified the exports of MPP and Finapiel under an incorrect tariff number and an incorrect company registration number, respectively. As a result, the GOM was unable to report MPP's and Finapiel's export information to the Department and did not notify MPP and Finapiel of the 1992 administrative proceeding. Because they were not notified, those companies could not participate in the review. Further, those companies did not (according to their certifications) apply for or receive any net subsidy during the first three quarters of 1994. Therefore, due to the unique facts in this case, the Department has determined that changed circumstances exist sufficient to warrant a review pursuant to section 751(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) (19 U.S.C. 1675(b)), and 19 C.F.R. 355.22(h). We are hereby notifying the public that we are initiating a changed circumstances countervailing duty administrative review on leather wearing apparel from Mexico. This notice is published in accordance with section 751(b) of the Act and 19 C.F.R. 355.22(h)(1)(i). Dated: December 15, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
