Other officers of the notorious former Soviet secret police are to follow Noviks and be put to prison, maintains the daily "Diena", indicating that a surge of arrests of other colleagues of Noviks and those directly involved in repressions which have been carried out in Latvia, is to be expected in the near future. Evidences are being collected and witness interrogated in probes of several other offices of the former KGB who are facing the same charges as their former chief. Up to now many victims of the past repressions have feared to give evidence and to turn in documentary evidences of criminal activities by Alfons Noviks and executors of his orders, said Dainis Vanags, chairman of the committee of totalitarian crimes investigation. However, during the last two months people have become more active in supplying the committee with numerous materials of help in investigating the cases.
