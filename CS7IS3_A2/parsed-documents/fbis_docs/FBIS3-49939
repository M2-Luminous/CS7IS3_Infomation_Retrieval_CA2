"We hope that this is a space which we can fill with our activities. We hope that these activities will be carried out by us as well as the sixteen NATO countries and will soon result in our becoming part of NATO, which associates countries with which we are linked in terms of human development, history and values," Zieleniec said. Olechowski described the partnership initiative as a very significant contribution to European security and a constructive and optimistic programme. But, he said, he saw a problem in the programme's not suggesting clear prospects of NATO membership for the Visegrad Group countries -- the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland. "Unfortunately, we see that we must go through different preparatory stages in order to join all the Western institutions we want to, without a promise that we will eventually succeed. This is a critical point of the Polish standpoint," Olechowski said.
