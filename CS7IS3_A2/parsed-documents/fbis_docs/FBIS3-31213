Carnogursky said the party had yet to decide whether it would suggest June or some later date, though it was leaning towards the autumn. Premier Vladimir Meciar earlier this week suggested June for premature elections. The KDH chairman refused to comment on whether his group had come to an agreement with the opposition Democratic Left Party (SDL) on a possible date. Carnogursky said that a motion calling for the premier's resignation was unlikely to be put forward during the next session of parliament, on Wednesday [16 February], though he added that it would certainly be made at some later date. If Meciar were to link a vote on the privatisation law amendment, expected in parliament on Wednesday, to the issue of confidence in his cabinet, Carnogursky said, the KDH would vote against the bill, even though that would mean voting against the changes to privatisation legislation, proposed by opposition. Carnogursky said he believed that if the premier did not link the issues the opposition would get the changes into law. Asked whether he would like to see the premier leave government before early elections were held, Carnogursky said: "The recalling of government is for us more of a question of principles, rather than of strategy." He could not say, however, whether the opposition is unified on the issue, though discussions between them are to continue non-stop until Wednesday's session.
