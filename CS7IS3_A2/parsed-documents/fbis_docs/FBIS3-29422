According to information obtained from China in mid-January, our intelligence agency said: "Kim Chong-il was in a traffic accident around September 1993. He is in critical condition, with broken bones and brain damage." This information was obtained by an official of the National Unification Board [NUB] through a researcher of a Chinese strategic institute when they participated in a seminar on Northeast Asian affairs held in the United States. The Chinese researcher said that he heard of such news from a friend with whom he served in the Army and who is currently working at the Chinese Embassy in Pyongyang and from a friend from school. The content of the information conveyed by the Chinese researcher is as follows: "Kim Chong-il, who is a speed demon, was in a traffic accident while driving his car at high speed. Kim damaged his brain and his bones were broken. North Korea invited Chinese experts who can read X-rays well as well as brain surgeons. However, the North Korean side did not allow the Chinese doctors to see the patient. They returned to China after saying they could not make a diagnosis without seeing the patient." Related agencies including the NUB and the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP] are currently analyzing this in detail. A related source said: "As a result of monitoring North Korea's various media, unusual signs are appearing surrounding Kim Chong-il such as the reduction in the number of teachings being carried out under his name. It seems definite that there is a change in Kim Chong-il's health." There is additional evidence that there is a "great change" in Kim Chong-il's health. U.S. evangelist Billy Graham, who recently visited Pyongyang to hold a revival service, said: "What was most surprising about my visit to Pyongyang this time was the fact that Kim Chong-il had disappeared from view." According to Rev. Graham, when he visited Pyongyang in 1992 Kim Il-song said to him: "Kim Chong-il is in charge of everything and I am standing at the second line." However, when he asked Kim Il-song about Kim Chong-il this time, Graham says he intentionally avoided the question. Billy Graham expressed his will to meet Kim Chong-il by saying: "I have a gift for Kim Chong-il." However, Kim Il-song changed the subject, Graham said. An expert in South-North affairs said: "In the phrases `the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il' which are being used commonly, the phrase `the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il' has been gradually disappearing since September 1993. This shows that there is a change in Kim Chong-il's succession system." A scholar on the issue of the reunification of the Korean peninsula said: "Viewing from various signs within North Korea, it seems that Kim Chong-il will face a change in his health before Kim Il-song. Now is the time to closely observe how Kim Chong-il's death will influence South-North relations." An NSP official concerned says: "As far as we know, there seems to be something wrong with Kim Chong-il's cardiac system." He still insists that this is "intelligence" [choppo], not "information" [chongbo]. This official also said: "A heart specialist from Lyon University in Paris secretly visited Pyongyang in March 1991 and performed surgery to install a heart pacemaker." He went on to say: "At that time, Western intelligence agencies believed only Kim Il-song could afford such expensive surgery and paid attention to the physical checkup of Kim Il-song, an old man. However, Kim Chong-il seems to be the person who underwent the surgery." This is not the first time that it was speculated something had happened to Kim Chong-il. Moscow radio reported in June 1993: "Kim Il-song strongly reproached his son, Kim Chong-il, and Kim Chong-il was hospitalized for a shock from this." At about the same time, Russia's ITAR-TASS carried a similar report under the headline "Kim Chong-il's Health Conditions." ITAR-TASS also carried this report in the ASIAN BULLETIN, which is distributed to Russian Government agencies and research institutes. The report says: "Kim Il-song has recently strongly reproached Kim Chong-il, his son and heir apparent, for his mistakes in the handling of state affairs. As a result, Kim Chong-il suffered a nervous breakdown and could not carry out his official duties for two months." This episode immediately followed the "rumors that Kim Chong-il fell from a horse." It was said that during a horse ride, Kim Chong-il fell from the horse and suffered a serious head injury. Upon receiving this information, our intelligence agency closely examined Kim Chong-il's appearances on Pyongyang television. The agency found out that Kim Chong-il barely used his left arm in official functions. An aide to Kim Chong-il, who contacted our side's official concerned in Beijing, China, said: "It is true that Kim Chong-il was injured when he fell from a horse. He was not injured in the head but slightly injured in the arms." A little while later, Kim Song-ae, who had disappeared for some time, suddenly appeared at an official function and demonstrated that she is all right. Kim Song-ae is Kim Chong-il's stepmother and Kim Pyong-il's mother. Kim Song-ae and Kim Chong-il are on hostile terms. Our side's agency concerned says: "When Cambodia's Sihanouk arrived in North Korea on 22 July 1993, Kim Song-ae appeared at the Pyongyang airport to receive Sihanouk. Kim Song-ae appeared at an official function to welcome a foreign state guest for the first time since she had disappeared from the public. This means Kim Song-ae regained her past authority." What is also drawing our attention along with the rise of Kim Song-ae is the change in the status of Kim Yong-chu and Kim Pyong-il. Kim Il-song's younger brother Kim Yong-chu "lived in exile" for 18 years in North Hamgyong Province but was suddenly appointed to vice president in early December 1993. While serving as ambassador to Bulgaria, Kim Pyong-il was summoned in 1992. Since then his whereabouts had been vague. However, it was learned around early December 1993 that he was in good health and living in Pyongyang. It is a widely known fact that Kim Chong-il and his half brother Kim Pyong-il do not get along well. According to a Mr. Kang who defected to the ROK from North Korea, Kim Chong-il injured his arm when Kim Pyong-il shot him with a gun. Mr. Kang said that he heard of such an incident when he visited Pyongyang in April 1990 from his uncle who works for a government agency. When Kim Pyong-il temporarily returned home while serving as ambassador to Bulgaria in early 1990, his mother Kim Song-ae said to him: "Kim Chong-il is treating me harshly by saying that I am his step-mother." When Kim Pyong-il heard this he got very angry and fired a shot at Kim Chong-il, but it only hit his arm. The rise of Kim Yong-chu, Kim Song-ae, and Kim Pyong-il go hand-in-hand with the signs of change in Kim Chong-il's health. Since September 1993, when it was learned that Kim Chong-il suffered brain damage in the traffic accident, Kim Yong-chu who was alienated, advanced to the core of the power structure. Also for Kim Song-ae to appear at an official meeting was not a common matter. It was learned that after an interval in his activities since ending his position as ambassador to Bulgaria, it was tentatively decided that Kim Pyong-il will assume the position of ambassador to Finland. An official of the NSP said: "Absolute power is bound to be concentrated in one person. The dispersion of power shows that there has been a change in Kim Chong-il's succession system. Also, it seems that lining up Kim Il-song's family to the core of the power structure is a measure to prepare for an `unavoidable circumstance' within the family." In connection with Kim Chong-il's position, it is noteworthy to see changes in North Korea's "Room No. 39." "Room No. 39." is a secretariat for Kim Chong-il. The agency concerned speculates that "Room No. 39," which used to be an office of the Finance Ministry under the party center (refers to Kim Chong-il), was disbanded recently and that it was merged into the Organization Department [chojikpu]. "Room No. 39" has been a channel for ROK business corporations' advance into North Korea. Therefore, they pay particular attention to changes in Kim Chong-il's position and the fate of "Room No. 39." Via Japanese media, North Korea has recently released a photograph of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il with Mt. Paektu in the background. The photograph shows Kim Chong-il on top of Mt. Paektu in the winter wearing ordinary clothes. Why did North Korea suddenly release such a photograph? A Chongwadae [presidential residence] official concerned says: "North-South relations will undergo momentous changes some time this year at the earliest, or next year at the latest." He also says: "Those changes will be made in a direction favorable to us."
