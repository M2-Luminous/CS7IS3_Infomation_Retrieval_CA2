He had been asked about the reaction of the head of the government to a letter from economists Anders Oslund (Sweden) and Jeffrey Sachs (United States) in which they decline "to further assist the Russian Government". According to Sergeyev, the head of the government believes that "the mechanical transfer of western economic methods to Russian soil has caused much more harm than good". "The reform course drawn up by the Russian Government and approved by the president naturally incorporates some elements of Western market economics, but it primarily takes account of particular features of our state and people and of traditions in Russia", Valentin Sergeyev concluded.
