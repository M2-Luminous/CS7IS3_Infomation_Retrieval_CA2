FR940920-0-00017 FR940920-0-00008 40 CFR Part 63 [AD&hyph;FRL&hyph;5073&hyph;9] National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Categories: Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants From the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Other Processes Subject to the Negotiated Regulation for Equipment Leaks; Correction AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Correcting amendments. SUMMARY: This action corrects errors and clarifies regulatory text of the ``National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Categories: Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Other Processes Subject to the Negotiated Regulation for Equipment Leaks,'' which was issued as a final rule on April 22, 1994 and June 6, 1994. This rule is commonly known as the Hazardous Organic NESHAP or the HON. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Janet S. Meyer, Standards Development Branch, Emission Standards Division (MD&hyph;13), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, telephone number (919) 541&hyph;5254. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 22, 1994 (59 FR 19402), and June 6, 1994 (59 FR 29196), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated in the Federal Register national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry, and for several other processes subject to the equipment leaks portion of the rule. These regulations were promulgated as subparts F, G, H, and I in 40 CFR part 63, and are commonly referred to as the hazardous organic NESHAP, or the HON. This document contains corrections to typographical and cross-referencing errors in subparts F, H, and I of the final regulations. A few editorial corrections are also being made to clarify the intent of certain provisions in these subparts. Paragraph (e) of §63.103 of subpart F is being revised to clarify that the source owner or operator is required to only document the basis for the determination that the provisions of the HON do not apply, and not to keep ongoing records. Tables 1 and 2 of subpart F are revised to correct typographical errors in spelling of several chemical names or the chemical abstracts services (CAS) numbers. Thiocarbanilide is being removed from table 1 of subpart F because this chemical is listed elsewhere in table 1 as diphenyl thiourea. A few editorial changes are being made to several sections in subpart H to clarify the intent of the provisions. Section 63.163(f) is being revised to remove a requirement to inspect sealless pumps for indications of liquids dripping from the pump seal. Since this inspection will not serve the purpose of detecting failures of these pumps, the requirement to perform these inspections is being removed. The provisions of §63.180(b)(2) are being clarified by adding a sentence explaining that inert gases are not to be considered in evaluation of instrument response factor. A number of corrections are being made to subpart I to improve consistency in terminology and to clarify the provisions. This document corrects subpart I to use the term ``pharmaceutical production process'' in §63.190(b)(5) and in the definitions section. The definition of ``pharmaceutical production process'' is being clarified to reflect the intent of the regulatory negotiation committee. Editorial corrections are being made to §63.190(e) and §63.192(e) to correct a drafting error in usage of the term ``source.'' Several errors in cross referencing subpart A of part 63 and other cross referencing errors are being corrected.

Nichols, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation.
