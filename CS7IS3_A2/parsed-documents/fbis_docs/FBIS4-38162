FBIS4-38162 "drnes124_m_94006" FBIS-NES-94-124 Daily Report 25 Jun 1994 JORDAN Senate, House Speaker Receive Yemeni Delegation Senate, House Speaker Receive Yemeni Delegation JN2506182594 Amman Radio Jordan Network in Arabic 1500 GMT 25 Jun 94 JN2506182594 Amman Radio Jordan Network Arabic BFN [Text] Senate President Ahmad al-Lawzi and Speaker of the House of Representatives Tahir al-Masri today met separately at the Parliament building with a visiting Yemeni parliamentary delegation led by Deputy Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kibsi. Details in the following report by our parliamentary affairs correspondent: Mr. al-Lawzi told the Yemeni lawmakers that, led by His Majesty King Husayn, Jordan has sought with all sincerity to ensure a reconciliation that advanced peace and unity in Yemen in the best interests of the country's people. Jordan, he added, has carried and continues to carry the concerns and causes of the Arab nation, particularly the Palestinian cause. Al-Lawzi emphasized that His Majesty King Husayn is giving the cause of Yemen top priority. He recalled the meeting held in Amman by Yemen's leaders and representatives who signed the accord document that has won widespread support throughout the Arab world. We have been deeply pained and distressed by the fact that no sooner had the Amman meeting ended than blood began to flow in Yemen and dialogue and understanding gave way to war, he said. The Senate speaker also recalled distressing events in Palestine, the Gulf, Lebanon, Sudan, Somalia, and elsewhere. For his part, Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kibsi, the head of the Yemeni delegation, emphasized that the Yemeni people understand Jordan's stand on Yemen's unity. The delegation is visiting Jordan to benefit from its rich experience in order to maintain Yemen's unity, which is held by the country's people to be their destiny. The war now raging in Yemen, he added, is not one between north and south or between the General People's Congress and the Socialist Party. It is a war pitting constitutional legitimacy against a party that has defied this legitimacy, in other words, a conflict between advocates of and deviationists from national unity. Al-Kibsi said that by sponsoring the accord document, which offered a political way out of potential hostilities, Amman lit a candle of joy. He noted that all Yemeni political forces showed up at the signing ceremony and put their signatures to the document. Every Yemeni citizen -- from the far left to the far right -- appreciates that Amman is anxious for Yemen to retain its unity, said al-Kibsi. Al-Kibsi delivered a message from Mr. 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, the speaker of Yemen's House of Representatives, to Mr. al-Lawzi. In his meeting with the Yemeni parliamentarians, al-Masri emphasized that, led by His Majesty King Husayn, Jordan headed the effort to heal the rift in Yemen. Our stance in Jordan toward fraternal Yemen is known and has not changed, al-Masri said. He said he hoped the hostilities and bloodletting would halt so that Yemen may stay united in fulfillment of the will of the country's people. Al-Kibsi told al-Masri he appreciated and took pride in the interest Jordan's king, government, and people have taken in Yemen's unity since it was declared. He noted that as soon as differences in Yemen emerged, Jordan and King Husayn moved to smooth over these differences and then set up the meeting that saw the signing of the accord document bearing the clear fingerprints of Jordan. Al-Kibsi handed Mr. al-Masri a message from Mr. al-Ahmar.
