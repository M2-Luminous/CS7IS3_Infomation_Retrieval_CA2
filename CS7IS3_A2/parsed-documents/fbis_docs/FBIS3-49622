The Slovak delegation included Economics Minister Jan Ducky, Governor of the National Bank of Slovakia Vladimir Masar, and a number of businessmen. During his three-day stay in Israel, Moravcik met with his Israeli counterpart, the Israeli premier, president and the speaker of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. The Slovak balanced diplomatic activity is aimed at "creating throughout the region equal opportunities and room for cooperation," Moravcik said, adding, "one of the prerequisites for this is the implementation of the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians." In order to further bilateral cooperation, agreements on the prevention of double taxation and protection of investments have to be signed, he said. His visit to Israel focused on the extension of political dialogue, bilateral trade, and areas of prospective cooperation. These are envisaged as agriculture, banking, travel industry, and Israeli investment in Slovakia. "The first stage of building bilateral ties logically culminated in this visit," Moravcik said.
