The meeting is the first to be held under a treaty on cooperation to preserve the environment signed between the two countries last June. Japanese officials from the Foreign Ministry, the Environment Agency, the Science and Technology Agency and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry will attend the meeting, the ministry said. The South Korean delegation includes officials from the Foreign, Science and Technology and Environment Ministries. The participants will discuss each nation's environment polices and bilateral and multilateral cooperation on environmental problems, it said. Japan is expected to propose joint projects including monitoring acid rain, apparently caused by emissions from China, and research on pollution in the Sea of Japan, such as that caused by Russia's dumping of nuclear waste, Japanese officials said. Tokyo and Seoul will also discuss South Korea's request for Japan to help in the recycling and disposal of industrial waste, the officials said. The Japan-South Korea accord covers research on acid rain, air pollution, global warming, the preservation of ecosystems and biodiversity. Under the agreement, the conference will be held annually, alternating between Japan and South Korea.
