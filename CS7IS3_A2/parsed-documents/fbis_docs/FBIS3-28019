Ambassador Manuel Yan, the chief government negotiator in the talks with the MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari, signed the agreement after a government panel finished studying it. Misuari signed the agreement on Wednesday. Government officials said Yan did not immediately sign to give senior officials time to review the pact. The 10-page accord covers 13 provinces in Mindanao and Palawan. Hostile actions banned under the agreement include kidnapping, hijacking, piracy, bombings, grenade throwing, aircraft bomb attacks, artillery shelling, and naval gunfire. The MNLF will also identify the location and unit commanders of its forces so responsibility for any violation of the agreement can easily be pinpointed.
