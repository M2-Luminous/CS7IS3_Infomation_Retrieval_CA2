The decision was made as Pyongyang expressed hope that Seoul would take the initiative in resuming inter-Korean dialogue at working-level meetings with the United States in New York on Wednesday and Thursday, informed sources said. If North Korea and the United States reach agreement at their meeting on Friday, Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang will call a high- level strategic meeting to prepare a telephone message to his North Korean counterpart offering to hold the fourth working-level meeting on exchanging special envoys. The message under consideration is expected to call for a working-level contact on the southern side of the truce village of Panmunjom early next month. In line with the working-level meeting, informed sources said, Seoul will reportedly announce suspension of the annual South Korea- U.S. military exercise "Team Spirit" provided that North Korea cooperates fully with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection activities and shows sincerity toward inter-Korean dialouge. Pyongyang and Washington met again in New York on Thursday to continue discussions on follow-up measures to North Korea's acceptance of IAEA inspections. The two are said to be near a compromise and may announce a set of agreements after meeting on Friday.
