The State Contract envisages procurement of 14 million tons of grain, 1.56 million tons of oil crop seeds (basically, sunflower seed), 25 million tons of white beet roots. Under the state's agreements with agricultural growers and producers the state's centralized fund is to stock 703,000 tons of meat and meat products, 1,960 million eggs, 4,140,000 tons of milk and dairy products, 636,000 tons of potatoes, 434,000 tons of vegetables, other products and raw materials. To make the State Contract materialize, the producers should be paid 38.8 trillion karbovanets. As Nikolay Solodki, chief of the Ministry's Main Agency for food resources, disclosed at a Collegium meeting, as of March 28 contracts were concluded with Ukraine's agricultural producers (collective and state farms) to the tune of 32 trillion karbovanets. Under the contracts' terms 25 per cent of the contract-specified sums are payable within 10 days. However, the farms were paid only 4.2 trillion karbovanets including 2.5 trillion karbovanets in short-term (up to 90 days) credits, which cannot but have a braking effect on the vernal sowing campaign's progress. Ukraine's state stocks of agricultural products are estimated currently at 4.2 trillion karbovanets. However, their realization domestically or marketing abroad are hampered by too high prices, which exceed twofold the world market's averaged ones, which questions earning the required sums. Ukrainian Minister for agriculture and foodstuffs Yuri Karasik attributes these too high agricultural product prices to unwarranted fuel price raises, particularly in 1993's second semester, when Ukrainian fuel prices exceeded the world market's averaged ones fivefold (at about 18 million karbovanets per ton of oil), allegedly due to the Ukrainian oil refineries' low performance in deep processing of crude petroleum. This year, however, the Ukrainian government is reported to have solved the problem of purchasing a part of necessary fuels abroad at prices not exceeding 140 USD per ton. No state loans are envisaged in 1994 and no credits will be granted to support the State Order, Nikolai Golub, vice-president of the "Ukraina" agrobank, said speaking at the Agricultural Ministry Collegium's session.
