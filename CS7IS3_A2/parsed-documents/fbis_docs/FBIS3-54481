The embassy will open in the next few months but Libya has already named Muhammad al-Fayturi as its charge d'affaires in the Emirates. The foreign ministry acting undersecretary, Sayf Sa'id, met al- Fayturi on Tuesday "after Libya decided to reopen its diplomatic mission here," the official UAE news agency WAM said. Libya closed its embassy in the UAE and several other countries in the mid-1980s apparently because it wanted to cut overspending due to a decline in oil prices, an Arab diplomat said. It was not clear what prompted the latest move since oil prices have stayed weak. But the decision coincides with Libya's dispute with the West over the 1988 Lockerbie plane bombing. The Gulf states -- oil producers like Libya -- have good ties with Washington and London, which demand the hand-over of two Libyan suspects in the bombing over the Scottish village of Lockerbie that cost 270 lives.
