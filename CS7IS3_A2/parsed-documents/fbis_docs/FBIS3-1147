You know that the mission assigned by the Sovereign National Conference to the transitional prime minister is essentially to lead the country to democracy. Between the end of 1992 and the beginning of 1993, you know that civil peace and the very existence of the nation as an entity was seriously threatened. It became necessary to initiate greater consultations than in the past between the head of state and the prime minister in order to save our country. This has been done and a crisis government was formed on the basis of seven fundamental principles to [words indistinct] which I had negotiated at the time and which was accepted by the head of state. The essential mission of the crisis government does not differ at all from that of the transitional government. It is the same thing; that is, to govern the country until the installation of democratic institutions. Today we are on the eve of the first meeting of the new National Assembly, and I thought my mission and that of the government had ended. It is henceforth up to the head of state who has the reigns of power to continue his consultations to form a new government. Of course, I am satisfied since Togo is entering into the community of the world's democratic nations. I am very satisfied with this. Of course, these results were achieved without having gone through great pains. We went through various ups and downs, including bloody events, and this is my only point of regret; we do not have the power to bring the dead back to life, those people whom our divisions and dissensions killed. But concerning our performance report, we will remember, if not this evening then in the days ahead, some of the highlights of this transition which has been a long one. This birth of our democracy has been long, but, thank God, the Togolese democracy has been born all the same. [Correspondent] Considering your experience, what advise do you give to your successor? [Koffigoh] I told you before it is not up to the outgoing prime minister to define the criteria for his successor. So, for the moment, I will limit myself to this. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] [Koffigoh] But I say that Togo is a nation which must get consolidated as a nation and which has to assert itself in the regional, subregional, and the international context as well as among countries belonging to the United Nations. Togolese have real problems that go beyond our petty squabbles and political triteness and these problems must be resolved. The best way to solve them is that each time difficulties arise ...[pauses] there is no country in the world that does not go through problems. But those who can contribute should be able to hold consultations to find the best solutions. If this spirit guides our country's march towards the future, I think we have a good chance to emerge victorious. But if we should continue to fight among ourselves while we forget the people, then, of course, we will have the same difficulties in the future. I think I have been clear enough. [end recording]
