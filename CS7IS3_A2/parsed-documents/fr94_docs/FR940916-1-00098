FR940916-1-00098 FR940916-1-00016 This section also provides specific restrictions on the movement of equipment with defective brakes onto the line of a connecting railroad. Hence, the delivery of defective equipment in interchange would be covered by these restrictions. In addition to fulfilling the other requirements set out in this section, the railroad seeking relief from civil penalty liability must show that the connecting railroad has elected to accept the non-complying equipment and that the point of repair on the connecting railroad's line, where the equipment will be repaired, is no further than the point where the repairs could have been made on the line where the equipment was first found to be defective. Subpart B This proposed subpart contains design standards that apply to all train brake systems as well as design standards that apply to specific types of operations and equipment. Section 232.101. This section contains general design standards that apply to all trains and equipment. The railroad industry expressed a strong desire for FRA to develop future safety regulations based on performance requirements rather than having specific design requirements specified by the regulations. FRA recognizes that requirements based on specific design standards may be overly restrictive. Furthermore, FRA has no objection to performance-based requirements as long as the performance requirements contribute to improve safety, and are able to be measured and enforced. Unfortunately, the railroad industry had little to offer in the way of specific and enforceable performance requirements for train brake systems either at the public workshops or in the written comments preceding this proposal. However, in §232.901(c), FRA has made an attempt to move toward performance-based safety requirements by encouraging railroads and equipment developers to submit proposed performance requirements to FRA for new train brake system technology. FRA feels that developing performance standards for designs already in production would be a backward approach and believes that it is much easier to develop and implement these types of standards for newly developed designs. FRA has also attempted to integrate performance standards into several of these proposed regulations. FRA believes that Interstate Commerce Commission Order 13528, as amended (codified in existing §232.3 and Appendix B to Part 232), is no longer completely relevant or necessary. FRA proposes to revoke the Order and incorporate its relevant portions into this section. Therefore, proposed §232.101(c) contains a list of equipment to which the Order's specifications and requirements for operating power-brake systems for freight service do not apply. In §232.101(e), FRA proposes to require that all new equipment built after January 1, 1995 be designed and constructed so that an individual inspecting the equipment can observe brake actuation and release from a safe position beside the equipment. This proposed requirement stems from the brake system design of double-stack equipment. Several parties commented that the functioning of the brakes on this type of equipment cannot be observed without inspectors placing themselves in potentially dangerous positions. In addition, a complete inspection of the brake equipment and systems used on double-stack equipment is time consuming. Consequently, inspectors are reluctant to conduct a complete brake inspection test on departing trains that contain this type of equipment. FRA feels that double-stack equipment is becoming a mainstay of the freight railroad industry and that this design deficiency must be corrected. FRA has attempted to make this a performance requirement by simply specifying how the equipment must function and allowing the industry to determine the method of compliance. In §232.101(f), FRA proposes to require that all train brake systems have an emergency application feature that increases the train's deceleration rate by 15 percent over the rate of a full-service application. Most existing train brake systems already meet this requirement. The intent of FRA is to ensure that this practice, which time has proven effective, continues into the future. This is also a performance standard since the method of achieving the desired increase in deceleration rate is left entirely to industry. Regarding proposed §232.101(g)&hyph;(h), wheel cracks due to thermal overstress are a dangerous consequence of extreme wheel heating by the operation of friction brakes. Wheels with on-tread brakes are particularly vulnerable. Research performed by the John A. Volpe National Transportation System Center and the AAR indicates that wheels with on-tread brakes will form thermal cracks if the wheel tread surface temperature remains above 600 degrees F. As a result, FRA proposes to require that future train brake systems with on-tread brakes be designed so that wheel-tread surface temperature does not exceed 600 degrees F during normal applications of the brake. FRA also intends to require that future train brake systems that include disc brakes be designed so the disc-pad rotor surface temperature does not exceed 750 degrees F during a normal brake application. This requirement is also supported by research data from the AAR and the John A. Volpe National Transportation System Center. In §232.101(i)&hyph;(j), FRA proposes to require that all locomotives be equipped with automatic wheel slip/slide detection systems and with handbrakes. Wheel slip/slide systems are required because they tend to maximize the retarding force available to stop the train. Handbrakes are required to minimize the chance of a car or locomotive moving while unattended.
