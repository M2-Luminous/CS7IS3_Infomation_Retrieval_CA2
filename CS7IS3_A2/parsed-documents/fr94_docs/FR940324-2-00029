FR940324-2-00029 FR940324-2-00018 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;265&hyph;000, et al.] Texas Gas Transmission Corporation, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings March 9, 1994. Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 1. Texas Gas Transmission Corporation [Docket No. CP94&hyph;265&hyph;000] Take notice that on March 4, 1994, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas Gas), P.O. Box 1160, Owensboro, Kentucky 42302, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;265&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for authorization to increase the certificated horsepower of its Haughton Compressor Station located in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Texas Gas states that the compressor unit installed at Haughton has a full nameplate capability of 2,250 horsepower, but has been programmed to a 2,000 horsepower capability to meet the station requirements existing at the time of its installation. Texas Gas states further that because its firm shippers have requested increased volumes, it is now necessary to uprate the compressor to its 2,250 horsepower maximum capability. It is stated that because the uprating can be accomplished by simply rewriting the control software, there is no cost associated with the alteration. It is further stated that the proposed uprating would increase the capacity available in the winter on Texas Gas' North Louisiana system by approximately 5.3 Mmcf per day, but would not increase the summer ambient capability of the Haughton compressor. Thus, it is said, there would be no increase in Texas Gas' annual available capacity along this system. Comment date: March 30, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 2. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. [Docket No. CP94&hyph;269&hyph;000] March 10, 1994.

Columbia states that it will provide the interruptible transportation service under its blanket certificate in Docket No. CP86&hyph;240&hyph;000 under existing authorized rate schedules and within certificated entitlements.

It is stated that NGO has agreed to reimburse Columbia for the remaining $90,739, plus any gross-up for tax purposes. Columbia proposes to upgrade an existing receipt meter to a bidirectional facility capable of delivering and receiving up to 20,000 Dth/d. It is stated that interconnecting facilities by Columbia consist of an 8-inch tap, electronic measurement, flow control, installation of a filter separator and less than 20 feet of pipeline within the existing right-of-way. Columbia states that it has obtained the necessary environmental clearances from the Ohio State Historical Preservation Office and the United States Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Service for its proposed construction.
