In a friendly atmosphere, the two recalled the traditional friendship between China and Sweden and expressed their hope that the two countries will enjoy constantly growing bilateral relations. Li Ruihuan said: Sino-Swedish exchanges date back to ancient times, and the Chinese and Swedish people have always had friendly feelings for each other. Sweden was one of the first of the group of Western countries which established diplomatic relations with New China, and the Chinese people have always spoken highly of this fact. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two countries have attained remarkable achievements in exchanges and cooperation in all fields. I hope that bilateral relations will grow further on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Li Ruihuan said: China has achieved fairly great economic development over the last decade and more since it started the policy of reform and opening up. However, it still has a long way to go before it can truly become prosperous. "We are striving for sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. Therefore, we need a peaceful international environment and a stable political and social order at home. While engaging in economic construction, we attach great importance to strengthening socialist democracy and the legal system." The CPPCC is playing an increasingly important role in this regard. Li Ruihuan briefed Troedsson on the CPPCC's functions, status, and role. Troedsson said: Swedish-Chinese relations have grown constantly in recent years with a constant expansion of bilateral cooperation, a constant increase in trade volume and investment projects, and very active cultural exchanges. The facts prove that cooperation and exchanges conform to the fundamental interests of the people of both countries. She said: Chairman Li Ruihuan is visiting Sweden at a time when the Swedish people are becoming more and more interested in China. This fact is no doubt very helpful to the mutual understanding between the two peoples and to the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Troedsson gave a luncheon for Li Ruihuan.
