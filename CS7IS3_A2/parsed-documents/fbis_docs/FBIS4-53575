The companies make up about 20 percent of Japanese companies closing their books on March 31. The so-called Kabutocho Press Club within the Tokyo Stock Exchange was packed like a morning commuter train with reporters and corporate financial officers for earnings announcements. The effects of the prolonged recession were reflected in the results, with many companies reporting, "sales went down because of the recession," or "the high yen cut into profits." Until now, some 350 companies have announced their results for their latest business year, showing a decline of some 6 percent in combined sales and a fall of some 14 percent in combined pretax profits from year-earlier levels. "If steel and auto companies which announce their results next week are added up, pretax profits will go down further, probably by more than 20 percent," an economist at a private think tank said.
