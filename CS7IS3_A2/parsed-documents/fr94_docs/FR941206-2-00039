ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given in accordance with the provision of section 1413 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 300f et seq., and 40 CFR part 142, subpart B, the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR), that the State of Minnesota is revising its approved Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) primacy program. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) has adopted drinking water regulations for Lead and Copper, 44 synthetic organic chemicals (SOCs), 12 inorganic chemicals (IOCs), and 8 volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) that correspond to the NPDWR for Lead and Copper, SOCs, IOCs, and VOCs, and promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) on June 7, 1991 (56 FR 26460&hyph;26564), on January 30, 1991 (56 FR 3526&hyph;3597), as amended on July 1, 1991 (56 FR 30266&hyph;30281), and on July 17, 1992 (57 FR 31776&hyph;31849). The USEPA has completed its review of Minnesota's PWSS primacy program revision and has determined that these sets of state program revisions are not less stringent than the corresponding Federal regulations. The USEPA has determined that the Minnesota rule revisions meet the requirements of the Federal rule. Therefore, the USEPA has determined that these sets of state program revisions are no less stringent than the corresponding Federal regulations and is proposing to approve the MDH's rule revisions. All interested parties are invited to submit written comments on these proposed determinations, and may request a public hearing on or before January 5, 1995. If a public hearing is requested and granted, the corresponding determination shall not become effective until such time following the hearing, at which the Regional Administrator issues an order affirming or rescinding this action. Frivolous or insubstantial requests for a hearing may be denied by the Regional Administrator. Requests for public hearing should be addressed to: Ron Murawski, (WD&hyph;17J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Any request for a public hearing shall include the following: (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the individual, organization, or other entity requesting a hearing. (2) A brief statement of the requesting person's interest in the Regional Administrator's determinations and of information that the requesting person intends to submit at such hearing. (3) The signature of the individual making the request; or, if the request is made on behalf of an organization or other entity, the signature of a responsible official of the organization or other entity. Notice of any hearing shall be given not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the time scheduled for the hearing. Such notice will be made by the Regional Administrator in the Federal Register and in newspapers of general circulation in the State of Minnesota. A notice will be sent to the person(s) requesting the hearing as well as to the State of Minnesota. The hearing notice will include a statement of purpose, information regarding the time and location, and the address and telephone number where interested persons may obtain further information. The Regional Administrator will issue an order affirming or rescinding his determination upon review of the hearing record. Should the determination be affirmed, it will become effective as of the date of the order. Should no timely and appropriate request for a hearing be received, and should the Regional Administrator not elect to hold a hearing on his own motion, these determinations shall become effective on January 5, 1995. Please bring this notice to the attention of any persons known by you to have an interest in these determinations.
