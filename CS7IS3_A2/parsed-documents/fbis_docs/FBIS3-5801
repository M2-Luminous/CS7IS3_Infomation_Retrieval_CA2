The source said that seals for reactors of five megawatt and over, which had been used for extracting plutonium, were not damaged and that some seals in the radiochemical laboratory -- a nuclear waste reprocessing facility -- and in the nuclear fuel producing plant seemed to have problems. The source explained: It is a convention for an inspection team to confirm if nuclear materials in containers with damaged seals are identical to those listed in the first report submitted by a country that is subject to IAEA inspections, as soon as seal damage is confirmed. This enables the inspection team to determine if nuclear materials have been diverted to other purposes. (David Kyd), information director of the IAEA, said: I am unable to comment now on the question about seal damage in North Korea's nuclear facilities. I will report the details of the result of the ongoing inspection on North Korea to the next meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors. Saying that the inspection team is now smoothly conducting inspections at Yongbyon, Director (Kyd) hinted that the question about the seal damage, which caused arguments between the inspection team and the North Korean authorities, has been solved smoothly. The inspection team will continue to inspect nuclear facilities in Yongbyon until this weekend and will leave Pyongyang around 15 March after winding up its inspection early next week.
