It is obvious that the two political setbacks were caused by differences among its leaders -- the "historic vanguard" -- and the workers and peasants they claim to represent. According to the Marxist-Sandinist theory implemented in Nicaragua during the 1900's, "the masses were not cultured." They had to be educated politically because their interests at the "moment" did not coincide with the long-term interests of the Sandinist revolution. The party leadership, therefore, said it had to interpret "the people's will" and consequently lead them down a certain path, even if in contravention of the people's will. After all, the Sandinist Government system had the coercive means to "convince," warn, or exclude those who doubted the validity of its arguments. The fact is that the Sandinist Front lost power; this was not envisioned in any chapter of its doctrine. In 1990 the government of Violeta Chamorro changed the historical tradition from dictatorship to democracy -- destroying the adversary through a policy of reconciliation -- and the Sandinist Front did not have a violent or defying opponent that could justify the preservation of its authoritarian and rigid position. The new democratic order penetrated the party structures, allowing its rank and file the space and means to express its opinions freely, evidence of the contrasting interests between the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] and its masses until the latter, one way or another, had its interests prevail over the messianic projects of the vanguard. Among other failed plans was the idea of regaining power by creating revolts, strikes, kidnappings, disturbances, social disruption, and chaos that would supposedly topple the new system established by the people's vote. Finally, Nicaraguan democracy dragged the party deep into an identity crisis. Today it is divided between the interests of the rank and file, which is contaminated by democracy, and those of the messianic projects. Apparently, the democrats have found an interpreter in the self-styled "For a Sandinism that will return to the majority" trend. They are proposing changes to the rigid party position, making it conform to democracy. They believe that if the party does not achieve ideological, organizational, and structural democratization, the FSLN will be abandoned by the popular groups that still follow it and will be reduced to a small group of agitators. The other current, which controls the chains of command on diverse levels of the party's current organization, is the self-styled "Democratic Left." Apparently it is not willing to accept a renewal that would allow participation by the rank and file. Recent party assemblies, convened before the special congress that will be held today, have confirmed that the FSLN is dominated by its inability, both structural and ideological, to adapt to Nicaragua's existing democratic circumstances. Majority resolutions against the Democratic Left were eliminated and manipulated by the party, confirming that that sector is not ready to relinquish its privileges. The special congress today offers the FSLN an excellent opportunity to overcome that division and emerge as a single, strong, organized party, committed to democracy, peace, and economic development. If this commitment is not achieved, those who have proclaimed the renewal and democratization of the party will have only two alternatives: to perish politically, devoid of credibility, or to be true to their proposals, ridding themselves of their rigid position in order to be reborn democratically in the modern history of Nicaragua.
