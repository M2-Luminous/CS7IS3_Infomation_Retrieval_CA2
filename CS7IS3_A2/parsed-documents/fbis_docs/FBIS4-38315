"We have to deal with matters in an open-minded and pragmatic manner," says Muhammad Imam, general manager of International Tourist Travel Services, adding that in view of the tangible progress on the Jordanian-Israeli peace track, Jordanian travel and tourist agents have to start communicating with the Israelis to prepare for any future bilateral agreement on tourism in the region. Mr. Imam adds that "we should not act like ostriches and hide away from reality." The reality, according to him, is that Jordan's tourism cannot survive without coordination with Israel, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon and the Palestinians. Dr. 'Adwan maintains that matters concerning tourism in the region will only be discussed in current peace negotiations. While informed sources in the tourism business told the JORDAN TIMES that Jordan was represented in a tourism conference in Tel Aviv on June 13, Dr. 'Adwan said that he "had no knowledge of it, has not been consulted (on the issue), and therefore, (he) can deny it." The Israeli daily newspaper, HA'ARETZ, said last week that five Jordanian businessmen were scheduled to attend the conference for which "Jewish businessmen were queueing." The tourism business sources, who asked not to be named, said that there was no harm in participating in such "friendly and beneficial" conferences to hear the "other point of view." Mr. Imam said that since "we sat with the Israelis in Madrid, Washington and will be doing so in Aqaba next month, it is no big deal to meet with them in the occupied territories for business pruposes." He said he believed preparations should start by providing the "proper" infrastructure for tourism-related projects in Petra, the Kingdom's main attraction, and by establishing other bridges linking both the Palestinian self-rule areas and Israel to Jordan. "We want tourists coming from the Holy Land to come and stay and not just use Jordan for an excursion," said Mr. Imam.
