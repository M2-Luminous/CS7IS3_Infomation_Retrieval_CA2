The wreath carries the following inscription: A respectful Tribute to President Ho Chi Minh -- Glorious Man of the Vietnamese Nation. The delegation also visited President Ho Chi Minh's residence and office. At Uncle Ho's stilt house, President Ochirbat posed for a while before some memorabilia that conjured up the image of the great leader of the Vietnamese people. He was apparently moved when Mr. Tran Viet Hoan, director of the late president's heritage complex, recalled a statement by President Ho Chi Minh that, although living far apart, the Vietnamese people and the Mongolian people love each other dearly and they have always supported each other. I firmly believe that the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries will certainly develop with every passing day, thus contributing to the maintenance of peace in Asia and the world. President Ochirbat entered his thoughts in a souvenir book and signed it. After leaving Uncle Ho's stilt house, President Ochirbat and his wife visited the Ho Chi Minh Museum where he was welcomed by Curator Cu Van Truoc and the museum staff and was guided by them on a tour of various galleries.
