I am going to set forth the following three opinions: 1. The buildup of the entrepreneur ranks has become the key to deepening the economic structural reform and building our province into an economically powerful province. Achieving and enlivening state-owned enterprises, particularly state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, is an important and difficult task in setting up the socialist market economic system. If we fail to achieve and enliven the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises in the course of reforming the economic system, the dominant role of the state sector of the economy will become weakened, the new market economic system will not take shape, and the socialist nature of the market economy will seriously be affected. Enlivening and achieving state-owned enterprises, particularly large and medium-sized enterprises, is a basic task for deepening the economic structural reform and building an economically powerful province. The state and the government certainly assume the responsibility for achieving and enlivening state-owned enterprises. For instance, the state and the government should strengthen macroeconomic control to create conditions for enlivening the microeconomy, should delegate power to lower levels according to the requirements as set forth in the "enterprise law" and the "regulations" to make enterprises actually have the rights to independent management, and should positively provide enterprises with a social guarantee system and the conditions for setting up markets to create a good social environment for changing the enterprise managerial mechanism. However, the key to actually enlivening and achieving state-owned enterprises hinges on enterprises themselves. The enterprises should grasp favorable opportunities, apply the state and the government's policies and laws as well as various resources provided by the markets, work out accurate policy decisions, and achieve management. External cause is the condition for changes and internal cause is the basis for changes. So, the key to enlivening enterprises hinges and depends on enterprises themselves. The key to achieving and enlivening state-owned enterprises under appropriate conditions hinges on personnel. To solve the problems in this regard, there must be outstanding entrepreneurs with both professional ability and political integrity, with knowledge of the market economy, with management ability, with courage and insight, with the daring to make attempts and to do pioneering work, and with the courage to keep forging ahead. Countless facts prove that with an outstanding entrepreneur, an enterprise will be able to find out information, products, technologies, capital, and skilled persons. An outstanding entrepreneur is able to grasp favorable opportunities, overcome existing difficulties, and find out ways and methods for eliminating contradictions. An enterprise lacking an outstanding entrepreneur, cannot enliven itself although its external conditions are good. At present, enterprises' deficits increase by a big margin due to historical, realistic, and objective reasons. But, responsible persons of enterprises should be held responsible for some of the reasons because they do not have sufficient motivation and pressure. The importance of the role of entrepreneur to an enterprise is thus clear! To achieve and enliven state-owned enterprises and develop the socialist market economy, we must cultivate a large number of outstanding entrepreneurs. 2. We should strengthen organizational leadership and deepen the discussions of the issue concerning entrepreneurs. The publication of Comrade Zhang Shire's [name as published] article drew attention from all fronts. Press units also organized the personages of all fronts to express opinions and hold discussions. Relevant departments under the provincial-level organs also thought out and explored ways for building up and cultivating an outstanding of entrepreneur rank. The question at present is how to further draw the attention of all fronts and to deepen the discussion of this issue. Our aim in supporting this discussion is to unify the understanding of the leaders at various levels and all social fronts, to promote the economic structural reform, to realize the target of building an economically powerful province, and to mobilize all fronts to pay attention to, support, cultivate, and build up a large number of outstanding entrepreneurs. To deepen this discussion, we should grasp the following few key points: A. The leaders at various levels and all fronts in society should define entrepreneurs's key positions and functions in enterprises and the market economy. This issue is not only a matter relating to entrepreneurs themselves as well as some government departments but also a matter that should be defined by the leaders at various levels and all fronts in society. B. Entrepreneurs themselves should further make efforts to upgrade their own quality to suit the new situation of the market economy. They must not remain satisfied with being plant directors and managers under the planned economic conditions any longer but should strive to be outstanding entrepreneurs fighting under the market economic system. C. Party committees, governments, people's congresses, and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference organizations, and all departments concerned should regard entrepreneurs as the most important factor of production factors, proceed from the development of productive forces, and mobilize all fronts to support, show concern about, protect, and cherish entrepreneurs. Governments should change their functions and delegate power to lower levels. Legislation and law enforcement departments should protect the legal rights and interests of entrepreneurs. All discussions, party committees, governments, and all departments should determine ways to support entrepreneurs. D. Organizational and personnel affairs departments should emancipate the mind, renew ideas, and reform the ways for management of enterprise cadres according to the new situation of the market economy. There are differences between enterprise cadres and the local party committee workers and government officers. Therefore, enterprises should carry out the competition mechanism in selecting and employing cadres. Entrepreneurs, as a production factor, should optimize reasonable distribution and organization according to the principle of market competition. E. How can the restructuring departments and the industrial and commercial management departments closely link the implementation of the modern enterprise system with the reform of the enterprise cadre management system in the course of reforming the enterprise system? They should select and employ outstanding entrepreneurs to promote the reform of the enterprise property right system and the setup of the modern enterprise system. Simultaneously, they should also be good at discovering and employing, through selection, outstanding entrepreneurs in the course of setting up the modern enterprise system. 3. According to the market's economic requirements, we should positively promote the reform of the enterprise cadre management system. The organizational and personnel affairs departments should attend to the following few principles in order to promote the reform of the enterprise cadre management system according to the requirements of the market economy. A. According to enterprises' different situations, organizational and personnel affairs departments should set forth different new ideas and methods for managing the cadres of enterprises of different categories. There are four different categories of enterprises as follows: The first category indicates the state-owned enterprises where systems have been reformed and the shareholding system is mainly carried out. The shareholding enterprises have four conditions. First, limited liability companies. The companies of this kind involve those with legal persons as their shareholders and those wholly funded by the state. Second, limited companies. The companies of this kind involve those with legal persons and staff members and workers as shareholders and those where fixed amounts of shares are sold to society by legal persons. The second category indicates the state-owned enterprises where systems have not been reformed yet and the contract system is being carried out. The third category indicates the urban collective enterprises whose cadres had been transferred by the governments for a long period of time in the past. The fourth category indicates the rural and urban collective enterprises where a considerable number of cadres are transferred by the town and township governments. Now, we are going to study the methods of managing the cadres of the enterprises of these four different categories and will set forth methods for selecting, recommending, and employing cadres for these enterprises according to the requirements of the market economy. B. To cultivate and nurture entrepreneurs, we should not only provide the necessary conditions for cultivation but also select the best and eliminate the worst through competition. Therefore, we must create an environment where entrepreneurs can compete with one another on equal terms. We should work out encouragement and restriction mechanisms and have the daring to give handsome awards and inflict heavy punishment so that a group of outstanding entrepreneurs will emerge and a group of incompetent enterprise responsible persons will be eliminated. Up until now, our enterprise cadres only promoted but never demoted anyone. Handsome awards could not be given to those who made contributions, and those who were incompetent could not be eliminated. Motivation and pressure was insufficient. Our state-owned enterprise leading cadres and entrepreneurs' quality is not lower than that of individual and private enterprise entrepreneurs, and the work of state-owned enterprise leading cadres and entrepreneurs is more difficult than that of individual and private enterprise entrepreneurs. Why does the state allow the entrepreneurs of private and individual enterprises to make larger amounts of money for themselves? Why are our state-owned enterprises not given proper remuneration from making larger amounts of profits and creating profits and taxes for the state? Heavy award means further mobilizing entrepreneurs' enthusiasm through material and honorary awards. On the other hand, if you make enterprises go bankrupt due to your incompetence, you will no longer be entitled to being a cadre or enjoying a good reputation in society. You will neither register yourselves to the industrial and commercial administrative departments within a set time nor be appointed as enterprise responsible persons by any enterprises. Awards must be handsome and penalties must be heavy. There must be such examples of courage and daring. The province as well as all localities should explore scientific and reasonable ideas and methods for handsome awards and heavy penalties. C. Entrepreneurs, as a production factor, should enter markets. Distribution needs to be reasonable and organization needs to be optimized. We should positively make preparations and set up entrepreneur markets. I hope that Tangshan and Shijiazhuang cities take the lead in this regard. We should formulate regulations and methods governing entrepreneur markets. D. We should proceed from the reality of the market economy to positively explore ways for management of enterprise cadres. First, there should be realistic requirements for entrepreneurs' ages and records of formal schooling. Second, we should popularize Tangshan's methods for recommending and appointing cadres by the organizational and personnel affairs departments. That is, recommend and appoint a cadre or a top leader for an enterprise. Third, the enterprises with conditions can carry out the method that enterprise party and government cadres "assume full responsibility." E. Entrepreneurs' associations, organizations of entrepreneurs themselves, should understand and reflect the voices of entrepreneurs and make efforts to protect the legal rights and interests of entrepreneurs. Simultaneously, these associations should play a positive role in upgrading entrepreneurs' quality and cultivating and nurturing entrepreneur ranks.
