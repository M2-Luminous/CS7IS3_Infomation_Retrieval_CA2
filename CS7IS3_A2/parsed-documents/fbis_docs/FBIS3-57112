When beginning the work of a newly elected organ, it is, of course, necessary to agree on a quorum. Views, naturally, differed. "Russia's Choice" insisted on a two-thirds quorum, and moreover demonstrated on the very first day that it intends to use the "right of the minority" to disrupt sittings. The other side proposed that the quorum be set at 50 percent of the deputies, as this will render the work of the Duma more stable regardless of the changing moods of deputies and factions. The majority of votes was cast in favor of the second option. The next question derives from the very same series: Which should be the base number to calculate the majority of votes required to adopt a decision? There would seem to be nothing to debate here -- the majority should be calculated on the basis of the number of deputies actually elected to the Duma (444 people). But there are those who, referring to the Constitution, demanded that six non-elected "dead souls" also be added to this. The discussion was so tricky that even "Russia's Choice" was split over it and failed to arrive at a unified opinion. But again, common sense prevailed -- the Duma finally voted to calculate the majority on the basis of the number of deputies actually elected. During the very first sittings, as if on a photographic plate, a polarization of the deputies' corps became evident. When one part of the hall applauds and rises to its feet, the other remains sullenly silent. And vice versa. It is somewhat disconcerting to see the entire right-wing sector of the hall react gleefully to inaccuracies and blunders, and rejoice when a decision is thwarted for whatever reasons. There is no "constructive collaboration" in that.... A parliament in which they do not have a guaranteed majority is no good to them. So from the outset the task has been to disrupt and to wreck. Future developments are easy to predict: After waiting a short while, the faithful hounds from the mass media will be let loose, and then the issue of dissolution "in view of the opposition to the president" will be raised everywhere. Basic decency has already been abandoned in the "democratic press" even today. The president is being urged to "demonstrate firmness" and to put pressure on parliament (it has to be assumed that hitherto he has demonstrated extreme lenience.) He is urged not to give the deputies apartments (let them live in a hotel for two years), and to restrict their travel opportunities. There is open rejoicing at the impotence of a parliament from which all premises have been confiscated and all backup services withdrawn. Matters are taken even further by Mr. Shumeyko, who, as the elected speaker of the Federation Council, at his first press conference declared a readiness to divide and isolate the State Duma in the event of "dire need": "It is possible to cooperate with those deputies of the Duma who are indeed concerned about the state, and adopt laws directly here." (That is, in the Federation Council, bypassing the State Duma.) It is no secret to Mr. Shumeyko that "this will be a certain violation of the Constitution." But if something is really wanted...it is even possible to violate the Constitution. So you see the type of authority which has been nurtured -- it will not be hampered by a mere Constitution [ni v odnu konstitutsiyu ne vlazit]! There is never a right time for disease and death. So it is that Ye. Gaydar chose not Saturday, and not Monday, but Sunday for his resignation announcement. Moreover, it is easy to understand why. Saturday was too early -- the "big chief" from Washington had not yet departed. And the composition of the new Cabinet of Ministers was expected to be announced Monday. After this, who needs your "resignation announcements"! Of course, the surprise announcement by the "father" of the Gaydar reforms, Mr. Ye. Gaydar, will generate, has indeed already generated, a mass of conjecture and commentary. But two assumptions are self-evident, and they can be expressed without fear of serious error. The first is that Ye. Gaydar "and Co." leave the government at a time when dense dark storm clouds are already gathering on the economic horizon. Now is the time to abandon the bridge of the unreliable government ship. At the same time, with the very same childish directness with which under Chernomyrdin they once swore "terrifying oaths" of loyalty to reforms, they bequeath the reforms to the government, having finally thrown the contents of the slops bucket over them. Second: Gaydar and his team are freeing their hands for the next presidential elections, at which they intend to emerge, like Aphrodite from the foaming sea, in all the radiance of untainted cleanliness: "Here we are, elect us!" But every cloud has a silver lining. It will be useful for Gaydar to sit on the opposition bench in order to experience the full measure of insolence and extreme contempt with which the government meets any proposals and initiatives emanating from parliament. He will rewarded according to his deeds. We will see what happens after that. Let us return to the parliamentary hall for a while. In the opening days, the issue of the type of ballot -- open or secret -- was the subject of fierce debate. Parliament's "democratic" part was all but foaming at the mouth in its attempts to prove that a secret ballot on any subject and as frequently as possible is a commitment to democracy, and the most important guarantee of the defense of the rights of the minority. It is funny. I have as yet been unable to forget the time, three years ago, when it was proven with equal fervor that the most important guarantee of minority rights is the roll-call ballot, whereas the secret ballot was exposed as anathema, as cowardice, as a desire to conceal one's position from voters. Which is why it was enshrined in Supreme Soviet standing orders that the roll-call ballot may be used at the behest of one-fifth of the deputies, but on no occasion can the secret ballot be resurrected. Why this U-turn? Least of all do I suspect my opponents of a lapse of memory or defective logic. If concepts are turned upside down, then it is probably for a reason. Maybe people are sick of publicity. And maybe there is some basis to the rumor that a "second key" has been fitted to the electronic ballot system, and that during a secret ballot (which by its very nature is impossible to verify) it brings about the required result.... It is exasperating to talk about this, but falsehood, deceit, and the desire to "sneak round the back" were brought into play from the very first days of parliamentary practice. It is normal and natural for people to adhere to different views. But can it be considered normal when an "extra" paragraph suddenly appears in an agreed document, and it just happens to be about a secret ballot at the behest of one-fifth of the deputies? When a respected professor and jurist known to the whole country, upon glimpsing into the hall, sees no raised hands, and hears no words of appeal addressed to him? And when there is a shortfall of just one vote to adopt the decision.... I cannot agree that politics is a dirty game. The dirt is brought into it by people -- through their conciliation, their lack of principle, their readiness to achieve aims by any means. In mainstream politics, the stakes are always high. It gives rise to a conflict of interests, frank and human passions, and it creates a very strong field of force, which masterfully arranges people along their invisible lines. In mainstream politics, there is always temptation -- the ceiling of legal and moral requirements is lowered a little, deceit is answered with deceit, meanness with meanness, lawlessness with even greater lawlessness. And it is easy to jump back and forth across the barrier, to achieve victory. Behind an easy victory follows the next phase -- "the final dash," when a subdued opponent is hunted down without any rules whatever. Then comes the celebration, the apotheosis of a victory which "will wipe the slate clean," burying the unsightly "details" beneath the waves of the general fever of the victors. Open baseness wears a mask of dignity, violence sets itself up as nobility, and falsehood preaches honesty. The phony carnival of an unjust victory.... Today, truth and honesty are on the side of the "left-wing" opposition. The sympathies and hopes of the honest, thinking, and feeling part of society turn to it. This is a great strength but also a great responsibility. These hopes must not be betrayed.
