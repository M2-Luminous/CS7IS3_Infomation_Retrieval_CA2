The government reaffirmed to seek the moderate step based on its perception that China's cooperation is indispensable for the UN Security Council to take effective measures against North Korea, and "North Korea's unclear issue has now become an issue, the resolution of which depends on China" (according to a Foreign Ministry source). The government, however, analyzes that the United States may seek a resolution imposing economic sanctions against North Korea in the UN Security Council out of irritation and disappointment with the recent situation. The government's judgment is that Japan has no choice but to enforce economic sanctions in concert with the United States if they are imposed. The government has sent Shunji Yanai, chief of the Foreign Policy Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, to Washington to attend emergency tripartite talks to be held by officials from Japan, the United States, and South Korea. During the talks, the officials will examine a draft of a resolution to be adopted by the UN Security Council and to be acceptable to China. Will the three nations seek a resolution criticizing North Korea in the UN Security Council or will they seek a resolution hinting at additional actions, including the imposition of economic sanctions against North Korea, in the UN Security Council? The three nations are likely to discuss details of concrete measures against North Korea while watching how China is moving. Japan-U.S. talks, U.S.-South Korea talks, and the Japan-U.S.-ROK tripartite talks are planned to be held. In addition to those talks, there is a high possibility that the three nations will hold their individual talks with China. Presently under study is Japan's proposal that special inspections should be conducted at two nuclear facilities that North Korea has yet to declare to the International Atomic Energy Agency in a bid to break the deadlock over the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. Administrative Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito, who returned home hurriedly on 2 June from his foreign trip, has met separately with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan, and Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the Policy Research Council of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. During the meetings, Saito said: "Japan plans to buy time by seeking a resolution criticizing North Korea. The United States may ask Japan to support its proposal for the economic sanctions against North Korea. I instructed Yanai, chief of the Foreign Policy Bureau, before he was sent to Washington to go along with the U.S. proposal if the U.S. side asks the Japanese side to support the proposal at the talks."
