The relevant authorities have therefore given Streams two weeks to leave the country. Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, speaker of the Transitional National Assembly, declared during a news conference yesterday that the British ambassador was behind the postponement of the archbishop of Canterbury's visit to Sudan. Mr. Khalifah said peaceful coexistence between religions and the good spirit prevailing between the Muslims and the Christians of Sudan constituted the motives for enemies to conspire and for intrigue to occur in an effort to shake up the stability being enjoyed by the people of Sudan. Meanwhile, Bishop Gabriel Rorech, minister of state at the Foreign Ministry, said the British ambassador was working to create distortions and differences between the government and the Episcopal Church in Sudan.
