The secularists in Egypt, for example, who reject the idea of a religious state, generalize: They do not differentiate between the Islamic groups that strive in God's path, with wisdom, spiritual counsel, conviction, and good example, and other groups that attack society for blasphemy and of pre-Islamic apostasy. [They fail to distinguish the danger of those] who call for individual interpretation of religion and the right to monopolize the propagation of Islam -- those who rush to establish Islamic law by violent means and even terrorism! Some secularists think there is an unwritten agreement between these groups--those who call for Islamic law by democratic and legitimate means and others who employ violence and terror. [They think] that each of the two groups is backing the other, and that whichever succeeds in attaining power first will necessarily and immediately proclaim the unification of the Islamic groups. All differences and conflicts between them would then disappear. The secularists who hold this opinion offer as proof their claim that various violent Islamic groups grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, founded by the late Shaykh Hasan al-Banna in the 1940s. They even accuse the Muslim Brotherhood of having hatched and nurtured persons who are easy for the violent Islamic groups to recruit. There is a regrettable meeting of minds between the secularists and the political-Islam groups who pursue democracy or violence in their call for social change. They both scorn the role of al-Azhar and its esteemed scholars, who have understood the sciences of religion through study and the attainment of qualifications, who pursue the propagation of the faith, religious counseling, and reasoning. The secularists for their part reject al-Azhar and its scholars whenever they try to correct mistaken ideas, in their preaching, writing, and intellectual achievements, as recently happened in the case of the television series ["The Family"] that tried to portray the phenomenon of terrorism without any familiarity with Islamic thinking or with the principles of worship and the proportionalities of reward and punishment for one's deeds. This sparked a dispute and all kinds of excesses by the secularists authors in response to the statement issued by His Excellency the Shaykh of al-Azhar in "The Family" series. One author, Wahid Hamid, even denied that Islam provides any clear pronouncement or allusion about what awaits a deceased person, who had been a heretic in this life, in terms of judgement and punishment in the grave. And there was the statement issued by the Supreme Council on Islamic Affairs, which defended the right of religious scholars and their role in combatting the excesses and errors in views of Islam, and in monitoring the literary and artistic works that exploit the climate of democratic freedoms, and distort Islam, the latest of the divinely revealed religions, which is valid and applicable at any time and in any place. Meanwhile, the general message of the political-Islam groups is that they reject al-Azhar and the clerics of the Islamic Council, the Dar al-Ifta' [office of the mufti], and the society of preachers and those of the Ministry of Awqaf, claiming that they represent or express government Islam, and justify or are silent regarding government abuses. Islam, they say, does not recognize a clerical class; it is thus the right of every Muslim to deduce his own interpretation of the faith in his own best interests and the interests of other Muslims, even should that lead them to prey on society! It is amazing that a writer such as Tharwat Abazah, the vice-president of the Consultative Council, in an article printed in AL-AHRAM newspaper last week, entitled "Art is Integrity," accused factions of the national left--Nasirites and communists--of being, in his words, "infidels." What can the violent and extremist groups, who accuse society of blasphemy and apostasy, do with them, after seeing a secularist declare them to be infidels, except assassinate them, in accordance with the sentence that they claim is their right? When a great Islamic thinker such as Fahmi Huwaydi resisted this dangerous distortion of Islam, and called for Muslims to unite their visions and efforts to confront the dangers facing the Islamic nation, we received, at AL-SHARQ's Cairo office, dozens of telephone calls from people demanding that we supply them with the last two articles AL-SHARQ printed after their publication in other newspapers had been prevented! Why all this distortion, clamor, and conflict over Islam now among Muslims in Egypt, secularists, fundamentalists, traditionalists, and moderates? Why did this not happen during the monarchial era, or at the peak of the July Revolution and the leadership of Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir? Perhaps because, in the days of the monarchy, the various classes and factions of the people had joined the political parties that expressed their aspirations and interests, and because the central national issue was embodied in the concept and the practices of all the popular forces on the achievement of independence and liberation from colonialism. Even the Muslim Brotherhood, which represented the Islamic political opposition to the existing regime, did not resort to accusing society of blasphemy and ignorance. They occupied themslves with Islamic education, and its mass expansion throughout Egypt, in the hopes of establishing an Islamic state through democratic means. Thus the Muslim Brotherhood fought side by side with the Egyptian army in the Palestine war, and cooperated with the secret Free Officers organization in launching a war of nerves against the British occupation all along the Suez Canal. This was despite the fact that the Muslim Brotherhood undertook, after the martyrdom of Shaykh Hasan al-Banna, and the leadership of Counselor Hasan al-Hudaybi, to announce its hostility toward the July Revolution, to the point of trying to assassinate Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir and overthrow the regime by force in 1954 and 1965. The revolution's national achievements and development projects surpassed the other parties in terms of establishing foundations of social justice; it thus pulled the rug out from under their feet, and crushed their former members' mass role, influence, and skirting of the revolution. In Islamic terms, Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir was from the very beginning keen on the Islamic sphere, its thinking and strategic inclinations, side by side with the Arab, African, and nonaligned spheres. He extended his hand to support and aid the liberation of Islamic peoples from colonialism and backwardness. In its time, the Islamic renewal saw the rise of the Supreme Council on Islamic Affairs, which revived the Islamic heritage and printed thousands of Islamic publications and books. It had a plan to develop al-Azhar to graduate thousands of qualified doctors, engineers, and religious scholars to undertake the propagation of Islam throughout the world, in the languages of all its peoples. It established Holy Koran Radio. We therefore believe that the early beginnings of Islamic extremism in Egypt were attributable to Anwar al-Sadat, may he rest in peace. He was the first to use them, in a Machiavellian fashion, to fight his Nasirite and communist enemies. It is he who supported them with money and violent means, as his close aides have attested. Then they turned against him and became his deadly enemies when he visited Jerusalem and signed a separate peace with Israel at Camp David, and he was assassinated by Islamists, setting off a wave of terror. The picture is different today; the details are less distinct, in light of the government's failure to meet society's minimum aspirations. It is true that there are great achievements, and they keep coming, but they cannot deal with the problems, which also keep coming, and grow ever more serious. In the absence of a national plan, and frustrations on the Arab scene, the climate is ripe for the fragmentation of intellectual and ideological unity into scattered, conflicting, and struggling pieces. Meanwhile, political parties are merely skeletons, or just newspapers or words, incapable of influencing the government or the masses. Thus we, and the people of Egypt, rely on the glimmer of hope emitted by the anticipated national dialogue, which may limit, or solve, the problems of intellectual poverty in general, and the resulting distortion of Islam in particular. Perhaps the first conditions for success and credibility of the national dialogue lie in the trust and participation of every person who has a vision for Egypt's change for the better, individually or collectively, without disqualifying any, according to the standard of democracy and political and popular balance.
