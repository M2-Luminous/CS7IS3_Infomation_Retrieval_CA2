In Moscow the President of Kazakhstan Left More Than Just His Signature on 23 Kazakhstani-Russian Documents"] [Text] After taking his leave of Boris Yeltsin, Nursultan Nazarbayev visited the mayor of Moscow and Moscow State University in turn. Quite frankly, he amazed the Moscow public. Only not so much with the essence of what he said as with his shrewdness: Nursultan Abishevich said something which recently has been actively preying on the minds of politicians in a considerable part of the post-Soviet area. This is the idea of uniting it in a Eurasian Union [EAU]. "I believe," the president said at a reception in the capital's City Hall, "that it is necessary to disband the association within the CIS framework because it does not work." He went on to expound his views on the EAU. He believes that it is necessary to form supranational working organs to coordinate economic, defense, and foreign policies. The union must have a common parliament. This is to make it possible to bring together the laws of the states in the union. The EAU needs an interstate executive secretariat appointed by the heads of state and common citizenship registered in a single passport. Even the currency could be common and supranational -- like the European ECU.... Nursultan Nazarbayev concluded as follows: "We must take this step, and our children would continue strengthening this union." In my view this idea needs least of all epithets like "new," "fresh," and "unexpected." I believe that epithets such as "sensible" and "realistic" suit it better. If you look at the abbreviation EAU, you perceive something familiar.... Well, of course, the European Union! But you certainly cannot suspect the Europeans of being rash and indulging in state romanticism -- it took them decades to arrive at their community. They surmounted difficult obstacles, which we have written about in different ways at different times -- ten years ago with playful skepticism, now with interested surprise and maybe even envy. Well I never: ...They are uniting while we are scattering. The bitter taste as a result of this, I believe, burns the souls of many people in the former Soviet republics. It is offensive to see Europeans chuckling about it. I do not doubt that many people in Ukraine feel this burning sensation. The recent elections have made them feel it. They feel it in Moldavia [Moldova], where the new parliament has now begun working. Belorussia [Belarus] has also demonstrated this, with its firm desire for economic union. How will others respond to this? We shall see. But if we are or, at least, want to be realists, the EAU is a vital idea. From all viewpoints: historical, economic, military, not to mention geopolitical.... In this part of the globe, where mankind is accustomed to seeing a unified state, we must not procreate dozens of weak formations at odds with each other. Of course, some people will see an image of the old empire. But it is perfectly within our power to create a union on totally new principles, without the former imperial aroma. So let us thank Nursultan Nazarbayev for his political telepathy: He has perceived in time and given voice to the mental impulses of many of us. I would like to think that Nazarbayev's idea was not announced in Moscow without the Russian president's knowledge. I want to believe it.
