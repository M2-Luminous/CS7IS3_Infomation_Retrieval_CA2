China's grasslands are not only extensive, but they are widespread, stretching from 310 to 610 longitude. China's grasslands are divided into 17 major types, over 30 subtypes, and over 1,000 specific varieties where more than 7,000 species of natural pasture grasses and feed plants grow. Within China's 21,000-kilometer borderline, 14,000 are on grasslands. Most of these grasslands are on the frontier in remote areas where diverse minority peoples live, and much of it ancient and poor. The protection, practical utilization, and development of grassland resources are not only of strategic economic importance, but also of strategic importance for strengthening the solidarity of the people, turning poverty into riches, strengthening border defenses, administering the national territory, and protecting and improving the ecological environment. 1.113 billion mu of China's 6 billion mu of grasslands are southern mountain grasslands or grazing lands, and in the north there are 378 million mu of grasslands, more than half of which, on average, are not in use. About 400 million mu of grazing lands are arid or summertime pasturage not yet fully developed for use, and over 1 billion more are depleted grassland that need to be renewed to greatly raise their level of productivity. Although the utilization of China's grasslands is presently in a period of transition in the level of productivity and method of management and utilization, moving away from the natural grazing stage to one of intensified management, they are still largely being plundered by the old style of grazing. Grassland resources have not been used to their fullest advantage and have not yet reached full production potential, and their present level of production is very low. In 1989, livestock production per 100 mu of grassland was one-twentieth of that of the U.S., one-tenth that of Austria, and one-eightieth that of New Zealand. The low productivity of China's grasslands does not arise from lack of actual natural resources, but from historical social and circumstantial causes, mainly: 1. Poor, unconstructive and backward management of grasslands for pasturage has caused grasslands to recede markedly. Grassland laws and protective controls are weak, and more than 100 million mu of grassland has been destroyed through exploitation in recent decades. Grassland management has for a long time been a practice of "eating from the big pot", and the management, construction, and utilization rights, responsibilities and benefits have not been driven home to the people, and that's why there has been an increase in over-grazing. Grasslands have been simply used and not replenished for a long time, and for decades, for every yuan of annual output from every mu of grassland, only 2 or 3 fen have been re-invested. Being unable to make ends meet has led to predatory management and relentless disappearance of grasslands which have turned to sand and salt, causing the depletion of over 1 billion mu of grassland. Grass production is down to two-thirds or one-half of what it was in the 1950's, hastening the loss of grasslands and wetlands, and increasing the hazards of sandstorms and pestilence. 2. Although the water and temperature conditions of mountain grasslands and grazing areas in the south are good, traditional farming mentality hinders the advance of efficient grass and pasturing technology and methodologies, and progress has been made in only a few places, while in most areas resources are still being wasted. In many places grass on mountain slopes has been removed to plant cereal crops, causing loss of wetlands, ecological damage, and bringing poverty to the mountain and the people, or creating a situation comparable to going begging with a gold cup. 3. Damage caused by mixed farming and grazing of mountain grasslands and grazing areas in the north has been serious. Although conditions are good for grasses and excellent for mixed farming and grazing, the attitude of favoring farming over grazing, and using grasslands for cereal crops has been detrimental to the development of grasslands, such as on the Sanjiang plain, the loess plateau, and the Huanghai coastal grasslands where the land has been turned to sand and salt, the ecological environment has been damaged, and use of grassland resources has been counter-productive. A national program for the development of grassland has been formulated to improve grasslands in order to meet the demand for wool, milk, beef and mutton, the needs for economic development of grassland areas and management of the national territory. A policy for a ten-year goal for grassland development has been formulated to integrate key-point development with overall administration, construction and management, and to make full use of the advantages in the north and south. Along with enforcement of national grassland laws and a compensatory contract responsibility system, and nationwide administration for development of vanishing grasslands, good grazing stock processing facilities should be built and commercial grazing stock product bases should be created in key development areas, in the northern mountain grassland and grazing locations, and in southern mountain grassland and grazing areas. Key projects should be implemented to build livestock feeding and shelter facilities on grasslands, meat and hides projects on northern grasslands, projects to emulate New Zealand on southern grasslands, green-light projects to control the depletion of grasslands, and other capital construction projects in grassland areas. The following development policies must be adopted to realize the above targets: 1. Put more effort into publicizing "grassland laws", enact better grassland laws and perfect the legal system as soon as possible, set up stronger enforcement organizations, raise the quality of law-enforcement units, resolve and eradicate grassland destruction, put a time limit on effecting property and utility rights, and credentials, put the compensatory responsibility system into full force, put teeth into grassland protection, ensure practical use and effective construction of grasslands. 2. Development and utilization of grassland resources should be brought into capital construction planning and financial business development plans to guarantee a steady input and supply of materials; 3. Nationally and locally financed grassland development foundation systems should be set up, mainly through financial outlays or land occupation and utilization taxes, grassland resource management fees, pasturage taxes, slaughterhouse taxes, part of which should be used for development of grassland resources. These foundations could be used for repayments, and managed by livestock (grassland) handling departments, and supervised and checked by financial departments; 4. Grassland resource administrative organizations should be strengthened. Among China's 6 major resources, grasslands occupy the largest area, but there is only one office-level (grassland office) unit with management responsibility, which, as the socialist market economy develops, will become unsuitable for handling the development and utilization of grassland resources. China must setup competent management organizations for effective macro-controls, supervision, and inspection of grassland resources.
