Britain's THE SUNDAY TIMES, for example, forecasts not only Ukraine's economic collapse, but a war between it and Russia. "If the crisis continues," the newspaper writes, "the majority of the Russians in Ukraine will choose the path of unification with Russia. This will provoke a civil war." TRUD's correspondent asked Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Leonidovich Zvyahilskyy to comment on this and other similar forecasts. [Zvyahilskyy] These are the ravings of a madman. Clearly, some people would very much like our relations to develop according to that kind of scenario, but no one is going to get us to fall out. Close, equitable ties with Russia were and remain our main policy priority. Russia is our biggest economic partner. We have historical, cultural, and linguistic connections. There are 12 million Russians living in our country. Ukraine is a major partner of Russia's. The Ukrainian market is equal to one-third of the Russian market. Major lines of communication to Europe and the Black Sea area run through our country. The economies of the Russian oblasts bordering us are the most stable because they maintain direct economic links with Ukrainian enterprises, and, you know, tens of millions of people live in those oblasts. In short, a strong and stable Ukraine is in the interests of Russia and its people. We should always live in peace and friendship. But there is no point in adhering to the principle that one's own interests are what count and everyone else's must fit in with "big brother's." I am sure that's how it will be when politics stop dominating economics and commonsense. It can be said that we are already en route to that today. We are boldly developing bilateral relations and are setting up joint ventures. We should eliminate more quickly the problem of nonpayments and obtain the opportunity to pay in a normal way for the raw materials and commodities of both Russian and our own enterprises. Nonpayments is a common ill, and we have to cure it together, and not by relying on some benefactor to endlessly provide nonrepayable loans. [Prokopchuk] You are thinking of supplies of Russian gas? [Zvyahilskyy] I cannot fault Russia at all here. We ourselves are to blame for the temporary halt in gas supplies. Russia provides us with 140 million cubic meters of gas a day. But there were several days when we were taking 180 million a day, thereby reducing the pressure in the export gas pipelines. Who is going to put up with that kind of presumptuousness. That is why my deputy, V. Landik, flew to Moscow and guaranteed Gazprom that we would not allow such outrageous behavior in future. [Prokopchuk] Is it true that the Russian joint-stock company Gazprom is demanding that the main gas pipelines and the underground gas reservoirs be transferred to it to make up the arrears? [Zvyahilskyy] That is idle speculation. Different terms were proposed: Namely, that a controlling block of shares be given to Gazprom during the flotation of the Ukrainian gas transportation enterprises and gas refineries. But we will not accept that. We propose something else -- flotation with the participation of Russian capital. But Ukraine will retain the controlling block of shares here. We are now preparing documents on yet another issue on which it is time we reached agreement. This involves the so-called "zero option" division of the former USSR's debts and property. Russia has repeatedly asked us to agree this option, saying that no one is to owe anyone anything, while the huge amount of former Soviet property belongs in its entirety to Russia. We insist that Ukraine has its own share of this foreign property. We have agreed to pay the appropriate proportion of the former debts to it. We are preparing a letter to the Russian Government. [Prokopchuk] Property is a good thing. But you will agree that you will have to wait a long time for it to yield a profit, while the situation in the country is already explosive. Half the population lives below the poverty line and millions are unable to buy the necessities of life. Are there any hopes today of a better outcome, of stabilization? [Zvyahilskyy] Our predecessors pinned their hopes on foreign loans. No one gave us any, and we can see that they are not a panacea. Hopes pinned on the possibility of rapid integration within the European economy and help from Ukrainians abroad were likewise dashed. Our government, headed by the president, relies solely on its own devices and possibilities. Unfortunately, serious mistakes in both the strategy and tactics of reform have been made in the last two years. As a result last year alone prices increased 100-fold while wages went up 50-fold. In what kind of normal state could you increase the return on fuel oil to 5,000 percent while raising the payment of bank loans to 320-percent interest per annum? This is not an expose of things done in the past, they represent inescapable facts of the present day. [Prokopchuk] The cabinet headed by the president has been in office five months. Has it managed to achieve anything? [Zvyahilskiy] Although the economic position in the country is difficult, the first signs of stabilization have nevertheless already emerged. The inflation rate did not exceed 20 percent in January-February, which is 4.5-times less than last December. Prices for the most important foodstuffs are not going up. Prices for sugar, butter, and vodka are actually going down. The rate of exchange of the karbovanets against the Russian ruble and the U.S. dolar has stabilized. It has not changed since January. I understand the sowing campaign is proceeding normally. We have settled our debts with the countryside and the numerous enterprises which sent their products to CIS countries last year under a clearing agreement. We are abandoning that this year. Accounts will be kept only in rubles or freely convertible currency. Prices for the next crop of wheat, sugarbeet, and sunflower have been fixed, as have prices for petroleum products, fertilizers, and plant protection agents. We will be granting credits for the sowing and harvesting campaigns solely in the form of goods, not money, because monetary credits, regardless of control, have vanished God knows where via the commercial banks. [Prokopchuk] Credits were surreptitiously converted into dollars and landed in foreign banks. Will you be able to get the money repatriated? [Zvyahilskyy] Only credits worth 8.6 trillion karbovantsi have been returned. Some $30 million for products sold last year under state contracts have not been. That is without taking account of what disappeared via commercial structures. Henceforth, we are introducing flexible currency regulation; we want to achieve through this a real correlation of prices for basic kinds of foodstuffs here and among our main business partners. We intend to determine precisely in terms of kinds of produce that proportion of the currency which must be sold to the state without fail. A plan to improve tax legislation hass been outlined; it will be geared toward the interest of manufacturers rather than traders. All these measures should resolve the chief problem -- that of ensuring the prompt repatriation of hard-currency export earnings. A number of decisions were made recently to that end. Under those decisions, all currency will pass solely through one state bank. Top managers are trying to torpedo this decision, but we are standing firm -- no licences or quotas will be issued unless accounts are opened in the Ukreksimbank and agreement is obtained for all export-import transactions to be serviced by that bank. That will enable us to establish control over currency transactions and introduce a system of liability for the repayment of credits. I think that if we instil order in this sphere we will have the wherewithal to pay for fuel supplies from Russia. I should talk, in particular, about our debts for gas. The government has instructed the main gas consumers -- the Ministry of Industry with its chemical and metallurgical concerns, and the Ministry of Machine Building Industry -- to pay for it in rubles or freely convertible currency, only on a prepayment basis. This arrangement will also be introduced for other consumers. The state will pay only for gas intended for municipal and domestic needs. Today we are caused many problems by the fact that karbovantsi, rubles, and dollars circulate in parallel within the country. We think that the state should have only one national currency -- the karbovanets. This will above all raise its exchange rate to a normal level and block off ways of deliberately padding the dollar exchange rate. If we want to block off the channel for currency speculation only the National Bank and its branches should, in my opinion, buy and sell currency. [Prokopchuk] You have set your sights on what is the most profitable business for commercial structures.... [Zvyahilskyy] I am under strong pressure for that reason. Sometimes government decisions are blocked. We issue someone currency, and it takes 15-20 days to reach the recipient. It is daylight robbery. We are trying to do something, but there is so much to do. I can see that it is time to put a stop to the anarchy and total licence for which Ukraine was "famous" in 1992-93. [Prokopchuk] But the enormous apparatus of the cabinet comes under you. [Zvyahilskyy] I do not know what will happen after the election of the new parliament, but I am sure that the cabinet needs to be restructured. It is clear that there will be structural and cadre changes in it. I have been able to see during my five months that the apparatus is not overburdened with people willing to give their all in the defense of state interests. A program has been adopted to make considerable cuts in the strength of the administrative-managerial apparatus at both central and local level. Incidentally, the first stage in the cutting of the Army's strength by 92,000 will also start this year. In short, I am sure that these and other measures -- privatization and the restructuring of our energy-intensive industry -- will clear up the lamentable consequences of the "Ukrainianization of the economy" of past years. As far as the forecasts of Ukraine's "collapse" are concerned, they will not materialize. Our country has huge potential reserves. And we, I am sure, like our friendly neighbor, Russia, will be able to tap them for the good of our people.
