However, many of the ANC supporters who turned up at King Zwelithini Stadium in the township north of Durban remained behind to watch police and peace monitors trying to persuade IFP supporters to leave the stadium. Those remaining were still demanding the stadium be vacated. Police were negotiating with them also. Earlier, an IFP supporter was stabbed to death and his vehicle set alight after he allegedly shot at ANC supporters outside the stadium. Transkei military ruler Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa, top ANC official Mr Thabo Mbeki and five other ANC officials were kept waiting while new arrangements for the rally were made. ANC supporters were earlier teargassed by police, according to a radio report.
