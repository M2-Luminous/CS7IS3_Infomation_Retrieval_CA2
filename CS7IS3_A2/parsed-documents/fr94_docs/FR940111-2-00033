FR940111-2-00033 FR940111-2-00017 Adequacy of the Ability To Recover Penalties The State has shown that legal mechanisms exist for exacting penalties tied to permitted and unpermitted facilities which fail to comply with SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;44, &hyph;45, and &hyph;46. The authorities used are not specifically based on a violation of these statutes. However, they do provide for 'civil penalties to be recoverable' for refusal to allow or carry out inspection, entry or monitoring activities, which is what 40 CFR 123.27(a)(3)(i) requires. The situation in Freeman v. South Dakota does not apply to the State's authority to collect penalties for refusals to allow the state to inspect potential water pollution violations. In that case, State inspectors had summarily terminated a campground's license because the campground's operator would not allow the state to inspect without a warrant. In Freeman , civil rights were violated because the State inspectors lacked statutory enforcement authority. In the Case of South Dakota NPDES, SDDENR does have adequate statutory authority to issue administrative orders. The South Dakota Attorney General has stated South Dakota has adequate statutory authority to implement the program described. Calculation of Penalties Ignorance of the law is not an argument for deferring penalties. The regulated community is notified through public notice of the requirements for permits, right of entry, etc. It is their responsibility to be aware of these requirements and be accountable for them from the time the requirements become effective. EPA agrees that the penalty for failure to have a permit might be more severe than for a failure to keep records by itself. However, both requirements are normally available to the regulator in taking enforcement actions. The existence of a penalty for a discharge without a permit does not, by itself, offset the need for a mechanism to collect penalties for failure to allow or carry out inspection, entry or monitoring requirements. As noted earlier, such a mechanism exists. Regarding the date at which a violation begins, the State has asserted that administrative orders or search warrants could be issued within one or two days. Therefore, the number of days of violation used to calculate penalties for unpermitted facilities would be almost the same as for permitted facilities. In cases where a discharge causes pollution of any waters of the state, the penalty can be calculated for each day the discharge occurred as a violation of 34A&hyph;2&hyph;21, subject to a ยง34A&hyph;2&hyph;75 order. The number of days of violation is just one factor applied in calculating penalties. The small difference in the number of days of violation between permitted and unpermitted facilities could be offset by the presence of other factors in calculating and negotiating the final penalty (e.g. the existence of another violation -discharge without a permit). Therefore, the immediate revision of SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;44, &hyph;45, and &hyph;46 is not required. However, EPA does consider such revisions desirable, so that the State would have more direct remedies for these violations. It should also be noted that EPA, in its oversight role, can take enforcement action. Typically, EPA would send to the State a Notice of Violation and give the State 30 days to take action. If the State were not to take sufficient action, including not collecting a large enough penalty, EPA could file an order and collect penalties from the date the violations started. Citizen suits are also a means to assure appropriate penalties are collected. Conclusion EPA finds that the penalty authority and process for collecting penalties is adequate and serves as a protection against noncompliance with water pollution control law, rules, and permits. EPA's oversight role offers a second level of protection. A third level of protection is offered by related statutes, such as prohibiting discharges which may cause or cause pollution of waters of the state (see 34A&hyph;2&hyph;21), prohibiting discharge of waste or pollutants without a permit (see 34A&hyph;2&hyph;36), and prohibiting reduction of existing water quality (see 34A&hyph;2&hyph;22). Therefore, the DENR NPDES program adequately meets the requirements for recovering penalties. III. Citizen Intervention EPA's September 1, 1993 Federal Register and August 27, 1993 newspaper notices requested public comment on South Dakota's statutory procedure for citizen intervention in administrative enforcement actions, as required by 40 CFR 123.27(d). South Dakota has certified that it allows intervention as of right in administrative enforcement actions pursuant to SDCL Sec. 34A&hyph;10&hyph;2. It has indicated that Sec. 34A&hyph;10&hyph;2, considered alone, appears to grant merely ``permissive intervention''; that is, intervention if no other party objects). However, South Dakota has also certified that if a citizen is denied intervenor status in an administrative case, he may file a lawsuit in circuit court to have the court order him to be named as a party in the administrative proceeding, pursuant to Sec. 34A&hyph;10&hyph;5. Because of the possibility for such a circuit court proceeding, South Dakota's Attorney General construes SDCL 34A&hyph;10&hyph;2 to allow mandatory intervention in administrative procedures. The Memorandum of Agreement, a document signed both by the State of South Dakota and the EPA, states that the SDDENR will allow intervention as of right in civil proceedings to at least the same extent required by 40 CFR 123.27(d)(1) and shall not oppose intervention in administrative proceedings as provided by ยง34A&hyph;10&hyph;2. A. Comments Favoring Existing Intervention Procedure Members of the regulated community commented that the statutory procedure afforded citizens an adequate right of intervention. One specific comment, made by a member of the regulated community, was that the State assurance in the MOA makes the citizen right to intervention mandatory. This commenter also noted that the Attorney General Statement interprets SDCL 34A&hyph;10&hyph;2 to mean that the citizen's right to intervene is mandatory.
