'Awn, who was talking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT from his residence in La Hutte Maison in the outskirts of Paris, said: "I hope that what I am saying will not be interpreted as appeasement." 'Awn added: "I do not agree to talk to the Lebanese regime. I prefer to talk to the party directly responsible on the ground. That party should, before the dialogue starts, make a number of commitments on two main issues, namely sovereignty and independence." 'Awn believes that "a practical demonstration of these two issues can be made by scheduling withdrawal of the Syrian Army from all Lebanese territory." He described the claims made every now and then about attempts to open a dialogue with him as mere maneuvers. He added that "serious dialogue cannot be done through the press." 'Awn asked: "What has become of the investigation into the crime of blowing up Sayyidat al-Najah church?" He said that that case should be urgently dealt with because "it is a special case, independent of any other case." He said that "that incident was fabricated and opened the way to other crimes."
