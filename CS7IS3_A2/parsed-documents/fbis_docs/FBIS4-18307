Tell me, do you really believe in the possibility of reviving the center? [Buttiglione] I believe that the line set out by [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Mino Martinazzoli is basically correct. [Caprara] What does "basically" mean? [Buttiglione] That the way in which we have implemented it has proved inadequate. We did not succeed in making the country understand it. [Caprara] What is your interpretation of that line? [Buttiglione] In a democracy in which rotation occurs, there is normally a left-wing force and a center force. The Right is smaller. We began amid a strong anti-DC [Christian Democratic Party] tide that disqualified the center. There was Bribe City, and for too long the center has been an entity without ideas. An entity for joint administration, chiefly with the Left. However,... [Caprara] However, what? [Buttiglione] ...however, we should have laid the foundations for a major center force that would have the Left as its antagonist. Because of our own shortcomings, the center vote was swallowed up by the Right. [Caprara] Are those all the faults? [Buttiglione] We committed a serious fault in the past by failing to expel certain crooks promptly. [Caprara] Could you name some names? [Buttiglione] A number of crooks. [Caprara] Where does Martinazzoli stand in this analysis? [Buttiglione] He made a major contribution, especially in the final stage of the election campaign. But evidently it was insufficient. [Caprara] Pardon me, Mr. Buttiglione, but are you mourning the DC now that it is dead? Some of its adversaries are doing so. [Buttiglione] I was never a member of the DC, though I always voted for it. Be that as it may, the verdict of historians will be different from that given by the newspapers now. The DC guaranteed the country the longest period of peace in its history, a certain level of development, and great tolerance. I think that some of the anti-DC sectarianism is ungenerous. [Caprara] If often comes from former Christian Democrats. [Buttiglione] Yes. The turncoats are asserting themselves by stabbing their brother in the back. [Caprara] After Martinazzoli's resignation, you said that you feel more isolated. Are you looking for new friends? [Buttiglione] Friendships are built by means of an exchange of views on history and by establishing ideological common ground on the basis of this exchange. I hope that history will enable us to find many friends. [Caprara] Berlusconi maintains that while the PPI asserts Christian values, your program embodies "the same emphases" and that some of the Pact's proposals are "the same" as some of Forza Italia's. Do you agree? [Buttiglione] Certainly, and I am pleased. Martinazzoli used to point out, in order to curb my academic enthusiasm for ideology, that although programs are important in politics, so too are the individuals and the forces that advocate them. We will discover through legislative activity whether points of contact exist. [Caprara] The PPI's Forleo says that you will take care of providing Berlusconi with a majority in the Senate. [Buttiglione] I have heard some rumors that I am supposedly jumping on the Forza Italia bandwagon. Many people have also asked me to do so, and I am grateful for their esteem. But I have always had an irresistible love for lost causes. I would find it difficult to jump on the victor's bandwagon. [Caprara] The Left of your party is not afraid of your leaving. It is afraid of your taking the party with you. [Buttiglione] We must not jump on the victor's bandwagon. I believe we must stay in opposition for a while. [Caprara] Precisely: They are afraid that you will hang on to them until the congress. Then, everyone over to Berlusconi. [Buttiglione] No, so that it becomes obvious that this Right is incapable of governing. It must be broken up by shifting some parts of it to the center. Meanwhile, we must build the party. This means bringing together many people who are bound by a common ideal and who trust each other. [Caprara] That is a wonderful picture. It is a shame that the PPI is at present the opposite of that -- not many people, and almost nobody who trusts anyone else. [Buttiglione] I agree with you. But the renewal could not have been carried out properly under the blows of an aggression and with such frequent elections. Keep in mind that if someone embraces a lost cause it is because he is convinced that it can prove victorious. [Caprara] Immediately after Martinazzoli's resignation, Rosa Russo Jervolino said that she tried to contact Martinazzoli but that she did not manage to speak with him. Did you try to contact him? [Buttiglione] That is my own affair, if I may be permitted to say so. Politics must be transparent, but everyone has the right to a private sphere of personal relations. [Caprara] I did not consider that an embarrassing question. Be that as its may, yours is a political reply. In his farewell message Martinazzoli described the MSI [Italian Social Movement] Right as "encumbered by the burden of its origins and its ideology." Do you consider that an intolerable burden? [Buttiglione] [National Alliance leader] Fini made a good decision when he decided to dissolve the fascists. And he made a mistake when he failed to do so. This, perhaps because he achieved good results in the municipal elections. My friend, Fisichella, and many other National Alliance voters are not fascists. But it is others who are in charge of the MSI. Real changes are painful and entail a certain residue being left out. [Caprara] Could [former President] Cossiga have a role to play in a party such as the PPI, which cites Catholic principles and which some people consider liberal? [Buttiglione] I think that he has carved out a different role for himself. It is partly an institutional or semi-institutional role, as a resource to turn to at times of crisis. I am not talking about a party but about the entire democratic system.
