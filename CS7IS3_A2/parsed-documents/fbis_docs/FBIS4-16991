Government staff received representatives of the association and a constructive conversation took place between them -- the students were promised that the unpaid stipend owed them will be paid and measures will be taken to prevent such a thing happening in the future. Apart from this, the student leaders agreed to meet with Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov. After this the student pickets were withdrawn. But representatives of political organizations which use any opportunity for self-advertisement remained in the area by the White House. After the picket was over, they organized themselves into a column and set off for Novyy Arbat, where they clashed with the militia. The RATUOS press and information center put out a statement from the chairman of its governing body, O. Denisov, expressing regret about the participation of several students in the unauthorized march but placing most of the blame for what happened on representatives of extremist organizations which used the students' nonpolitical event for their own purposes.
