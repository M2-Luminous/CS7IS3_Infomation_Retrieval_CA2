At 2040 [1740 GMT], the spiteful, secessionist gang fired a missile at a densely-populated residential area in Sanaa, inflicting large losses on the citizens and their houses and property. These losses have not yet been counted. This cowardly and treacherous action reveals the black, hidden grudge this criminal gang harbors against the sons of our people, who, along with the heroes of our brave Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy, are valiantly and firmly confronting and foiling their criminal secessionist scheme against the homeland and its unity and democratic march. The source stressed that the cowardly criminals will not escape punishment and both the people and the Armed Forces will inflict just punishment on them.
