After the talks, correspondents of foreign television stations overwhelmed President Karadzic with questions about threats of air strikes. Let us hear how Dr. Karadzic answered: [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Please comment on the statement by French Foreign Minister Juppe that he will demand an ultimatum for the Serbs, 10 days to withdraw 20 [words indistinct]. [Karadzic] Minister Juppe should ask [Austrian Foreign] Minister Mock about the fate of the Austrian ultimatum in 1914. [Unidentified correspondent, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] Will you withdraw your artillery from the positions around Sarajevo? [Karadzic, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] Immediately, as soon as we sign the peace plan. [Unidentified correspondent, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] The NATO secretary general today said that it was high time to do something in Bosnia. How would you comment on this? [Karadzic, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] Well, had they taken no actions in the former Yugoslavia, it would not have disintegrated. I would love it if they would not meddle into our affairs at all, because, it is precisely they who have caused this war. [Unidentified correspondent, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] What will happen if the NATO Council issues an ultimatum to the Serbs to withdraw from their positions around Sarajevo? [Karadzic, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] How can we withdraw from Sarajevo? Sarajevo is not a surrounded town, but a divided town. We hold half of the town. If somebody is asking us to give up our own town, then no, never, out of the question. [Unidentified correspondent, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] Do you believe in air strikes, Mr. Karadzic? [Karadzic, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] I believe in God. [end recording]
