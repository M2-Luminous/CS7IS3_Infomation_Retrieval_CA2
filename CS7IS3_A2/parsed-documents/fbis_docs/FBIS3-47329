Commenting on their remarks at a news conference on 10 January, Gaishi Hiraiwa, president of Keidanren [Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan], said: "While a strong yen will delay Japan's economic recovery, a weak yen will end the current asset deflation and strong yen-caused deflation. I believe the weak yen is in the interests of the United States." In this way, he implicitly attacked the U.S. Government. Asserting: "It is undesirable that exchange rates fluctuate because of the remarks of specific individuals," President Hiraiwa said definitely: "Given the U.S. economic recovery, the yen can be depreciated a little more." Touching on stimulus measures at the news conference, Hiraiwa stressed: "It is necessary to cut more than 5 trillion yen in income taxes prior to raising the consumption tax and to issue national bonds to make up for the fiscal shortfall resulting from the income tax reduction." As for handling the consumption tax, he said: "The idea is surfacing that if the income tax and consumption tax are cut and raised simultaneously, it will serve to stimulate the economy by increasing demand; this idea is reasonable." Thus, Hiraiwa expressed his understanding of the tax cut and tax increase package the Finance Ministry has broached. As for the lead time of the income tax reduction prior to the consumption tax hike, President Hiraiwa said: "I cannot say lightly whether 15 months (under study by the government) is desirable or not." Referring to the argument for lowering the official discount rate, President Hiraiwa indicated his opposition to lowering the rate, saying: "Many people are pointing increasingly to its adverse impact on the economy."
