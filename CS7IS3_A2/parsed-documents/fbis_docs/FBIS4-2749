Government statistics show that Anhui's gross national product (GNP) -- the total value of goods and services produced -- amounted to 94 billion yuan in 1993, up 22 percent over the previous year. That was nine percentage points higher than the nation's average growth rate, according to an official of the provincial statistics bureau. In 1993 Anhui ranked 12th in China in terms of industrial output value and eighth in terms of agricultural output value, compared to tenth on both counts in 1992. The official said that during the first quarter of 1994 Anhui scored a 25-percent increase in industrial output value. Anhui, a pioneer in introducing the initiative-based responsibility system in China's rural areas, has always paid close attention to agricultural production and has tried to expand the production of township-run factories in a bid to increase farmers' incomes. As a result, six million farmers have left the fields to find jobs in the manufacturing and service sectors. Meanwhile, rural industry has become a major driving force behind Anhui's economic growth. The output of rural industries topped 110 billion yuan-worth and the per-capita income of rural residents rose by 150 yuan in 1993. The official said that Anhui has become a national pacesetter in converting state owned enterprises into joint stock companies. By issuing shares, the Meiling Co. Ltd and the Maanshan Iron and Steel Company have raised 7.2 billion yuan, about one seventh of the total raised nationwide in this way. To date, Anhui has set up 15 stock trading centers, more than any other province-level area in China. It currently has 416 joint stock companies. The official said that the provincial government has decided to convert 20 percent of major state-owned enterprises into stock companies and try the institution of the modern enterprises system or corporation system in 50 selected state-owned companies. Anhui has also speeded up its construction of roads, harbors and airports over the past few years, in an effort to provide a better investment environment for overseas firms, he said. For example, new wharves have been built and existing ones upgraded in the port cities of Wuhan and tongling on the Chang Jiang River. Airports opened last year at Wuhan and anqing and an expressway linking the provincial capital of Hefei to Wuhu is being built. Anhui exported 960 million U.S. dollar-worth of goods in 1993, up 16 percent over the previous year, he said. It approved the establishment of 1,040 foreign-funded businesses in 1993, involving 703 million dollars in overseas investment. In the first quarter of this year six international consortiums, including the Sanyo Company of Japan, the Merrill Lynch Group of the United States and U.P.I. (Hong Kong) Ltd, invested a total of 15 billion yuan in infrastructure projects in cities and in upgrading existing companies in other parts of Anhui, he said.
