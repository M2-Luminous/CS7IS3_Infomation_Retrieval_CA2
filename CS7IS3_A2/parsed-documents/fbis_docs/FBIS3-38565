In a meeting in Berlusconi's Rome home, representatives from the three right-of-centre groups reached full agreement on a programme for the winning alliance in March 27 elections. According to Berlusconi, talks focussed on "politics and programmes." "I explained to them what I consider to be the right and proper solutions for Italy's problems, and I am happy to say that they were unanimously approved," said Berlusconi, owner of the Fininvest broadcasting-to-construction conglomerate. Also present for today's meeting were Francesco D'Onofrio, Pierferdinando Casini and Clemente Mastella of the Democratic Christian Centre, and Alfredo Biondi of the Centre Union. The Democratic Christian Centre was formed two weeks ago by right-wingers splitting from the Christian Democratic Party when it renamed itself the People's Party [Italian Popular Party], while the Centre Union is made up of ex-members of the Liberal and Social Democrat parties. Widely tipped to enter into an agreement with the right-of-centre alliance are the separatist Northern League and the National Alliance [NA], the renamed neofascist Italian Social Movement, neither of which were represented at today's talks. A partnership with the National Alliance was not ruled out by Clemente Mastella, who told journalists later that "we must give careful consideration to the National Alliance, which is a different thing from the Italian Social Movement. It is important that we avoid prejudice. With goodwill and generosity agreement is possible. We must show that we are able to make sacrifices for the good of the country." An outburst, Monday, by League chief Bossi, who said that he would have nothing to do with "fascists" or with anyone who struck deals with them, was brushed aside by Berlusconi today: "I have my own way of doing politics," he told the press. "We have had enough of empty words and quips. I have no intention of responding to off-hand comments like that." Berlusconi was also quoted as saying that Bossi could not go on thinking that Milan was his own private hunting reserve. Francesco D'Onofrio stressed that the federalist movement would now have to enter a right-wing alliance on the terms of the parties already involved: "We have reached an agreement, and it is a sound one," he said. "We found no sticking points over our political programme, and now we just have to see to putting it into practise. The League must be aware that we are the nucleus of the liberal democratic pole, that we are united and strong."
