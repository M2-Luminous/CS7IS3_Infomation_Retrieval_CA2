That would make no sense, he said, adding that the United States is mistaken in thinking that pressure and intimidation can bring the DPRK to its knees. This statement was made by Kim Il-song in the course of an exclusive PRENSA LATINA interview at the Presidential Palace. During the two-hour interview, Kim Il-song addressed the current tense situation being experienced by the DPRK, relations with the PRC and other countries, foreign investment, and the outlook for reunification of the Korean peninsula. Kim Il-song also praised the DPRK's ties with Cuba and President Fidel Castro. In a measured and firm voice, Kim Il-song stressed that his government is committed to turning the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free zone.
