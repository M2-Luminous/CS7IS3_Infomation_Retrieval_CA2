In case of such agreement an ex-territorial corridor would be created and a number of rights and guarantees ensured for Russia, Landsbergis noted. He emphasized that lately the political and economic crisis had been aggravated in Kaliningrad enclave. Thus, deep concentration of Russian military forces there represents danger for Lithuania. Landsbergis noted that the former Lithuanian government constantly raised questions on the demilitarization of Kaliningrad enclave. President Brazauskas raised this question at the United Nations as well. It would be paradoxical that Lithuania would add to the militarization of the enclave now, which would become a fact if Lithuania signed the agreement on the military transit. Landsbergis reproached the Lithuanian Government that it did not express its protest against Russia ignoring the Helsinki agreements signed in 1992. The agreements say that a foreign army can not be present in the territory of any state which does not give its agreement on it. Landsbergis thinks that the best way out would be to divert Russian military transit through territories of other states, like it happens now with the passanger trains. Any other agreements represent danger for Lithuania despite the presence of any international monitors which will be invited to Lithuania.
