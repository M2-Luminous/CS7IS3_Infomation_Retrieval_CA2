FR940222-2-00031 FR940222-2-00023 EPA amended its confidentiality regulations at 40 CFR part 2, subpart B to authorize SEE enrollees for access to confidential business information (58 FR 7187, February 5, 1993). As discussed in that notice, EPA offices had been giving SEE enrollees access to confidential information under the impression that Agency confidentiality regulations allowed such access. The February 5, 1993 Federal Register notice rectified that error by amending these regulations to provide for such access. Among the procedures established by EPA confidentiality regulations for granting access is notification to the submitters of confidential data that SEE grantee organizations and their enrollees will have access. 40 CFR 2.301(h)(2)(iii). This notice is intended to fulfill that requirement. The grantee organizations are required by the cooperative agreements to protect confidential information. SEE enrollees are required to sign confidentiality agreements and to adhere to the same security procedures as Federal employees. Dated: February 4, 1994. Karen Morehouse, Acting Director, Office of Exploratory Research. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3898 Filed 2&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;M
