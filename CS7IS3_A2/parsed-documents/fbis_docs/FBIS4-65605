It is also proposing a substantive preliminary meeting between the officials who are in charge of preparations for the meeting of the two foreign ministers. Acting on instructions from the Foreign Ministry, Greek Ambassador in Tirana Khristodhoulos Tsalikis conveyed this "issue" to Albanian Deputy Foreign Minister Arjan Starova. The Greek side insists on all questions and decisions being raised before the meeting, which is anticipated to be held before the end of July, so the two ministers will be in a position to "close" the differences. According to the Greek proposal, these meetings could be held at the border-crossing of Kakavia, alternatively on Greek and Albanian territory.
