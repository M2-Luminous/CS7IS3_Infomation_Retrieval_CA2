Since 8 April of this year, the Republic of Macedonia has been a member of the United Nations. At this moment it has been recognized by more than 50 countries, some of which are of extreme importance, and the process of recognition by others has already been announced. Finally, the Republic of Macedonia has become an international reality. It is a new and prospective [as published] state in the Balkans, a factor of peace in the region." This, among other things, was emphasized by Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov in his new year's statement to the delegates and numerous guests at the 72d session of the Macedonian People's Assembly. He also made a review of everything that has been achieved during the past year, particularly what lies ahead of us and what our duties and obligations are in the year to come. Talking about the current internal situation, President Gligorov pointed to the necessity of adopting a stabilization program. "That is, probably, the number one issue in Macedonia," he emphasized, and stressed reality as the only possible way of approaching that subject. According to him, reality means starting from the objective economic and social situation in which we find ourselves now, from its influence on the stability of the country, and the further reinforcement of its international position. "The Republic of Macedonia is in transition." he pointed out, "and we should make that period easier by opting for that which will exact the smallest economic and social price of all of us, without exception." The second point of the review by President Gligorov within the framework of the stabilization program was the social and political security of the country. That is the basis on which the future development of democracy and construction of a legal state depends. Therefore, in the opinion of President Gligorov, besides the indispensable restrictions, the program should also take into account social endurance and establish a system for solving the social conflicts. In this context, he stressed the need for a speedier establishment of the judiciary system, because, in his words, it has a direct impact on the entire social and political stability of the state. President Gligorov also said that "it is of special importance for us to create an economic, social, and political milieu that will guarantee the stability of interethnic relations in Republic Macedonia. We have been hearing for three years that Macedonia will `without a doubt witness an interethnic conflict' and that will be the end of this state. But what has reality demonstrated? First, it demonstrated that such an interethnic conflict is not unavoidable if we have a clear political option, that this is the state and fatherland of all those living in it, that the nationalities must enjoy their rights, but also respect and perform their duties toward the state. Those rights must be realized and solved through dialogue, understanding, and political measures within the system and its institutions. And second, the realization of that unique alternative, as a guarantee to peace and harmonization of interethnic relations, is very much dependent on the economic and social status of the state." As the last segment on the importance of the stabilization program President Gligorov stressed its influence on the reinforcement of the republic's international position. "That position," he said, "at this moment must, first of all, be bolstered on the economic plan and reaffirmed abroad. That is our real interest, but also it is in the interest of the international community at large. The stabilization and economic rise of Macedonia is an important part of that plan. Any other choice will either mean pushing the country into a hopeless isolation or placing it on the margins of the world economic market." Continuing, President Gligorov made a special presentation on maintaining and reinforcing the security of the Republic of Macedonia. "Our republic, today, is on relatively stable foundations. However, we do not and must not underestimate those possible dangers, particularly because there is a bloody war going on in the region. That is why our basic idea is to make the Republic of Macedonia an equal member of the collective European and world security. The CSCE is the first link. However, it is of no less importance for us, in the interest of our own security and the security in the region, to be included, first of all, in the NATO Council, and then in NATO. It is therefore of extreme importance that the Macedonian People's Assembly has already come to a firm decision on that," President Gligorov emphasized. "The foundations of the sovereign and independent state of Macedonia," President Gligorov said furthermore, "were lain on 8 September 1991. They were reaffirmed by the Constitution of the Republic and by the admission to the United Nations. The centuries long aspirations and wishes of the Macedonian people are our reality -- what we are experiencing today -- an independent and internationally recognized state, as a continuity of the 1903 Ilinden [the first Macedonian Republic in Krusevo], and the 1944 ASNOM [Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Macedonia]. Honored delegates, there is no such a force that can change all that. Many have tried in the past three years, claiming from the outside, that we are `an artificial creation', a `communist invention.' For the sake of the truth, all those claims have been exhausted. The Republic of Macedonia is a respected reality. Allow me, in the end, to express my deep belief that the Republic of Macedonia is opening up a new page in its history. Its basic orientation will still be an independent state, with an open European option, fully integrated in the International Community and its security systems; a democratic state in which the interethnic relations are and will be regulated by international standards; a market economy and full candidacy in the world market. That is why, finally, I stress the necessity for the People's Assembly and government, as well as for the other factors in the republic, to turn to economic and social questions, to the stabilization and development of our economy. That will ease the transition and create conditions for economic revitalization. That will be a thorny road, with problems and numerous sacrifices. However, there is no other road." Congratulating the orthodox delegates and guests on the new year and the Christmas holidays, President Gligorov sent a message asking all of us to gather the necessary strength to completing that which began with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the realized international recognition, in order to leave to the next People's Assembly and Government a complete state with all its attributes. [Box, p 11] "Main Argument" "The question of the economic survival of the Republic of Macedonia is a question of the intensive engagement of many in the Balkans. It was always offered as "the main argument", saying Macedonia could not survive as a state, because it was not able to survive economically on its own. That is why we have been exposed to various blockades in the past three years since our independence. We demonstrated our ability to maintain our state under such conditions, taking into account its economic vitality and positive stimuli from privatization. We hear, even today, threats to destabilize us through economic measures. However, the most important thing at this moment is for us not to allow an economic collapse inside the country, which would erode democracy, thus jeopardizing the life and stable fabric of our state. There is not one single political goal that could justify that," President Gligorov emphasized. [Box, p 11] End to Balkan Wars "The question on the dispute over our name has acquired its real framework. It has been proven that we do not endanger any of our neighbors, and our independence and international recognition are not cause for a new Balkan war -- on the contrary. We have demonstrated ourselves to be a factor that has impeded the expansion of the war to our southern border. We demonstrated that the independence of the Macedonian state is the key to peace in the south of the Balkans. Through all this historical mistakes have been corrected. It, independent Republic of Macedonia, put an end to the historical reasons for Balkan wars and conflicts; it impeded attempts for another division of Macedonia. I deeply believe that knowledge about Macedonia being of vital interest for neighboring Greece will become more and more widespread. We have many more reasons to fully cooperate as good neighbors, instead of creating a new region of conflict in the Balkans," President Gligorov said. [Box, p 11] Moderation and Realism "The difficult process of our recognition," President Gligorov said, "demonstrated that moderation and realism are the only possible routes in our foreign policy. It demonstrated that it is neither justified to idealize international relations and practice, nor to have a completely nihilistic attitude in that regard. Reality demonstrated that international relations and practice rely on real interests and principles. They can neither be idealized nor denied."
