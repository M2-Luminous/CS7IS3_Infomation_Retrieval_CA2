Naturally in the first place this will concern Rwandan refugees, but Tanzania, which has the largest refugee camp on its territory, can also count on aid. The aid has already been approved in principle, but will now be paid out in practice. Four organizations (Doctors Without Frontiers, Caritas, the Red Cross, and Oxfam-Belgium) will assign the funds. Since they have already incurred considerable expenses before the money has reached their bank accounts, the government is also promising to reimburse any bank interest charges. In addition to the large amount of BFr100 million in direct aid, it has also been decided to release BFr14 million in order to rebuild Tanzania's food stocks. These strategic stocks have recently fallen very sharply. The aim is to supply the equivalent of some 4,000 tonnes of grain which will be used for both the Tanzanian population and Rwandan refugees. A similar amount will be spent to dig water wells in the regions where the refugees are located. By sending aid to the local population and the refugees, the organizations hope to avoid tension between the two groups. The State Secretariat for Development Cooperation has announced that further emergency aid will be approved as soon as new project proposals have been received. The money will be taken out of the existing emergency aid fund (which increased to BFr500 million in 1994) and the structural aid fund to Rwanda. The State Secretariat believes that this trend toward increased emergency aid spending is regrettable, but that it can not be avoided at this moment.
