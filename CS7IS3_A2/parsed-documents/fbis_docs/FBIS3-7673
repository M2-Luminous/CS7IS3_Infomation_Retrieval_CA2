We should talk more about democracy. [Begin recording] [Chuan] It is better for us to discuss democracy, not coups. We can solve problems through the democratic system since we love this system. [Unidentified correspondent] Is it time for us to solve problems by rules and regulations, not threats and intimidation? [Chuan] I have stressed all the time that we should deal with problems in line with rules and regulations under the democratic system. I hate threats because people have dignity. [end recording] Meanwhile, Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak said that it is just an academic paper about a coup, how it is staged, and whether or not it will benefit the country. This has nothing to do with countering government policy. [Begin recording] [Wichit] It is an expression of opinion by the writer. This is just a theory. It has no harm. [Unidentified correspondent] Will it cause confusion since the article is publicized in the army newsletter? [Wichit] It depends on interpretation. I have not read the article. Thank you for informing me about this. I believe that it is rather an academic article. [Unidentified correspondent] Have there been any moves in the Armed Forces? [Wichit] The military leaders have repeated on several occasions that the Armed Forces are an apparatus of the government. [Unidentified correspondent] Do you think that such an article was meant as a hint at a time when there is political confusion? [Wichit] It is rather an academic article. [end recording]
