"As an Eastern country with our own culture, traditions, and strong religious upbringing, we will not employ such methods," Health Minister Suyudi told reporters after meeting with President Suharto at Bina Graha Palace on Monday, 13 December. Criticism has recently been heard from ulemas, who question the methods of the anti-AIDS campaign and the recommendation that people who frequently service women use condoms. They believe that such tactics are tantamount to legalizing prostitution. [passage omitted] According to the minister, condoms should be used to prevent the spread of AIDS, but society only approves of this method being employed by people who are already infected with AIDS so that the disease will not be transmitted to others, such as their wives or spouses.
