At a routine news briefing this afternoon, a reporter asked: Now that the British Hong Kong Government has already ruled out the possibility of Chris Patten withdrawing the political reform bill at the request of the Chinese side, is it still likely that China and Britain will resume their talks in such a situation? Wu Jianmin made the aforementioned remarks when answering the question.
