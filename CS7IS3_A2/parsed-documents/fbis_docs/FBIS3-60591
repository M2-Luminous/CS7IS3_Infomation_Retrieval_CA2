AL-SAFIR met with Mikhail Mali, head of the Russian National Security Council Committee, who is participating in the supervision of military production. It asked him about the future of military production, which he showed some optimism about. We had the following dialogue. [AL-SAFIR] What is the condition of the Russian military industry institution? Is it still capable of exporting modern military equipment and arms abroad? [Mali] I posed such questions in a meeting with President Boris Yeltsin recently. The president then read a statement from our ambassador in Bangladesh in which the latter says that, for no reason whatsoever, we are allowing tenders, one after the other, to be awarded to other countries. In this way, we are opening up markets in which we previously had a strong position to competitors who are defeating us with our own weapons. Of course, the Middle East has its own special character. Regarding Bangladesh, we could have made millions of dollars there. We need this money so that the mechanisms for production will be set up at the Aviastart installation in Ulyanovsk, which we opened to manufacture Tu-204 planes. We exhibited the most modern samples of Russian military weapons and equipment in Abu Dhabi and China. Military industry, despite the setbacks it has had, is capable of exporting competitive equipment. We have decided that from now on we will not attempt to sell old models. While previously the Soviet Union did not hesitate to sell old weapons, we sell new weapons as much as possible without affecting our defense capabilities. We have displayed the newest weapons, beginning with modern projectiles and ending with airplanes, missiles, electronics, and modern optical equipment. In Abu Dhabi, we proposed to the Americans staging a battle between the Russian T-80 tank and the American Abrams. The members of our tank team volunteered to stage the battle because they were convinced they would win. The Americans rejected the offer. Their rejection was an indication that they accept the fact that the Russian tank is superior in combat. We could export new weapons to the amount of 10-12 billion [currency not specified] a year despite the fact that our weapons exports in 1992 dropped to $3.5 billion. We can also flood the market with spare parts for our weapons and military equipment. It is no coincidence that the prime minister decided to supervise the exports of weapons because of his dissatisfaction with what has been happening so far. [AL-SAFIR] How is Russia doing in the arms markets, especially in the Middle East? [Mali] With the dissolution of the contract between the Soviet republics and turning the page on the Soviet regime, the internal political problems overshadowed all others. Russia, at that time, according to the opinion of many Russian politicians, directed its energies toward coping with these problems that were much more important. The production of the most modern models of military equipment and the export of weapons was not a priority. It was only natural for us to lose a part of our trade market immediately. The arms trade is more difficult than the trade in gold or diamonds due to the force of habit that controls it. We have no existence in a number of markets now after we stopped exporting spare parts and ammunition. We failed to meet the schedules for exports and have not taken into consideration the situation in Syria, for example, or Jordan, Tunisia, Libya, or Algeria. I regret that Algeria, according to information I have, bought non-Russian military equipment, as did India. Yes, we do not have a presence in some markets anymore. However, we hope to return to these markets. As of 1994, we will resume our regular activities. I hope we will regain our positions in the arms markets and acquire a better position than we had before. The president has signed a decree stipulating raising the minimum salaries of workers in the military industry by eight times more than the salaries in the rest of the sectors. The military industry will be granted 20 percent of the price of products the state orders from it before delivery of the products. Such a step will give confidence to those who work in the field and they will become more creative in new equipment. As for the approval of the military philosophy, it has enabled Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to develop a plan for arming the military until the year 2000. [AL-SAFIR] What kind of weapons can Russia sell to the Arab countries? [Mali] I believe we can sell the weapons that we exhibited there this year, particularly air defense missiles. These missiles can be used to destroy targets on the ground, at sea, and in the air. It has been shown in practice that the S-300,000 missiles are capable of destroying aerial targets and ships 180 kms off shore. They can also be launched from ships to destroy a whole regiment of tanks on shore after specially equipped planes locate their position. We have models of such planes. In short, these sea-ground, sea-air, and surface-to-surface missiles are unique and multi-purpose weapons. [AL-SAFIR] Can Russia produce weapons and equipment fit for use in the Middle East climate? [Mali] We benefited a great deal from the Abu Dhabi military fair. The Russian delegation included all senior weapons designers to see for themselves soldiers who are unlike Russian soldiers, who do not complain of severe winter cold nor of hot summer weather. The soldiers of many countries are used to comfortable conditions. Thus the military industry sector, which will be requested to promote exports, is required to produce weapons and equipment fit for use in tropical and desert regions. These weapons and equipment must be fit for use in the areas where they will be exported and ensure comfort for personnel using them, meet certain technical specifications, and are easily guided and aimed. [AL-SAFIR] Are the various products of the Russian military industry establishment going to change in light of the new military philosophy? [Mali] We will introduce numerous changes. It has been decided to limit production of assault submarines to two submarines a year. Production of Diesel-powered submarines will be considerably reduced. I think that we will stop building large ships as we no longer needs them because they are vulnerable and their operation is very costly. According to our new philosophy and, given the current developments in Russia, tactical weapons have become strategic ones. We will go ahead in producing the winged Cruise missiles and the (Plazma) weapon in which we are far ahead of Western countries. This is a defensive weapon that can be used for destruction of attacking missiles as well as ground targets. We will continue to develop light weapons that are easy to move by land, sea, and air; computerized weapons; and combat communications systems. Since the ideological confrontation worldwide that previously exhausted us is over, we may focus on producing and advancing modern weapons such as the Mig aircraft by using foreign-made electronic equipment to increase the effectiveness of our weapons by 30 to 40 percent. We can also meet the interests of our Western partners to some extent. It is highly likely that we will cooperate with other countries in the manufacture of military weapons and equipment. [AL-SAFIR] Would you like to say anything to the Arabs who may seek to purchase Russian weapons? [Mali] We are ready to receive Arab military delegations to teach them how to use new models of weapons while testing them to facilitate their introduction into their armies as quickly as possible. We have also established, with President Yeltsin's approval, a bank for the Military industry establishment in which Greece shares in its capital. We do not know yet if the Arabs desire to share in funding weapons production. The door is open to them and we invite them to participate in this bank activity and in joint weapons production. We invite the Arabs to inspect the weapons system at the Nizhniy Novgorod Fair. We are preparing to exhibit new models of weapons at this fair and in Moscow. We will exhibit new types of military equipment and provide ample information on them. We do not have any intention of exploiting them and all that we want is for our exhibits to attract buyers. We will prove the effectiveness of our products in a competition with rivals. As for me, I support returning approximately 60 percent of the revenue of our weapons exports to the Arabs for investment in their economic sectors. This policy is in our interest for several reasons, primarily because this cooperation will enable us to retain the work sites of the important industrial sector. We can also safeguard the security of regions by our own weapons and ensure revenue from our exports. Such deals are in the interests of both sides.
