This institution -- which was set up after the Targu Mures events [March 1990] and out of the belief that somebody should deal with would-be spies at work in Romania -- has not had too many problems to cope with over the past four years. Foreign agents do not seem to have tested its capability all that much, since the only danger for our "national security" brought to the fore by one of the SRI's leaders so far was the attempt of a foreigner to find out the secret of the pollution smoke from Copsa Mica by jumping over the fence of an enterprise there. The only difficulties for the institution have come from the independent press, which was worried by the possibility that the SRI might bring back to life the glorious methods used by the no less glorious former Securitate. However, even these difficulties were no big deal for [SRI Director] Virgil Magureanu's institution. The part of the press subservient to the SRI (yes, there is such a thing in Romania!) took care to present this concern as the expression of an attempt -- paid from abroad -- to destabilize the country. Relative harmony has reigned within the institution, since under the mask of a public appearance of softness, Magureanu hides his true steel nature. Consequently, there has not been too much dissidence or rebellion against his absolute rule within the institution. The few instances when people dared to utter a word against him were dealt with in the purest Romanian style, by quietly removing the naughty ones. However, the SRI seems to have lost its primordial tranquility of late. This has happened not for reasons lying outside the institution, since the situation there seems to be good, even very good for the SRI now. After his endorsement by Parliament, Virgil Magureanu is no longer being challenged by the press or the opposition. His proverbial ability has finally had its way. Nor are spies causing trouble to the SRI any longer. According to Magureanu, they do not exist, because they have all already been caught. The causes of the disturbance come from within the institution. Some two weeks ago, the public learned with stupefaction (from EVENIMENTUL ZILEI) that Gheorghe Diaconescu, head of the SRI's Counterespionage Division, had been dismissed. No sooner had the upset created by this news evaporated than another piece of news took its place, namely that the SRI plans to dismiss Dumitru Cristea, one of Magureanu's prominent deputies. As is the case with all the institutions of today's power in Romania, the SRI did not condescend to give too many explanations about these two events that have taken place inside the institution. In these circumstances, it is hard for us to realize what is actually going on in one of the basic organizations for Romania's national security. Is there a life and death battle being waged between foreign networks? Have the two events any connection at all with the uncovering of a KGB spy within the CIA? Does Virgil Magureanu want to remove the people of a much stronger adversary, who is placed in the structures of the current power? Are the various accusations that one hears against Gheorghe Diaconescu and Dumitru Cristea true? Or are they pure SRI fabrications? What is certain is that the SRI is going through a crisis and the crisis is so big that it cannot be contained within the institution and has quickly become public knowledge. This is an indication that the confrontation between Magureanu and some people within the SRI has become a life and death affair. The sacked general Gheorghe Diaconescu does not seem to have come to terms with his fate. Despite the drastic measures taken by Magureanu, it is more than certain that protegees of the dismissed general are still left within the SRI. These are not people that give up easily. Even though they are not doing so directly, they are probably acting against the SRI director. Threatened with dismissal, Cristea is fighting hard to prevent it. For the time being, the war is being waged at the level of mere press statements. However, nobody can guarantee that they will stay put at that level. The struggle might also reach the stage of released documents and compromising disclosures. Therefore, one can proceed from the assumption that the SRI is undergoing a major upheaval, which may seriously affect the ability to function of this vital institution for the country. Who will put an end to this strife? Looking at all the other bodies of power, we realize with concern that there is nobody who can bring peace to the SRI. Consequently, all that is left for us to do is to watch helplessly the unfolding of this war, which currently poses a greater danger for us all than the entire political and economic crisis.
