The ad is timed with Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota's visit to the U.S., starting Thursday, to press the White House and the Pentagon on the issue. Ota said in the ad that his past two visits to the U.S. to seek a solution to the problems failed to produce any concrete results. Ota is scheduled to meet commanding officers of the Hawaii-based U.S. Pacific Fleet. In Washington he will hold talks with State Department and Pentagon officials as well as with members of the Senate and House of Representatives Armed Services Committees. Some 75 percent of U.S. military facilities in Japan are concentrated in Okinawa, comprising a cluster of islands northeast of Taiwan. The ad calls for the return of the U.S. naval port in Naha, and the abolition of parachute training and live-ammunition exercises. Okinawa was reunited with Japan on May 15, 1972 after a 27-year occupation, under the condition that U.S. Forces would be allowed to continue to use the bases there.
