There is concrete evidence that every day, Karadzic's fascists are expelling some 300 Bosniaks and 150 to 200 Croats from Banja Luka. The exiles are first stripped of all their property, including their savings and personal jewelry. President Izetbegovic draws attention to the fact that the UN Protection Forces, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Red Cross are providing the one-way transportation, and warns that their duty is actually exactly the opposite. They are supposed to guarantee all the people's survival in their home towns and on their ancestral hearths, stresses President Izetbegovic in letters addressed to the most prominent UN officials and the International Red Cross.
