The General Staff Department must play an exemplary leading role in the consolidation and reform. Zhang Wannian said: Consolidation and reform of business operations has a bearing on the preservance of our military's nature and objectives and on the overall interest of army building and national development. It is a solemn political task. We must unswervingly attend to this task with a high sense of responsibility for the army, the state, and the people and carry out this task through to the end until success. Zheng Wannian pointed out: The CMC and its chairman Jiang Zemin have emphasized repeatedly that it is necessary to run the military with strict discipline. The crux of the various tasks in the military lies in implementation. We must implement the guidelines of the various CMC decisions to the letter and accomplish the task of consolidating and reforming production and operations with high quality work and high standards. While enhancing discipline in production and operations, efforts should be made to conduct education or rectification in regard to weak points in work of military organs. Special attention should be paid to units that are not supposed to engage in business operations as well as consolidation and reform of business operations run by army units stationed in the special economic zones.
