According to information provided by the Agriculture Ministry's Bumper Harvest Projects Office, currently grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops cultivated with the new skills promoted under the bumper harvest projects have reached 1 billion mu in total acreage. Grain production for the past seven years has increased by 23.8 billion kg, ginned cotton by 556 million kg, oil-bearing crops by 2.3 billion kg, sugar crops by 7.5 billion kg, vegetables and fruits by 1.8 billion kg; meats, poultry, and eggs by 620 million kg; aquatic products by 400 million kg, and milk by 28 million kg, with the increase in the output value of these products totalling 26.8 billion yuan. The nationwide bumper harvest projects for agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, and forestry -- which were jointly initiated and promoted by the Agriculture and Finance Ministries in 1987 with all-out participation by 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions throughout the country -- have thus far promoted 147 new technological items, including new, good crop varieties; new, good poultry and livestock breeds; dry-land farming; simulated agricultural cultivation; water-conserving cultivation; cultivation using plastic sheeting; horticulture; improvements in fertilizer formulas; comprehensive crop disease, pest, weed, and rat control; straw ammoniation; feed and additive formula improvements; high-yield aquatic breeding; fresh-keeping, storage, transportation, and processing of farm products; agricultural mechanization in cultivation and breeding; and rural energy development. Backed by special funds and pushed hard by government actions, these new technologies have been promoted rapidly at the agricultural production level and have had huge benefits. The 20 projects implemented last year under the nationwide bumper harvest projects for agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, and forestry have resulted in an increase of 1.98 billion kg in grain production, 47.6 million kg in ginned cotton, and 179 million kg in oil-bearing crops -- respectively 23 percent, 3.3 percent, and 20 percent more than the planned targets -- and an increase of 3.74 billion yuan in output value. Practice has shown that bumper harvest projects have turned out to be an important means in speeding up the transformation of China's agricultural scientific and technological achievements, in guaranteeing its agricultural production, and in promoting the development of rural productivity. The bumper harvest projects have been a major state plan in enhancing the level of rural productivity. For the past seven years, a total of 16.5 billion yuan have been invested in the project, of which 180 million yuan were state revenues, while the remainder were made up of local funds and loans. The state has specifically formulated a guiding group for the projects. In attaching importance to their implementation, governments at provincial, prefectural, and county levels have adopted a contract management system to ensure success. Last year, 197 first-tier contracts were signed between the Agriculture Ministry and various provinces, regions, cities, and cities with provincial-level economic powers, while 950 second-tier agreements were entered into between provinces and counties, with personnel being designated at each and every level to guarantee the successful promotion of all new skills at the peasants' level. Through explorations and summing up amid practice, the bumper harvest projects have developed an effective, regulated, and institutionalized management pattern of their own. From the very outset, the nationwide bumper harvest projects have adopted a competitive mechanism by singling out for promotion scientific and technological achievements which have a bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood and which are capable of enhancing the economic results of China's agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries industries, as well as of stimulating the development of the three aforementioned industries. In the course of their implementation, project contracting units must present periodical progress reports to parties offering such contracts. Before a project is concluded, all interested parties will undertake the appraisal and summing up process according to project and contract requirements. Circulating funds handed down together with appropriations are to be utilized on a rolling basis, under which repayments must be made in time. Defaults in repayment may result in the suspension of appropriations for the next project. These rigid management rules have provided a new say to better manage China's agricultural funds under market economic conditions.
