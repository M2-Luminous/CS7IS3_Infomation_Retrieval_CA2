The subversives sent a clandestine communique to Medellin radio stations, justifying the planting of explosives at U.S. facilities to reject the presence of U.S. troops in Colombia. Four bombs exploded at Citibank branches and at an English academy in several Medellin locations. Meanwhile, the police defused three other explosive devices. The FARC said the presence of U.S. soldiers harms Colombian interests; thus, it is exerting pressure for their immediate departure. About 250 U.S. soldiers are building bases in Puerto Lopez, Meta Department, and in Araracuara, Amazonas Department, to detect drug traffickers' planes. In addition, the troops are building a school, a health center, and a road in Juanchaco, in the western Valle del Cauca Department. Mauricio Navas Talero, a former Attorney General's Office high-ranking official, filed a petition today for protection, a judicial mechanism used to protect constitutional rights, requesting the departure of foreign soldiers. Navas explained the Colombian Constitution does not empower the president "to tolerate, consent, or allow the entry of foreign troops in the country." This would be acceptable if the Council of State issued an authorization. He added "to defend this constitutional right, I am asking the courts to urge President Cesar Gaviria to order the immediate departure of the troops." Judicial sources have said the courts will issue a ruling on the petition for protection within 10 days.
