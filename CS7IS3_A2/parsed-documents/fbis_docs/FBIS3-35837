Mykola Polonskyy has the story: [passage omitted] Yuriy Meshkov read out a statement expressing his readiness to cooperate with all political forces and economic structures since the elections. Having almost 1 million Crimeans, 72 percent of the adult population, supporting his candidacy demonstrates, in the president's opinion, the great unity of the peninsula's population that now forms a single people. Crimea, in his words, can become a bridge of friendship between Ukraine and Russia. It was relations between the young republic and these states that raised many questions from journalists. A question was raised on a referendum on the status of Crimea. Yuriy Meshkov confirmed his resolve strictly to comply with the letter of the law. His principal aim, however, is the economic well-being of the Crimeans, while all the rest is secondary. In other words, the question of the Crimea either seceding from Ukraine and developing as an independent state or not, virtually remained unanswered. Obviously, reality compels Yuriy Meshkov not to hurry secession, for the economic situation in Crimea is complex, so much so that even a thought of the republic surviving independently is absurd. As for Russia, the president only spoke about the need to restore and strengthen economic relations with it. The news conference somehow did not discuss the integration of Crimea in the Russian ruble zone, which so far has been regarded as a panacea for every trouble. [passage omitted] Meshkov told journalists that he would not take steps drastically different from the previous course and that he would not undertake substantial structural changes and replacements in power structures. In other words, everything will remain unchanged. But if so, how can the Crimeans expect any improvement in their well-being and living standards? Unfortunately, journalists did not hear the Crimean president's specific proposals or concrete ideas in this respect.
