Paznyak, V. Golubev, and S. Naumchik have held a news conference at the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. In the words of S. Naumchik, "despite the resistance of certain circles," U.S. President Clinton will visit Kuropaty [burial site of thousands of victims murdered by Soviet security police in the 1930's] on 16 January and meet with BNF Chairman Z. Paznyak. "The initiative to meet came from the American side," Z. Paznyak specified. The parliamentary opposition leader also voiced harsh criticism of Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Shushkevich for signing the CIS Collective Security Treaty. He accused Shushkevich of betraying the national interests of Belarus. Speaking on the issue of unifying the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems, Z. Paznyak noted that Russia is "waging economic war against Belarus," and that the last agreement concluded by Yeltsin, Kebich, and Chernomyrdin means that "our country has surrendered." At the news conference, parliamentary opposition activists denounced Belarus' entry into NATO. "Only a policy of neutrality and the support of European states will help Belarus survive," Z. Paznyak emphasized. In addition, he said he doubted that the elections set for this spring will actually take place.
