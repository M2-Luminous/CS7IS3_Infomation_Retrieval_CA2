The attorney general, the Congressional Human Rights Committee, and representatives of the Council for Peace and the National Coordinating Board for Human Rights arrived at the theater of operations today. The Army is trying to eliminate Shining Path columns in Leoncio Prado Province, on the left bank of the Huallaga River in the northern Peruvian department of Huanuco. The visitors boarded helicopters and overflew Venenillo, Moyuna, and Mohena, villages where the National Coordinating Board for Human Rights and certain news media claimed that Army helicopters had fired rockets at civilians, leaving an unspecified number of casualties. Carlos Blanco, chairman of the Congressional Human Rights Committee, reported that the theater of military operations has been reconnoitered, and testimonies of the reported outrages will now be gathered. Blanco belongs to the ruling party majority in Congress. He said: "We will stay here as long as necessary to gather all the necessary testimonies."
