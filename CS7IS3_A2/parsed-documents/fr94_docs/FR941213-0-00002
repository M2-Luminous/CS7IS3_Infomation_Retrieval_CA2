FR941213-0-00002 FR941213-0-00001 RESOLUTION TRUST CORPORATION 12 CFR Part 1609 RIN 3205&hyph;AA03 Affordable Housing Disposition Program AGENCY: Resolution Trust Corporation. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) is adopting the interim final rule which was published on October 19, 1994, as a final rule without change. The rule provides policies and procedures, required under subsections (c)(3) of section 21A of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, for the marketing of properties under the Affordable Housing Disposition Program (AHDP). The rule is necessary because the Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring and Improvement Act of 1991 (Refinancing Act), the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1992 (1992 Appropriations Act), the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (1992 Housing Act) and the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act of 1993 (Completion Act) changed the manner in which the RTC is to identify, market and sell certain properties under the AHDP. This rule also clarifies certain policies of the RTC regarding the disposition of assets in the AHDP and reflects certain comments received with respect to a previously published interim final rule. By implementing the statutory changes required by the Refinancing Act, the 1992 Appropriations Act, the 1992 Housing Act, and the Completion Act, and clarifying certain provisions of the AHDP and making the other changes set forth herein, these regulations will enhance the availability and affordability of residential real property for very-low income, lower-income and moderate-income families and individuals. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective January 12, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen S. Allen, Director, Affordable Housing Disposition Program, (202) 416&hyph;7348, or Barry Wides, Deputy Director, Affordable Housing Disposition Program, (202) 416&hyph;7138.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulatory Procedure On August 31, 1990 (55 FR 35564), the RTC published a final rule establishing the procedures to be followed by the RTC in connection with the sale of eligible residential properties to qualifying purchasers under the AHDP. Those procedures were established in accordance with the affordable housing provisions of section 21A(c) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, as amended be section 501 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) (12 U.S.C. 1441a). On May 6, 1992 (57 FR 19500), the RTC published an interim final rule and requested comments (May 6, 1992 Interim Rule). That publication implemented some of the statutory changes made to the AHDP by the Refinancing Act and clarified the RTC's policies on a number of issues relating to the disposition of assets in the AHDP. On June 12, 1992 (57 FR 24937), the RTC published an interim statement of policy titled Lower Income Occupancy Requirements for Bulk Sales in the Multifamily Affordable Housing Disposition Program. That publication provided that when more than one multifamily property is purchased from the RTC under the AHDP, the RTC will require that not less than 15 percent of the dwelling units in each separate multifamily property purchased in bulk be made available to low or very-low income individuals. The final statement of policy was published on August 19, 1992 (57 FR 37581) and reflected no changes from the interim statement of policy. On October 19, 1994, (59 FR 52669) the RTC published an interim Final Rule which implemented several statutory changes made to the AHDP by the Refinancing Act and not reflected in the May 6, 1992 interim final rule, implemented a number of statutory changes made to the AHDP by the enactment of the 1992 Appropriations Act, the 1992 Housing Act, and the Completion Act, and, it further clarified RTC policies relating to the disposition of assets within the AHDP. Comments The RTC received written comments only from the Savings and Community Bankers of America (``SCBA''). SCBA endorsed the interim final rule and suggested no changes to the rule.
