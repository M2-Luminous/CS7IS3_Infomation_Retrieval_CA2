FBIS4-59316 "drnes092_j_94012" FBIS-NES-94-092 Daily Report 11 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Dawn Scud Attack Launched 11 May; More Than 23 Killed Dawn Scud Attack Launched 11 May; More Than 23 Killed JN1105145094 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1407 GMT 11 May 94 JN1105145094 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] In a treacherous and cowardly act that can be committed only by hysterical people who sense that their demise is inevitable and who face the gloomy fate that awaits every murderer, the gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] Command has fired its destructive long-range Scud missiles against civilian installations and residential quarters in Sanaa and other Yemeni cities in the northern and western governorates. A missile fell on a residential quarter in Sanaa at dawn today, martyring more than 23 citizens, completely demolishing four houses, and damaging others. The bodies of a newly-wed couple, still in the first week of their marriage, were removed from under the rubble. The masses that arrived on the scene condemned this criminal act that targets the lives of citizens -- women, children, and the elderly -- and denounced these vindictive actions carried out by the seccessionist clique in the YSP. These show the rancor this clique harbors toward the sons of our people. Another missile fell on al-Rahidah Hospital the day before yesterday, killing many patients. All these criminal acts are part of the attempt to undermine our people. However, these acts will only make our people more committed to unity and more insistent on defending it and protecting Constitutional legitimacy, and more determined to rid themselves of killers and murderers who have no qualms.
