FR940922-2-00104 FR940922-2-00070 Parametric Study of the Potential for BWR ECCS Strainer Blockage Due To LOCA Generated Debris (DRAFT); Availability, Correction The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has published a FOR COMMENT draft of NUREG/CR&hyph;6224 Parametric Study of the Potential for BWR ECCS Strainer Blockage Due to LOCA Generated Debris , on August 29, 1994 (59 FR 45042). This report presents a draft of the methodology developed to assess the potential blockage of BWR emergency core cooling system (ECCS) strainers by a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) generated debris. The report describes the analysis approach, models developed and summarizes initial calculated results of the loss of ECCS recirculation capability. The address to request a free single copy of this report has been corrected. A free single copy of draft NUREG/CR&hyph;6224, Parametric Study of the Potential for BWR ECCS Strainer Blockage Due to LOCA Generated Debris , may be requested by those considering public comment by writing to the Distribution Section, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001. A copy is also available for inspection and/or copying for a fee in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC.
