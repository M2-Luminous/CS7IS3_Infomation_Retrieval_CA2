"'Arafat is under pressure from all sides. He says something and then two weeks later cannot deliver what he promises. He does not represent all the Palestinians. Still, he is our only partner on the Palestinian side and the negotiations with him will continue. There is no going back." [passage omitted] Rabin said he reached the conclusion that al-Asad is serious about his contacts with Israel when Israeli intelligence learned that al-Asad had turned down a request by the Iranian ambassador to meet with him prior to the Syrian leader's summit meeting with Clinton in Geneva. Rabin reached the conclusion that Syria has a partnership with Iran on the Iraqi issue, but that it decided to sever the partnership in relation to Israel. "If al-Asad were to do one-third of what al-Sadat did, there would be no problems in the peace process with Syria," Rabin said. [passage omitted] Rabin also said that because of the danger of Iran and Islamic fundamentalism, peace must be reached between Israel and all the pro-American states in the region. "I hope that al-Asad now understands that the path to rapprochement with the U.S. must go through Israel." He spoke with concern about the regime in Egypt. "The regime in Syria is more stable than the one in Egypt. Even if al-Asad is assassinated the regime will remain stable. On the other hand, the regime in Egypt is now the least stable in the region and is under the risk of an Islamic takeover." The meeting lasted over three hours and was held in a pleasant atmosphere and with a lot of empathy displayed for the prime minister.
