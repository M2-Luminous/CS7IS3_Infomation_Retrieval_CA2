The sources said 'Arafat's health is good; in the past few days he has been chairing meetings of the Palestinian National Authority Council. The sources explained that 'Arafat recently underwent medical tests at the military hospital in Tunis under the supervision of a team of prominent doctors. The tests lasted only two hours, after which 'Arafat resumed his activity. The sources noted that the doctors advised 'Arafat to get some rest. However, this advice is not new. Such advice has been given to him several times in the past because of his hectic activity and frequent travel. Regarding the rumors circulated by Western and Israeli media that 'Arafat has divorced his wife Suha Tawil, the Palestinian sources said these rumors are untrue and that 'Arafat and his wife are leading a normal life. The Palestinian sources said that the recent rumors of 'Arafat's illness and his divorce are an attempt to divert attention from the course of peace and the gains which 'Arafat, his negotiators, and the PLO Executive Committee members have achieved. The sources said that these rumors are part of a plan of provocation and attrition that began with the campaign on 'Arafat following his address at a Johannesburg mosque in which he spoke about a jihad to liberate Palestine. These rumors then turned into a media campaign against 'Arafat and Suha Tawil. The sources did not rule out that this campaign will continue before and after 'Arafat's return to Jericho.
