After conscientiously listening to detailed reports on enterprises production and operations, product marketing, circulation funds, the transformation of operational mechanisms, and so on, Secretary Xie Fei asked many specific questions. On the morning of 3 June, Secretary Xie Fei held talks with comrades in charge of a number of light and textile industrial enterprises based in the Guangzhou area. The comrades in charge of Guangzhou Bandao Electric Appliances Company, Guangzhou Baiyunshan Joint-Stock Company Ltd., Guangzhou Huanan Sewing Equipment Company, and Guangzhou Wuyang Bicycle Company briefed Secretary Xie Fei on production, operations, and the transformation of operational mechanisms this year. After being told that the above-mentioned enterprises have gradually extricated themselves from a difficult position to varying degrees, worked out new development strategies in accordance with the new reform measures introduced by the state since the start of this year, and achieved initial results in all areas of endeavor, Secretary Xie Fei said that whether Guangzhou would be able to maintain the traditional superiority of its light industry will largely depend on enterprises' reform, readjustment, and reorganization, as well as the development of new and quality products. We should make every possible endeavor to explore a new road to this end. Speaking of the problems facing enterprises at the moment, such as heavy burdens, a lack of circulation funds, and so on, Secretary Xie Fei noted that it is necessary to enhance determination and redouble efforts in this regard to basically resolve these problems over the next two years. At present, we must be determined to seize each and every opportunity to resolve these problems and make sound and concrete macroeconomic decisions to this end rather than shouting empty slogans. We should allocate more human resources to this area of endeavor. On the morning of 4 June, Secretary Xie Fei held talks with comrades in charge of a number of heavy industrial and chemical enterprises based in the Guangzhou area. Comrades in charge of Guangzhou Iron and Steel Company Ltd., Guangzhou Heavy Machinery Plant, Guangzhou Petrochemical Plant, Fangcheng International Joint-Stock Company Ltd., and Guangzhou Paper Company Ltd. briefed Secretary Xie Fei on their development in great detail. After listening to the reports, Secretary Xie Fei pointed out that, by and large, large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises based in the Guangzhou area have already improved their operations to a certain extent. This shows that we have done a lot of work in this area and that these large and medium-sized enterprises have built a solid basis over the past decades and are now capable of enduring all types of trials. I am confident about improving their operations still further in the years to come. In all senses, large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises based in the Guangzhou area have always been in an extremely important position in the province. Given Guangdong's actual conditions, it is all the more necessary to maintain a large batch of large and medium-sized enterprises which can serve as Guangdong's industrial backbone and pillar, thereby pushing ahead with the province's overall industrial growth. Secretary Xie Fei also gave the following three instructions concerning the development of Guangzhou's large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises: 1) clearly define property rights relations and transform large and medium-sized enterprises into genuine legal entities enjoying operational decisionmaking powers; 2) establish a strict and scientific enterprise management system within each large and medium-sized enterprise; 3) Guarantee large and medium-sized enterprises have advanced production expertise and equipment. Secretary Xie Fei maintained: So long as we work hard and strive for new breakthroughs in these three areas, Guangdong-based large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises will certainly be able to shake off their heavy burdens, improve efficiency, and take on a completely new look in the near future. To achieve this, we must make redoubled efforts to improve work in this area.
