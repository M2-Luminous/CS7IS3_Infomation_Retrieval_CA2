FBIS4-29477 "dreas118__a94026" FBIS-EAS-94-118-A Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Majority of House Members Favor Tax Hike Majority of House Members Favor Tax Hike OW1706085294 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 15 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1706085294 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted a poll of all House of Representative members 4-11 June to survey their views on raising the consumption tax rate (currently 3 percent), which has been a focal point in reforming the current tax system. The poll found that more than 60 percent of the 468 lower house members surveyed conditionally favored raising the consumption tax rate. They are believed to have favored raising the tax rate out of their judgment that the consumption tax rate has to be raised to prepare for a society of senior citizens and out of the need to secure financial resources to make up for fiscal shortfalls resulting from continued cuts in the income and resident taxes. They favored raising the consumption tax rate on condition that administrative reform is promoted and the current tax profit [ekizei] is abolished. Many of the lower house members, who conditionally favored raising the consumption tax rate, proposed raising it by 5 percent. Meanwhile, about one-fourth of the lower house members surveyed opposed raising the tax rate. Asked how they will deal with a bill on raising the consumption tax rate if it is submitted to the Diet for deliberation, 295 lower house members answered, "We will conditionally vote for it," while 22 lower house members answered, "We will unconditionally vote for it." The number of those legislators represented more than 67.7 percent of the total legislators surveyed. Meanwhile, 124 lawmakers said, "We will vote against it," while 27 lawmakers said, "We have no position." With regard to conditions cited by the representatives for favoring the raise of the consumption tax rate, 196 representatives said, "A concrete goal must be set for administrative reform," while 110 representatives said, "The tax profit must be abolished." Eighty-six representatives said, "The financial resources of the local autonomous governments must be increased," while 66 representatives said, "Daily necessities including food must be excluded from taxation." As reasons for opposing an increase in the consumption tax rate, some lower house members said, "A comprehensive taxation system must be introduced, the current unfair system must be redressed, and the tax profit must be abolished before the consumption tax rate is raised," while other lower house members surveyed said, "The debate should be held to discuss whether or not to raise the consumption tax rate three years later, when the economy is expected to recover." By political party, among the ruling parties, one member each from the Japan New Party and Komeito said, "We oppose raising the consumption tax rate"; while three members from Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], two members from Komeito, and one member each from the Japan New Party, the New Party Mirai, the parliamentary group Kaishin, and the independent group said, "We have no position." An overwhelming majority of the lower house members surveyed said, "We conditionally favor raising the consumption tax rate." Two members from Sakigake [Harbinger Party] favored raising the tax rate, 20 members conditionally favored raising the tax rate, and no Sakigake members opposed raising the tax rate. Meanwhile, 35 members Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] members "opposed" raising the consumption tax rate, while 33 party "conditionally favored" raising the tax rate. This reveals that the SDPJ was still strongly reacting against raising the consumption tax rate. From the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], 107 members "conditionally favored" raising the tax rate, while 70 "opposed" raising the tax rate. All 15 Japan Communist Party members "opposed" raising the tax rate. Asked about a proper percentage to be raised in the consumption tax rate, 76 lower house members who favored raising the consumption tax rate answered by citing a figure. Thirty-six lower house members cited "5 percent," 28 cited "7 percent," and nine cited "6 percent." About 60 percent of them cited 5 or 6 percent, a figure falling short of the 7 percent envisioned by the national welfare tax plan. A large number of the lower house members surveyed cited the administrative reform and the redress of the unfair tax system as their conditions for favoring an increase of the consumption tax rate. This indicates their strong belief that raising the tax rate should be curbed in anticipation of increased tax revenues that would come after the government cuts back its spending and the unfair tax system is redressed.
