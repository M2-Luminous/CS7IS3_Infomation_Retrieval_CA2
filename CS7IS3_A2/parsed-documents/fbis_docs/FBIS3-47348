The ruling and opposition camps agreed later to pick panel member Yubun Ueno as successor to Shoji Motooka as committee chairman. Both Ueno and Motooka are members of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan], the largest among the seven parties in the ruling coalition. The committee voted 17-16 to pass the motion submitted by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], the main opposition party. Members of the LDP, the Japanese Communist Party and the Niin Club, a small group of upper house members, voted for the motion. The resolution is legally not binding and only reflects the committee's feelings, Diet officials said. The LDP's motion was an apparent bid to slow the passage of government-proposed political reform bills through the upper house, coalition sources said. The main opposition party accused Motooka of ignoring the LDP's objections to the holding of a vote two days before to set the date of a public hearing on January 17. The setting of the hearing paves way for the ruling coalition to vote on the reform bills. Coalition sources said the ruling parties may vote on the package of four reform bills in the committee on January 18 and at a plenary session the following day. If the bills pass the second chamber without being modified, they will become law since the House of Representatives has already approved them. The bills call for introducing single-seat constituencies combined with proportional representation for House of Representatives general elections and imposing stricter controls on political funding. Both ruling and opposition parties say the current multi-seat election constituencies are money guzzling and the root cause of political corruption. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his political future on the enactment of the bills.
