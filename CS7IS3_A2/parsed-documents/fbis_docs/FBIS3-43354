FBIS3-43354 "drafr003_c_94022" FBIS-AFR-94-003 Document Type:Daily Report 5 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 5 Jan MB0501134394 MB0501134394 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Action Needed on Peacekeeping Force -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 5 January in a page 10 editorial notes that the 27 April election "is supposedly to be policed by a body that does not yet exist, the National Peacekeeping Force. Unless work takes place at the speed of greased lightening, we could have a problem." "It is now much too late to ask the United Nations for an international contingent. The National Peacekeeping Force is the most vital single bridgehead on the next leg of the forward path. Get moving." BUSINESS DAY Too Late for Peacekeeping Force Before April Election -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 5 January in a page 6 editorial says there is "a strong case" for a national peacekeeping force, but the project "has been left so late, and political problems are so complex, that there seems little chance it would be ready in time to accomplish anything. It would be better to scrap the idea than thrust responsibility on to an inadequate, poorly trained force." BUSINESS DAY advises the Transitional Executive Council, TEC to "lower its sights, form a small, symbolic squad for special duties, and concentrate its efforts on restructuring the security forces as a whole." SOWETAN TEC Must `Be Seen To Have Teeth' -- The TEC will have to "define its role very clearly if the institution is to gain credibility," remarks Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 5 January in a page 6 editorial. "It will also have to be seen to have teeth to earn respect." The TEC gas asked the government to deploy the South African Police in northern Natal, including parts of kwaZulu, but the government says "it is still studying the request." The TEC has ordered the kwaZulu Commissioner of Police to supply it with information about alleged hit squads in his force. The kwaZulu chief minister "has stopped him from co-operating with the TEC." Now the African National Congress, ANC, "seems set to ask it to intervene in the purchase by kwaZulu of a luxury R[rand]33 million jet. The TEC will have to strenuously avoid being seen as a tool of the ANC in its fight against the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. It has to work on projecting an image of impartiality." ILANGA New South Africa Can Only Hope for 'Gradual Change' -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu for 30 December to 1 January in a page 4 editorial says: "The hot topic these days among many people is that 1994 heralds a new South Africa. We believe that the black nation can hardly wait to leave apartheid behind. Let us, however, give a word of caution! To some, this new South Africa spells heaven on earth. You hear them say: Come oh new South Africa and let us eat well, live in new houses. Even among school pupils you hear things like: Even if we fail come year's end, it will not mean much, because in the new South Africa it will be pass one pass all. No such thing will happen. Those who imagine that come 27 April this country will be a land flowing with honey are to be pitied as they live in a fool's paradise. All that can be hoped for is that if all goes well politically, things will gradually change for the better, but not in the blinking of an eye." "The new South Africa will yield good and enjoyable results only if we all work with determination to make it so in all aspects of life, and not just in the political field."
