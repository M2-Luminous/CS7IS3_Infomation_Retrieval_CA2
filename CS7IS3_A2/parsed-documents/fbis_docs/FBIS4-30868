In reply to a question by Bojan Veselinovic, Drnovsek said that if it were not for the well-known Klagenfurt incident, Bizjak still would have been minister. Dr. Janez Drnovsek also said: [Begin recording] [Drnovsek] I have decided to accept the resignation of Minister Bizjak. I believe that by offering his resignation Minister Bizjak has acted in a principled and correct manner and that I must act likewise and accept his resignation. I believe that this will facilitate and safeguard consolidation within the Interior Ministry. [Veselinovic] Would you have decided to replace Minister Bizjak even if the Klagenfurt incident had not happened? [Drnovsek] I believe that the direct reason for this replacement is the Klagenfurt incident, that this is a question of objective responsibility just as was the case with [former Defense] Minister Jansa. [end recording] [Veselinovic] When asked whether he had proposed to Minister Bizjak that he replace Vinko Beznik, head of the special police troops, and Mitja Klavora, head of the Crime Department, even before the Klagenfurt robbery, Drnovsek replied: not directly, even though he had proposed, on the basis of the debate over the government report on the Depala Vas incident, that Bizjak take adequate measures within the ministry, including personnel measures. [Begin recording] [Veselinovic] Therefore, if the personnel changes had been carried out and there had been no Klagenfurt incident, hypothetically speaking Ivo Bizjak would have still been the interior minister? [Drnovsek] That is so. [end recording] [Veselinovic] In the next few days Drnovsek will send a proposal for the new interior minister to the State Chamber, which will merely be informed of the acceptance of Bizjak's resignation. Drnovsek did not comment on the names of the two candidates known for far, for new interior minister. He only said that he will decide in the next few days when, in accordance with the coalition agreement, the Christian Democrats will propose a candidate who will also have to be acceptable for him as the prime minister.
