Here is our Kazan correspondent Zhaudat Aminov. [Aminov] At a news conference given straight after the signing of the agreement it was said that an agreement of this kind strengthens Russia as a great and distinctive state that contains many curious phenomenon. Boris Yeltsin is perhaps the only person in Russia's leadership who really understands what a federation is, Yuriy Spiridonov said. It is good that he is president, Mintimer Shaymiyev said, agreeing. Both leaders believe that the time is not far off when the federation treaty issue will have to be tackled again and the federation will be built up from below, taking into account the interests of the republics and the regions. Russia's oil-producing regions, which include Tatarstan and Komi, today founded a consortium to jointly manage the export of fuel. The agreement promises to be mutually advantageous. Both leaders agreed on closer cooperation at the Federation Council level, too, although they were of the opinion that that body had yet to assume a proper role and did not have any real influence on the situation.
