FR940810-0-00191 FR940810-0-00021 Table 1._Respiratory Protection for Asbestos Fibers 1Airborne concentration of asbestos or conditions of use 1Required respirator Not in excess of 1 f/cc (10) X PEL), or otherwise as required independent of exposure pursuant to (h)(2)(iv) Half-mask air purifying respirator other than a disposable respirator, equipped with high efficiency filters. Not in excess of 5 f/cc (50 X PEL) Full facepiece air-purifying respirator equipped with high efficiency filters. Not in excess of 10 f/cc (100 X PEL) Any powered air-purifying respirator equipped with high efficiency filters or any supplied air respirator operated in continuous flow mode. Not in excess of 100 f/cc (1,000 X PEL) Full facepiece supplied air respirator operated in pressure demand mode. Greater than 100 f/cc (1,000 X PEL) or unknown concentration Full facepiece supplied air respirator operated in pressure demand mode, equipped with an auxiliary positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus. Note: a. Respirators assigned for high environmental concentrations may be used at lower concentrations, or when required respirator use is independent of concentration. b. A high efficiency filter means a filter that is at least 99.97 percent efficient against mono-dispersed particles of 0.3 micrometers in diameter or larger.
