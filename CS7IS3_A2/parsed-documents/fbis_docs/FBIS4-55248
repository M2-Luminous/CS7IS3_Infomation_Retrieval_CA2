During a meeting today with Nikola Koljevic, RS vice president, and RS Health Minister Dragan Kalinic, Mrs. Abuzaid said this move was made because of a security threat to UNHCR personnel following the UN decision that Serb targets can be bombed without previous announcement. Humanitarian aid to the people in the Srpska republic will from now on be delivered via Belgrade, which is seen as technically more complicated.
