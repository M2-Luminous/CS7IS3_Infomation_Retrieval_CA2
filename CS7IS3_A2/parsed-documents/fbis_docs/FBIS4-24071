Commenting on Finance Minister Derek Keys's budget speech, NP spokesman Danie du Plessis said the budget was the product of negotiation within the government of national unity and contained sufficient elements to promote growth. However, he expressed reservations about the one-off levy to cover the costs of the transition. "The functioning of the Independent Electoral Commission and its lack of financial discipline which the taxpayer now has to account for is an example of how state expenditure should not occur." If the government kept strictly to the budget, South Africa would reap the fruits. But if insufficient discipline was exercised over state expenditure, taxpayers would face an increasing burden. "Extravagant promises by some ANC ministers have already made the danger lights flicker. All ministers must now realise that they can only make promises within the framework of the budget."
