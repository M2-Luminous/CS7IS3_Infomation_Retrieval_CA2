FR940727-0-00043 FR940727-0-00020 4. We have also decided not to accept under section 4(g)(3) gifts of travel expenses for attendance at meetings that are governed by the regulations implementing 31 U.S.C. 1353, the government-wide travel reimbursement statute. The GSA rules implementing section 1353 prohibit agencies from using general gift acceptance statutes to accept travel reimbursement for attendance at meetings that are covered by that section. As we noted in the NPRM, however, GSA's rules implementing 1353 do not govern the acceptance of travel and related expenses for attendance at, or participation in, meetings or events that are required to carry out an agency's statutory or regulatory functions. We agree with commenters that there are substantial public interest benefits to be gained by employees' attendance at, or participation in, certain government sponsored meetings or events (such as international coordination meetings provided for by treaty). Thus, to the extent that attendance at, or participation in, government sponsored meetings or events are deemed outside the scope of 1353 coverage (because the meetings are required in order to carry out statutory or regulatory functions) we will permit the acceptance of travel reimbursement for them under section 4(g)(3). 5. The Commission has established the imposition of mandatory factors that Commission officials must consider in determining whether conflicts or appearance problems may exist. Where gifts are offered by a regulated entity, we will require officials making conflict of interest determinations to evaluate at the outset the extent to which benefits of the gift might accrue to individual employees. If the gift does benefit an individual employee, agency officials shall consider whether that employee is responsible for matters affecting the potential donor that are currently pending before the agency and the significance of the employee's role in such matters. Whether or not the proposed gift benefits employees personally, we will consider: the nature and sensitivity of any matters pending at the Commission affecting the regulated source and the timing of the gift; the market value of the gift; and the frequency of gifts made by a particular donor. Finally, we have adopted public disclosure and reporting requirements that are intended to minimize or eliminate appearance problems. The Commission will keep a detailed record of all gifts accepted from prohibited sources and make the following information publicly available concerning gifts that are accepted: the identity of the prohibited source; a description of the gift; market value of the gift; documentation concerning the prohibited source's reason for the gift; a verification from the prohibited source that the gift is unconditional (not contingent on any promise or expectation that the Commission's receipt of the gift will benefit the donor in any regulatory matter); and the date the gift is accepted by the Commission. The Commission shall file a semi-annual report to Congress listing the gift, donor, and value of all gifts accepted from any donor under section 4(g)(3) authority. Conclusion 6. We believe that, as mandated by section 4(g)(3) of the Communications Act, the regulations adopted here will preclude real and apparent conflicts of interest when the Commission exercises its new gift acceptance authority. In order to ensure the integrity of our process, we have, as discussed above, adopted numerous safeguards which will require careful consideration of conflicts of interest issues by impartial agency ethics officials. Our rules will also ensure that our actions implementing this authority are exposed to the fullest possible public and congressional scrutiny.
