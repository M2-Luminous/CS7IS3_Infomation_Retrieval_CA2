FBIS4-9787 "drlat064_a_94017" FBIS-LAT-93-064 Daily Report 3 Apr 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Ambassador: Havana To Court More Foreign Capital Ambassador: Havana To Court More Foreign Capital PA0404043794 Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2216 GMT 3 Apr 94 PA0404043794 Hamburg DPA Spanish BFN [Text] Montevideo, 3 Apr (DPA) -- Today, Cuban Ambassador to Uruguay Manuel Aguilera said the government of Cuban President Fidel Castro may be willing to allow foreign investors to play a greater role in the country's enterprises. The diplomatic spokesman added, "We in the Castro administration are resorting to mechanisms that are even more flexible than those adopted by the PRC when it began implementing its economic reforms. The mechanisms are so flexible that we may even consider making some exceptions." Aguilera, who recently took office, pointed out that although Cuba insists on maintaining its position of using "mostly Cuban capital" within the majority of joint enterprises, "we are willing to make exceptions in cases of national interest." In an interview granted to LA REPUBLICA newspaper, Aguilera stressed, "there could be a case of a joint enterprise in which the state would not own most of the stock; that is, most of the capital would come from a foreign firm or from several foreign firms." As for Cuba's opposition to implementing a free market economy, Aguilera explained that in order to move forward, "we must create innovative methods that allow us not only to retain the ownership of our basic means of production and resources, but also to unleash certain forces [liberen determinadas fuerzas]." Havana's representative in Montevideo said that the unleashing of these forces "will create a tangible Cuban presence in international markets by way of joint enterprises. This is why we are opening the country (Cuba) to foreign capital; we need resources, technology, and markets." Aguilera's statements were disclosed just before Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's 4 April arrival. Robaina is scheduled to make a three-day official visit to Uruguay. Uruguayan political circles are viewing Robaina's arrival with heightened interest because a foreign minister under the Castro administration has not visited this South American country since 1986, when former President Julio Maria Sanguinetti was in power. The last trip made by a Cuban foreign minister to Uruguay took place 20 years after the two countries broke off bilateral diplomatic relations. One diplomatic source in Montevideo reported that after meeting with Uruguayan President Luis Lacalle and other prominent individuals, Robaina will visit Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay.
