The final communique reflects the issues discussed at the meeting: The Mozambican Government continues to strictly adhere to the General Peace Accord. Although the international community is assisting in the implementation of the General Peace Accord and in the democratization of the Mozambican society, Frelimo's Central Committee noted with apprehension the patronizing attitude that some members of the international community have shown toward Renamo on a number of occasions, as well as the actions aimed at downplaying the seriousness of the violations of the General Peace Accord, and underestimating Renamo's maneuvers to avoid fulfilling the agreed timetables. In complete disregard of its public statements on the upholding of democracy and human rights, Renamo continues to prevent the access and movement of citizens in areas under its control, thereby violating the General Peace Accord. Moreover, Renamo prohibits economic activities -- namely, hunting, fishing, and logging in areas under its control in violation of the spirit and letter of the General Peace Accord and the Constitution of the Republic.
