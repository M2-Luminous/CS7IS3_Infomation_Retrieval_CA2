"The Chinese Government believes that although there are some difficulties for resolving this issue, there is, after all, room and possibility for striking a proper settlement," Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said. "So long as the parties concerned display sincerity and hold dialogue on an equal footing," he said, "it is possible to have these difficulties overcome." Shen refused to say whether China would use its veto to block other UN Security Council members from implementing sanctions, but indicated they were opposed to heavy-handed sanctions. "At this time, we do not favor a resort to means that might sharpen the confrontation," he said while calling on the parties involved to "remain calm." North Korea has been involved in a 16-month confrontation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the U.S. over verification of its suspected nuclear weapons program.
