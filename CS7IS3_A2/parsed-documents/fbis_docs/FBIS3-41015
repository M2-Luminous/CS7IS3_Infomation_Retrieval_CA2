What Lies in Store for Baykonur?"] [Text] The mass media of many countries readily publish materials on the fate of Baykonur Cosmodrome. The business, scientific, and political world is concerned about the problem of preserving this unique creation of human hands. "Farewell, Baykonur," "The Destruction of Baykonur Is the Tragedy of the Century," "Nightmare at the Cosmodrome" -- this is a far from complete list of the headlines in Russian and foreign newspapers and magazines. But what is the true state of affairs? In an attempt to answer this question, representatives of the U.S. firm of Anser [name as transliterated] -- Messrs. R. Dalby and B. Alexander -- visited Baykonur last year. After spending less than two days at the cosmodrome and viewing the launch and technical complexes of the Soyuz, Proton, and Energiya carrier rockets (30 minutes at each complex), the guests happily set off home. Not even a high-class specialist is able to assess the technical condition of very complex systems in such a short space of time, apart from forming an impression of their outward appearance. But the U.S. experts drew hasty conclusions without a moment's hesitation: "The breakup of the USSR has not affected Baykonur's potential." In their haste the gentlemen from across the ocean did not attach any significance to the following "trifle": Of the 40 major organizations involved in implementing space programs in past years, just over 10 are left today. The test cosmodrome now functions only thanks to military specialists carrying out their official duty in bleak climatic conditions and in the humiliating position of an indeterminate legal status. The potential of the military contingent, which is fatigued as a result of everyday troubles, is not infinite, however. Meanwhile, the U.S. experts maintain that the tragic situation in which the servicemen find themselves has been "greatly and deliberately" exaggerated. This is allegedly being done for the sole purpose of "squeezing" more money out of the government. But why did the Americans need to "put a gloss" on the situation? It is no secret that a worldwide struggle is being waged for a place in the "space Klondyke." And anything goes in this struggle, as the saying goes. Baykonur really is in need of serious assistance to maintain impeccable technical readiness. One or two glitches in carrying out international programs, and it would mean the end of the world reputation of the unique complex. Is this not the version that the gentlemen from Anser had in mind? P. Berlin, another U.S. expert, is still more subtly cunning when he concludes: "The risk in contracts for commercial launches appears insignificant." In short, the cosmodrome is in full order, with the exception that there is "no comfort" at Leninsk. Not that this will hamper commercial launches in any way. And yet Mr. Berlin must know that it is only possible to win the competition for a commercial satellite launch by giving the client solid service, including a high-class hotel, "car keys," excellent roads to the launch site, and so on. Leninsk is not ready for this today. Additional capital investments are also needed, otherwise Russia will quit the space market empty-handed. More than 20 delegations from the United States, France, Germany, India, Turkey, and other countries have visited the cosmodrome recently. Guests arrive at the invitation and under the patronage of Russian firms such as the "Energiya" Science and Production Association, the M.V. Khrunichev Association, the Space Research Institute, the Russian Space Agency, and the National Aerospace Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The delegations are different, but they are all united by one thing: Not once has anyone deemed it necessary to notify the cosmodrome's command of their visit. On the other hand, both the Kazakhstani press and Russian newspapers keep "chewing" over an old story with a persistence worthy of better application -- the cosmodrome's servicemen want to create a military space base on the republic's territory. The local newspaper altogether accuses us of wishing to "militarize space." The most popular "refrain" in numerous local press statements is the assertion that the Republic of Kazakhstan is the cosmodrome's master. Askar Nurmanov, a specialist of the Kazakhstani Aerospace Agency, declared: "We unexpectedly found ourselves the possessors of such a structure and were not ready to exploit it." I will comment that considerable funds, in addition to high-class specialists (whom Kazakhstan does not have today), are needed for the normal "exploitation" of the cosmodrome. According to last year's estimates, 38 billion rubles are needed annually. Until this year, however, this sum was distributed between Russia and Kazakhstan in the following proportion: Russia paid 94 percent, and Kazakhstan just 6 percent. Since Baykonur is located on Kazakhstani soil, this implied that the rest was covered by leasing the land allocated to the cosmodrome and the landing zone. As far as this is legitimate, let the economists and financiers -- in short, those whose job it is -- resolve matters. To date a whole package of documents regulating many questions has already been adopted. There is the creation of an open-type joint-stock company at the cosmodrome. The granting of privileges to all specialists who come to us to work. Finally, a memorandum has been signed which attempts to regulate the interests of all the sides involved in fulfilling space programs. Unfortunately, as practice has shown, many documents do not entirely remove the tension. But the main point is that efforts are being made to this end. We are prepared to meet journalists and experts, specialists and dilettantes, to show and tell them everything the way it is. Our only request is one which Mikhail Bulgakov expressed exhaustively on addressing young litterateurs: "Write what you see, and do not write what you do not see!"
