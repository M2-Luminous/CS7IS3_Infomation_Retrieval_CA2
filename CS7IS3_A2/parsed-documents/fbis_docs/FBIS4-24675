Half of the output value created by farmers in the rural areas has come from scientific upgrading. Southern Jiangsu, in the Chang Jiang River delta, covers 12 counties and cities under the jurisdiction of the cities of Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou. The gross domestic product in the area has increased by 19.6 percent yearly since 1978, when China started its rural reform featuring the contract responsibility system with a family as the basic unit. "Such a rate has exceeded the early economic development stage of Japan and the Republic of Korea," a local official said. According to international standards, southern Jiangsu has entered the initial stage of modernization in agriculture, rural industrialization and urbanization. These 12 counties and cities have been listed by the central government among the 100 counties in China with strong economic power. The official noted that the average living space per capita, the expenditure on clothes, recreation and education and medical care, and the life-span of the people in most of these counties have surpassed the government-set quotas for a relatively comfortable life in rural areas. He attributed the rapid economic growth in these counties to the popularization of science and technology. A survey shows that more than 50,000 rural industrial enterprises in southern Jiangsu Province have established cooperative relations of various kinds with over 1,000 research institutions, universities and colleges. More than 10,000 scientists and technicians across the country have settled down in these counties to help with economic expansion. "Such a huge project to invite so many highly-trained people to work here was beyond the government's administrative capacity," the official noted. By now, every county or city in southern Jiangsu has set up science development funds and agricultural development funds. The annual amount of funds in science development allocated by the county and township governments accounts for at least one percent of the government's financial expenditure. One example is Wuxi county, which spent 460 million yuan in 1992, 1.28 billion yuan last year and three billion yuan this year on science and technology. The county has contracted for 902 provincial and national projects for the development of sciences and new products over the past three years. So far, southern rural Jiangsu has set up over 800 scientific research institutions employing 200,000 scientists and technicians. These institutions turn out more than 2,000 new research findings and products a year. According to the official, the popularization of science and technology has helped widen the general knowledge and skills of rural laborers. The nine-year compulsory education has been popularized in the 12 counties, where at least 90 percent of the rural industrial staff and workers have received technical training. The official noted that a modern rural area with booming economy, developed science, beautiful surroundings and socialist civilization is being formed in southern Jiangsu Province.
