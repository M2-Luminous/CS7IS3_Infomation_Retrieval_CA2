Convention on the Law of the Sea goes into effect, a Foreign Ministry official said Friday. He said, "After the convention takes effect this coming November, those countries which have been registered as pioneer investors at the United Nations hold prior rights to developing the seabed." The government held an economic ministers' meeting late last year to discuss the issue and sent the application to the United Nations on Jan. 14. "This application is to secure a mining area in the deep seabed development system of advanced nations including Japan and France," he said. The area, called "the Clarion Clipperton fracture," holds deposits of about 40 billion tons of manganese, about 50 times as much as the estimated deposits of the element under the continents, and various natural resources including cobalt, copper and nickel. The area is between longitude 124 and 138 degrees west and between latitude 9 and 18 degrees north, according to Ministry officials. The U.N. technical experts' group will review the South Korean application and then the U.N. preparation committee is expected to register South Korea's rights as a pioneer investor around August. South Korea has invested about 45 million U.S. dollars in exploring for promising seabed areas over the last 10 years, the officials said.
