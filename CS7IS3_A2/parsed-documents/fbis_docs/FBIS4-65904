In an interview with LES ECHOS, Defense Minister Francois Leotard pointed out that his bill is merely the expression of choices which are in line with the defense white paper. He explained his decision to give priority to ongoing production activities to the detriment of research, and acknowledged that he has changed his position on the antimissile defense projects. From the industrial point of view, he affirmed that he had confidence in companies and wanted to leave strategic choices up to them. Lastly, he gave an initial estimate of the cost of France's foreign operations in 1994, which should total Fr3.3 billion, a figure which includes the scaling down of troops in the former Yugoslavia. He hopes that this will be financed, like last year, by the supplementary budget. [LES ECHOS] The military programming law should be passed by the entire political class, including the Socialists. This lack of controversy, does it not show that those who accuse you of having postponed all the important choices, were right? [Leotard] There have been and there will be debates, but the bill should be passed with broad approval. I understand this very well and I hoped for it, because when the security of our country is at stake, it is best to avoid party squabbling. The agreement of the three major political groupings would be a good thing. It would show that we have done our work well. Everyone is aware of the government's desire to make defense a priority. The figures included in the military programming law prove this, since we are increasing our investment regularly until the year 2000. The debate will certainly continue on topics such as nuclear testing or certain armament programmes. However, I vigorously disagree with the allegation that no choices were made in the military programming law. First of all, I have never heard anyone ask for a program to be stopped. Moreover, the bill submitted to Parliament is the expression of choices which are in line with the white paper: the choice of joint Armed Forces; priority to production currently under way; and the reinforcement of conventional forces. It is true that in 1997, decisions will have to be made on a number of programs such as the NH-90 helicopter, the ATF transport plane, or the second aircraft carrier. However, it is not necessary, nor is it possible, to make these decisions before then. [LES ECHOS] Have you made a choice regarding the APTGD (long-range precision weapon) missile? [Leotard] We will make a choice this year. However, I would like to emphasize in this respect that we have planned to earmark funds for the supersonic antiship missile program, the successor to the Exocet, and to do so before 1997. This will allow us to maintain our skills in the area of ramjet engines. [LES ECHOS] You have decided to give preference to ongoing production activities to the detriment of spending for upstream research. Is that not dangerous in the long term given the fact that the United States is doing the opposite? [Leotard] Spending for research is being reduced very slightly as a percentage of equipment expenditure, but as this is increasing in volume, we end up with virtually the same amount in constant francs. However, this is also a choice because we want to emphasize production. The productivity efforts which we initiated must also apply to research. I am convinced that we can do better with the same resources and that this decision in no way and in no sector will compromise France's military research effort. There is still redundancy to be eliminated and rationalization to be made. And this will make it possible to reinforce our efforts in priority areas. I feel that the time has come to put the emphasis on production, because I feel that priority must be given to equipping the Armed Forces. [LES ECHOS] Are you not worried about industrial research agencies? [Leotard] Everyone knows that the armaments industry is experiencing tough times. It is losing jobs. I do not wish to embellish the reality, but we are making the best possible use of our resources to maintain French competence. I cannot see any technological skills which we would be abandoning. [LES ECHOS] Yet, at the same time, you say that they are going to have to be shared or abandoned? [Leotard] Yes, in the future. Successive defense ministers often found themselves faced with a sort of budgetary obstacle which they used to push ahead of them. My concern is to have France get over such obstacles without too many difficulties so that we can appropriately prepare for the coming century. We are at the end of a period in which more than 90 percent of our defense requirements were produced nationally. More European cooperation is emerging on the horizon. We are faced with an alternative: either cooperate, or purchase from abroad, something which we would like to reduce. To this end, we are going to spend Fr1.2 billion per year between 1995 and 2000 on foreign purchases, compared with Fr1.4 billion per year between 1987 and 1994. There is no third option, since it would mean the multiplication of national production by each of the European countries. [LES ECHOS] One year ago, you made a vibrant plea in favor of antimissile defense. That is one of the rare lines of action which has been totally ruled out. What happened? [Leotard] I now have a slightly different approach to the problem. I have observed that in the United States and in Germany the debate on this issue has been marked by a great deal of modesty, not like the enthusiasm of the eighties. As you know, we are devoting considerable debate--and also money--to policies which provide partial solutions to the problem in the knowledge that France alone is not able to solve it all by itself. What we want is to make the Germans our partners in a number of research areas. Within the current context of our research and products, we can provide certain aspects of an antimissile-based defense system. Here I am thinking in particular of the APTGD missile, which is a weapon of retaliation and is therefore part of this type of thinking. The Helios optical observation satellites and Osiris radar are also being actively continued in this spirit. Space observation is of fundamental importance in this area. We must now look and see what we are politically prepared to share with others, such as the warning system. [LES ECHOS] Are you prepared to give the larger part of the Osiris program to the Germans? [Leotard] The Germans seem to be interested in genuine cooperation with us in the area of space intelligence. That is a good thing. In addition, there is indeed a link with the industrial alliance projects currently being negotiated. [LES ECHOS] Is Germany, which is slashing its defense spending, still a reliable partner? [Leotard] In any case, we are in an imbalanced relationship, in that we are increasing our spending when all the other countries are reducing it. This allows France to pull the others along and to keep its lead. Cooperation is, by definition, based on the budget decisions of others. As long as there is no political authority in Europe, or legal structures such as a European armaments agency protecting national budget decisions, we will have this very delicate problem. If the British, German, and French develop a joint strategy in the industrial area, they are literally saving the European defense industry, and that is what I am endeavoring to do. Not a week goes by that I do not have discussions with my German or British counterparts. A very strong political will must be imposed on the military staff and industry. [LES ECHOS] Before moving on to the European stage, should you not first of all successfully complete the industrial restructuring of French firms, as your predecessor began to do? [Leotard] The state certainly has responsibilities and resources, but it does not have heavily influence the decisions of businesses which themselves have been, via the market, the major indicator of their strategy. This does not prevent me from giving support to regrouping operations at European level, which are currently being negotiated, including operations between private companies. I think that the collaboration currently under way, provided it leads to a satisfactory agreement, is the basis of the European defense industry and complies perfectly with the interests of our national industry. As for relations between Aerospatiale and Dassault, I think that this operation is an intelligent one. It should be pursued. Whether or not this should be done by hacking away at it or throwing diktats at it, I do not know. I am not an ideologist. [LES ECHOS] What is your strategy for Dassault? [Leotard] Our duty is to make that company give some thought to the post-Rafale period and open up its long-term prospects: In other words, to push it to move closer to other industrial companies. Dassault is making genuine and courageous efforts to rationalize its plant. It too has its own corporate reason for being. It is a company that makes one of the best products in the world. [LES ECHOS] As regards the rapprochement between Thomson-CSF [Wireless Telegraphy Company] and TCE [Thomson Consumer Electronics], is there still talk about going private again? [Leotard] No. This rapprochement is no longer news. [LES ECHOS] Are you in favor of a rapprochement between CSF and DASA? [Leotard] If plans for a rapprochement were to take shape with regard to part of the activity of these two companies, I would look into it with the concern that it be in line with the highly advanced rapprochement currently emerging between Aerospatiale and DASA. [LES ECHOS] GIAT [Industrial Group for Ground Weapons] Industries has announced poor results. Do you hope to see it recapitalized? [Leotard] It will have to be. The thing that really strikes me, however, is that we are dragging along extremely heavy state structures which are no longer suited to the constraints of the market, with cost levels that are much too high. We must therefore continue down the road taken to adapt to the market. For GIAT Industries, this will involve pursuing efforts to boost productivity. Many of its production centers are still not in a position to produce under good conditions. We have to motivate employees so that the adjustment can be made with the fewest possible social difficulties. This is just as true for GIAT Industries as for other companies. [LES ECHOS] Do you think you will be able to comply with budget restrictions this year? [Leotard] I will have to make efforts like all the ministers due to the reduction in operating expenditure. However, do not forget that the Defense Ministry is the state's leading investor and that it is increasing its efforts throughout the military programming law. [LES ECHOS] What is your estimate of the cost of foreign operations this year? [Leotard] It should total Fr3.3 billion, in terms of remuneration and operating expenses. Nevertheless, we have to remain very cautious. These are only forecasts. In addition, I would like the prime minister to allow us to repeat what happened in 1993. Indeed, for the first time the additional spending on foreign operations was not financed by tapping into spending for defense equipment. The prime minister is well aware of this problem. [LES ECHOS] You have given Army Auditor Yvon Jouan the task of studying weapons exports. In the coming year, do you plan to reform the way in which this activity is organized in France? [Leotard] The system used by the CIEEMG (Interministerial Committee for the Study of Weapons Exports) is very strict and tightly controlled. I feel that this is a good thing. It does not leave room for unexpected increases or for attitudes that run counter to a political will. With regard to the system used by the armaments offices, I personally feel that there must be some rationalization along geographical, institutional, or structural lines. We are working on it.
