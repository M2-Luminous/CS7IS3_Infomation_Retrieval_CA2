Al-Hasan was alluding to the massacre of innocent worshipers at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque during the blessed month of Ramadan. He said in our view and in view of the world, the massacre proved the racist settler trend continues to hold sway in Israel, finding support, cover, and facilities and revealing the bad conditions of the Palestinian people under occupation. Al-Hasan said Israeli crimes continued after the Hebron massacre. The least occurred the day before yesterday, and was committed by Israel after the issuance of Resolution 904, in contempt of all rules of international legitimacy and human values. In a speech at the opening of the 101st session of the Arab League council that began in Cairo today, al-Hasan said this grotesque crime explains to us the importance of the unified Arab stand in affirming the condemnation of Israel and exposing its intentions, and the need to coordinate among the brothers to confront challenges and dangers. Al-Hasan said: In Jordan, we moved on Arab and international levels. We contacted permanent and other members of the UN Security Council. The condemnation of the crime was made plain. We demanded protection for the unarmed Palestinian people. We asked the international community to shoulder its responsibilities and affirmed the need to remove Israeli settlements from the occupied Arab territories.
