The oblast has actively progressive western rayons and passively conservative eastern rayons. These specifics rooted in the historical divisions of the region between various empires only reinforce the negative trend toward an increase in the weight of regional candidates which is caused by the majority electoral system. Consequently in Bukovyna the most formidable basis might exist for the prediction that candidates will give in to the temptation of populist promises colored in keeping with the trends. In addition, it is recalled that during the previous elections the obkom [oblast committee] nomenklatura had no trouble in eastern rayons, where kolkhoz chairmen and Communist Party secretaries "made it" without a hitch, and committed all its propaganda efforts to the west, to Kitsmanskiy, Vizhnitskiy, and Zastavnevskiy Rayons. Little has changed since, except perhaps the fact that the democratic publications of the region call the eastern Khotinskiy, Kelmenetskiy, and Sokiryanskiy Rayons only the preserves, and no longer the strongholds, of communism. In turn, Chernovtsy enjoys the reputation of a politically involved city, and even now many observers believe that the most severe struggle among contenders will break out precisely in the oblast city. Against this background, rayons in which Moldovans and Romanians (20 percent of the population of the oblast) are clustered, especially the recently created Gertsayevskiy Rayon, stand apart. Politicians are uncertain about the tastes of their residents. Some recall the December 1991 referendum in which an overwhelming majority of residents in these rayons voted in favor of Ukrainian independence. Others are concerned about the likelihood of the obstruction of elections by these territories, in which the chauvinistically disposed Eminescu Society subscribing to the position that "Northern Bukovyna has been Romanian land since time immemorial" enjoys a certain influence. Religious factors may also influence the course of the election race and its result. Bukovyna is an area with traditionally strong Christian roots. Periodic flareups of the flame of confrontation between the Kiev and Moscow Patriarchates of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church may force members of the clergy to seek support from political entities and, accordingly, give them concealed support. Out of the three main denominations (the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow and Kiev Patriarchates and the Greek Catholics), the lion's share of parishes (over 300) remain with the first church, with the attendant consequences. Although the 50 parishes of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kiev Patriarchate are a quantitatively small force, one would think it to be sufficient to undermine the image of any contender. Contenders themselves in Bukovyna, where almost 20 political parties, public organizations, and ethnic cultural associations operate, will represent considerably fewer political centers: the party of power, the NRU-KUN [People's Rukh of Ukraine-Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists], the DemPU-URP [Democratic Party of Ukraine-Ukrainian Republican Party], the SPU-KPU [Socialist Party of Ukraine-Communist Party of Ukraine], and the DSU [State Independence of Ukraine]. In the oblast, which is considered both agrarian and industrial, the party of power is realistically capable of controlling the votes of the electorate, particularly in rural areas. The nomenklatura proposes candidates from the power structure of the oblast--popular people who at one time were delegated there by the democrats. After all, it is known that elections establish their own rules of the game. Consequently, not wishing to become members of any party, these politicians may, in order not to lose support, face the option of running as independent candidates but with the blessing of the head of the local state administration. In general, the situation on the eve of the election to the power structures is one of the most piquant in the community of Bukovyna's democrats--if for no other reason than the top leaders of regional Rukh, headed by its chairman Hryhoriy Manchulenko, hold positions in the oblast state administration. This may be the reason NRU spokesmen have so far been keeping the assessment of the activities of the local authorities balanced, thus incurring condemnation by the other wing of the democrats--the Congress of National-Democratic Forces. There is even the suspicion that the NRU has entered into an unadvertised alliance with the party of power. Meanwhile, through almost all of November the NRU and the URP-DemPU called on one another to unite for the sake of opposing the neocommunists in the elections. This resulted in the establishment of the Zlahoda Committee of Democratic Forces. However, before it managed to get on its feet, DemPU leader Taras Kiyak announced, at its oblast conference, the creation of the Poryadok electoral bloc within Zlahoda. In addition to the DemPU, the URP, the "greens," the Prosvita Union of Officers, and farmers who have asked for associate membership in the DemPU agreed to join Poryadok. Having thus distanced itself from Rukh, DemPU merely gave the local mass media the occasion to ponder whether there would be less Zlahoda [accord] with such a Poryadok [order]. However, it appears that everything blew over; at any rate, from the outside it appears that Zlahoda has come to an agreement concerning election strategy and tactics. Meanwhile, the DSU association and the Communists vigorously "reached out to the people." In the political array of Bukovyna, the DSU clearly sympathizes with the URP. Strict discipline and clear-cut slogans of the DSU, which are attractive to voters, fit in harmoniously with the objectives of the already mentioned bloc with the equally expressive name Poryadok. However, DSU leaders offer assurances that they have no intention at all of forming a bloc with anyone. The recently held organizational meeting of the Chernovtsy city committee of the Communists testifies to their organizational activities. The "Reds" are clearly in a hurry to create structures before the election. They are being helped in this by the publication OBYEKTIVNAYA GAZETA, which is known for its criminal disrespect for Ukrainian independence and whose sources of financing are not known. The GAZETA is published and edited by Volodymyr Dovheshko, who is also the first secretary of the KPU oblast committee. Unlike the democrats, the comrade secretary long ago released lists, which his name heads, of candidates for deputies from the KPU. The KPU does not get along well with the local Socialists, who are hardly different from the Communists. That same Dovheshko just recently came from the ranks of the SPU. However, by all signs mutual relations far removed from "comradely" have developed between the two secretaries of the oblast committees of the KPU and SPU (Kostyantin Kovelchuk is the leader of the Socialists in Bukovyna). The KPU is openly accusing the SPU of being soft on all "Bandera's followers." However, it is quite probable that this is merely a tactical device through which the KPU and the SPU want to gain a maximum of the votes of the electorate. In the second 10-day period of December, a "roundtable" panel on "The Crisis in Ukraine and Ways To Overcome It" organized by the New Ukraine association met in Chernovtsy. New Ukrainians who created a center in local areas the year before last and who until recently did not make their presence known in any way suddenly became active. Doctor of Economic Sciences Ihor Shkola, professor of the University of Chernovtsy and cochairman of the local center of New Ukraine, said that he had agreed to the "roundtable" panel on the condition that specific measures for stabilization in the country will be worked out by it. The New Ukrainians of Bukovyna have made decentralization of the economy and the endowment of administrative territories with more extensive rights the cornerstone of their strategy. Here is why. In Bukovyna, New Ukraine is actively supported by the directors of local state enterprises, as well as leading personalities from the oblast state administration. For his part, Professor Shkola is one of the active supporters of a free economic zone whose concept has gone astray in the offices of Kiev but is quite popular in Bukovyna. Perhaps this idea may only be spoiled by "Trojan horses"--candidates for deputies from the outside, mainly from the capital city. According to some reports, the functionary of the Cabinet of Ministers Buzduhan may become one of these candidates. As far as the political associations of entrepreneurs are concerned, no information is available about them. However, almost all observers agree that the local business community will sooner or later articulate its program because even now it has several brilliant personalities in its ranks. Some of the entrepreneurs have probably already placed their bets on the candidates of national-democratic forces. There are reports about businessmen sounding out the positions of probable candidates from the party of power. As far as predictions are concerned, candidates who are supported by strong, organized groups that have actually been created already although not proclaimed will win. On the other hand, candidates enjoying the patronage of the power structure will have a chance in rural rayons. After that, the democratic nominees will stand a real chance in Chernovtsy and one or two rayons of the oblast, whereas in other rayons, candidates of the party of power or those supported by it will win. However it will be possible to consider even this outcome of elections favorable, if it materializes, because the current deputies of the Supreme Council from Bukovyna which have been dispatched there by the late CPSU have for a long time now represented nobody aside from themselves. The move by which the KPU and the SPU want to get [published item ends in mid-sentence]
