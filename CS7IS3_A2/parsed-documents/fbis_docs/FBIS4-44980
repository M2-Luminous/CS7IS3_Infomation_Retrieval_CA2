The term of the present Assembly expires in March 1995. Mr. Yadav claimed that the ruling Janata Dal and its allies would get two-third of the seats. He expressed hope that by then the voter's identity cards, as directed by the Election Commission, would be ready. He said the State was prepared to spend 50 per cent of Rs 100 crores required for the purpose. Mr. Yadav told reporters that the Vaishali Lok Sabha by-election was a dress rehearsal before the Assembly elections. He denied that there was any criticism in the party over the selection of the Janata Dal candidate for the by-election. He said, "We needed Mrs. Kishori Sinha. We did not want to take any risk about it". He said that he wanted to dispel the charges against the Dal that the party was biased against the upper castes. Mrs. Sinha had filed her nomination as a Janata Dal candidate after resigning from the Congress(I). Mr. Yadav said that the Congress(I) should not complain about the defection of Mrs. Sinha since the Central Government had survived because of defections. He quipped that Mr. Ram Lakhan Singh was most competent to speak on the subject. The Chief Minister expressed his unhappiness, over the leakage of letters written by two Janata Dal M.P.s -- Mr. Nitish Kumar and Mr. Brishen Patel --which reached the Press before he received them. However, he did not want to discuss the letters. He also refused to answer questions pertaining to Mr. Patel's criticism regarding his style of functioning. He described the M.P.s as his younger brothers. But he said that the people who had been helped by him earlier were now speaking against him. He said that the M.P.s were not fit to pass such comments.
