Talking to the deputies of the Midi-Pyrenees region within the framework of the nationwide debate on reorganizing national and regional authority, which should result in a proposal in the spring on a reorganization strategy, Mr. Balladur stressed that it was important "in the future for Aerospatiale to be able to enter into alliances essential to its development," adding that "the government will examine this issue in due time." In addition, the prime minister explained that the 2 February decision by the government to increase Aerospatiale's capital by 2 billion French francs was indicative of "its willingness" to support this sector even under "difficult budgetary conditions." Aerospatiale features on the list of public companies which the government plans to privatize. However, several members of the government have repeatedly said that Aerospatiale's privatization is not planned before 1995. President Francois Mitterrand himself opposes this privatization on national interest grounds. Mr. Balladur remarked that "he did not see any need to keep bringing up this issue, which is not on the agenda right now and not for some more years to come." Speaking in more general terms, he assured that the government is "very alert" to difficulties encountered by [defense] companies and that he "vigorously supports corporate reconversion processes, closely scrutinizes corporate social plans, and strengthens national companies whenever possible." Moreover, with regard to the more equal geographic distribution of public research in France, the prime minister explained that "it is not a matter of finding new research facilities in the provinces," but "rather of defining the conditions that would allow scientists from these regions to successfully take part in international competition."
