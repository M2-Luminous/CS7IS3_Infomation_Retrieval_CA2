FR940426-0-00089 FR940426-0-00019 Executive Order 12866 The contents of this announcement have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order, the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of the criteria in this announcement. The potential costs associated with the criteria in this announcement are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these criteria the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the criteria justify the costs. The Secretary has also determined that the criteria in this announcement do not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. The criteria in this announcement are consistent with the requirements of the HEA and promote the President's priorities. Waiver of Rulemaking It is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. The Secretary has consulted with the members of the Direct Student Loan Regulations Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee in the development of the criteria in this announcement, and many of the comments of those members have been adopted. However, the timely implementation of the Direct Loan Program for the 1995&hyph;1996 academic year does not permit the solicitation of further public comment on the criteria for origination for that year. To ensure successful implementation of the Direct Loan Program in the second year, schools need to receive program and software training, integrate Direct Loan Program materials into school publications, and interface Direct Loan software and origination procedures with the school's own systems and procedures. The Secretary believes that the training of school personnel, the development and distribution of materials, and the updating of Direct Loan systems and procedures must begin by June 1994. These preparations require that the Secretary, as soon as possible, initiate the school selection process and prescribe the standards and procedures for the origination of loans by schools that are considering whether to participate. The increase from five percent of new student loan volume in the first year of the program to 40 percent in the second year means that the number of schools participating in the program in the second year is likely to increase from 104 to over 2,000. In light of the preparations required to accommodate the dramatic growth in the Direct Loan Program in the 1995&hyph;1996 academic year, the Secretary finds that the requirements for the second-year implementation of the program do not permit the solicitation of further public comment on the criteria for loan origination in that year. Therefore, the Secretary finds that such a solicitation would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B).
