This was stated today in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS correspondents by Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov after a working meeting behind closed doors between a G-7 delegation and members of the Ukrainian Government. He announced that at least $1 billion would be required merely to rebuild the protective covering of the fourth generating set. A further $1.2 billion would be needed to complete the building of new reactors so as to have room to maneuver in the energy field. Slightly more than 1 billion would be required for staff training, for conversion measures, and also for maintaining the Chernobyl AES after mothballing. The Ukrainian side insists that the Chernobyl problem should be seen as a single package. The ITAR-TASS correspondents learned that the G-7 representatives take a different view on a number of the issues under discussion. Specifically, they refuse to give any help in the social area. Tomorrow's meeting will show whether the Ukrainian side is able to talk them round.
