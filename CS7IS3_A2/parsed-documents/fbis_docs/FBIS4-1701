The 334-page report, compiled by World Bank staff in Beijing and Washington, said the loss of MFN trading status will have consequences for the U.S. and China ranging "from the dramatic to the disastrous." The report said China's exports to the U.S. could be reduced by between 42 and 96 percent, depending on how readily Chinese exports can be substituted by others. "American consumers will be penalized," it said. In 1992, the U.S. imported almost 27 billion dollars worth of goods from China, making the U.S. China's single largest trading partner, the study said. China's top exports to the U.S. include yarn, cotton fabrics, telecommunications equipment, travel goods, handbags, footwear, watches, clocks, toys, sporting goods and clothing. "In actuality, the impact of MFN loss is likely to be closer to the lower bound, but even that is a substantial dislocation of trade," the bank's senior economist for China Country Department, Rajiv Lall, said. The report said time is right for China to significantly liberalize its trade with such steps as reducing tariffs, replacing import quotas and licenses with simpler taxes, and removing remaining export control. The U.S. first granted provisional MFN status to China in 1973. Domestic legislation in the U.S. requires the review of China's MFN status on a yearly basis. The next such review is expected in June. The report said that "complete MFN loss would lead to severe dislocation of China's exports to the U.S.," at least halving, and possibly wiping out, China's export of clothing to the U.S.
