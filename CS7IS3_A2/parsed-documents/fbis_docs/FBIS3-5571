Kim, nevertheless, has recently joined the DLP and was named Tuesday as head of the party's Puchon-Sosa District chapter in Kyonggi Province, triggering a dispute among ranking members of the ruling party. In the past Kim, 43, openly voiced skepticism about a capitalistic society and pursued socialist revolution, centered around workers. He was at the forefront of the radical labor movement and led the leftist struggle against past administrations headed by retired generals. His membership in the party, not to speak of his appointment as head of a DLP local chapter, naturally raised many an eyebrow. Conservative members of the DLP wonder how Kim will react to proposals on revising labor laws in the future and what stand he will take on the controversial National Security Law. Reaction to Kim's appointment came immediately at Tuesday's party postholders meeting, where 10 local chapter heads were named. Rep. Yi Chi-ho of the party's Minjung faction said he did not understand how the party could accept a man who had served a two-and-a-half-year prison term for illegal labor activities. Kim was sentenced to two and a half years in jail for organizing the Seoul Labor Movement Federation in 1985. It was the crowning achievement of a long career devoted to struggling against the government that began in the 1970s. "If (Kim) could record the anti-establishment struggle as an achievement, what is going to happen to those who stood on the side of the establishment?" Yi asked Wednesday. "If he has changed his political views, the party should have clarified them before accepting him into its ranks," Yi said. Another senior DLP official said, "there are many party members who are wondering about the true colors of the party." Still another senior party man asked sarcastically: "Wouldn't the DLP appear to be a progressive party to the people, while the Democratic Party has become a conservative party?" One party member who served as a ranking government official under President No Tae-u reacted more stoically. "Hasn't a new political force been forming in the party with new people being induced from the dissident camp?" "It is now the time," he went on, "for either those new members or the party to clarify their ideological views." The reform advocated by President Kim Yong-sam and anti-establishment activities pursued by members of the dissident camp are two different things and should be distinguished as such, said another party official. "Those people who welcome President Kim's reform would not necessarily accept Kim Mun-su," he said. But party leaders belonging to the Minju, or President Kim's, faction beg to differ. Rep. Kang Sam-chae said the ruling party should be able to embrace a wide spectrum of political views, including those in favor of conservatism as well as progressive forces. "Political ideologies change with the times," he said. Able politicians with dissident backgrounds and progressive tendencies could provide great impetus to the party's efforts to effect reform and change, Kang said, noting that Kim Mun-su has already publicly accepted President Kim's spirit of reform. Other Minju faction members echoed Kang's sentiments. "With the degeneration of socialism and the end of the Cold War, the leftist progressive ideology has few followers even in activist groups," they said. Those who still insist on ideological confrontation do not even want to join the establishment, they said. In any event, the last word, perhaps, belongs to Kim Mun-su himself. He has said he would actively participate in President Kim's reform campaign and help carry it out rather than watching from the outside and only offering criticism.
