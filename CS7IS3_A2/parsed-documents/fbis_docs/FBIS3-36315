Has Given Georgia to Turkey... But They Do Not Know it Yet in Georgia"] [Text] For all the variety of party movements in Georgia and serious differences of views between loyalists of one party or another, they all met Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's victory in the Russian elections with unanimous silence. Only Zurab Gagnidze, candidate of philosophic sciences and leader of the Georgian National Ideology Party, has sent a congratulatory telegram to Vladimir Volfovich on behalf of his supporters. "We are confident that your victory will have a positive influence on the attainment of genuine freedom in Georgia," the telegram says. "Zhirinovskiy is a nationalist in the good sense of the word," Gagnidze believes. We concluded from a conversation with the leader of national ideologists that he is attracted by the Liberal Democrats' economic program, Zhirinovskiy's desire to cut down the bureaucracy, and his struggle against American aggression. Zurab Gagnidze opposes the withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia, saying that there has been not a single serious conflict in the decades while Russian soldiers were present here.
