FR940902-0-00067 FR940902-0-00010 The OALJ coverage is as provided for at section 166 of the Act, and set forth at §627.800 of the interim final regulations. As noted in the response to the preceding comment, the OALJ's jurisdiction includes more than just the specific sections cited at section 166(a) of the Act. No change is made to the final rule. A commenter raised some concerns regarding the entities specified at §627.801(a) that may request an ALJ hearing based on a Grant Officer's final determination which imposes a sanction, a corrective action, or denies financial assistance. It was correctly suggested that the Grant Officer might issue a sanction upon a ``vendor'' and paragraph (a) is amended to cover such situations. A commenter recommended that the provisions at §627.801(a) pertaining to procedures for filing a request for an ALJ hearing could be made clear that a request for a hearing must be submitted by certified mail, by changing the words ``may transmit by certified mail'' to ``must transmit by certified mail.'' The Department agrees that the provision at §627.801(a) of the interim final regulations seems to indicate that the use of certified mail to transmit a request for a ALJ hearing is discretionary, which was not intended. The provision at §627.801(a) is amended to indicate that the Grant Officer's final determination to impose a sanction or corrective action, or to deny financial assistance may be appealed to the OALJ within 21 days of receipt of the final determination, and that a request for a hearing shall be transmitted by certified mail, return receipt requested to the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The Department has reviewed §627.802(e) in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries, 114 S.Ct. 2251, 62 U.S.L.W. 4543 (June 20, 1994) which addresses the allocation of burden of proof in cases governed by §7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act and has concluded that no change in this section is required. In Greenwich Collieries, the Supreme Court concluded that a claimant for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act was the ``proponent of a rule or order'' under section 7(c) of the APA and, as such, carried the burden of persuasion. Section 627.802(e) of these regulations is predicated on the fact that in appeals from Grant Officer Final Determinations the grantee is the proponent of the rule since, in the absence of an appeal, the Final Determination would represent a final debt due and owing the United States. The grantee seeking to avoid this outcome is clearly the ``proponent of the rule or order.'' This construction is also consistent with section 165 of the Act which places on grantees the affirmative obligation to maintain adequate documentation to prove the allowability of costs incurred. While the grantee has the burden of persuasion, in our desire to ensure orderly presentation of evidence, the Grant Officer retains the obligation to prepare and present the administrative file. In addition, a few of the commenters noted typographical errors or incorrect statutory and/or regulatory citations in part 627, subparts E, F, G, and H which are corrected in the final rule. Subpart I_Transition and Implementation On June 3, 1993, the interim final rule was amended to revise the transition provisions at part 627, subpart I (58 FR 31471). Those requirements are restated in the final rule, along with the addition of a definition of ``initiation of procurement'' (§627.904(e)) and a provision for the transfer of summer program funds (§627.904(k)(2)). A number of general comments were received on the difficulties and uncertainties of the transition to the new program to be implemented on July 1, 1993 and whether the contents of the interim final rule adequately addressed a range of questions on the transition. Subsequent to the publication of the interim final rule on December 29, 1992, the Department conducted implementation training for the States in February and March of 1992, provided transition guidance in Training and Employment Guidance Letter 7&hyph;92 on March 8, 1993, and issued two sets of questions and answers on the transition and interim final rule to the Department of Labor regional offices by Field Memorandum that were widely circulated throughout the JTPA system. The Department believes that these mechanisms with the additional guidance reflected in the June 3, 1993 Federal Register document, referenced above, substantially answered the various transition questions and issues that were raised and that a further discussion here is not required. Part 628_Programs under Title II of the Job Training Partnership Act Nontraditional Employment for Women (NEW) Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;235) The Nontraditional Employment for Women (NEW) Act includes a series of amendments to the JTPA. NEW's purposes are to provide a wider range of training opportunities for women under existing JTPA programs; to provide incentives for the establishment of programs that train, place, and retain women in nontraditional fields; and to facilitate coordination of JTPA and vocational education resources available for training and placing women in nontraditional employment. Further, the NEW Act is consistent with the overall goal of JTPA programs to increase participants' employment, earnings, educational and occupational skills. This separate discussion of the NEW Act is provided as a reminder to States and SDAs of the importance of efforts to train and place women in nontraditional employment and the emphasis the Department places on such efforts. There are contained in the final rule various references to the requirements pertaining to nontraditional employment for women, especially as they pertain to planning and setting goals, the assessment process and development of the individual service strategy, and to the various reports required by the Act.
