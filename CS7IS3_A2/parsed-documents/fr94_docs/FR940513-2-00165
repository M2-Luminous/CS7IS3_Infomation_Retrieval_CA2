Certain expenses may be attributable to a portfolio but not attributable to any particular class of the portfolio's shares (``Fund Expenses''). Corporate Level and Fund Expenses will be allocated among the classes of shares based on the value of their relative net assets at the beginning of the day. In addition to the cost of 12b&hyph;1 and/or Administrative Service Payments, each class will bear certain expenses specifically attributable to the particular class (``Class Expenses''), as provided in condition 1 below. 4. Applicants wish to have the ability to convert shares of one class to those of another class, subject to conditions 5 and 16 below. For example, shares of a Deferred Option class could convert after a specified period of time to shares of the Front-End Option class in the same portfolio. For purposes of conversion to Front-End Option shares, all shares in a shareholder's account that had been purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of Deferred Option shares would be considered to be held in a separate sub-account. Each time any Deferred Option shares in the shareholder's fund account convert to Front-End Option shares, a pro rata portion of the Deferred Option shares then in the sub-account also would convert to Front-End Option shares. The portion would be determined by the ratio that the shareholder's Deferred Option shares converting to Front-End Option shares bears to the shareholder's total Deferred Option shares not acquired through dividends and distributions. 5. Applicants propose that each class of shares sold without a front-end sales load or subject to a CDSC be permitted to be exchanged for shares of a class sold without a front-end sales load or subject to a CDSC in the same or another Fund. Each class of shares sold with a front-end sales load or subject to a CDSC would be only exchanged for the same class of shares in a different Fund. The exchange privileges would be operated in accordance with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. B. The CDSC 1. Applicants request an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act, and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder, to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on redemptions of certain classes of shares, and to permit the Funds to waive the CDSC for certain types of redemptions. The requested exemption will supersede three prior orders. 1 Each Fund's particular CDSC schedule may vary, but the sum of any front-end sales charge, CDSC, and asset based sales charge will not exceed the maximum sales charge provided in article III, section 26(d) of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''). 1 MacKay-Shields MainStay Series Funds, Investment Company Act Release Nos. 15038 (Apr. 3, 1986) (notice), 15078 (Apr. 30, 1986) (order), 15718 (May 5, 1987) (notice), and 15758 (May 29, 1987) (order) and The Mainstay Funds, Investment Company Act Release Nos. 20046 (Jan. 21, 1994) and 20104 (Mar. 1, 1994). 2. The CDSC will not be imposed on shares that were purchased more than a specified period of years prior to their redemption or on shares derived from the reinvestment of distributions. Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed on an amount that represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for shares purchased during the CDSC period. In determining whether a CDSC is applicable, it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares representing capital appreciation, second of shares derived from reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions, and finally of other shares held by the shareholder for the longest period of time.
