Jumping on the bandwagon has become a habit of the minister. Well, more power to him. However, there is more wind in the pockets than in the sails. Studying the reconstruction potential of the Armed Forces from the small Czech Republic, independent Western experts concluded that even if 80 percent of the military budget was spent on this purpose, the restructuring would require at least 12 years. Polish specialists estimated that to reach the armament level of the German and U.S. Armies, the Polish Army would have to receive 10 percent of the state budget for 20 years. For Ukraine, NATO is also an example of how to resolve the problem of unification of weapons and military equipment. The huge military industrial complex in Ukraine needs to be phased out because its production used to be oriented toward former Warsaw Pact countries. A new complex will take decades and huge expenses to establish. Let alone the fact that Ukraine has a range of military plants (the Lvov Radio and Television Equipment Amalgamation, the Dniepropetrovsk Rocket Plant, and Mariupol Ship Yard), whose products are even better than their NATO equivalents, such as the T80-M tank manufactured in Kharkov. Besides, Ukraine risks losing its niche on the arms market, which presently brings substantial profits to the state treasury. The "Partnership for Peace" has its social aspect in Ukraine as millions of people employed in the defense industry will be thrown out onto the street. It does not take a military expert to understand that achieving NATO standards will demand changes in microelectronics, computers, optical equipment, radio electronics, and electronic surveillance. The AWACS digital communication systems, satellite meteorologic system, satellite system of strategic communications, integrated radiolocation system of intelligence and weapons management -- they are all part of NATO's equipment. Perhaps Defense Minister Radetskyy had in mind not the global problems of the "Partnership for Peace," but joint military exercises and maneuvers. But who will pay for all of this? Is the Ukrainian economy able to sustain even just a company exercise with NATO, let alone make preparations to become an "equal partner?" Last year, the Ukrainian Army did not hold a single exercise on the regimental level. At a meeting with officers from the Ivano-Frankovsk Garrison, Vitaliy Radetskyy complained that instead of resolving combat readiness issues, he is forced to think how to provide people with food and where he can get money for personnel to bathe in the bath house. The experience of joint Russian-U.S. exercises shows that in five to seven months, the Armies managed to prepare only a small military parade involving 250 servicemen on both sides. According to one source of leaked information, NATO is going to earmark $10-$30 million annually for the "Partnership for Peace," which is, at best, some $1 million for cooperation with each member country. For Ukraine, the "Partnership" will cost at least $1 million. As usual, it is the people that will take most of the burden -- even though Ukraine should hardly expect that this much-vaunted program will secure military security guarantees for our state.
