Specifically, Ozark is proposing to abandon all of the facilities at the Turkey Flat Station, including the compressor unit, dehydration, measuring and regulating equipment, 10,364 feet of 6 inch line, and metering equipment at the Turkey Flat # 1 well site. Ozark was authorized in Docket No. CP78&hyph;532,et al., inter alia, to construct and operate the Turkey Flat Compressor Station. Ozark asserts that gas supply produced from the well located behind this compressor is being delivered to another pipeline and therefore production will not be interrupted upon abandonment of the station. Ozark further states that it proposes to reclassify the facilities proposed to be abandoned herein, for future use. Comment date: November 17, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. Standard Paragraphs F. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before the comment date, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10).

Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate and/or permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.
