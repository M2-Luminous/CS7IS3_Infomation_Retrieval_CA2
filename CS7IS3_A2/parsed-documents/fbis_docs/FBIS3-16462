The meeting was held behind closed doors. The press service of Zhirinovskiy's party told ITAR-TASS that the two politicians focused on Russian-American relations "taking into consideration the geopolitical interests of the two countries", and on inter-parliamentary contacts. Zhirinovskiy handed to Nixon a personal message addressed to President Bill Clinton, the press service said. According to press reports, Nixon wanted to meet Zhirinovskiy during his week-long visit to Moscow to get a clearer idea of the broad spectrum of Russian political leaders capable of influencing developments in the country. Zhirinovskiy, however, denied last week that he wanted to meet the American ex-president.
