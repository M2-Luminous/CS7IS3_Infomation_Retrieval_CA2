Both of them are ready for initialling, he said. The question is one of the two draft deals on the withdrawal of Russian troops by August 31 and social security nets for servicemen over an interim period. Zotov says this provides for the servicemen's right to privatize their housing before selling it to local residents and to take out or transfer property to their relatives in Latvia and other property guarantees. The two sides are holding further talks on Russia's radar installation at Skrunda and an agreement on social security safeguards for retired Russian servicemen residing in Latvia. Moscow and Riga are still wide apart on the amount to be paid for the leasing of the facility. Russia put forward a new proposal agreeing to pay in fuel exports to Latvia in exchange for the use of the installation, the diplomat said. Earlier, agreement had been reached that Moscow would continue using its advanced warning radar station in the next four years and take a further 18 months to dismantle it. On social security safeguards for retired Russian servicemen, Zotov said that differences remained on granting permanent residence to those who retired after Latvia gained independence in August 1991. (The Latvian bureau for monitoring Russian troop withdrawals puts their numbers at about 15,000 - IF) "Russia will never renege on its demand that all Russian servicemen retiring before January 28, 1992 be granted permanent residency in Latvia even if the whole deal on troop withdrawals has to be thrown out", Zotov said. The latest round is to end on Thursday but not on Wednesday as planned before.
