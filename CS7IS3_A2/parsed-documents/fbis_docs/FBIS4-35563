[Gur] Good afternoon. [Barqay] Have we gone back to a succession of attacks and counterattacks? [Gur] Listen, Hizballah never halted its attacks for even one moment, day or night. Fortunately for us, some of their activities fail and the Israeli public never learns about them. Our soldiers, however, have to suffer them on a permanent basis. Therefore, we will strike back at them with all the measures at our disposal. [Barqay] Have they, in other words, failed from the very beginning to uphold the famous agreement not to fire Katyushas. [Gur] They kept the agreement and so did we. The agreement stipulated that Israel would not shell civilian areas and they would not shell Israel's borders. We did not fire at any civilian settlement. We operate against Hizballah in the framework of the understandings reached after Operation Accountability [late July 1993]. Today's launching of Katyusha rockets at Israel was definitely a provocative act by Hizballah which contravenes the agreement and we will have to examine how to deal with this matter. [Barqay] In other words, Mordekhay Gur, today's air force raid did not infringe upon the understandings? [Gur] Definitely not, today's attack on enemy targets without harming civilians is within the parameters of our rights as part of the war currently being waged there. The attack was directed purely, completely, and fully against enemy soldiers belonging to Hizballah. Each one of these soldiers had either participated in operations against Israel already, or was preparing to participate in such attacks in the near future. Therefore, this was a pure military operation which scored an impressive success. [Barqay] Did we have prior intelligence information that dozens of Hizballah personnel would be meeting there? [Gur] You surely do not expect me to give you an intelligence briefing now. I can only recommend that all the Arab armies, especially Lebanon and Syria, take a good look at how the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] performs not only at roadblocks or during occasional and regrettable incidents, but rather when it decides to act and concentrates its capabilities, know how, intelligence, and technology. When that happens the IDF knows how to win and it will always emerge victorious. [Barqay] Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan has proposed expanding the security zone to preclude the launching of Katyusha rockets. [Gur] First of all, the Katyusha rockets could always have a longer range. Second, they can move in long-range artillery and there is no limit to this. I see absolutely no point in expanding the security zone. What I most certainly hope for is that both the Lebanese and the Syrians stop placing obstacles on the road to peace with Lebanon. The Syrians must also understand that the time has come for Lebanon, and its citizens in the southern part of the country, to enjoy some peace. Our citizens in the north also deserve to have some calm and tranquility. This could become achievable within a very short time if the Syrians and Iranians stopped preventing the Lebanese from reaching an agreement with us. [Barqay] Do the Katyusha barrages obligate Israel to react? Perhaps even a ground offensive? [Gur] I leave that for the government to decide. [Barqay] But you said that the Katyushas constituted a gross violation of the agreement. [Gur] Undoubtedly. [Barqay] So the region is going to heat up? [Gur] I did not say what will happen there because Israel reserves its freedom of action. Last night's operation achieved tremendous results. Now we can carefully examine what we have to do. There is no rush. We are not making off the cuff decisions. We are acting according to the clear and supreme security interests of the State of Israel. [Barqay] Did we inform the United States in advance of the operation? [Gur] Permit me to ignore any political questions connected to this affair. [Barqay] Did we receive any negative feedback from the Americans following the operation? [Gur] Not that I know of. Perhaps it is still early. The entire world knows about Hizballah's activities and is aware of the support the organization receives from Syria and Iran. The reaction coming in corresponds to this. The entire world recognizes Israel's right to protect its sovereignty and enable its citizens along the northern border to live in peace. [Barqay] Thank you, Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur.
