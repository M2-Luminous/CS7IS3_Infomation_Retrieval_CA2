The reason for this is because Mexico has solid instruments for confronting possible alterations in the financial markets. [Begin unidentified entrepreneur recording] We feel that we have a solid project, particularly if we all defend it. [end recording] The entrepreneur pointed out that an emergency plan is not needed, nor any additional measures other than the ones agreed upon in the current agreement. Nonetheless, he warned that we must be very cautious and not allow strange forces to manipulate us and alter the economic and political program or even lead to destabilization. [Begin Antonio Sanchez Diaz de Rivera, president of Mexican Employers Confederation, recording] Some are trying to attain that destabilization. Nonetheless, if all sectors are united and there is social unity, and if authorities and society act jointly to prevent it, we will definitely prevent it. [end recording] In matters of politics, the businessmen pointed out that although the death of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate will somewhat tarnish the electoral process, they ruled out the possibility that the elections be postponed beyond 21 August. [Begin Ricardo Dajer Nahum, president of Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce, recording] I think the elections must be held on 21 August. I feel we cannot allow the objectives of those who have provoked a series of events -- that we denounced in a certain way last week -- to be attained. [end recording] As for the financial markets that remain closed on Thursday as a sign of mourning, Manuel Robleda, leader of the Mexican Stock Market, urged investors to be prudent, as it was observed in the foreign market that Mexican Government debt titles registered a moderate drop. Throughout the financial institutions, the polled businessmen said they were determined to continue working for the benefit of the economic project. [Begin recording] [Unidentified businessman] The economy must remain at the same level it is now. It must maintain the same standards of living we have and continue working as usual. [Second unidentified businessman] There will not be any movements that will change our country's way of living. [end recording]
