The paper, mouthpiece of the Arab Ba'th Socialist Party, said in an article today that the regime, which faced an irritating armed resistance in many of its major cities, districts and villages was incapable of playing any positive role in the region. AL-THAWRAH added that instead of solving its internal problems, rising from its messed up policies and its failure to find suitable solutions for obstacles facing its people, the Iranian regime intervened in the internal affairs of Arabs and Muslims despite the harsh lesson it learned from its war with Iraq. The paper commented that the Iranian regime received a similar blow when it attempted to interfere in Iraq's internal affairs during the chapter of sabotage and hooliganism following the 30-state aggression on Iraq. The paper cautioned Arabs and Muslims against Iranian attempts to intervene in their internal affairs through spreading chaos and instigating trouble under false slogans similar to what has been going on in Jordan and Algeria.
