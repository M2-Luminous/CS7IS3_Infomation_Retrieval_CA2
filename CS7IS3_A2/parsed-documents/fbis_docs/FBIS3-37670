Grachev told his U.S. counterpart during a telephone conversation on Monday that "the position of the Muslim side regarding the NATO demands and the presence of the Russian force in Sarajevo is not clear for Russia" and warned that any provocations against the Russian peace-keepers would result in "a sharp aggravation of the situation and will disrupt mutual efforts." The presence of U.S. peace-keepers in Muslim areas "would strengthen the situation in general and we could have ensured a close interaction between our servicemen," Grachev said. However, Perry rejected the invitation.
