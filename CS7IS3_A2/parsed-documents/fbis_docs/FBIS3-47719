There was no "failure" to sign a cease-fire agreement, they said, because the signing of the document was not scheduled for this week in the first place. Government chief negotiator Manuel Yan said both sides were, still studying the proposed agreement, although he said it might be signed in the near future. "The guidelines and ground rules are still being studied, and after we agree on them, then that's when the signing will take place," Yan said. What was scheduled for this week, according to Defense Undersecretary Feliciano Gacis, was a meeting in Cotabato City of joint support committee number one of which he is the government co-chairman." The MNLF co-chairman is Dr. Tham Manjoorsa. The meeting, Gacis said, did not need the presence of MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari, as the media had reported. Misuari, sources in the panel said, only wanted to be present during the discussions, but his absence would make no difference because "these discussions are at the level of the support committees, which are `below' him (Misuari)." Support committee number one is concerned with defense and security matters. There are four other such committees tackling discussions on the educational system, the financial and economic system, the judiciary and the administrative system. The committees, Gacis pointed out, thresh out issues of contention in the Tripoli Agreement. Gacis said the worst incident which occurred was that his discussions with Manjoorsa were delayed for one day "because of site preparation." He said his meeting with Manjoorsa was cordial, and that they exchanged position papers on the topics they were scheduled to discuss. "After perusing the documents, we agreed that we both needed time to study and respond further so both sides agreed to meet again two weeks from now," he told a press conference in Camp Aguinaldo. He refused to reveal the contents of the papers, saying only that the MNLF's was a slight modification of what they had submitted during the formal talks in Jakarta last year. Developments with regard support committee number one are particularly crucial since they represent what are believed to be the most controversial sections in the Tripoli Agreement: paragraphs two and eight. Paragraph two, Gacis said, "states that defense matters shall be the concern of the national government provided that the joining of the MNLF forces with the Armed Forces of the Philippines will be discussed later -- so that's why we are discussing it." "Paragraph eight says special regional security forces will be set up in the area of autonomy in southern Philippines provided that the details will be discussed later," he said. "What has caused so much trouble," said an official who requested anonymity, "is that some have assumed that this merger of the MNLF and AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] and the setting up of regional security forces can be taken for granted when it's very clear that these are subject to discussion." Nevertheless, Gacis said, he had already found "possible points of agreement" in the position papers. He conceded "there are also points where we have to close the gap," and this was why both sides agreed to study the matter more closely before meeting again. As for Misuari's reported wish to enter Cotabato City with 500 armed bodyguards, Yan said: "In the cease-fire agreement it is clearly provided that both will refrain from provocative acts." Although the agreement has yet to be signed, Representative Edgardo Ermita, a government negotiator, said it was already being observed informally by both sides. Yan refused to categorically call Misuari's request as "provocative" saying only that "we see no need for a large number of (MNLF) men to secure chairman Misuari, when we have taken responsibility for his safety."
