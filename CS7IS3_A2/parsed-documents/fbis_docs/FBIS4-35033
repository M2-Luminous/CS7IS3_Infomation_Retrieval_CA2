On the contrary, potentially negative effects will be felt in some areas, such as wheat, corn, sugar beets, oil seeds, and dairy products. Concern has been caused by the rapid progress made in drafting a possible trade agreement with the United States. Correa considers that a complete and basic study has not yet been made of the implications of such an agreement for the national economy. At the same time he considered it unacceptable to sign an agreement providing for trade integration with the United States which could affect the implementation of Chilean agricultural policies. The SNA leader recalled that the only effort made to study the possible effects of such an agreement was undertaken by the Confederation of Production and Trade (CPC). He considered this study only an "approach" to the subject. Among the possible problems of a TLC [Free Trade Agreement] Correa gave one example. He mentioned that in the case of Mexico (which presently is a signatory of NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement]), the importation of North American sorghum is permitted, without the payment of customs duties, for subsequent reexport to the United States. Some statements which have been made have caused greater concern in the SNA. It is still not clear whether Chile will adhere to NAFTA or will sign a bilateral agreement. Subsidies In addition to the previously mentioned concern, Chilean farmers feel uncertainty about the possibility that an initiative like NAFTA could have an impact on agricultural policies now in effect in Chile. Correa said that these policies provide "minimum protection against sudden and artificial fluctuations in international prices caused to a large extent by the subsidies which the developed countries provide for their agricultural production and exports." He estimated that the United States Government pays $35 billion annually in subsidies to protect its farmers. He repeated the concern of the SNA regarding the advisability of a policy of bilateral agreements as an alternative to the strategy of unilateral openness to the rest of the world, which has been the policy adopted in the past. He expressed the view that the number of bilateral agreements which have been entered into have ended up by "undermining the uniform structure of our customs tariffs." He said that "several of the preference agreements have seriously compromised domestic production." Dollars What is happening to foreign exchange rates is a matter of concern to the SNA. During the first quarter of 1994 the U. S. dollar has declined by 3.3 percent. Over the past 12 months, according to SNA statistics, the decline has amounted to 6.2 percent in real terms. Correa said that this does not agree with what Eduardo Aninat, the minister of finance, said when he spoke at a meeting with businessmen on the first day in office of the new government. At the meeting Aninat emphasized the importance which stability in the rate of exchange of the U. S. dollar had for the Chilean export sector. Correa refuted this remark with the fact that the dollar has fallen in value, which, he considered, "could lead to a situation of extreme difficulty." He said that the lesser value of the dollar, "has contributed to reducing inflationary pressures. However, among other aspects, it is harmful for the Chilean export sector," he emphasized. Correa defended the Chilean agricultural sector, stating that it is not always the cause of an increase in the index of consumer prices. He said that there are some months, like April 1994, when the index of consumer prices has recorded a decline. [passage omitted]
