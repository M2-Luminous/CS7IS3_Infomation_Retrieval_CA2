He met in Bratislava with the republic's most senior constitutional representatives -- Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic -- and he was received by Slovak President Michal Kovac. During his visit, the Romanian prime minister granted our daily an exclusive interview. [Skoda] Could you compare the standard of Romania's relations with Slovakia and with the other Visegrad Group countries? Are they better or do they lag behind in any respect? [Vacaroiu] We have traditionally good relations with Slovakia. A general agreement on friendship and cooperation between Romania and Slovakia and a whole series of important agreements -- for example, a memorandum on whose basis an agreement on creating a free trade zone will be drafted -- have come into force. We have signed an agreement on preventing dual taxation and on protecting investments and payments as well as other agreements concerning culture and tourism. A consular agreement is under preparation. The important thing is that we have formed a basis for intensifying cooperation between our business entities. So, the dynamism of our bilateral relations is very good on all levels. [Skoda] Our countries are coordinating their foreign policy and their policy toward the ethnic minorities within the framework of the Romanian-Slovak agreement on friendship and cooperation. Some political forces in neighboring Hungary have described the signing of this agreement as "a step oriented against the interests of Hungary." How do you now assess this coordination? [Vacaroiu] We are especially concerned about harmonizing certain steps of common interest. Dealing with the issue of the Hungarian minority in Romania, however, is our internal affair. We are merely interested in ensuring that all the citizens of our states have the same rights and responsibilities, but not privileges. Our laws guarantee them rights. Certain circles in Hungary and in our country are coming up with demands that are unacceptable to us as a sovereign state. For example, we will not discuss borders; otherwise, this could lead to destabilization. The ethnic minorities -- and not only the Hungarians -- enjoy the same rights as other citizens, and they are not discriminated against thanks to the principles by which we are governed. In any case, in resolving these issues, it is essential to follow a correct path. [Skoda] In essence, our two countries are pursuing the same aims in foreign policy -- to join the North Atlantic pact and to become integrated as fast as possible into West European economic structures. How is Romania approaching the Partnership for Peace? Have you already drafted a specific program for Romania's involvement in NATO's military maneuvers and in the UN "peace-keeping" operations in Europe? [Vacaroiu] At the moment, we are going through the first, transition stage of the economy's radical transformation and of establishing a law-governed state. Therefore, in foreign policy we are striving to secure stability and peace in our region. For this reason, we have signed the Partnership for Peace, and were the first country to do so. Adapting to the structures of the NATO armies is proceeding concurrently with the reform of the Romanian Army. Of course, we envisage that we will also take part in some NATO exercises and UN peace-keeping operations. However, this will also depend a great deal on the financial resources.... [Skoda] In connection with recent developments in the Balkans and the increased diplomatic activity by Moscow to bring about peace in Bosnia, what is your assessment of the signing of an agreement on the creation of a Muslim-Croatian Confederation? [Vacaroiu] Romania has good relations with all the republics of the former Yugoslavia. We believe, however, that the involvement of all three sides in the Bosnian conflict is necessary to bring about a lasting peace. Greater involvement by the international community is essential in order for it to supervise for a certain period the outcome of the peace process .
