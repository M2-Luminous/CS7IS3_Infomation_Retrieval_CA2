ACTION: Notice of correction. SUMMARY: This notice is a correction to the notice that appeared in the February 25, 1994, Federal Register concerning a Call for Information for the Eastern Utah Resource Management Plan. This planning effort will incorporate the components of ecosystem management. To do this, it is important to increase the level of involvement of those interested in the planning area. In addition to the usual scoping meetings held to identify issues, we will be using representatives from the various interest groups to help collect and analyze the data and develop the alternatives to be analyzed in the National Environmental Policy Act process. In the February 25, 1994, Federal Register notice, public workshops were scheduled to be held in April of 1994. In order to make these workshops more responsive to public needs and to help focus the issues discussion, the workshops are being rescheduled. Information on the dates, times, and places of these workshops will appear in local papers and planning updates. In order to help the public better understand ecosystem management and the increased opportunity for the public to participate in this process, the Bureau of Land Management is preparing a series of information bulletins to be mailed to those interested in the process. We are also seeking opportunities to meet with groups and organizations interested in assisting in the preparation of this plan.
