By this invasion, Hebron says it is a city that cannot submit to the will of the Zionists, and that it is a Palestinian Arab city with a free will that could not be subdued by years of captivity, suppression, murder, deportation, confiscation of lands, and encroachment on sanctities. In Hebron, a real war continued for 18 hours after the city was isolated and besieged by the occupation army, thereby revealing its old colonial face. The army intervened after the settlers had failed to subdue the will of the Ibrahimi Mosque guards, who are all Hebronites, brothers of Gazans, sons of all Palestine who deepened their affiliation with their Arabism with heavy sacrifices, while all others around them were heading toward their final downfall in the final, historical screening of the entire Arab popular and official rank. At the peak of talks on the details of how to deprive international protection of its effectiveness, the army of Rabin and Peres invaded Hebron to re-occupy it and guarantee effective protection of the settlers, whose crime Rabin and Peres had disowned for temporary political reasons. But by that 18-hour armed confrontation, Palestinian militants, who believe in their freedom, sovereignty, and full rights, showed they were in full control of their will and that they had completely given up the idea of attaining their rights outside the confrontation field. Because everything in Hebron and all other towns and camps of occupied Palestine is now clear, and everything in the labyrinths of open and secret talks is suspect and vague. Chief negotiator Shahal is a false man of peace at the negotiation table; in the battlefield, however, he is a general armed to the teeth with U.S. weapons and racist Zionist hatred. Once he is through with his murderous, suppressive tasks, he changes his uniform and goes back to continue his mission at the negotiations table. It is precisely here that we clearly see the unison of enemy words and deeds. It is also here, unfortunately, that we clearly notice the absence and growing separation of the [Palestinian] negotiator from the resistance stand in Hebron which, like other parts of the land, is creating its own glory and delivering another child, who will hold a stone to the face of the occupation soldier, with his helmet and gun, and force him to flee in defeat. Is Washington, which recognizes Jerusalem as the eternal capital of "Israel," suitable as an arbiter of justice after all bloody massacres and moral scandals?! Denunciation is our firm answer at this stage when the Intifada is moving toward a wider armed confrontation, opening the way for a general armed popular rebellion, which will definitely come.
