Syrtlanov under the rubric "Military Reform: In the Air Forces of the Commonwealth Countries": "In Independent Flight"] [Text] Ukraine was among the first nations of the Commonwealth to declare its right to resolve issues of military organizational development independently. The uncompromising stance of Kiev on the question of the formation of a national army did not suit everyone, but to give them their due, it made it possible to set about the practical realization of the conceptual framework for the creation of air forces in the republic in a very short time. Many associate the successful emergence of this branch of the armed forces with the name of the commander--Lieutenant-General of Aviation Valeriy Vasilyev, whose service was linked with the former Odessa and Carpathian military districts for many a year. The commander himself had this to say: "My emergence as an aviator really did take place on Ukrainian soil. And every officer would agree with me that one cannot in good conscience fulfill one's military duty without being instilled with respect for the history and traditions of a people whose peaceful labors you are entrusted to protect. That is why the aspirations of the Ukrainians for sovereignty, for the genuine right to dispose of their own fate, including on questions of defense, are near and dear to me. I am proud of the fact that I have been entrusted with the command of the Air Forces of a nation, in whose annals are inscribed in golden letters the names of scientists, designers and pilots who were trailblazers of the skies and space: Nikolay Kibalchich and Yuriy Kondratyuk, Igor Sikorskiy and Aleksandr Mozhayskiy, Sergey Zhukovskiy and Sergey Korolev, Arkhip Lyulka and Oleg Antonov... I believe that this feeling of participation in the cause of all generations of countrymen is shared by all fliers who have sworn their loyalty to Ukraine, holding to its policy of independent development within the framework of conciliar statehood." The economic crisis and other negative phenomena of our times have undoubtedly had an impact on military reform in Ukraine as well. A particularly difficult situation has taken shape in the Air Forces--the most technically sophisticated branch of the armed forces. This is, first and foremost, the problems with logistical support for the combat training of fliers as expressed in shortages of fuel, spare parts and assemblies. It would be erroneous to explain, as some politicians are attempting to do, that all of these needs are from the very fact of the proclamation of its independence by Ukraine and difficulties in relations with the countries of the so-called near abroad. The author, who has visited many of the units, sees the reasons in the disruption of economic ties among enterprises and the overall decline in production. I can say, knowing the situation in other regions of the former Union, that things are no better--if not worse-- there as well. What is the way out of this situation? We must obviously be realists. The leadership of the Air Forces of Ukraine have intentionally reduced the pace of flight training, taking into account not only the amounts of reserves of material resources, but also changes in the international situation and the lessening of military confrontation in Europe. They are striving, that is, to provide a level of combat readiness thereby that diplomats have defined as precisely the level of defensive sufficiency. The struggle to raise the efficiency of combat training has also been called upon to play its role in the cause of providing a climate of economy. The level of proficiency of the Ukrainian aviators makes it possible to hope for a rapid transition of the national Air Forces to a new rhythm of combat training. They do not conceal the fact, however, that the personnel issue is quite acute. The taking of the military oath of loyalty to Ukraine, after all, forced every serviceman to make an unequivocal choice of citizenship right from the start. Whatever may be said, the very necessity of deciding was unexpected and was perceived quite painfully for many. And it is entirely natural that some fliers announced their desire to return to their native lands, to other republics of the CIS. Quite a few vacant positions appeared as a result, especially squadron commanders. That is why the careful screening of candidates for the open positions is underway everywhere in the regiments even today. The results will not be long in coming. We are thus talking about temporary difficulties, and in no way a hopeless situation. If we look to the more distant future, then with a certain reconfiguration of some of the aviation schools located on the territory of Ukraine they will be able, to all appearances, to train their own national cadres for all the branches of aviation. I will say, anticipating the readers' question, that the personnel problems in the local areas are being considered, wherever possible, through the lens of ensuring social protections for the personnel. The officers believe that a series of pieces of legislation will soon make it possible to provide all families of servicemen with housing and all- round incentives for their martial labors. Quite a bit of work really does lie ahead if we are talking about the strategic tasks of military reform. A conceptual model for the creation of a qualitatively new branch of the armed forces of Ukraine--the Air Defense Troops--is being considered in earnest in Ukraine; they will include the larger units and formations of PVO [Air Defense], the Air Forces and space units in an organizational regard. It is difficult to predict the results of such an experiment, and it has both many advocates and many opponents. The latter, judging by an appearance at the January session of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, could include General V. Vasilyev to a certain extent as well. Time will tell all. It will be necessary in any case to talk about a fundamental review of the tasks and aims of military reform of the Air Forces of Ukraine in accordance with its peaceloving foreign policy and the rationalization of the standard organizational structures of the armed forces. Yes, Ukraine has proclaimed that it is a non-aligned nation, that it will not maintain, produce or employ nuclear weapons, and that it sees no neighboring country as a potential adversary. But this stance in no way propagates the euphoria of pacifism. The military in Ukraine have not forgotten their main task--to maintain proper combat readiness. They like to refer here to the experience of local wars, testifying to the decisive role of aviation in the attainment of victory in contemporary battle. A separate question pertains to improving the structure of the Air Forces. The projected program envisages, in particular, gradual cutbacks in administrative structures through the disbanding of the divisional echelon. Calculations show that this measure, under the prevailing conditions in the republic, would make it possible to increase markedly the combat potential of the aviation forces. A body for the centralized command and control of the Air Forces has already been created on the basis of the former headquarters of the air army in Vinnitsa, to which are subordinate the operational command-and- control groups in the Western (Lvov) and Southwestern (Odessa) sectors, as well as groups for the command-and-control of military-transport aviation, reserves and personnel training. They are also not getting by in Ukraine without cutbacks in the size of the troops. The cutbacks in personnel will be insignificant in the first and second stages of the military reform, up to 1995. This will affect officers who have served out their stipulated terms first of all. The directive issued by the Supreme Soviet and the President of the republic on the discharge only of servicemen with the right to a pension and provided with housing, as a rule, is being unswervingly fulfilled. But there are plenty of aggrieved people, since it is it simply impossible to take all living situations into account. More significant later cutbacks in the administrative structures, support subunits, storage bases and, partly, the aviation regiments, from 1995 through 1999, will once again be through dischargees who have served out their terms or some other circumstances. This process may also be carried out in a less painful manner for peoples' fates by regulating the entering classes at the military schools. Meetings with the army community last year revealed yet another problem, of a morale nature, connected with the re-organization of the armed forces of Ukraine. The officers were concerned at the time about whether their honorary name designations would be retained after the reformation of the units, with a right to the legacy of combat history and traditions. This question has now been resolved, I was told at the socio-psychological service of one of the Kiev headquarters, and the honorary names of the storied units and formations will be retained under the new conditions as well. Someone sensibly reasoned that the memory of heroic deeds of older generations could be a powerful factor in the indoctrination of draft youth and the soldiers of today. The problem of the state symbol on the aircraft of the Air Forces of Ukraine has also been cleared from the agenda. A statute on distinguishing marks (emblems) for aviation units is being considered in parallel with it. Suitable variations of samples of these unique military crests will have to be selected on a competitive basis and discussed publicly in the military collectives. A colleague of mine, ARMIYA UKRAINY newspaper staff correspondent for the Vinnitsa garrison Nikifor Lisitsa, related this to me. I would note that the distinguishing marks of the Ukrainian Air Forces appeared for the first time on the MiG-29 aircraft that took part in air shows in the United States and Canada in the summer of 1992. That visit, by the way, was described in detail in the last issue of AVIATSIYA I KOSMONAVTIKA, which immediately became a bibliographical collector's item among the local aviators, since not all of them subscribe to it. Most of them have now understood that the contemporary specialist cannot get by without a professional periodical. Both Vasilyev and his deputies, as was reported at the secretariat of the commander of the Air Forces of Ukraine, are permanent subscribers to the journal. It has become much more substantive and interesting in the last two years, in their opinion. Such a review obligates us to a great deal. Most importantly, it forces us to believe that the collaboration between the fliers of the CIS countries in the skies and on the groud will serve the cause of peace and the preservation of friendly relations between our peoples in the future as well.
