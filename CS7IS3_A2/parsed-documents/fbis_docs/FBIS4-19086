In the course of the talks the two sides signed an agreement on air traffic between Croatia and Turkey. Our reporter Andjelko Perincic asked both ministers to make brief statements: [Granic] ``Relations between our two countries are improving. Apart from the agreement signed today we also discussed an agreement on friendship and cooperation which will probably be signed during President Demirel's visit to Croatia at President Tudjman's invitation. ``We also discussed an agreement on economic cooperation which will most probably be signed during my visit to Turkey in May, when a meeting between Minister Cetin, Prime Minister Silajdzic, and myself is to be held. We also discussed a credit to be granted by (Ex-Bank) to Zagreb Bank to the tune of $100 million, which will be activated at the beginning of May during a visit of a Zagreb Bank delegation to Ankara. We also talked about cultural cooperation, about signing a cultural cooperation treaty, and also a transport agreement, the establishment of permanent sea lines, and about the help that Turkey can offer Croatia for its admission to the Partnership for Peace alliance. A Turkish ambassador is to head a NATO delegation during their visit to Zagreb.'' [Perincic] Minister Granic announced an initiative to establish a joint Turkish-Croatian-Bosnia-Herzegovina bank in Sarajevo; Turkey is also to provide help to our country for its admission to international financial institutions and the rebuilding of the old bridge in Mostar. He also said that Turkey will support the joint Croatia-Bosnia-Herzgovina policy and their participation in meeting of Islamic countries to be held in Tunisia soon, where a report on the Washington agreement will be delivered. Croatia should also be a special guest at a meeting of the North Atlantic assembly to be held in Ankara soon. As regards NATO's role in the crisis in southeast Europe, Turkish Minister Cetin, in the capacity of an official of a member of the alliance, stated the following for Croatian Radio and TV: [Cetin, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] "We will support Croatia's relation toward NATO as a basis for its admission to NATO's Partnership for Peace [as heard]. The Turkish ambassador to NATO headquarters in Brussels is to head a NATO delegation which is to come to Croatia to discuss that issue. I hope that with that support and President Tudjman's and Minister Granic's tactfulness, Croatia will achieve stability in the Balkans and will win a right decision by NATO as regards cooperation with that alliance within the Partnership for Peace project." [Announcer] It should be added to this report from Ankara that in the Croatian-Turkish ministerial talks the two sides also discussed the need to stop the greater Serbian aggression in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to include the Serbs in negotiations on the federation [in Bosnia-Herzegovina].
