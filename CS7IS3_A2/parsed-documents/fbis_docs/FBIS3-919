Governor Antonio Simbine said that those accusations were both false and without foundation. In an interview he granted the Radio Mozambique correspondent in that province, Governor Simbine noted that [words indistinct] accusations by Renamo officers reflect the thought that is uppermost on their minds: to return to war, should Renamo lose the upcoming multiparty general elections. The governor for Cabo Delgado Province invited the Renamo political delegate to report the matter to the UN Operations in Mozambique so that the truth can be established. [passage omitted] Governor Simbine dismissed as groundless reports that war materiel was being stored in the (?lower part) of Pemba, the capital of Cabo Delgado Province and he added that there should be an inquiry into the matter. The governor for Cabo Delgado categorically denied any provincial government involvement in an alleged attempt on the life of the Renamo political delegate. He said that Renamo should report all it knows to the competent authorities, so that investigation can begin. He noted that, quote, the government has no need to become involved in the assassination of a simple citizen who happens to be an opposition politician, unquote.
