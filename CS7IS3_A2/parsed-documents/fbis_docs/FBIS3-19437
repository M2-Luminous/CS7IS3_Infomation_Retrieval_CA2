This was obvious during the last meeting of the Greek generals, he said. The Council of Ministers convened under President Rauf Denktas this morning and assessed the developments concerning the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. In a statement before the meeting, Denktas said he was meeting with the Council of Ministers in order to lay the ground for his meeting this afternoon with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special envoy in Cyprus. Denktas pointed out that the measures will also be assessed by the Turkish Cypriot Republican Assembly. He noted that the stage of discussing the measures has now been reached. The president pointed out that at their last meeting, the Greek generals clearly showed what they really think about Cyprus. Their aim is to continue to implement the Akritas plan, he said, adding that the issue must be assessed seriously. This is an outright threat, he stressed, and the United Nations will be informed of the situation by letter. Denktas pointed out that the behavior of the Greeks runs counter to the contacts being held by the two sides. If this is the policy of the Greek Cypriot Administration, he said, then the CBM's have no meaning. In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that they reviewed the benefits cited in the CBM's, as well as the benefits promised before the measures. We tried to determine the shortcomings and to work on getting whatever is being promised, he said, adding: We expected to see the promises become concrete; instead, we realized that many benefits were withdrawn. Replying to a question, Denktas said that even though the principle of secrecy is still valid, he would like to give an example. Experts said there would be gates and customs on both sides of Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport, he said, but now this clause has been removed. We insist on this clause. Asked if the Turkish Cypriot side will go to New York at the end of the month, Denktas said that this can only happen if the UN secretary general invites him. Prime Minister Hakki Atun said that a beneficial assessment was conducted at the meeting and that they discussed the start and the current stage of the negotiations. He said: We briefed the Council of Ministers on the views of the coalition parties regarding the measures. He stressed that they worked in harmony with the president. Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime minister, said that the issue was assessed by the coalition parties separately during the Bayram holiday. The Council of Ministers consolidated the views of the two parties, he said, and President Denktas will meet with Gustave Feissel in light of this information. The Council of Ministers session continued under Atun after Denktas left the meeting.
