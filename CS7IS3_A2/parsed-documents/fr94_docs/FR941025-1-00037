FR941025-1-00037 FR941025-1-00007 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [OH65&hyph;1&hyph;6498b; FRL&hyph;5081&hyph;1] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Ohio AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: USEPA proposes to approve Ohio's Rule 3745-35-07, entitled ``Federally Enforceable Limitations on Potential to Emit'' and submitted April 20, 1994, as a revision to Ohio's State Implementation Plan (SIP). USEPA further proposes to authorize Ohio to include such limitations as conditions within federally enforceable State operating permits (FESOPs). In the final rules section of this Federal Register, the USEPA is approving Ohio's Rule 3745-35-07 as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views the action as noncontroversial and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to the proposal of that action. If USEPA receives adverse public comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this action must be received by November 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be submitted to: William L. MacDowell, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Enforcement Branch (AE&hyph;17J), USEPA, 77 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois 60604. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Summerhays, Air Enforcement Branch, Regulation Development Section (AE&hyph;17J), USEPA, Region 5, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 886&hyph;6067. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary Information is provided in the rules section of this Federal Register . Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. Dated: September 19, 1994.
