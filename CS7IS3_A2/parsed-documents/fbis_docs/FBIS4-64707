The petition on the establishment of the new party was submitted to the Interior Ministry Secretariat General by Gurcan Baser on behalf of the founders council. The party has 31 founding members. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Burak Gercek] Different scenarios have recently been proposed with regard to our political life. The most talked-about proposal consists of the unification of the True Path Party [TPP] and the Motherland Party [ANAP] under the Main Path banner. This was realized today, but only in name. The participants are different. We are now asking MPP founding leader Baser why they chose this name. [Baser] We used our right as citizens and 31 of us established a party in line with the Political Parties Law. In our country, division in the political spectrum demonstrates the governments' inability, rather than their strength. It will be beneficial for the parties with similar platforms -- the party in power and the main opposition party -- to integrate. We are inviting all parties with similar platforms to unite under our roof. [Gercek] Whereabouts in the political spectrum are you situated? [Baser] Free economy and Ataturk nationalism. I believe that these two phrases are sufficient.
