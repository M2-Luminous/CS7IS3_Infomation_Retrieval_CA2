LE POINT: How do you view the future Atlantic summit, which must define future relations between the Atlantic alliance and the countries of Central and East Europe? Francois de Rose: President Clinton presented to the allies a project called Partnership for Peace. This project takes into account his compatriots' reservations vis-a-vis overseas obligations and their new demand for "zero dead wars" [preceding three words in English]. Thus the document seeks a formula that would allow the United States to remain present in Europe without the risk of becoming implicated in possible conflicts... However, it should also be viewed within the context of a priority in U.S. policy, that is, assistance to the consolidation of the regime in Russia, where more than 30,000 nuclear weapons are stored. The complex ambition in this undertaking translates into a program that would like to associate Western allies, neutral nations, members of the former Warsaw Pact and successor states in the former USSR, including Asian countries, to this partnership. "It is thus difficult to understand what distinguishes this partnership" from the CSCE or from the Committee for North Atlantic Coordination (COCONA). Since the project additionally contemplates the eventual adherence of all the participants, and hence of Russia, to the alliance, how could one not see in it a threat to the Alliance itself? By being everyone's ally, one ends up being no one's ally. LE POINT: And how about our Europe in there? Francois de Rose: West Europeans naturally share Washington's interest in the consolidation of the changes under way in Russia. And they prove it by contributing 80 percent of the economic assistance provided. However, this does not mean that American and European priorities are necessarily similar. Ours is -- or should be -- that Central and East Europeans should be given the security assistance necessary for their course toward democracy and a market economy. When voices in Moscow are heard protesting the adherence -- even long-term -- of some of these countries to the alliance in the name of the so-called threat this would represent for Russia, one must see in it the survival of the worst impostures of the Soviet false language. Must we let this language obstruct the measures that we would deem to be in the interest of security in Europe? Let us be frank: what these Central and East European countries are seeking in a close association with the Atlantic alliance is assurance against a possible return of the Soviet danger. While waiting for the WEU [Western European Union] to provide a steady foundation for its structures and forces, only NATO possesses the trump cards indispensable to make deterrence credible. For the alliance to bring to East Europe this "plus" it alone holds, its members -- including the United States -- must entrust it, not only with peacekeeping missions, but with missions aimed at reestablishing peace. Bosnia, however, has taught us that Europeans have opposed air strikes against Serb artillery positions, and that the United States subordinates the dispatch of land forces to a stop in the fighting, which would mean that the problem is solved. This summit should decide to create "groups of combined interarmy forces" used for peacekeeping operations. The question would then be to know whether their mobilization would depend on the UN, which allows the murder of its blue helmets to go unpunished, or on the CSCE, or on the alliance itself. Thus we could begin thinking of stationing such a group right away in Macedonia to maintain the peace in this very fragile area bordering on Kosovo. Because who can think that such a decision, already difficult enough within the Alliance, could be made by the UN or by the CSCE? The cruel punishment for our hesitation is that Russia seems to hold more precise, but negative, views on NATO enlargement than the allies themselves. Nevertheless, if the alliance loses its credibility, the only direct influence remaining in Central and East Europe would be that of Russia and Germany. Ours, the French one, would only be part of the common foreign policy of the European Union. This should lead us to reflect on the place that we should hold in NATO leadership structure.
