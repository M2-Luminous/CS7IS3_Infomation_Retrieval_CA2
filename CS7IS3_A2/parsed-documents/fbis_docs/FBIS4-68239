In terms of results, two aspects of the meeting will be of special significance to Ukraine. The first is that Ukraine has joined the economic union as an associate ember and signed all the economic agreements without exception -- a fact that will significantly affect future relations with all the members of the CIS. The second is the attempt to untie the "Black Sea knot," which primarily affects relations between Ukraine and Russia, which worsened following the incident in Odessa. Yet another agreement was reached in Moscow on the division of the Black Sea Fleet and on creating a Russian military base on Ukrainian territory. What are Kiev's prospects in light of this second aspect following the Moscow meeting of the presidents of Ukraine and Russia? Let us turn to Leonid Kravchuk's own words. And so... Let us put it this way, what is ours and what is not ours? All the bases that are now located in Ukraine--Odessa, Ochakiv, Izmayil, etc.--are on our land and they are seemingly not at issue. As to ships, Ukraine will take as many as she requires to meet her military strategic needs as outlined in her military doctrine. (According to the Russian media, Ukraine lays claim to 15-20 percent of the ships of the Black Sea Fleet.) Where will the base of the Russian Navy be located? We will know in ten days' time. This matter is to be decided by a team of Ukrainian and Russian experts. Nonetheless, Leonid Kravchuk showed his hand, as he put it, saying that although it would be better not to locate this base in Sevastopol for patriotic reasons, it is necessary to reckon with realities. And the realities are that a significant portion of the Black Sea Fleet will be Russian, and if the base of the Russian fleet is located elsewhere, the Russian military will need to be provided with living quarters, their children with schools, and their wives with jobs. Given the financial capabilities of Ukraine, it is unlikely that these could be made available in another city. A Russian base on Ukrainian territory--is this to last forever? Based on what the president says, it is apparently only a matter of leasing, and leases have expiration dates. Consequently, the situation should not be dramatized. How much will the ships of the Black Sea Fleet, which will be handed over to Russia, cost, and what will be the price tag on the lease of Ukrainian territory to be used as a Russian military base? According to the president, the cost of these ships still needs to be added up. As far as the cost of the lease for basing Russian ships is concerned, there are international rules and principles for computing the price of such arrangements. We will not be inventing something new. We will propose whatever these calculations show the amount to be. What will be the status of this Russian base? After Ukraine takes her portion of ships from the Black Sea Fleet and Russia takes hers, we will immediately have Russian troops on Ukrainian territory, rather than the joint troops we had up to now. And once the troops are Russian, their status will need to be defined. But the president's decision on this issue is not final. This decision has to be ratified by the Supreme Council. ...Let me explain that this is what the president thinks, but the final decision regarding the fate of the Russian base will depend, as Leonid Kravchuk noted, on the Supreme Council, whose present numerical composition does not allow it to pass legislation. All of this is somewhat reminiscent of the second round at Massandra. That was the first occasion on which Leonid Kravchuk speculated about how profitable it would be for Ukraine to lease the Sevastopol naval base to Russia. That is also when the first calculations by independent experts appeared, in which the value of the Black Sea Fleet was assessed at 30 billion dollars. (It will be interesting to see what figure is presented this time.) After Massandra, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev declared the need for a military and political union between Moscow and Kiev. But all that was in the past. Yet the fact that the problem of the Black Sea Fleet in the relations between Ukraine and Russia is being raised over and over again leads one to give the matter serious thought. These reflections indicate clearly that even after last week's meeting in Moscow of the presidents of Russia and Ukraine, it is premature to believe that this matter has finally been resolved. Is there anyone who still fails to understand that what is at stake is not only the fate of the Black Sea Fleet? Is there anyone who still fails to understand that behind the numerous recent promises by Russian leaders--both military and civilian--to protect Ukraine from all enemies from the south with an indivisible Black Sea Fleet, lies a defining of global military policy issues that are of extreme importance to Russia and which by no means exclude a military and political union between Moscow and Kiev, even though today this notion strikes us as absolutely impossible. Yet who can say for certain today what will happen tomorrow? And is the creation of a Russian base on the territory of Ukraine a step that should be interpreted as giving in on a smaller issue in order to protect what is of greater importance? I do not know, I am not sure, especially as, unfortunately, we are drawing no lessons from the past. And yet, there was plenty to reflect upon: The outcome of the division of the foreign assets of the former USSR; the still standing decree of the Supreme Soviet of Russia (the soviet is gone, but the decree remains) on the status of Sevastopol; Russia's position with respect to nuclear disarmament in general and in the Odessa incident in particular, which both sides recognize as over, even though each side continues to believe its position to have been correct. What next?.. Even before the ink had dried on the documents signed by the presidents in Moscow, a storm of accusations began to rage. The very next day after the signing of the agreement, Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's press secretary, issued a statement concerning the Ukrainian reaction to the signing of the agreement on dividing the Black Sea Fleet. It states that following the meeting on settling the problems of the Black Sea Fleet in stages, the Ukrainian side began to interpret this agreement in a one-sided manner. Even before the negotiations provided for by the agreement had begun, continues the statement, the Ukrainian side began to put foward its own formulas pertaining to the leasing, dates, and location for basing the Russian Black Sea Fleet. The Russian side is forced to remind [Ukraine] of the harsh realities and urgent tasks that constitute the basis of the signed agreement. I was particularly struck by the assertion: "Reckless words and unbecoming acts with respect to something as sacred to the [Russian] ation as the Black Sea Fleet." Thus, even before the experts on the Black Sea Fleet picked up their pencils and began their calculations, Vyacheslav Kostikov gave an appealing demonstration that he is both efficient and knowledgeable. It is quite clear who is speaking through the press secretary. And when the Black Sea Fleet, which was no more than a fleet only yesterday, suddenly becomes "sacred to the Russian nation," we are well aware what arguments are used to defend and protect those things that are sacred to a nation. Thus the mention of harsh realities does not appear to be entirely out of place. This, however, leads to the inevitable conclusion that it is premature to speak of unravelling the "Black Sea knot" anytime soon, especially with the prospect of a foreign military base along the lines of Guantanamo appearing on Ukrainian soil.
