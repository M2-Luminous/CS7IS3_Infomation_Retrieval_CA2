Even now the oblast administration (which has succeeded in becoming the oblast government in the interim) is unsuccessfully attempting to evict several former elected representatives from their official apartments in St. Petersburg. Eleven apartments at 10 Yakhtennaya Street were made available to deputies by a decision of the oblast soviet on 4 September 1991. They were intended for elected officials working for the oblast soviet on a full-time basis and residing permanently in the oblast. As noted in the decision, which was signed by Mr. Yarov, this was intended to be temporary official housing. Thus it was assumed that during their period of service as deputies the deputies' own housing would be reserved for them. After the oblast soviet completed its activities on 16 November it was time for the now-unemployed deputies to go back home. That is the oblast administration's opinion. However, according to Mikhail Simanov, chief legal consultant in the oblast government's legal department, some of the former deputies continue to occupy apartments in St. Petersburg and refuse to give them up, basing that position on various circumstances of a personal nature. As of this time the oblast government has lodged claims against six former oblast soviet deputies: Aleksey Vaskov, Oleg Mokhov, Lyudmila Katushonok, Nikolay Shalonin, Nina Goroshchenko and Svetlana Belyayeva (the rest have either vacated the apartments after all or else remain in them on terms satisfactory to the administration). It appears that the administration does not intend to do any favors for the deputies, with whom it is commonly known not to have the most amicable relations. After oral negotiations and attempts to find a compromise solution produced no results, the deputies were sent an official letter, in which they and the members of their family were directed to vacate their official housing within one month. That deadline expires a few days from now. It is a possibility that soon there will be a sensational trial -- the administration is preparing to go to court to demand the forcible eviction of the former deputies from their official apartments, an action of which the latter were warned in the aforementioned letter. The apartments are not the only object of disagreement between the oblast government and the former deputies. It seems that many of Leningrad Oblast's elected officials are attempting to derive the maximum benefit from their present situation. Tomorrow Smolninskiy Rayon Court will begin trying another case. This time the deputies have filed 18 lawsuits against the administration simultaneously, insisting that they were fired from their jobs with the soviet in violation of proper legal procedure.
