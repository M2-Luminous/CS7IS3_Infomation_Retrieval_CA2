They Bring Their Vouchers Here Too..."] [Text] At the end of last year RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA (see the issue for 28 December) reported to its readers on the check investment fund of workers of Profsolidarnost. Most frequently such funds advertise themselves in loud and intriguing ways: "We will turn your voucher into gold!" etc. And the "details" that interest the voucher holders are simply left out. The calling card of Profsolidarnost, which was founded by the largest branch trade unions of Russia, was drawn up, it seemed, quite carefully. Nonetheless the Moscow staff headquarters of the fund, which is located in the building of the Council of the FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia] on Lenin Avenue, and its representative offices, which are in republic, kray, oblast, city, and rayon trade union committees, and also RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA are receiving phone calls and letters from people requesting that various details be clarified, that they discuss in greater detail why Profsolidarnost can so confidently guarantee them high dividends. The floor is turned over to the vice president for public relations of the joint-stock company of managers of AKOM, Andrey Stolyarov: "I will not deny that the growing interest of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA readers in our fund is gratifying. We are gaining more and more stockholders. But it is also quite natural for the people to want to learn more about the people to whom they have decided to entrust their vouchers. Noisy scandals over funds that promised mountains of gold yesterday and today have suddenly taken a dive or have disappeared completely are a lesson to many: be careful...we must never disappoint the expectations of the people or even promise more than we can give them. You will agree that this would be a terrible blow to the largest and most respected associations of workers--the trade unions." And so we have the trade unions behind us. They are the ones whose direct duty it is to defend the interests of the workers--our first guarantors. Where does almost any investment fund begin? With the creation of a network of its representative offices and points for receiving vouchers and selling shares. And on this they spend millions and millions of rubles that have been taken out of the pockets of the shareholders. But we essentially already have such a network. It is the trade union structures of the most diverse levels, which are capable of simultaneously both monitoring the activity of the fund and appreciably influencing it. If the "rank-and-file" shareholder has certain doubts or questions he is welcome to come to his home trade union committee where he knows everyone and they know him. The authorized capital of Profsolidarnost is more than 50 billion rubles. Obviously a large fund. And in this connection the misgivings expressed by certain people are justified: Will the founders not start investing the multitude of vouchers they have gathered "just any old where"? As long as they dispose of them?...no, nothing like that happens here nor will it happen. Some are better and some are worse, and the trade unions know precisely which is which, in which branches and in which enterprises things are proceeding well today and where they are having nothing but trouble. Because the controller of the fund of the joint-stock company of managers AKOM has already managed--with real support from the trade unions--to set up an effective system of investments. In particular, we have arranged business contacts with a number of profitable and promising enterprises of the extraction and processing branches--petroleum, timber, chemical, gold-ore, diamond...and, believe me, these enterprises will survive in any "weather."
