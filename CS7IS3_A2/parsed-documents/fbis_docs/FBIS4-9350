Every time peace was close at hand or whenever talks between the warring sides became deadlocked through a fault of the Moslems or Croats, Serbs would be provoked into military action or a massacre of civilians would be staged, with the inevitable effect of postponing the peace process and fanning the war, Kontic said in a statement to Radio Kragujevac. From Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, which should have been demilitarized in spring last year as a U.N. protected area, Moslems launched an offensive against Serb positions in late March. When the Moslems were threatened with military defeat, NATO bombed Serb positions around the town on April 10 and 11 allegedly to protect the local U.N. observers. Since this did not affect the situation on the front, NATO set another ultimatum to Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Friday, this time that they withdraw to 3km from Gorazde by 00:01 GMT Sunday or be bombed (again). The bombing did not take place because Serbs from Bosnia-Herzegovina, under an agreement with head of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi, started to withdraw, and around 200 peace-keepers have arrived in Gorazde and have begun their deployment in the buffer zone between Serb and Moslem forces. Assessing that the plan of the European Union (E.U.) on Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of three ethnic republics had offered a real perspective for resolving the crisis quickly, Kontic said that Serbs had practically met all the Moslem demands, so that it had seemed that the solution was on the horizon. "And then the U.S. enforced the Moslem-Croat federation and the confederation with Croatia, without any participation of the Serbs, and at their expense in fact, because new concessions by the Serb side had been counted on," the Yugoslav prime minister said. In order to get Serbs to make these concessions, it was necessary to intimidate them with air strikes, or blacken them once again in the eyes of the world community and justify the siding against them, Kontic said. Commenting on the U.S. demands for the destruction of bridges and other forms of communication between the Serb Republic in former Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia, Kontic assessed that such demands which come from extremist circles and individuals should not disturb Yugoslav citizens and cause their concern. "Even if this did take place, it would be an act of aggression on an independent and sovereign country and the answer would be unequivocal and clear. Yugoslavia has such a force that can be placed in the defence of the country at a moment's notice," the Yugoslav prime minister said. "The situation is monitored continually and measures are taken to protect our borders. That is why certain funds are earmarked for equipping the army with modern weapons and strengthening the country's defence even at this moment when the economic situation is very difficult," Kontic told Radio Kragujevac.
