FR941012-2-00122 FR941012-2-00080 2. If a Fund implements any amendments to its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder service plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by a class of shares under the plan into which another class will convert (the ``Target Class''), shares of the class that will convert (the ``Purchase Class'') will stop converting into the Target Class unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The Trustees shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (the ``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to covert into the Target Class. If deemed advisable by the Trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (the ``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that the New Purchase Class will convert into the New Target Class. The New Target Class or the New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the Trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 6, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of the New Target Class or the New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser or Distributor. The Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into the Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement. 3. Any class of shares with a conversion feature will convert into another class of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in article III, section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion. 4. The Trustees of the Trust, including a majority of the independent Trustees, shall have approved the Multiple Class System prior to the implementation of the Multiple Class System by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the Trustees regarding their deliberations with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multiple Class System will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the Multiple Class System is in the best interests of both the Funds and their respective shareholders. 5. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class of a Fund and any subsequent charges thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Trustees, including a majority of the independent Trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Fund to meet Class Expenses, rule 12b&hyph;1 fees and shareholder servicing fees shall provide to the Trustees, and the Trustees shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. 6. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes or shares. The Trustees, including a majority of the independent Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and Distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and Distributor at their own costs will remedy the conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.
