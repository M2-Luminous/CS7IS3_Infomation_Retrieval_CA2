FR941117-0-00093 FR941117-0-00011 (2) When an application for authority to operate a station is filed with the FCC, the notification required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section should be sent at the same time. The application must state the date that notification in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section was made. After receipt of such applications, the FCC will allow a period of 20 days for comments or objections in response to the notifications indicated. (3) If an objection is received during the 20-day period from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory for itself or on behalf of the Naval Radio Research Observatory, the FCC will, after consideration of the record, take whatever action is deemed appropriate. (b) Table Mountain. The requirements of this paragraph are intended to minimize possible interference at the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone of the Research Laboratories of the Department of Commerce located in Boulder County, Colorado. (1) Carriers planning to construct and operate a new or modified Public Mobile Services station at a permanent fixed location in the vicinity of Boulder County, Colorado are advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the need to protect the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone from interference. To prevent degradation of the present ambient radio signal level at the site, the Department of Commerce seeks to ensure that the field strengths of any radiated signals (excluding reflected signals) received on this 1800 acre site (in the vicinity of coordinates 40 ○07 ’50 ’ ’ North Latitude, 105 ○14 ’40 ’ ’ West Longitude) resulting from new assignments (other than mobile stations) or from the modification or relocation of existing facilities do not exceed the values given in Table C&hyph;3 of this section. Table C&hyph; 3._ Field Strength Limits for Table Mountain 1Frequency range 1Field strength 1Power flux density 1.6 to 470 MHz 10 mV/m ^65.8 dBW/m 2 470 to 890 MHz 30 mV/m ^56.2 dBW/m 2 890 to 3000 MHz 1 mV/m ^85.8 dBW/m 2 Note: Equivalent values of power flux density are calculated assuming free space characteristic impedance of 376.7 V (120 p V ). (2) Advance consultation is recommended, particularly for applicants that have no reliable data to indicate whether the field strength or power flux density figures in the above table would be exceeded by their proposed radio facilities. In general, coordination is recommended for: (i) Stations located within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles); (ii) Stations located within 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) transmitting with 50 watts or more effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone; (iii) Stations located with 16 kilometers (10 miles) transmitting with 1 kW or more ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;
