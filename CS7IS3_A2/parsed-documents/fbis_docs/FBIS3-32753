He then said he considers the debate generated by the presence of U.S. troops in Juanchaco Ladrilleros and Bahia Malaga to be over and done with. [Begin Gaviria recording] Yes, undoubtedly, in the wake of the State Council's statement yesterday, what could be called a controversy has now ended. I did not intend to offend the State Council, and I do not believe I did offend the council. What I did was defend a legal position -- an interpretation of the Constitution -- and to respect Colombia's international treaties and their development, which I consider essential. I consider this essential not for the president or his position, but for the professionalization of the Armed Forces and for international cooperation in efforts to counter drug trafficking. [end recording] During the same ceremony, former Police Director General Miguel Antonio Gomez Padilla for the first time appeared in public wearing civilian clothes.
