Yi Yong-dok proposed contact be made in the Home of Peace south of the military demarcation line at Panmunjom at 10 am on 28 June, by a three-member delegation with about five aides from each side headed by a deputy prime minister. Earlier, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter who visited Pyongyang relayed to ROK President Kim Yong-sam a proposal by DPRK President Kim Il-song on holding a summit. Kim Yong-sam accepted the proposal without hesitation. Yi Yong-dok chaired a high-level strategic meeting of the ROK Government this morning. The meeting decided to make the proposal on the South-North representatives' contact. Yi Yong-dok said in the faxed message: "I was authorized to let you know that we agree to your (DPRK) proposal as it is correct considering the wish of the nation, and the inward and outward situation on the Korean Peninsula." The message urges the DPRK to make a "positive response" to the ROK proposal on the representatives' contact.
