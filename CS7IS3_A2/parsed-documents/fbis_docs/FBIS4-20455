So far, the P190 antigen derived from Plasmodium falciparium is reportedly to be the most prospective candidate, because of the antigen's capability of inducing antibodies to provide complete immunity to monkey model of human malaria. Research results indicate that the repeated three-peptide sequence of P190 antigen, the repeated eight-peptide sequence of RESA antigen, and the repeated four-peptide sequence of CS antigen of Hainan strain (FCCI/HN strain) P. falciparium contain T cell epitope that is closely related to immune function against malaria infection. These repeated peptide sequences are believed to be the functional regions responsible for immunity. Variation of these sequences could be responsible for failure of human body's immune response to P. falciparium attack. In other words, plasmodia may constantly variate their repeated peptide sequences, the hot spots of gene deletion and gene insertion, to avoid being neutralized by host's immune response. Therefore, variations should be put into consideration when using the repeated peptide sequences to develop malaria vaccine. Researchers believe that vaccine developers should be able to correct the problem encountered if they study carefully the variation's nature and mechanism. Results obtained from this experiment indicate that Hainan FCCI/HN P. falciparium makes an ideal strain for developing malaria vaccine because of its P190 antigen's conservativeness and bimorphism property. Chinese researchers are hoping to develop a complete vaccine that is capable of protecting human beings from any P. falciparium attack by putting two kinds of bimorphism sequences in one single vaccine.
