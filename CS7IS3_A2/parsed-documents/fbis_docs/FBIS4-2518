"This year is a key period for economic reforms. Accelerating political reforms all depends on the success of that," said Pan Guohua, the vice-chairman of the Department of International Politics at Beijing University. "Political steps will not appear for one or two years. There are many conditions not ripe for democracy at present," Pan said. A former party general secretary, Zhao Ziyang, put forward a programme of moderate political reforms in the late 1980s, but the subject has been a near taboo in China since Zhao's dismissal after the Tiananmen massacre in 1989 and the jailing of Bao Tong, who was Zhao's former political secretary and the director of the central committee's political reform think tank. However, in a lively discussion with other mainland scholars in Hong Kong, Pan indicated that consensus is being reached in the capital on the political transition after the supreme leader, Deng Xiaoping, dies, as well as plans for cautious democratisation. Pan said the experience of 1976 -- when three key Chinese leaders died -- proved that China would not fall into chaos after Deng's death. "I admit we do have some worries that another dictator could emerge. But in general we feel that widespread instability is impossible," he said. The three most likely to emerge as supreme leader of China after Deng's death are President Jiang Zemin, the executive vice-premier Zhu Rongji and a vice-premier, Li Ruihuan, Pan said. Asked about the fate of the Premier, Li Peng, he replied: "Of course everyone can be included." As far as democracy is concerned, Pan said, researchers in the capital believed it could be achieved through the gradual devolution of power to the National People's Congress (NPC) and to non-communist parties. Both have been described by Western scholars as window-dressing meant to legitimise the Communist Party's grip on power in China. However, Pan said this view ignored important changes already taking place. The standing committee of the NPC, headed by Qiao Shi, was already seeking to enhance its power at the expense of the Communist Party, he said. "The NPC must listen to a growing chorus of complaints from the people, so they feel the need for more authority," he said, adding that the standing committee significantly amended more than 20 laws last year. The growing political role of non-communist parties represents the second route by which democratisation would be achieved, Pan said. These so-called democratic parties have in the past been tightly controlled by the authorities and all acknowledge the overall leadership of the Communist Party. But Pan pointed out that at the recent Beijing municipal elections, a Communist candidate lost to a Democratic Party candidate in Haidian District, which is home to most of the capital's universities and research institutes. The consensus in Beijing was for a "safe" speed of political change, however. "The Chinese people care about the conditions for their children. As a result, economic reforms have gone faster than political reforms," Pan said. The devolution of power to local governments as well as the development of the nonstate economic sector would lay the foundations for the civil society that is considered crucial to successful democracy, he believed. "As long as they are constitutional, the Chinese government will support the emergence of new popular groups," he said. "Up to now, no such groups in the academic or social sphere have posed a serious threat to the Communist Party and government." The greatest threat to the party came from internal corruption. "Even though two national meetings have been held to deal with this problem, the measures taken so far are not working," he said. "The life or death of the party lies here." Within Beijing University, Pan said, growing academic freedom had contributed to more discussion about political change and other taboo subjects. "In the past, the party controlled everything we said, but no longer. The atmosphere is now very harmonious." But Pan had harsh words about the dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng, who have been detained and harassed by Beijing police in the past month. "The common people don't care one whit about them," he said. "They know that if the likes of Wang Dan or Wei Jingsheng were to become the leaders of China, they would not be able to handle a single matter well." As long as dissidents were handled by police in accordance with legal procedures, Pan believed no protests would be raised at their detentions.
