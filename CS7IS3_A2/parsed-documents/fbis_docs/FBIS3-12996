It will either come now or in another few months. The question is whether the Government of Israel will decide right away, on the basis of the security situation in the town, to issue an evacuation order against the Jewish inhabitants. The other possible date for a confrontation is in the summer, as July approaches. According to the Declaration of Principles [DOP], a significant change must take place in the city in another few months. It will be recalled that according to the agreement, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will redeploy no later than on the eve of the elections to the authority (the elections are to take place nine months after the DOP goes into effect). The accord says that "in deploying its military forces, Israel will be guided by the principle that its military forces should be redeployed outside populated areas." This means that IDF brigades will no longer be deployed in the center of Hebron, just as IDF units will not be able to move around the centers of Nabulus and Gaza, unless our aim is not to implement the accord with the Palestinians. Under the current security situation, there will be no choice but to offer the Hebron settlers the opportunity to move to Qiryat Arba'. If any of the Jewish settlers in Hebron believe that following the massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs and the frequent humiliation they cause their neighbors, their security will come from the Palestinian police, they are being overly optimistic. Israeli security experts do not share that view. The reason for the evacuation is therefore one of security rather than politics. When the ministers argue about the Jewish presence in Hebron, most of them base the need to evacuate on security reasons. Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer, who was coordinator of activities in the territories and the military commander of the West Bank, heads the proposal for the evacuation of Hebron and bases it on the need to defend the Jewish residents and not to please the Palestinians in the wake of the Hebron massacre. The ministers who heard the reports by Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq and Major General Dani Yatom, commander of the Central Command, got the impression that they are also worried about the security aspect. The Jews of Hebron have become a target, one of them said. Immediately after the massacre, another security official proposed to evacuate Hebron and Qiryat Arba', even temporarily. He was concerned about the women and children. Everybody listened, but his proposal was not discussed at that stage. From a military viewpoint, we have reached an absurd situation in Hebron. No precedent for the number of soldiers required to defend the Hebron settlers can be found in the history of border incidents or the defense of any other settlement. The ministers were shocked by the figures quoted by the chief of staff. Although we are in the midst of peace negotiations, the defense of the Hebron settlers is more like war deployment. There are times when numbers are not what counts -- for instance, if there were a need to defend Jerusalem. But that is not the case with Hebron, especially since Qiryat Arba' is not far away. A top IDF commander must tell the Hebron settlers candidly that it is very difficult to provide them with the security they expect. If that situation continues, it will not be enough to deploy in the town even a large part of the soldiers serving in the entire West Bank, and there might even be a need to expel Arabs from Hebron. The forecast of Avraham Ahituv, who was Shin Bet chief in the late 1970's and before that headed its Arab Department, is being realized. In the 1970's, some of the settlers began to infiltrate into Arab Hebron without permission. Some took unbridled actions even back then. Until that time, the situation between the two populations had been relatively calm. Ahituv came to Prime Minister Menahem Begin and told him that he was worried about "the infiltration into Hebron." He told Begin that we had arrived at a modus vivendi in the Cave of the Patriarchs and that there were good foundations for coexistence, but that the infiltration into Hebron might cause problems, for the security forces as well. He told Begin that this is what will hurt his party's basic tenet that Jews and Arabs can live together in peace under Israeli rule in Eretz Yisra'el. The entry into Hebron will only increase the friction and hatred, and clashes will become unavoidable. I dare to guess that if Rabin were told that the Hebron settlers would leave now of their own free will, he would welcome it. He is not pleased that the proposal was raised by ministers, because this may hurt the negotiations. At least two ministers are ready to discuss evacuating the settlers from Hebron within the framework of the negotiations with the Palestinians. At least another eight ministers are prepared to support an Israeli-initiated evacuation. The Americans view it from a different angle. They are concerned about 'Arafat's growing weakness, the risk to the peace negotiations, and the inadequate steps Israel took following the massacre. In their view, Israel must immediately make a unilateral move to put the talks back on track. The evacuation of Hebron for security reasons would be such an example, and their representatives are showing interest in it. Rabin will definitely be asked about it during his visit to Washington. But even the Americans, like the Palestinians, understand that you cannot ask Refa'el Eytan to join the coalition and, with the same breath, order the evacuation of the Jewish settlers from Hebron.
