In his opinion, the electors voted for "people with socially oriented thinking, and the alliance between patriots and supporters of a strong state is gaining in strength." Aman Tuleyev's victory in Kuzbass, which was "the stronghold of radical democrats quite recently", is convincing proof of it, Zyuganov believes. In his opinion, the same trend became prominent in Ukraine, which follows from the "convincing victory of the left-wing forces in eastern Ukraine and a strong support for state-oriented forces in the Crimea." Everywhere, with the exception of western Ukraine, "the opposition is being consolidated. Actually, it is the opposition to shock therapy and the breaking of ages-long ties between the three great Slavonic nations", Zyuganov continued. Commenting on the situation in the Crimea, he pointed out that although the public opinion poll, held there, has no legal force, it does reflect people's feelings, and "both Moscow and Kiev will have to take it into account." The Russian Communist leader said that the Communist party of the Russian Federation favoured the closest possible rapprochement of Moscow, Kiev and Simferopol, and not their drifting apart. "We shall hold a well-considered stand, aimed at improving relations between the Crimea, Ukraine and Russia... Nobody is encroaching upon anybody else's sovereignty, but there can be no real sovereignty, if economic relations are disintegrating," Zyuganov said. Moscow March 30 TASS -- Thirty four members of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation were elected to representative bodies in subjects of the Federation at the local elections last Sunday. A total of 216 Communist candidates took part in the elections, a spokesman for the department for work with the territories at the president's administration told ITAR-TASS. The activity of Communist candidates was rather high, but no more than 16 per cent of them won the elections. Thus, only two out of 27 Communist candidates got the needed number of votes in the Voronezh region, and as many in the Rostov region, where 31 Communists were standing for election. One out of 20 Communist candidates was elected in the Kursk region.
