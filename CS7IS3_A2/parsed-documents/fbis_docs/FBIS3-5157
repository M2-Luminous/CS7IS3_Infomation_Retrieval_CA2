He was responding to a question by Asian Airline and Aerospace, a publication produced during the Asian Aerospace 94 show which ended last week, about the perceived emergence of an arms race between the three countries. The minister said that an abrupt or significant U.S. withdrawal may lead to these countries feeling more insecure or wanting to fill the vacuum. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, China has the world's largest armed forces with three million troops while India has 1.2 million. Compared with these two giants, Japan's armed forces of 238,000 is miniscule. "Either way, it will mean that they will build up their military capabilities," Dr Yeo pointed out. "And if any of them becomes assertive, the result will be tension and instability in the region." He explained that the "restraining presence" of the U.S. meant that countries need not be as worried about their potential enemies and can focus their attention and resources on economic development rather than building up their military capabilities. Asked about the region's two hot spots -- the Spratlys and the Korean Peninsula -- he said that the potential for conflict in the South China Sea would be greatly increased if oil and gas were discovered. "However, so long as the countries involved are willing to abide by internationally accepted codes of conduct in resolving this territorial dispute, it was less likely that there will be open conflict in the region," he said. On tension in the Korean Peninsula, he commented that an arms race could be triggered off in north-east Asia if Pyongyang developed a nuclear bomb. "Japan could feel so threatened that it proceeds to develop a nuclear capacity of its own," he said. Such a turn of events would in turn prompt China and the two Koreas to accelerate their military build-up. "An arms race in northeast Asia will create tensions that could destabilise the entire Asia-Pacific," he noted. The minister said that because of the uncertainty in the region in the post-Cold War era, "security is something we cannot take for granted". He said: "Singapore believes that the best means to maintain peace and stability is to develop an understanding among the countries here as well as those countries which can make an impact on our security, such as the U.S., China, Russia, Australia and Japan." This was why the Republic strongly supported the Asean Regional Forum (ARF) which provides the framework for multilateral discussions of security issues on a regular basis. It would also enhance the close defence relations and cooperation which had been built up over the years, he said. Touching on Singapore's role in the discussions of security issues on a collective basis, he said that being small, it could not influence the course of events. "But by acting together with other Asean countries, we have a role to play in cooling down any potential conflict which may arise in the region."
