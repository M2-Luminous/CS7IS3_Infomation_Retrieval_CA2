The official who declined to be named also said Iraq's commercial attache Khalid Khalaf and cultural attache Muhammad Kazim allegedly told police that they gunned down Talib al-Suhayl [al-Tamimi] at his Beirut home on Baghdad's orders. A third suspect in Tuesday's killing, an Iraqi embassy guard, was reported to be on the run. Lebanon has summoned its acting charge d'affaires in Iraq, Sa'd Zakhiyah, to return to Beirut for consultations and he was expected to arrive later Thursday. The official told AFP the cabinet approved on Wednesday a proposal by Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz to consider depriving the diplomats of their immunity from prosecution. Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf tried telephoning Buwayz on Wednesday but could not speak to him because his Lebanese counterpart was attending the weekly cabinet meeting, the official added. Iraqi opposition groups denounced al-Suhayl's killing in statements to AFP. Al-Suhayl, who was in his 70s, had lived in Beirut for several years and held both Jordanian and Saudi passports. The outlawed al-Da'awah al-Islamiyah urged the Lebanese authorities to take all the necessary steps to punish the killers "particularly because we have information that the Iraqi intelligence services have plans to kill (other) dissidents in Lebanon and in other countries in the region." The al-Da'awah also urged the Lebanese authorities to protect Iraqi dissidents living in Lebanon. The London-based Free Iraqi Council opposition group said al-Suhayl was a distinguished opposition figure extremely active in trying to bring about change in Iraq." He was involved with a group of senior Iraqi officers and officials from Tikrit and Mosul in a plot to topple Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, the group said. It also charged that the US intelligence service CIA was implicated in al-Suhayl's assassination. The CIA has turned down his request for help in plotting Saddam's downfall and probably betrayed him, the Free Iraqi Council said. "The CIA must have passed on the information to Saddam Husayn who went on to assassinate hundreds of army officers and other figures in July 1993," it said. According to officials al-Suhayl was killed Tuesday night by a man who knocked on his door pretending to be a delivery boy. When al-Suhayl appeared the killer pulled out a gun with a silencer and shot him dead. Security forces staked out the Iraqi embassy in the northern suburbs at dawn and arrested two diplomats as they arrived. The Iraqis were carrying guns which may have been used in the killing. Iraqi charge d'affaires 'Awwad Fakhri was summoned Wednesday to the Lebanese foreign ministry but he told reporters he was not aware of the facts.
