But not only that, over the past year, the rate of growth has exceeded the rate of inflation. There have been only 12 years since the war in which the rate of growth has exceeded the rate of inflation in this way and only four years since 1970. Of course it is not enough. We can't be satisfied with this achievement in a single year. The challenge is to improve on this performance and sustain it year after year. And, if you won't find this shocking coming from a central banker, I believe the prospects are encouraging. First, there is the improvement in the world economy, including the recovery now clearly visible in our major markets on the Continent. Second there is the improved supply-side flexibility of our own economy, in both the goods and services and the labour markets, following the deregulation and liberalisation that has characterised the last decade and more. Compared with many countries, in continental Europe certainly, this means that we are relatively well placed. Third there is our prospective fiscal position. The action taken by the Government, and indeed by our present Chancellor, last year, progressively to reduce the PSBR [Public Sector Borrowing Requirement] was never going to be popular whatever form it took. But such action was crucially necessary. It was necessary to achieve a proper balance between domestic and external demand. It was necessary to make room for private-sector expenditure and for a shift in the balance of private spending from consumption to investment, without which the expansion could not be sustained. Finally, there is the monetary policy framework, which I believe gives us a better chance of moving towards our goal of price stability in the medium term than at any stage in my professional lifetime. Since we came out of the ERM [Exchange Rate Mechanism], a series of steps have been taken to make our objective unequivocally clear and the policy process almost totally transparent. The latest step, the Chancellor's recent decision to publish the minutes of our monthly monetary policy meetings will, in time, do a great deal to improve public understanding of our shared commitment to continuing low inflation. It may, though, spoil the fun for some of the pundits who will no longer need to speculate about possible disagreements. The testing time will come, as it must inevitably come sooner or later, when we need to raise interest rates in order to moderate the pace of expansion and pre-empt the emergence of associated cost and price pressures. With the economy still operating below capacity, though no-one can know just how far below, it may be that this point is still some way off. But whenever it comes, I hope that it will be regarded positively, as a considered response to the underlying strength of the economy and to the prospect for inflation in the medium term, and not as evidence of weakness, in simple knee-jerk reaction to the latest set of erratic monetary or economic data. Our purpose will be to maintain the expansion at a sustainable pace, and not to leave the tightening of policy so late that the economy is brought to a juddering halt by a much larger interest- rate rise than would otherwise be needed. It is a realistic hope that next year I will be able to report on a second consecutive year of growth above the rate of inflation and I even venture to look forward to the year after next.
