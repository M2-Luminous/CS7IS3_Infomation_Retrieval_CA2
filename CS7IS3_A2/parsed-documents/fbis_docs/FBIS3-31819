If one doubts this, it is enough that they would listen to the salvos of criticism and denunciations of the decision that resounded throughout the world. Greece apparently thinks that it could assert its long-range interests through a painful pressure upon the young republic at a very painful moment for the Balkans. Athens certainly wants to make sure that in the future Skopje will not present any territorial claims regarding the northern Greek province of Macedonia. Such a possibility exists and it cannot be refuted a priori. However, this is not the greatest problem at the present. It is a question for the future whether Skopje will declare territorial claims regarding Greek territory. However, an economic blockade, which is taking place at the present, already represents a clash between Greece and Macedonia. This bodes great dangers against the background of the existing situation in the Balkans. One of them is in forcing the Macedonians into a too close alliance with Albania in order to obtain a commercial outlet to the world. This could violate the very fragile ethnic-political balance in Macedonia. The second danger is in Greece trying to apply pressure on other Balkan countries, including Bulgaria, in an attempt to prevent Macedonia from obtaining a commercial outlet. This could violate the fragile political balance in the southern Balkans. One should not be puzzled if it appears that, while thinking about its long-range interests, Greece neglects the importance of the immediate ones. The trouble is that the states bordering on Greece could also pay for this mistake, despite the fact that this is the last thing they want.
