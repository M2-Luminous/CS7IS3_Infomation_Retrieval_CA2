FR940516-1-00069 FR940516-1-00005 H. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements The owner or operator of any BLR or wet strength resin source subject to these standards would be required to fulfill all reporting requirements outlined in the General Provisions to 40 CFR part 63. V. Summary of Environmental, Energy, Cost, and Economic Impacts A. Facilities Affected by These NESHAP These NESHAP would affect BLR and WSR facilities that are major sources in themselves, or constitute a portion of a major source. There are three existing manufacturers of BLR, all of which were assumed to be major sources for the purpose of developing these standards. (Final determination of major source status occurs as part of the compliance determination process). Of the 17 existing facilities that manufacture WSR, 9 were assumed to be considered major sources. The expected growth rate for the BLR industry and the wet strength resin industry is expected to be between 2 and 3 percent through 1995. Impacts associated with the control options are presented in Table 3 and Table 4; the options selected as proposed standards are footnoted.
