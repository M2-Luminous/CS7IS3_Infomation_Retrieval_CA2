The projected summit has already caught the attention of Middle East watchers and Arab and world media. The consensus is that the fate of the entire Middle East peace process hangs on the outcome of the Geneva summit. AL-BA'TH notes the importance that the United States attaches to the Geneva summit and cites a statement to that effect by Warren Christopher. The paper also quotes U.S. Administration officials as expressing the hope the session will propel the peace process forward and Washington's assertion that it will continue to work for a comprehensive peace. Arab and world media are agreed that Syria's posture on the peace process is the right one. They point out that Middle East security and stability are inconceivable while a chunk of Arab territory remains under Israeli occupation. AL-BA'TH stresses that the world, and the United States in particular, realizes that, without the involvement of Syria and Lebanon, peace in the Middle East stands no chance. It counsels wariness of Israel's procrastination and insistence on separate and partial deals. Syria, the paper emphasizes, will have absolutely nothing to do with partial and separate deals, as such a course will heighten tension in the region. Syria wants a comprehensive peace founded on UN resolutions and the Madrid formula, AL-BA'TH concludes. AL-THAWRAH comments on escalating Israeli attacks on south Lebanon, seeing the action within the context of a strategy to use the volatile situation as a bargaining chip and lever to apply pressure on Lebanon. The Rabin government, using an iron fist to blackmail Lebanon, deal with it in isolation from other Arab states, and force it into signing a separate agreement, is out to undermine coordination among Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. The idea is to weaken the Arab position and pave the way for Israel to deal with each of the three tracks separately and subsequently dictate its terms and own solutions. Coming two weeks before the the summit between al-Asad and Clinton, the attacks are seen by the paper as a bid to whip up tension and deflect the session from its declared objective of giving an impetus to the peace process and promoting a just and comprehensive settlement along the lines of the Madrid formula and pertinent UN resolutions. The responsibility of the international community and the American sponsors cannot be overstated. Both must use their clout, be firm, and rein in Israel lest it get carried away by its aggressive bent. They must bring about enough pressure to force an Israeli pullout of south Lebanon, the Golan Heights, and other occupied Arab territory as envisaged by UN resolutions -- the underpinnings of a fair and comprehensive peace, AL-THAWRAH concludes.
