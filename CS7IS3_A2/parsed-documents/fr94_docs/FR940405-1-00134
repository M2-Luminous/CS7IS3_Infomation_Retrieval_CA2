Table A&hyph;2 shows how to determine if the indoor sample results are significantly different from the results taken outdoors. Use this table by following these steps: (1) Take the same number of samples indoors and outdoors. (2) Average the results of the outdoor and indoor samples. (a) Add the outdoor results together and divide by the number of samples taken. (b) Add the indoor results together and divide by the number of samples taken. (3) Compare the range of the outdoor and indoor samples. (a) Subtract the lowest sample result of the outdoor samples from the highest result for the outdoor samples. (b) Subtract the lowest sample result of the indoor samples from the highest result for the indoor samples. (4) Calculate Delta, which is a term derived by subtracting the difference between the indoor average and the outdoor average and then multiplying that result times 2. (5) Calculate the Sum of the Ranges. Add the outdoor Range and the indoor Range together. (6) Calculate the Test Statistic. Divide Delta by the Sum of the Ranges . (7) Compare the Test Statistic with the second column in the table below. If the Test Statistic is more than the number found in the column, the difference is significant. Example: (1) Three samples are taken indoors and three samples are taken outdoors. The results of the outdoor samples are 500 ppm, 580 ppm and 480 ppm. The results of the indoor samples are 650 ppm, 710 ppm, and 680 ppm. (2) The average of the outdoor samples is 520 ppm (1,560 ppm divided by 3) and the average of the indoor samples is 680 ppm (2,040 ppm divided by 3). (3) The Range of the outdoor samples is 100 (580^480=100) and the Range of the indoor samples is 60 ppm (710^650). (4) ``Delta'' is 320; (680^520)Ã—2=320. (5) The ``Sum of the Ranges'' is 160; (100+60)=160. (6) The ``Test Statistic'' is 2 (320 divided by 160=2). (7) Since the ``Test Statistic,'' 2, is greater the 0.974 found in the table for 3 samples, the indoor air levels of carbon dioxide are significantly more than the outdoor air levels.

If the indoor sample results show levels that are greater than 800 ppm or that the indoor levels are significantly more than the outdoor levels, initiate actions to investigate the functioning of the HVAC system and determine if the employees are affected.
