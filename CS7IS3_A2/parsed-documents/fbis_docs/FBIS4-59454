In an interview with a MENA correspondent in Damascus, Muhammad said that he put forward an initiative to resolve the Yemeni crisis and that he is consulting about it with some personalities who are not involved in the current dispute. He added that if these personalities and the parties to the dispute respond to this initiative, he is willing to go with these personalities to Sanaa or Aden to stop the bloodletting and save unity. He stressed that any efforts, suggested solutions, or initiatives to resolve the Yemeni crisis must be based on the principle of safeguarding the Yemeni unity, not on returning to the situation that prevailed before 22 May 1990. The former Yemeni president pointed out that he had presented several initiatives last year and this year and that he warned earlier against turning conflicts among the members of the ruling coalition into the funeral pyre of unity. He regretted what is going on in Yemen, reaffirming his backing for every effort to safeguard unity and resolve the conflict through dialogue and peaceful methods. He noted that what is happening at present does not help the two sides to have a peaceful dialogue. Commenting on the appointment of a defense minister and a navy commander from among his old loyalists, he remarked that his loyalists who went to Sanaa with him after the January 1986 incidents were divided between the General People's Congress and the Yemeni Socialist Party, after these two partners had (?aborted) the setting up of a democratic unionist party during the honeymoon that preceded unity. He pointed out that this was the choice of his loyalists and that it was not planned. Muhammad affirmed that appointments to party and government posts are according to the prevailing political rules and that he has nothing whatsoever to do with these appointments. He remarked that accepting an appointment is the personal choice of the person selected for a post.
