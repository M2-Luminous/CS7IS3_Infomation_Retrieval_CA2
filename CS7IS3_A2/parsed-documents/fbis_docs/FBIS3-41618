Murmansk--For more than three months Norwegian authorities have worked to get this equipment cleared through Russian customs. Russia has demanded an importation fee and value-added tax on the equipment, which is a gift from Norway. The problem was solved when Minister of Foreign Affairs Johan Jorgen Holst last week got in touch with the head of the Russian Ministry of Nuclear Affairs, Viktor Mikhailov. The equipment has now been delivered to the nuclear power plant duty free. Director Knut Gussgard at the National Radiation Protection Board says that this decision is important for nuclear safety work. ``The customs problems almost put a halt to the entire Norwegian-Russian work to improve safety at the nuclear power plant at Polyarny Sori, which is not up to Western standards in several areas,'' he says. The Kola power plant, which opened in 1973, has four reactors. Two of these are of the same type as those at the nuclear power plant in Greifswald in the former East Germany. The Greifswald plant has been closed for safety reasons. New Million [Kroner] Gift The National Radiation Protection Board did not want to continue with the work of improving safety conditions at Kola until the first shipment of maintenance equipment and batteries were in place. ``Since the problem now has been solved, we will order an emergency generator unit worth 10 million kroner. If everything goes according to plan, the unit will be installed at the power plant just after the new year,'' Gussgard says. The National Radiation Protection Board realized a long time ago that the emergency power supply was not good enough. A power failure at the nuclear power plant on 2 February clearly showed this. The reactor cores were then in danger of a meltdown. Only after two hours did the power plant manage to get the power supply up again. A catastrophe was probably averted. The emergency power unit from Norway will prevent such a situation from arising again, according to the National Radiation Protection Board. Customs Dispute Both the Russian Consulate at Kirkenes, the Norwegian Consulate in Murmansk, and the embassy in Moscow have worked to get the Norwegian equipment out to the power plant duty free. The head of the customs department in Murmansk thinks that the safety equipment is a form of emergency aid and therefore should be duty free. However, customs officials in Moscow demanded both an importation fee and value-added tax on the equipment. Tariff rates are high in Russia. All told tariffs and taxes on the Norwegian equipment would have amounted to almost half a million kroner. High Priority The political advisor at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tore Gundersen, says that environmental problems in northwestern Russia have top priority in the cooperation in the Barents region, and that the solution of the customs problems is of importance for any further nuclear safety work. ``We are planning to expand the aid package of 20 million kroner. But first we want to see the result of the first grant. It is important that the customs problems have been solved. We are prepared to grant additional millions for environmental work in the northwestern part of Russia,'' Gundersen says.
