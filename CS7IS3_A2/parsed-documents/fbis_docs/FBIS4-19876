This is not surprising, since the company has invested 10.9 billion kronor [SKr], i.e., 17 percent of its 1993 sales figures, in research and development. This result was not beaten even by research-intensive pharmaceutical companies. But Ericsson is not uncontested in the Swedish top league. Sandvik AB performed best during the first three months of the year. Sandvik has more published patents applications than any other Swedish enterprise and this ensures the company a continued strong position in future index ratings. Ericsson has for some years maintained a clear strategy, filing patent applications in a more active and well-prepared manner. This is where Erling Blomme, the company's legal executive, plays an important role. He is in charge of the way the corporation handles its patents. Erling Blomme maintains that since the 1980's Ericsson has been placing an increasing emphasis on protecting itself through patents. The results show in a gradual increase of the number of patents granted. In the first index published by DAGENS INDUSTRI in October 1993, Ericsson scored 22 patents granted. By the next quarter, this figure had grown to 27. The latest patent index shows 28 patents between October 1993 and the end of March 1994. Japanese telecommunications companies have not caused Ericsson any problems in the area of patents. The Japanese are known for their "lightning-fast" action to secure important key patents by patenting all surrounding applications. But these obstructive patents make it impossible for the original constructor to apply his design without infringing his own patent infringements. "On the other hand, we have become aware of new operators in the West," Erling Blomme said. "For instance, there are U.S. companies with a patents portfolio as their only asset and source of income." The U.S. telecommunications company AT&T ran into difficulties with a "patents company" that attacked all telephone exchange suppliers on the U.S. market, including Ericsson, which got its share of problems. The patents company succeeded in obtaining a SKr280-million settlement from AT&T the first time the issue went to court. Last fall Ericsson was summoned to court in the United States by the U.S. telecommunications company IDC. The U.S. company alleged that Ericsson had, among other things, violated an important subpatent within the new digital standard for mobile telecommunications. Ericsson responded with a countersummons, claiming that the patents of IDC are invalid. "We have managed quite well on the U.S. market so far," Erling Blomme said.
