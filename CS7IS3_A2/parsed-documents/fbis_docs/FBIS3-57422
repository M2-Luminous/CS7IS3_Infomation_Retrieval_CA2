A president who is ever more trying to play the role of supreme arbiter, "the father of the nation." A government in which the "practicalists" [praktiki] have effectively overpowered the "marketeers." A parliament that is still divided into several parts: the even firmer democrats and the even more rabid "reds and browns." What next? [Gaydar] It is easier for me to talk about the main, pivotal line in economic policy, which will be taking shape in the next few months, not about the movement of figures. I do not believe very much in the apocalyptic forecasts predicting an immediate economic catastrophe resulting from the new government's actions. I still believe it will have enough common sense not to do what sectoral lobbyists demand. It seems to me more likely that the government, under pressure from conflicting interests, will pursue a policy of half-measures, half-steps, first stepping up the inflationary process, then putting the brakes on somewhat. Inflation will be fairly high -- 20 to 25 percent a month -- and people, realizing the essence of inflationary taxation, will start adapting themselves to the conditions of inflation, while the process of declining actual money supply will naturally continue. [Gurevich] That is to say, instead of an ineluctable, speedy catastrophe you forecast a prolonged agony that may just as well result in a catastrophe, which this time may break out by the next presidential elections. [Gaydar] This development of events may, of course, assuredly paralyze Russia's chances of economic growth. If someone in fact sincerely believes in the existence of nonmonetary methods of combating inflation... If there is readiness to exchange the well-being of one's own citizens for an expansion of the sphere of Russia's imperial influence, one may get mixed up in ill-conceived currency unions -- why not? But I am certain that only an economically stable Russia with a strong currency could be a point of attraction for its neighbors. [Gurevich] I have also heard another version of your resignation: It was a combination thought out together with the president and designed to bring down Chernomyrdin in the end. [Gaydar] It's like Tolstoy wrote [in "War and Peace"]: the first column is marching, the second column is marching... [Gurevich] Do you plan to focus on working at the State Duma now? [Gaydar] I am a leader of the "Russia's Choice" parliamentary faction, and I will use this position to defend policies of which I am confident. Presently the actual leverage of authority is, of course, held by the government. A compromise situation where both lines of economic development coexisted within one government is a thing of the past. Society will be fully able to assess the results of its work. [Gurevich] The trial-and-error method in this situation is a cruel experiment. [Gaydar] The reason I resigned was precisely because certainty in terms of responsibility is also an insurance. The period of reform from above in Russia has ended; further movement will be determined by the initiative and pressure from the bottom up. [Gurevich] Back to the State Duma: Some people are leaving your faction. [Gaydar] I think this is natural. The situation has changed; a faction that was seen by many people as a government faction is no longer such, the political landscape has changed. I do not see any tragedy in the fact that some people have decided that working in other groups would be more advisable. An overwhelming majority of the faction members, however, are unanimous in their commitment to the program principles of "Russia's Choice." [Gurevich] Rumors have been circulating about Gennadiy Burbulis' leaving your faction; he is still a prominent figure... [Gaydar] Gennadiy Eduardovich has not said anything about his intention to go over to another faction. [Gurevich] Is the president still accessible to you and people who share your views? For it turned out that he did not even know that he was scheduled to meet with Fedorov on Monday. [Gaydar] I know that the president wants reform to continue, that he takes it close to heart. In many instances he supported us in resolving very difficult and contentious questions. The president works within the limits of reality, though -- he is not a tsar, not our Lord, not even a general secretary. He should heed the balance of forces in society, think about stability.
