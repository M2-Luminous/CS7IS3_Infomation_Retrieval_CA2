However he gave no indication that members would be any more ready to act than they have been since August, when NATO threatened air strikes to relieve the siege of Sarajevo. As expected, what we are hearing from the summit is fine words about new partnerships for peace in East Europe but a reluctance to deal with the most obvious source of instability in the region. Perhaps, at heart, the President does not consider the war in Bosnia to be a direct American concern; his unwelcome enthusiasm for further political integration on this side of the Atlantic suggests that he would prefer Europeans to unite in sorting out the continent's problems on their own. In domestic political terms, Mr Clinton can perhaps afford to keep his distance from the Balkans. He can hardly do the same with the threat posed by North Korea's advancing nuclear programme; countering proliferation is one of the main planks of his foreign policy, and an American infantry division is deployed between Seoul and the North Korean border. Yet the same lack of will is painfully apparent. The main protagonists--the United States, China, Japan and South Korea--obviously dread the idea of Pyongyang's actually using a nuclear bomb. But their actions suggest that mere possession of nuclear materiel might, at a pinch, be tolerable. All concerned hope that they can keep the situation within manageable bounds. South Korea fears that precipitate disintegration of its northern neighbour will result in a reunification process even more debilitating than was Germany's. Despite their frequent irritation with the unpredictable Kim Il-song, both China and Japan regard a divided Korea as easier to deal with than a united peninsula. The main casualty of such cynicism towards the international non- proliferation regime is the credibility of American foreign policy. The United States has retreated from President Clinton's fiery rhetoric of last July--when he vowed the destruction of North Korea if it used a nuclear device--to actions that suggest that almost any deal is worthwhile. Having declared then that no inducements would be offered to Pyongyang until it fulfilled its international obligations, the Administration is now offering a string of concessions. In so doing, it has undermined the International Atomic Energy Agency's insistence on regular "challenge" inspections of undeclared sites. Thus, both in Europe and Asia, Mr Clinton's much vaunted emphasis on economic security is being undermined by his reluctance to act decisively to safeguard political-military security.
