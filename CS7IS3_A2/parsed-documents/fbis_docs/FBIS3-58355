According to Aho, in the debate at home, Finland has been placed in the same position as the member countries of the former Warsaw Treaty. After talks with Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, Aho's interpretation was that the Partnership for Peace initiative serves primarily the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe, and an open invitation has been extended to the other CSCE countries merely in the name of impartiality. Aho thought that the countries that had sought membership in the European Union could progress to become observer or full members of the Union's defense system, the Western European Union, and that way possibly further into NATO membership. Aho said that the Finnish Government intends to ask for clarification of what NATO means by Partnership for Peace.
