The problems of overstaffed organizations, duplication of functions, uneven relations, and low efficiency still exist in the province. It is time for us to conduct reform and to deal with these problems fundamentally. According to the station reporter's dispatch from the provincial personnel affairs work conference that concluded on 15 January, the major tasks the province adopted to cope with the aforementioned problems are to push forward in an overall way reform of organs; to establish gradually or enforce the system of public servants; to conduct vigorous reform of the wages systems of organs, establishments, and units and to orient the wages systems to an enforcement track; to promote reform of the system of social insurance in organs, establishments, and units; to deepen reform of personnel affairs systems of enterprises and establishments; to actively establish or improve the managerial and service systems for talented personnel; and to enhance the management over the affairs of specialized and technical cadres. In successfully conducting reform of organs and enforcing the system of public servants, emphasis should be placed on successfully grasping the connection between the reform of organs and the enforcement of public servant systems. First, we should do a good job in conducting definition in the following three fields: 1) The definition of organs functions; 2) The definition of organs names; and 3) The definition of staff size. We should be determined to deal with the long-standing problems of disputes over trifles that exist among economic departments and between the comprehensive economic departments and the specialized economic departments. Second, we should carry out personnel transfers and do a good job in shifting the function of departments. A central task in this regard is to establish a demarcation line, under the socialist market economy system, between things that must be controlled by the state and those that should not be controlled, and to deal correctly with the relationship between them. Streamlining the staff size of organs and transferring personnel constitute a difficult point in reforming organs and is a premise of enforcing the system of public servants. In line with the demands of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the province's situation, the party and government organs at or above the county level across the province should carry out a personnel cut of 35,000. This is a quite arduous task and requires us to do a good job in deeply and carefully conducting ideological and political work among personnel and to enable the broad masses of cadres, staff members, and workers to adopt a correct attitude toward the new appointments and dismissals by realizing it is necessary in order to build Hebei into a strong economic province. We should try to have the reappointees be relaxed and greeted with pleasure by the outgoing personnel. The provincial party committee and the provincial people's government have decided that the province will basically complete the reform of organs by the end of 1995 and the work of enforcing the systems of public servants by the end of 1996. Tasks for the two reform projects are very arduous. Meanwhile, they have also made specific arrangements for the reform of the wage systems.
