He told this to an ITAR-TASS correspondent in a telephone conversation today. Viktor Ilyukhin is unperturbed by the news that Anatoliy Chubays has decided to bring a court action against him for slander. "As a lawyer," he underlined, "I judge the documents I have collected to be very serious. They show convincingly that the methods which Anatoliy Chubays is using to carry out the transfer of state property into private hands serve the interests of only 15 to 20 percent of Russia's population." Without waiting for the court to consider, the chairman of the Duma Security Committee has decided to inform press representatives of the contents of these documents on approximately 11-12 May -- immediately after the end of the lower chamber of parliament's recess.
