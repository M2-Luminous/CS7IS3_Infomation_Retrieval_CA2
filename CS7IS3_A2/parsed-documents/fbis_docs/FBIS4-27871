Allies, including the United States, also recognize that sanctions by the UN Security Council must not be carried out from simply a symbolic level but from a practical level." This high-ranking official held a news conference with reporters accompanying President Kim on the afternoon of 5 June at the Uzbekistan Hotel in Tashkent, where they are staying, and explained the background and prospects of the consultations held for taking sanctions against North Korea by the UN Security Council. He also revealed: "Discussions on the North Korean nuclear issue will be carried out on a full scale starting this week." This official added: "The government's position is that the sanctions must be carried out in stages. We plan to discuss this matter with allies so that practical sanctions can be carried out on a step-by-step basis." Following is a summary of the news conference: [Reporter] What is the reason for carrying out step-by-step sanctions? [Official] It is to give North Korea the opportunity to prove the transparency of its past nuclear activities. The method to clarify North Korea's past nuclear activities has not yet disappeared completely. Other than measuring the replaced fuel rods, we can clarify it through a special inspection [tukpyol sachal] or other inspection methods. Sanctions are not meant to block the opportunity to prove its transparency from the beginning. [Reporter] What are the moves being taken by North Korea? [Official] There is nothing peculiar. Up-to-date intelligence capabilities that can inspect every corner of North Korea 24 hours a day have been mobilized on a full scale. A close posture of military preparedness has been assumed between the ROK and the United States, and we can strengthen it further if necessary. We expect that there will be no provocations from North Korea. [Reporter] What is China's position? [Official] When Tang Jiaxuan, Chinese deputy foreign minister, visited the ROK from 2 to 4 June, and held the ROK-China deputy foreign ministers meeting, they discussed the North Korean nuclear issue. It is known that China also expressed worry and interest over the fact that North Korea decided to go ahead and replace the fuel rods. [Reporter] What is North Korea's attitude? [Official] The recent remark by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu emphasizes the inevitability of replacing the fuel rods, and that if the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks is held, the issue of special and ad hoc inspections [tukpyol mit imsi sachal] can be resolved. This shows that there is no change in its existing position. [Reporter] Other than the sanctions by the UN Security Council, are independent sanctions against North among the allies including the ROK, the United States, and Japan being examined? [Official] Under the current situation I believe that it will be possible to take sanctions through a UN Security Council resolution. Of course, we cannot eliminate various possibilities, and since President Kim received Russia's promise for a firm support during his visit to Russia, we will work to promote sanctions through a UN Security Council resolution.
