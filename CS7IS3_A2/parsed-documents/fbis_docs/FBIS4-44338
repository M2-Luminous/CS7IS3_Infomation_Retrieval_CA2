HADEP was founded to take the place of the Democracy Party (DEP) which was closed down by the Constitutional Court. So far, no one has come forward as a candidate for chairmanship of HADEP, although acting chairman Murat Bozlak is expected to announce his candidacy for the post. DEP Chairman Hatip Dicle, who is currently in prison, has rejected calls to run as a candidate for the HADEP chairmanship. "Our friends outside will be of more help," he said. Several DEP members, who joined HADEP after DEP's closure, stated that they wished to continue their political struggle within the new party. Seventeen of DEP's administrators joined HADEP before the congress. They include the party's deputy chairmen Osman Ozcelik, Bahattin Gunel and Kemal Bilget and the administrators Ismail Arslan, Seyhmuz Cagro, Nevzat Ozbay, Ahmet Cihan, Harun Cakmak, Melik Aygul, Muharrem Keklik, Ahmet Karatas, Mehmet Nuri Gundes, Mehmet Zeynettin Unay, Mahmut Kovan, Aynur Gurbuz, Veysi Aydin and Ali Beykoylu.
