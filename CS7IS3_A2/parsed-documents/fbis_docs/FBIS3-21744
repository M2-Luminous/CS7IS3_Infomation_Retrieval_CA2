News Director Julio Miller is on the telephone with Roberto Leyton, former Panamanian ambassador to the OAS. Miller: Mr. Leyton, is this information from the United States true? Leyton: I can only tell you what I know, which is what my brother's lawyers told me when I talked to them at noon. They told me that the charge is indeed conspiracy to launder money, and that my brother has reiterated his absolute innocence. They have said that there is no specific accusation against my brother. They themselves concede that they have never seen anything similar to this because my brother has not been accused of conducting any transactions with cash money, which is what is regularly referred to as money laundering--an attempt to convert money obtained illegally into cash. According to what my brother has told them, he has strictly abided by Panamanian laws; all money transfers were conducted with the proper authorization of the people he was representing; and those transfers never involved cash money, but were bank transactions of money that had already been deposited in renowned banks. According to him, he has done nothing different from what corporate lawyers do in Panama. Miller: Mr. Leyton, what about the involvement of companies such as Merryl-Lynch and the existence of 45 kg of cocaine that were going to be introduced in the United States? Leyton: I repeat again: I have no information regarding any drug accusations against my brother, only about the charge of conspiring to launder money. From a newscast I watched before, I think Merryl-Lynch is involved, but I have no proof of this. My sole concern is my brother. Miller: When will a decision be made? Leyton: I have no information on that. All I know is there will be a hearing on 4 March to determine bail. The lawyers have already told me that it is difficult for foreigners to obtain bail because they have no collateral. My brother does not have enough resources to make a deposit as large as the one they usually request, however, there will be a hearing to discuss this matter. I want to use this opportunity to denounce the slander and evil intentions of people who have tried to involve me in this matter. I have nothing to do with this situation, I do not even work with my brother. We have not even had a single client in common. Ricardo is my brother, I believe he is innocent, and I will support him as his brother, but we run our offices independently. I do not know for sure if there are political motivations behind this, but I want to explain that my brother and I do not even belong to the same political party or follow the same political trends. Do you have any more questions? Miller: Thanks, Mr. Leyton. We are very grateful for your statement. Fonseca: During his first statement in Tampa, Ricardo Leyton has maintained his innocence. With regard to this case, 28 persons have been arrested. Thus far, reports have mentioned that Luis Sanchez, a businessman, and Ricardo McFadden, an auditor, were arrested with Leyton in Tampa. RPC Television learned that on 4 March, the Tampa Court will decide whether or not Leyton and the other 28 suspects will be freed on bail. RPC reports indicate that several covert DEA agents infiltrated the group of presumed investors, and that they were the ones to leak the information and provide the details to issue an arrest warrant against Leyton and the others who are accused.
