"We cannot understand why Estonia has adopted such an inhuman attitude towards the retired military," Svirin said. "If Estonia abandoned that position we could solve many problems we face," he said while adding that Russia does not intend to postpone inter- state negotiations. Russia's position is that recent rounds have ended without results and have become negotiations for the sake of negotiations, Svirin said adding that no agreements have been initialed. Therefore, Russia has proposed that all four working groups meet in Moscow and draw up proposals in order to come out of the deadlock. "When those proposals are ready, we will together with Ambassador Vaino Reinart decide when the next round of negotiations will take place and the Ambassador has agreed," Svirin said. Estonia's position is that the retired Russian military should leave the country. Latvia recently went to a compromise with Russia allowing some 20,000 Russian ex-officers to stay in Latvia.
