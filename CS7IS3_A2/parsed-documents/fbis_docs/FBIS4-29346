Settlement on auto trade talks will probably be delayed beyond the July 8-10 summit, International Trade and Industry Minister Hata told a press conference. But he added Japan could reach accord on "the overall direction" of bilateral auto trade during a meeting between Prime Minister Tstutomu Hata and U.S. President Bill Clinton to be held along with the Naples summit. Japan previously expressed hope that talks on auto trade and two other priority framework sectors -- government procurement and insurance -- will be settled before the Naples G-7 meeting. "There should be flexibility in bilateral framework negotiations," Hata said. On Japan's economy, Hata said "the biggest concern" is a strong yen. Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno depicted a brighter economic prospect in his latest press conference amid an emerging sign of a recovery in various industrial sectors, Hata said. But he added small companies are still struggling under the lingering uptrend of the yen against the dollar.
