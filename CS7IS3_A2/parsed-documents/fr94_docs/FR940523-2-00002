FR940523-2-00002 FR940523-2-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [Docket No. 92&hyph;127&hyph;3] Public Meeting; Availability of Environmental Assessment and Preliminary Finding of No Significant Impact for Determination of Nonregulated Status of Upjohn Co., ZW&hyph;20 Virus Resistant Squash AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is announcing that a public meeting will be held to discuss an environmental assessment and preliminary finding of no significant impact prepared for a determination of nonregulated status for a genetically engineered virus-resistant squash line designated ``ZW&hyph;20 squash.'' APHIS will be accepting public comments on the environmental assessment. APHIS has previously requested public comments on any plant pest risk issues presented by the ZW&hyph;20 squash. The environmental assessment and preliminary finding indicate no significant impact on the environment from the determination that the ZW&hyph;20 squash does not present a plant pest risk and should no longer be regulated under APHIS' regulations. Based on this preliminary finding of no significant impact, APHIS has determined that an environmental impact statement need not be prepared for the issuance of this determination. DATES: The public meeting will be held in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, June 21, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 to 4 p.m. local time. Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before July 7, 1994, regarding the environmental assessment. ADDRESSES: The public meeting will be held in the Jefferson Auditorium, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC. The following documents may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays: Copies of the environmental assessment and preliminary finding of no significant impact, the petition submitted by the Upjohn Company, and the comments received in response to our September, 1992, and March, 1993, Federal Register notices. Persons wishing to inspect these documents are requested to call ahead on (202) 690&hyph;2817. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. James White, Biotechnology Permits, BBEP, APHIS, USDA, room 850 Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;7612.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 4, 1992, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) issued a notice of proposed interpretive ruling (57 FR 40632&hyph;40633, Docket No. 92&hyph;127&hyph;1) in response to a petition from the Upjohn Company (Upjohn), Kalamazoo, MI, for a determination of regulatory status of its ZW&hyph;20 virus-resistant squash line. After considering the comments submitted during the 30-day comment period, APHIS determined that it was in the public interest to reopen the comment period to examine scientific issues raised by the commenters. A notice was published in the Federal Register on March 22, 1993 (58 FR 15323, Docket No. 92&hyph;127&hyph;2), requesting additional information on eight issues raised by respondents to Docket No. 92&hyph;127&hyph;1. On March 31, 1993 (58 FR 17044&hyph;17059, Docket No. 92&hyph;156&hyph;2), APHIS amended its regulations in 7 CFR part 340 by establishing a petition process. The petition process allows for a determination that certain plants are no longer regulated articles, and formalizes the interpretive ruling procedure which was in place when the original petition for the ZW&hyph;20 squash was submitted. To provide for a thorough review of comments and information submitted to APHIS on the ZW&hyph;20 squash, APHIS is convening a public meeting to provide a forum for an open discussion of the issues analyzed in the environmental assessment. Procedures for the Public Meeting Any interested person may appear and may be heard in person, by attorney, or by other representative. The meeting will be held in the Jefferson Auditorium, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, on June 21, 1994, from 9 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. and from 1:30 p.m. until 4 p.m., local time. However, the meeting may conclude earlier if all persons who have requested an opportunity to speak have been heard. Persons who wish to speak should register at the meeting location with the presiding officer before the meeting. Pre-meeting registration will begin at 8 a.m., local time, on the day of the meeting at the meeting site. Persons who have registered will be heard in the order of their registration. Attendees who do not register in advance will be allowed to speak after all scheduled speakers have been heard. We ask that anyone who reads a statement provide two copies to the presiding officer at the meeting. The presiding officer may limit the time for each presentation in order to allow everyone wishing to speak the opportunity to be heard.
