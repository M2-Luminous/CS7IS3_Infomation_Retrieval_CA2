FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Sidney C. Jackson, Acting Product Manager (PM) 21, Registration Division (7505C), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 227, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, (703) 305&hyph;6900. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA received from Gustafson, Inc., P.O. Box 660065, Dallas, Texas 75266&hyph;0065, pesticide petition (PP) 4F4284 on March 2, 1993, proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing a regulation pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, 21 U.S.C 346a and 371, to exempt from the requirement of a tolerance the residues of the biofungicide Bacillus subtilis MBI 600 in or on all raw agricultural commodities when applied as a seed treatment for growing agricultural crops in accordance with good agricultural practices. The notice of application to register Bacillus subtilis MBI 600 as a new active ingredient was published in the Federal Register (58 FR 67791) on December 22, 1993. No comments were received in response to the FR Notice. Strain MBI 600 of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis is a naturally occurring isolate of the spore-forming genus Bacillus which was first isolated from faba bean plants growing at Nottingham University School of Agriculture, Sutton Boningham, United Kingdom. Bacillus subtilis is a soil saprophyte found world-wide. Strains of this organism are not generally regarded as human or animal pathogens. The product is intended to be used as a seed treatment. When applied to seeds, the bacteria colonize the developing root system, competing with disease organisms which attack roots. The data submitted in the petition and all other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological data considered in support of the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance include an acute oral toxicity/pathogenicity study in the rat, an acute dermal toxicity study in the rabbit, an acute pulmonary toxicity/pathogenicity study in the rat, an acute intravenous toxicity/pathogenicity study in the rat, a primary eye irritation study in the rabbit, and a delayed contact hypersensitivity study in the guinea pig. These studies were performed on the active ingredient and the end-use product Gus 376 Concentrate Biological Fungicide. A review of these studies indicated that the biofungicide was not toxic to test animals when administered via the oral, dermal, intravenous or pulmonary routes. The active ingredient was not infective or pathogenic for test animals when administered via the oral, pulmonary or intravenous route. The end-use product produced slight ocular irritation which dissipated within 4 days of dosing. An overall moderate skin sensitization reaction was noted in the treated guinea pigs 24 to 72 hours following treatment. No reports of hypersensitivity have been recorded from personnel working with this organism. All of the toxicity studies submitted are considered acceptable. The toxicity data provided are sufficient to show that there are no foreseeable human or domestic health hazards likely to arise from the use of the product as a seed treatment. Acceptable daily intake (ADI) and maximum permissible intake (MPI) considerations are not relevant to this petition because the data submitted demonstrated that this biological control agent is not toxic to humans. No enforcement actions are expected. Therefore, the requirement for an analytical method for enforcement purposes is not applicable to this exemption request. This is the first exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for this biofungicide. Bacillus subtilis MBI 600 is considered useful for the purpose for which the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is sought. Based on the information considered, the Agency concludes that establishment of the exemption will protect the public health. Therefore, the regulation is proposed as set forth below. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed rule. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number [PP4F4284/R2051]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch at the Virginia address given above from 8 a.m to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 2 of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have an economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 Environmental Protection, Administrative practice and procedures, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: April 5, 1994. Stephen L. Johnson, Acting Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticides Programs. Therefore, 40 CFR part 180 is amended as follows: Part 180_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows: Authority : 21 U.S.C. 346a and 371. 2. By adding new 180.1128, to read as follows: 180.1128 Bacillus subtilis MBI 600; exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. The biofungicide Bacillus subtilis MBI 600 is exempted from the requirement of a tolerance in or on all raw agricultural commodities when applied as a seed treatment on seeds used for growing agricultural crops in accordance with good agricultural practices.
