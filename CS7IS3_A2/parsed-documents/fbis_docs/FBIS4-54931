Kolodko stressed that reforms in Poland are running on four tracks, but the main aim is the liberalization of the Polish economy supported by privatization. "We must bring the Polish economy from stabilization to economic growth. The hard work of society, the wise economic policy of the governing circles, and promotion of the habit of saving to increase the means for investment are necessary to achieve this aim. There cannot be a good market economy without a wise and stable economic policy, which the coalition government is set to develop and to build a good environment for doing business," Kolodko said.
