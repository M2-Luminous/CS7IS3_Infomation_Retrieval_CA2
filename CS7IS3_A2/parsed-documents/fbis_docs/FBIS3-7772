Such an accord would give the mainly Moslem Bosnian government "the chance to finally deal with only one enemy, the Serbs," Vice President Ejup Ganic told reporters. Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic was in Washington Sunday for the second day of talks with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic on the creation of a Moslem-Croat federation in Croatia's war-torn neighbor, Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage omitted] Ganic said Croatia, however, had yet to win the withdrawal of Serb troops from both Bosnia and Serbia, which have occupied a third of its country since the war there ended shortly before the Bosnian conflict began. Pushing the Bosnian Croats to reach an agreement with the Moslems would give Croatia "a chance to deal with the Krajina (Serb-occupied Croatia) without any distractions," Ganic said. [passage omitted] Ganic said: ``When the Croats and Moslems have a federal state with part occupied by the Serbs, then we can deal with that. But the federal state comes first. "Then as one country we will deal with the Serbs, one on one." He said that since there had been greater U.S. involvement in Bosnia on the Moslems side, the Serbs had turned to Moscow. The Serbs, Ganic said, "are reveling in everything Russian. They can have the Russians." [passage omitted]
