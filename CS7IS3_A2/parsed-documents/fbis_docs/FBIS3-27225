It has explored ways to build a new type of logistics support under the new setting of a socialist market economy, and, by relying on improved management and technical progress, brought about significant changes in the supply of basic necessities, including clothing, food, shelter, and transport. As of last year, 1.2 million officers and men had moved into new, modern barracks. The improvement in the appearance and bearing of the soldiers has further enhanced the image of our mighty force. On 1 May, all the rank-and-file and some officers were issued new camouflage [mi cai 6617 1752] training suits. Junior officers have been issued whipcord winter uniforms. Service-wide issuance of 87-style regular uniforms, training suits, and work clothes that started in 1988 has been completed; in torrid, chilly, and coastal defense regions, the officers and soldiers have also been issued specially-made vests, winter clothes, or water-proof gear to be worn on patrol missions. As restrictions on the market are being lifted, living standards in the barracks have remained, more or less, stable. Early last year, the Central Military Commission [CMC] spelled out clearly the principle that in military spending, it is necessary to guarantee the needs of the soldiers' daily lives. The standards for a soldier's allowance and board expenses have been raised. The military also had a good harvest of grain and nonstaple foodstuffs last year. During the year it produced 660 million kg of grain, 220 million kg of meat and eggs, and 610 million kg of vegetables. Wider use of greenhouses and large sheds to grow vegetables has enabled troops stationed in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hainan to have fresh vegetables in winter. New barracks have been built at the grassroots in the military. Last year, the military started, on a scale never seen in the history of PLA, renovations of barracks. Units in charge of barracks construction at all levels have sent engineers and close to 100 task forces to help the grassroots units draw up plans and designs for barracks construction. Many units also took it upon themselves to manufacture bricks and tiles and collect rocks in an effort to reduce production costs. It has been learned that after the renovation, the pass rate of the military's barracks is now 100 percent; and 50 percent of them are rated excellent. Logistics work has also benefited from the marked increase in the military's capacity for rapid shipment. Whenever there are major military operations, the army has been able to organize mechanical transport to quickly ship personnel and materials to where they are needed, thereby ensuring successful accomplishment of assignments such as military exercises, emergency action needed because of natural disasters, and relief operations. The various units, which are equipped with driving crews and other specialized personnel, are capable, by and large, of getting their truck convoys into action at any time. Army units and local departments in charge of transportation and war preparedness have worked together in renovating or building a number of new national defense and coastal defense highways. The units are also beginning to get cooking cars, bakery cars, and refrigerator cars used for logistics support in field operations.
