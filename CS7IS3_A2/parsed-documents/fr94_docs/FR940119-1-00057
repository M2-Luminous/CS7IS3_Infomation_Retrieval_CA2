FR940119-1-00057 FR940119-1-00014 Questions have been raised regarding the effectiveness of the primary PSC mortality limit to reduce halibut bycatch rates for two reasons. First, the minor difference between the primary and secondary limits constrains NMFS' ability to implement fishery closures under the primary limit before the secondary limit is reached. Second, observer data on halibut bycatch rates do not indicate that closure of Bycatch Limitation Zones 1 and 2H under the primary limit necessarily reduces halibut bycatch rates to allow more groundfish to be harvested before the secondary limit is reached. To the contrary, closure of Zones 1 and 2H often increases bycatch rates by forcing fisheries to move to areas with lower groundfish catch per unit of effort and higher halibut bycatch rates. Once the secondary limit is reached, the entire BSAI is closed to directed fishing for specified groundfish species by vessels using non-pelagic trawl gear (50 CFR 675.21(c)(1)(iv)). To respond to these concerns, NMFS prepared a draft analysis for a proposed FMP amendment to eliminate the primary halibut PSC limit. The draft analysis was reviewed by the Council and its Advisory Panel (AP) and Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) during the Council's September 1992 meeting and adopted for public review. At its December 1992 meeting, the Council considered the testimony and recommendations of the AP, SSC, fishing industry representatives, and the general public on the proposed action to eliminate the primary halibut PSC mortality limit. The Council adopted the proposed action under Amendment 25 to the FMP and requested NMFS to prepare a proposed rule to implement the action. The action would not affect the secondary halibut bycatch mortality limit established for the BSAI trawl fisheries (3,775 mt). Mandatory Retention of Salmon Until Counted by a NMFS-certified Observer At its September 1993 meeting, the Council requested that NMFS prepare a proposed rule for review and approval that would prohibit the discard of salmon taken in the BSAI groundfish trawl fisheries until a NMFS-certified observer has counted each fish and collected any scientific data or biological samples that the observer had been requested by NMFS to obtain. Regulations to prohibit the discard of all salmon taken in groundfish trawl operations until an observer has counted each salmon would provide the opportunity to collect better data on salmon bycatch. These data could be used to assess the quality of bycatch rate estimates derived from existing observer sampling procedures and provide additional information with which to assess the magnitude of salmon bycatch in the Alaska trawl fisheries. Additional data collected on salmon taken as bycatch in the BSAI trawl fisheries also could be used to assess long-term management measures that may be developed to address the salmon bycatch problem. Mandatory retention of salmon until counted by an observer also would support independent industry initiatives to explore factors that may be correlated with salmon bycatch and identify changes in fishing operations that could reduce salmon bycatch rates. NMFS concurs that additional information on salmon bycatch would be desirable and is necessary to develop management actions to address the salmon bycatch problem in the Alaska groundfish trawl fisheries. Regulations implementing the Council's request would require operators of vessels carrying observers whose fishing operation allows for sorting of groundfish catch to sort all salmon from the groundfish catch and store the salmon in a separate bin or other location on the vessel that allows the observer free and unobstructed physical access to each salmon for observation and collection of scientific data or biological samples. Operators of vessels not carrying observers onboard or whose fishing operation does not allow for sorting of groundfish catch for salmon must ice, freeze, or store in a refrigerated saltwater tank all salmon taken as bycatch in trawl operations for delivery to the processor receiving the vessel's groundfish catch. Processors receiving groundfish from trawl vessels participating in a directed fishery for BSAI groundfish would be required to retain all salmon delivered by each vessel during a weekly reporting period in separate bins marked with the vessel's name and Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) fish ticket number(s) until a NMFS-certified observer has counted each salmon and collected any scientific data or biological samples that are requested by the NMFS Observer Program. Processors without observer coverage immediately available would be required to store all salmon until a NMFS-certified observer is available to count each fish. Salmon must be stored at a location that allows an observer free and unobstructed access to each salmon. NMFS proposes to require vessel operators and managers of shoreside processing operations to designate a crew person or employee who would be responsible for proper sorting, retention, and storage of salmon until a NMFS-certified observer has notified the vessel operator or manager of the shoreside operation that the number of salmon and any biological samples have been obtained. Upon the request of the observer, the designated crew person or employee also would be responsible to help count salmon and take biological samples from retained salmon under the direction of the observer. The intent of this proposed requirement is to support industry initiatives to obtain better data on salmon bycatch and to facilitate the collection of these data in a manner that does not jeopardize the collection of other scientific or catch data that NMFS-certified observers currently are required to obtain. Processors without observer coverage would be required to freeze salmon until such time as an observer is available to count retained fish. Some processors are never required to obtain an observer because their groundfish processing operation never exceeds 500 metric tons (mt) during a single month. Mandatory retention would require these processing operations to freeze salmon carcasses for an unknown period of time until an observer is obtained to count the fish. Although not quantified, the associated costs to unobserved processing operations resulting from long-term storage of salmon likely are unreasonable relative to the amounts of groundfish processed and corresponding salmon bycatch that could be expected from the small amounts of groundfish delivered to these processing operations. Therefore, NMFS proposes to exempt processors from mandatory retention of salmon during those months that the processor is exempt from obtaining observer coverage under regulations implementing the Observer Program (50 CFR 672.27 and 675.25). Currently, this exemption applies to mothership processors and shoreside processing facilities that receive less than 500 mt of groundfish during a month.
