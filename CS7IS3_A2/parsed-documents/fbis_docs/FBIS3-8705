In his one-hour introductory statement, Nicolae Vacaroiu discusses the government's activity over the past year and five months and the "difficult period Romania experienced in 1993," which, he says, "will continue in 1994." He says that the government carried out his activity on the "basis of the government program and strategy" aimed at "implementing the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] policy, that of the ruling party." Vacaroiu says that 1993 was "the first year in which we succeeded in stopping the decline of production." He stresses that "Romania's foreign debts did not increase in 1993" and that "priority was given to agriculture, which is the branch that has to ensure the consumption base for the population." After pointing out the potential that exists in this area, he stresses that "the association and privatization process has to be intensified" and "agricultural machinery and equipment have to be ensured." Vacaroiu points out that "although we have recorded an increase of 12 percent in agriculture on the whole, we are still faced by particularly difficult problems," especially in the "animal-breeding sector." After emphasizing that the transition process is much more complex than expected and that one of the "essential problems is changing the mentality of people, and their adjustment to a market economy," Vacaroiu says that a "radical change" is needed and trade companies have to adjust "while we move on." Discussing 1994, he predicts a "slight economic increase." He continues to say that the "GNP is estimated to grow by 1.5 percent in 1994, industrial output by 2 percent, and exports by 7 percent, while imports are expected to decrease by 2 percent." He assesses that the unemployment rate will be 12 percent and consumer costs will increase 15 percent. After stressing that the price increase was 295.5 percent in 1993, while that of net incomes was only 210.6 percent, thus causing a decline in the standard of living, Vacaroiu says that at the end of 1993 the average pay was 54 percent compared with that in 1990. Discussing priority goals for 1994, Vacaroiu says that the "main goal in 1994 is to relaunch and stabilize the economy," increase "the coherence of the economic and social reform process," with "emphasis, of course, on the restructuring, privatization process, and on social protection." He assesses that the standard of living "will not deteriorate in the first half of 1994," but that it will even "increase 10 percent" in the second half of the year. After stressing the need to "invigorate Romanian industry along with the restructuring and privatization process," Vacaroiu mentions the "measures included in the memorandum with the IMF." Discussing industrial production in January, he says that it "increased 1.8 percent compared with last December and 5.5 percent compared with the previous January," while "productivity increased 1.6 percent compared with December and 10.1 percent compared with January last year." The prime minister warns, however, that this does not mean that "things are back to normal," but that Romania is still experiencing a "particularly drastic economic crisis" that may still have "harsh negative effects on the economy and life in general." After discussing the "January surplus trade balance," Vacaroiu stresses that the foreign currency policy is of great importance, since it is the one to "contribute to macroeconomic stability." He continues to discuss other banking and state budget issues. Regarding the restructuring program and the privatization process, Vacaroiu discusses procedural matters and the important role to be played by the stock exchange. At 1047 GMT Prime Minister Vacaroiu begins discussing the recent government reshuffle, explaining the reasons behind the replacement of the four ministers of defense, interior, justice, and transportation. He admits that "we are still facing great problems in the area of corruption, violations, and tax evasion." In connection with the replacement of the minister of defense, Vacaroiu says that "Romania's Army has to represent a symbol of the country, it has to guarantee stability, credibility, and must by no means be involved in various disputes -- political or of any other nature." After presenting the merits of each newly appointed minister, Vacaroiu speaks about the problem of financial blockage and the need to eliminate it. Discussing agricultural issues, Vacaroiu points out actions that have been taken to support this sector "with certain sums of money from the budget," through the "sale of agricultural machinery and equipment on credit," and through "priority actions in the area of privatization." Vacaroiu concludes his introductory statement by emphasizing that "a number of actions have been taken" to "give an impetus to small-and medium-sized private entrepreneurs" in order "to guarantee their financial sources."
