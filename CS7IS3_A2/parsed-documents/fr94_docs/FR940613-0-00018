FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William G. Rosoff, Office of Regulations and Rulings, (202&hyph;482&hyph;7040). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 8, 1993, the President signed into law Public Law 103&hyph;182, the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (107 Stat. 2057). Title VI of this Act, popularly known as the Customs Modernization Act (the Act) amended certain Customs laws. Section 651 of the Act amended section 321, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1321). Before its amendment by the Act, section 321 authorized administrative exemptions from duty and taxes on articles such as gifts and personal and household goods, and in certain other situations. Specifically, section 321 authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in order to avoid expense and inconvenience to the Government disproportionate to the amount of revenue that would otherwise be collected, to disregard a difference of less than $10 between the duty actually due on an entry and the estimated duties deposited. On the same basis, section 321 authorized the Secretary to admit free of duty and tax any article the value of which was less than $50 in the case of bona fide gifts ($100 if the gift was from certain island possessions) sent from persons in foreign countries to persons in the United States. Section 321 authorized the Secretary to admit free of duty and tax any article the value of which was less than $25 in the case of personal or household articles accompanying the traveler. In all other cases ( i.e., if not a bona fide gift sent from a person in a foreign country to a person in the United States or a personal or household article accompanying a traveler), the Secretary was authorized to admit free of duty and tax any article the value of which was less than $5. In the last three cases ( i.e., bona fide gifts, personal or household articles, and all other cases), the exemptions were subject to the condition that the aggregate fair retail value in the country of shipment of articles imported by one person on one day could not exceed the authorized amount. Also, the exemptions in these cases were not to be granted in any case in which merchandise covered by a single order or contract was forwarded in separate lots to secure the benefit of the provision. The Secretary was authorized to prescribe regulations to implement these provisions. Section 321 specifically authorized the Secretary to diminish any of the dollar amounts referred to above. Section 651 of the Act increased the dollar amounts described and, instead of setting maximum dollar amounts below which the Secretary was authorized to make the exemptions applicable, authorized the Secretary to make the exemptions applicable to an amount to be specified in regulations, but not less than a stated amount. That is, the amended section 321 now provides minimum dollar amounts for the exemptions. In the case of the difference between duty actually due on an entry and the estimated duties deposited, the dollar amount was increased to a minimum of $20. Also, this provision was changed to authorize Customs to apply the exemption to the total of duties, fees, and taxes, instead of only duties and taxes, as had been the case. In the case of bona fide gifts, personal or household articles, and all other cases, the dollar amounts were respectively increased to $100 ($200, if the gift is from one of the named island possessions), $200, and $200, respectively. Section 651 removed from §321 the specific authorization to, by regulation, diminish any of the dollar amounts specified in the provision. Section 651 retained the specific authorization in section 321 for regulations to prescribe exceptions to any exemption whenever the Secretary finds such action is consistent with the purpose of the provisions or is necessary to protect the revenue or to prevent unlawful importations. The provision in the Customs Regulations containing the authorization to disregard a difference of less than $10 between the duty actually due on an entry and the estimated duties deposited is found in 19 CFR 159.6. The provisions in the Customs Regulations pertaining to the administrative exemption for bona fide gifts are found in 19 CFR 10.152 and 145.32 and the provision for personal or household articles is found in 19 CFR 148.51 (see also §§148.12, 148.64). The provisions in the Customs Regulations pertaining to the $5 administrative exemption for all other articles are found in 19 CFR 10.151 and 145.31. Conditions for the exemptions provided for in 19 CFR 10.151 and 10.152 are currently found in 19 CFR 10.153. Provisions pertaining to the administrative exemptions under section 321 are also found in part 128 of the Customs Regulations, which relates to express consignments. Section 128.24(d) of that part refers to low value shipments ( i.e., shipments valued at $5 or less) and provides that such shipments must be segregated from shipments valued at more than $5 when the special informal entry procedures provided for in part 128 are used. This provision was intended to cover articles which could be administratively exempted from duties and taxes under section 321(a)(2)(C) (see T.D. 89&hyph;53, published in the Federal Register on May 8, 1989 (54 FR 19561)).
