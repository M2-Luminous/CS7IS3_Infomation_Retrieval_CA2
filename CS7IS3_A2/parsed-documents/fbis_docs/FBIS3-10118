We know of the government's intentions to arm paramilitary groups to hinder the movement, but we will remain alert, Lara added. Lara was interviewed while heading a protest march. He also said the National Assembly of Health Employees will conduct an analytical and scientific study to determine the causes of the death of patient Miriam Catalina Rodriguez de Alvizurez outside the emergency ward of Roosevelt Hospital. Lara said he agrees with other union leaders who have said the president of the Republic and the Army commanding general are directly responsible for the patient's death.
