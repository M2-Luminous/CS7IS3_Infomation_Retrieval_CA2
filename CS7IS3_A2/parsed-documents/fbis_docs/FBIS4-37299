FBIS4-37299 "drnes118_l_94013" FBIS-NES-94-118 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Malaysian Sultan's `Secret' Visit Reported Malaysian Sultan's `Secret' Visit Reported TA1706190994 Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew 1700 GMT 17 Jun 94 TA1706190994 Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew 1700 GMT 17 Jun 94 Hebrew BFN [Report by political correspondent Gadi Sukenik] [Text] Only a handful of top political officials in Israel were party to the secret, but even they were surprised when (Tengku Abdullah), also known as Sultan Abdullah, landed in Israel on 12 June. Abdullah is the brother of the Malaysian king. He is a member of parliament and is very close to Prime Minister Mahathir. This was quite a surprise, considering that with the exception of Iran, Malaysia is -- or at least was -- one of the toughest nuts for Israel to crack. Malaysia is a Muslim country with a population of approximately 20 million. There is no Jewish community. The capital is Kuala Lumpur. The supreme ruler is King Muhibbuddin. Longstanding Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed, who is second in command, is the country's real strongman. The Israeli Foreign Ministry's semiofficial representative was expelled from Malaysia back in 1966. Since then, there has been no contact whatsoever between the two countries, and Malaysia's leadership has adopted a vehemently hostile anti-Israeli and overtly anti-Semitic line. Malaysia's rulers recognized the State of Palestine back in the 1980's and established close relations with Iran. They declared that Malaysia would never make peace with Israel, even if the Arabs did. When former President Herzog visited neighboring Singapore, Malaysia recalled its ambassador from that country and almost severed diplomatic relations with it. Even the movie Schindler's List, which is about the Holocaust, was banned as Jewish propaganda. The brother of the Malaysian ruler arrived in Israel accompanied by a Jewish businessman, who served as a mediator. There is no doubt that Sultan Abdullah's visit was undertaken with the knowledge and approval of the Malaysian leadership. On Sunday, the Malaysian official met with the foreign minister before Mr. Peres flew abroad. On 14 June, the Malaysian official met with Prime Minister Rabin. He left Israel yesterday after touring the country between meetings. Despite the veil of total secrecy surrounding the matter, we have learned that Malaysia is already expressing readiness in principle to establish business and economic ties with Israel. Once sufficient progress is made in the peace process, diplomatic ties will follow. This is one of the most succulent pieces of fruit Israel has reaped from the agreement with the Palestinians so far, along with the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Vatican. There is significant economic potential here, which goes far beyond the breaching of yet another fanatical Muslim wall of hostility. Although Malaysia has sacrificed democracy and civil rights in exchange for political stability, it has achieved an incredible level of economic prosperity. Its economy is growing at a tremendous rate with no unemployment, and its natural resources guarantee a rosy future. It goes without saying that when asked, all the Israeli officials who played a role in this affair refused to make any comment.
