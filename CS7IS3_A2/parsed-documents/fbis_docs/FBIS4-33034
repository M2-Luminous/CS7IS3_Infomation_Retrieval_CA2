The Army called the operation a success despite accusations of having indiscriminately bombed civilians. The military operation called Aries was aimed against the Shining Path [SL] members who operated in the area with two battalions known as Red Sea and Local Force which, according to military officers, were reduced by 40 percent in Huanuco. The National Human Rights Coordinating Board claimed in April that during the military offensive civilians had been bombed and innocent people murdered, and that in one area about 50 people had been killed as a consequence of the excesses committed by the military. Committees from several humanitarian organizations, and even from Congress, visited the Leoncio Prado region to verify the accusations, after which they said they had not found proof of bombings or massacres, although they did obtain some reports of human rights violations committed by the military. The military chief of the zone, General Alfredo Rodriguez, reported at the end of the operation that the two terrorist battalions had been disbanded, and that the SL columns still remaining in the jungle zone north of Lima are out of contact, without provisions, and partially disarmed. The general added that the Red Sea battalion was reduced to 40 men, and that the Local Force members were disbanded. He added that Red Sea chief Jose Picon, aka Manco, and another 20 SL members abandoned his group and hid in the Monzon area. Rodriguez said that the SL groups are trying to replenish their ranks with young men they kidnap from jungle towns and whom they force to join the SL ranks under threat of death. The military chief considered the Aries operation to be successful, as "it has left the subversives with few weapons" and "a great deal of ammunition" was confiscated. According to the military officer the terrorists are trying to reorganize themselves, for which reason the Peruvian military forces cordoned off the area to prevent them from doing so. Gen. Rodriguez nonetheless pointed out that the ending of the Aries operation does not mean that the military have stopped exerting pressure in the area, because they must prevent the SL bases from reorganizing. On 25 May the military high command presented to journalists at the Tingo Maria military base in Leoncio Prado Province 23 SL members captured during the operation, during which a total of 30 men were arrested. The military also displayed weapons, explosives, medicines, communications equipment, documents, and propaganda material confiscated from the terrorists. Gen. Rodriguez showed a copy book in which an SL member known as Comrade Angel had written an order to his comrades to "facilitate the access of the Red Cross to all the combat areas." Gen. Rodriguez said he suspected that members of the Red Cross were informing the SL of Army movements, something which has not been proven.
