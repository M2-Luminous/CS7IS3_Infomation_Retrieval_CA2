FR940114-1-00054 FR940114-1-00009 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Federal Highway Administration 23 CFR Part 1205 [NHTSA Docket No. 93&hyph;20; Notice 1] RIN 2127&hyph;AE89 Highway Safety Programs; Determination of Effectiveness AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) was signed into law December 18, 1991. Section 2002(a) of ISTEA, Highway Safety Programs, requires that the Secretary of Transportation either designate six key areas as priority highway safety programs or submit a report to congress describing the reasons for not prioritizing these programs. The six program areas involve: Speed control, Use of occupant protection devices, Driving while impaired, Motorcycle safety, School Bus Safety, and Police Traffic Services. The existing National Priority Program Areas address four of the six areas identified by the Act, but do not include Speed Control or School Bus Safety. The agencies have reviewed existing data and statistics regarding deaths and injuries attributable to these two areas and have considered the availability of existing countermeasures related to speed control and school bus safety, and tentatively propose to include Speed Control as a Priority Program Area, but have tentatively concluded that School Bus Safety does not warrant being included as a Priority Program. Interested persons are invited to submit comments on this proposal. DATES: Comments on this document must be received no later than February 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Commenters should reference the docket and notice numbers of this document and be submitted (preferably in ten copies) to: Docket Section, room 5109, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 7th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Docket hours are from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: In NHTSA: Ms. Marlene Markison, Office of Regional Operations, NRO&hyph;01, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 7th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590, telephone: (202) 366&hyph;0166; or Ms. Kathy DeMeter, Office of Chief Counsel, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, telephone: (202) 366&hyph;1834.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The State and Community Highway Safety Grant Program (the 402 program) was established under the Highway Safety Act of 1966, 23 U.S.C. 402. The Act required the establishment of Uniform Standards for State Highway Safety Programs to assist the States and local communities in organizing their highway safety programs. Eighteen such standards were established and have been administered at the Federal level by FHWA and NHTSA. NHTSA is responsible for developing and implementing highway safety programs relating to the vehicle and driver, while FHWA has similar responsibilities in program areas involving the roadway. Until 1976, the 402 program was principally directed towards achieving State and local compliance with the 18 Highway Safety Program Standards, which were considered mandatory requirements with financial sanctions for noncompliance. Under the Highway Safety Act of 1976, Congress provided for a more flexible implementation of the program so that the Secretary would not have to require State compliance with every uniform standard or with each element of every uniform standard. As a result, the standards became more like guidelines for use by the States. Management of the program then shifted from enforcing standards to one of problem identification, and countermeasure development and evaluation, using the standards as a framework for the State programs. In 1981, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Public Law 97&hyph;35, revising the section 402 program. The Act directed the agencies to conduct rulemaking to determine those State and local highway safety programs most effective in reducing accidents, injuries, and fatalities. On April 1, 1982, NHTSA and FHWA issued a joint final rule (47 FR 15116) identifying six National Priority Program Areas which the agencies then considered to be the most effective highway safety programs. The six program areas included one FHWA program area, Safety Construction and Operational Improvements, and the following NHTSA Program Areas: Occupant Protection, Alcohol Countermeasures, Police Traffic Services, Emergency Medical Services, and Traffic Records. The April 1982 final rule provided that these National Priority Program Areas would be eligible for Federal funding under an expedited procedure under the 402 program (23 CFR 1205.4.). It also established a mechanism by which other, non-priority programs identified by a State may be eligible for Federal funding. (23 CFR 1205.5 (a) and (b).) Periodic Review and Determination of Priority Programs On April 2, 1987, the enactment of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;17) revised 23 U.S.C. 402. The changes provided for a periodic review of the effectiveness of the various programs eligible for funding under section 402 in reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities. The periodic review procedure was believed to be the best method of ensuring the continued relevance of the section 402 program to changing circumstances and traffic safety needs, and for ensuring that Federal funds continue to be used for the most effective programs. The legislation also provided that the terms ``standard'' and ``standards'' within 23 CFR Part 1204 be replaced with the words ``guideline'' and ``guidelines.'' The purpose of this amendment was to conform the language of section 402 to the current implementation of the programs. Pursuant to these amendments, NHTSA and FHWA conducted a rulemaking action to review those programs most effective in reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities. In a final rule issued on April 6, 1988, (53 FR 1255) the agencies determined that the National Priority Program Areas should continue to include the one FHWA program area, Roadway Safety (formerly, Safety Construction and Operational Improvements), and the five NHTSA program areas that had been identified in 1982. In addition, the agencies determined that a sixth NHTSA area, Motorcycle Safety, should also be included. On May 3, 1991, NHTSA/FHWA published a joint NPRM (56 FR 20387) proposing to add Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety as one of the National Priority program areas. The public comments supported that proposal and resulted in the addition of that area as one of the National Priority Program Areas eligible for the expedited funding process.
