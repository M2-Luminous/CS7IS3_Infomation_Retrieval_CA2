The hullabaloo around the Russian ``top secret weapon,'' the general believes, was raised by those who disapprove of the partnership relations that are now being established between Russia and the West. We have seen more than once in the past that whenever some military-industrial complex needed new funds, reports immediately began to appear, claiming that this or that country ``is lagging behind the Russians,'' he recalled.
