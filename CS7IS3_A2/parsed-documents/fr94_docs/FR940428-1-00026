FR940428-1-00026 FR940428-1-00008 Paragraphs (a)(1)&hyph;(4) of §222.6 of the proposed rule provide the same requirements as found in the current rule at §222.3(c)(2)(i)(A)&hyph;(D) for the issuance of temporary permits for a variety of purposes. The proposed rule makes not substantive change from the current rule; however, the text of these paragraphs is revised and reduced for clarification. The current rule specifies that temporary permits may be issued in times of national or regional drought or emergency where such use would not result in permanent resource damage. This provision is retained in this proposed rule at §222.6(a)(5), but is revised. Limiting this provision to drought or emergency that is ``national or regional scope'' is excessive to the qualifications established for temporary grazing use of other lands by permitted livestock from an affected allotment. Additionally, the qualifying phrase ``*␣*␣* where such use would not result in permanent resource damage,'' would be removed since this qualification is unnecessary. Part of a determination that the capacity exists to graze animals is that any such grazing use permitted will be done in accordance with appropriate standards and guidelines in a forest plan or rangeland project decision to prevent resource damage. Paragraphs (a)(6) and (a)(7) of §222.6 of the proposed rule provide the same requirements as found in the current rule at §222.3(c)(2)(ii) (A) and (H), concerning temporary permits for transportation livestock an animals used for breeding purposes. The proposed rule makes no substantive changes from the current rule; however, the text of these paragraphs is revised and reduced for clarification. The current rule at §222.3(c)(2)(ii)(C) allows free or paid permits for trailing livestock that graze along the way as they cross National Forest System lands. Issuing free permits for such use is not in the public interest and must be closely administered to prevent excessive use and potential resource damage. As a result, the proposed rule at §222.6(a)(8) would allow authorized officers to issue only paid temporary permits for trailing livestock across National Forest System lands and other lands under Forest Service control. This should not result in a substantial increase in the cost of business since, in many instances, there may be alternatives to trailing that do not require the payment of a grazing fee. Paragraph (b) of this proposed section would allow an authorized officer the discretion to issue free or paid temporary permits where the primary documented objective is managing vegetation to meet a resource objective other than livestock forage utilization. Where the primary land management objective is to ``manipulate vegetation'' (as opposed to livestock production), the current regulations at §222.3(c)(2)(ii)(I) require that a fee be charged for this use. The agency believes this fee requirement is an impediment to effective vegetative management. In some areas, vegetation, such as chaparral, is best managed by grazing livestock. Permitting free use could be a cost-effective way to manage fuelbreaks, tree plantations, or other areas where it is desirable to remove vegetation periodically. In these situations, grazing can be used instead of more costly methods involving herbicides, fire, or mowing. The temporary permits for vegetation management issued under this authority would not replace existing grazing permits where the primary purpose if livestock production and the permittee pays a fee. The current rule at §222.3(c)(2)(ii)(E) provides for free permits to campers and travelers for the livestock used during the period of occupancy. This same provision is carried forth into the proposed rule at paragraph (c)(1) of proposed §222.6. Livestock use under this provision does not included livestock being used by campers and travelers permitted under the provisions of paragraph (a)(6) of this section which covers use by transportation livestock for commercial purposes. The current rule at §222.3(c)(2)(ii)(B) allows for free or paid grazing for research purposes and administrative studies but requires the issuance of a permit. Under the proposed rule at §222.6(c)(2), authorized offices may provide for this type of grazing use free of charge without a written permit. Experience shows that the amount of grazing permitted under this authority is insignificant. Most of the livestock involved in such studies are owned by permitted and are authorized and paid for under a term grazing permit. Where a university or other research entity owns or borrows the livestock used in a study, it is in the interest of the United States to allow such use free of charge and without a written permit, since the public will benefit from the information gained from the research. Paragraph (c)(3) of proposed §222.6 would allow authorized officers to grant free grazing with no permit to permittees for horses, mules, or burros that are used to support the management of permitted livestock. This type of free grazing use is appropriate when the animal is not grazed full time on the allotment but is used occasionally as a work animal during the grazing season. This is a revision of the provision of the current rule at §222.3(c)(2)(ii)(F), which allows for this type of permitted use on either a free or paid basis. Proposed Section 222.7_Requirements Applicable to Grazing Permits This section of the proposed rule contains the requirements which must be met in order to hold a term or temporary grazing permit. Proposed paragraph (a) lists the requirements for term and temporary grazing permits while paragraph (b) covers all additional requirements applicable specifically to term permits. The proposed rule is similar in content to the current rule at §222.3(c)(1) and existing agency direction with two primary differences. First, the proposed requirements would enable foreign corporations to hold grazing permits, and second, this proposed rule would establish a satisfactory record of performance under previous or currently held federal grazing permits as a requirement for the issuance or renewal of a grazing permit. Proposed §222.7(a)(1) would limit issuing term and temporary grazing permits to private individuals, grazing associations and districts, business concerns, or tribal governments, making it clear that government agencies are not eligible to receive term or temporary grazing permits. This is consistent with §222.3(c)(1) of the current rule.
