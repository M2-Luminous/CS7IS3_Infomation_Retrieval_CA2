FR941216-2-00142 FR941216-2-00085 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;213, 50&hyph;245, 50&hyph;336, 50&hyph;423] In the Matter of Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Co. and Northeast Nuclear Energy Co. (Haddam Neck Plant and Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2 and 3); Exemption I The Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPCO or the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;61 which authorizes operation of the Haddam Neck Plant, and Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO or the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;21, DPR&hyph;65 and NPF&hyph;49 which authorize operation of the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, and 3 (Millstone) respectively. The licenses provide, among other things, that the Haddam Neck Plant and the Millstone plants are subject to all rules, regulations and Orders of the Commission now or hereafter in effect. The Haddam Neck Plant is a single-unit pressurized water reactor located at the licensee's site located in Middlesex County, Connecticut. The Millstone plants consist of a boiling water reactor and two pressurized water reactors located at the licensee's site in New London County, Connecticut. II The Code of Federal of Regulations at 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against radiological sabotage,'' paragraph (a), in part, states that ``the licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system and security organization which will have as its objective to provide high assurance that activities involving special nuclear material are not inimical to the common defense and security and do not constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety.'' The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' paragraph (1), specifies that, ``the licensee shall control all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) also requires that, ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.'' It further states that individuals not employed by the licensee (e.g., contractors) may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided that the individual, ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into a protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected area.␣*␣*␣*'' The licensee proposes to implement an alternative unescorted access system which would eliminate the need to issue and retrieve picture badges at the entrance/exit location to the protected area and would allow all individuals, including contractors, to keep their picture badges in their possession when departing the Haddam Neck Plant and the Millstone plants. By letter dated September 28, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5). Specifically, the requested exemption would allow individual, including contractors, who have unescorted access to retain possession of their picture badges instead of returning them as they exit the protected area.
