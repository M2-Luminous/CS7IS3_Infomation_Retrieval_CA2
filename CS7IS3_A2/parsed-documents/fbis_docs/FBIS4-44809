FBIS4-44809 "jpest013__l94028" JPRS-EST-94-013-L JPRS Science & Technology Europe/International Economic Competitiveness 8 April 1994 WEST EUROPE CORPORATE STRATEGIES Bull, Ilog Cooperation in Artificial Intelligence Reported Bull, Ilog Cooperation in Artificial Intelligence Reported 94WS0302B Paris LE MONDE INFORMATIQUE in French 8 Apr 94 p 6--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94WS0302B Paris LE MONDE INFORMATIQUE French CSO [Article entitled: "Bull and Ilog Team Up"] [Text] When Herve Yahi announced the "merging" of Bull-Cediag's and Ilog's constraint programming activities last week in Paris, the director of Bull BPA (Business Process Automation) probably sounded the death knell of the French manufacturer's artificial intelligence products business. Indeed, the software program Charme--a product of research Bull conducted in the late 90s [sic] in the Munich ECRC with Siemens and ICL--was one of the last pride and joys of the Cediag product catalog, which also features the Kool expert system generator. According to Herve Hayi, Charme racked up sales of Fr7 to 8 million a year in 1992 and 1993, out of the tiny Fr60 million generated by all artificial intelligence business. The deal is a lucrative one for Ilog. The "merger" product Ilog Solver (which Bull sold under the name Bull Solver) will benefit from the constraints expertise of Bull teams. Moreover, it will be virtually the only program of its kind in a promising market, especially internationally. The only solid competitor today remains Cositech, whose boss Mehmet Dincbas and product Chip also came out of the ECRC. Finally, according to Ilog CEO Pierre Haren, the "merger" of Ilog's and Bull's two product lines is taking place without money changing hands. In other words, his company is picking up several years of investment by the French computer manufacturer at little cost.
