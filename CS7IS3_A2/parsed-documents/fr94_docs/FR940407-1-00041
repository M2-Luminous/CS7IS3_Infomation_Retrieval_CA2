FR940407-1-00041 FR940407-1-00012 B. Practical Issues The WACC approach also presents some important technical advantages. First, the WACC uses the actual long-term interest expense currently provided by a regulated carrier to compute the company's cost of long-term debt capital, while the Commission's CET uses an estimate of a carrier's long-term interest expense based on moving averages of Baa-rated corporate bond yields in computing an allowable rate of return on rate base. By definition, a firm's actual long-term interest expense is more accurate than an estimate of that expense. In its comments in Docket No. 91&hyph;51, the State of Hawaii stated that the Commission's CET introduces imprecision into the calculation by requiring that parties substitute a proxy for carrier interest expense as a component of the carrier's rate of return, although this component is known and subject to verification. Second, the WACC, when implemented properly, ensures that the regulated carrier will be allowed a return on rate base that is large enough to ensure that the carrier will have the opportunity to earn, at a minimum, revenues that are sufficient to cover its embedded (actual historical) cost of debt. Assuming that debt capital financing is less expensive than preferred stock and common-stock equity capital financing, when the known cost of long-term debt is weighted by the regulated company's proportion of long-term debt capital outstanding, and then added to the firm's cost of preferred stock weighted by the firm's proportion of preferred stock capital outstanding and the firm's cost of common-stock equity capital weighted by the firm's proportion of common-stock equity capital outstanding, the resulting sum ( i.e. , the WACC) can be no less than the cost of the firm's embedded cost of debt. Such a guarantee is not available under the Commission's CET, as Matson Navigation Company, Inc. (``Matson''), has pointed out. For example, if the long-term interest expense estimate, derived on the basis of a moving average of historical Baa corporate bond yields, is not representative of the actual long-term interest expense of the regulated carrier, or if the historical financial data reflecting the financial picture of the benchmark group of firms are not representative of the regulated carrier's financial position, then the regulated carrier's calculated allowable rate of return on rate base could fall short of its embedded cost of debt. Third, the Commission's CET has proved difficult to apply in the case of the Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Authority (``PRMSA''), which has a capital structure composed entirely of long-term debt and by law is not required to pay taxes. On the other hand, the WACC can be used effectively to establish an appropriate allowable rate of return for such a carrier. The WACC is computed for such a carrier by weighting the cost of long-term debt near or equal to one, the cost of preferred stock near or equal to zero, and the cost of common-stock equity near or equal to zero, and setting the corporate tax rate equal to zero. The WACC can be used effectively to compute an accurate estimate of the overall cost of capital and, in turn, to establish an appropriate allowable rate of return for a regulated carrier that is financed exclusively or almost completely by long-term debt 15 and is tax-exempt, because it distinguishes between such a carrier and one that is financed with substantial amounts of common-stock equity and is not tax-exempt. In its comments in Docket No. 91&hyph;51, PRMSA observed that the Commission's CET makes no such distinction because it uses as a benchmark for every regulated carrier, regardless of actual capital structure or tax status, a typical firm financed with a relatively balanced mixture of long-term debt and common-stock equity capital, and is not tax-exempt. 15 A profitable firm will generally have at least some amount of common-stock equity capital in its capital structure because such a firm will usually have an internal source of such capital in the form of retained earnings. Lastly, the WACC method typically uses a number of different methods to calculate the regulated firm's cost of common-stock equity capital. This yields several different estimates of the firm's WACC providing a regulatory commission with a range of numbers from which a single number representing an allowable rate of return on rate base can be chosen. This minimizes the possibility that the allowable rate of return will be distorted by inappropriate subjective judgements or by extraordinary economic conditions existing during the time period used to measure that return. By comparison, the Commission's CET produces a single measure of an allowable rate of return. On the basis of its review, the Commission has determined to propose the use of the WACC methodology to evaluate the reasonableness of a carrier's rates in the domestic offshore trades. The Commission believes that the WACC approach set forth in the proposed rule represents a substantial improvement over the existing methodology and addresses the criticisms voiced in comments in Docket No. 91&hyph;51. We now turn to the proposed rule. III. Estimating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital A. Capital Structure The first step in calculating the WACC is to determine an appropriate capital structure ( i.e. , the proportions of long-term debt, preferred stock, and common-stock equity capital issued by a firm to finance its operations) for the regulated firm. There are two important issues that may have to be resolved. The first is whether to calculate the WACC using a ``typical'' or ``ideal'' capital structure as some regulatory commissions do, or the actual capital structure or that expected in the near future, as others do. The second issue concerns the situation where the regulated company is a subsidiary of a parent company. The issue is whether to use the capital structure of the subsidiary or that of the consolidated system ( i.e. , the parent company and all of its subsidiaries) in computing the WACC.
