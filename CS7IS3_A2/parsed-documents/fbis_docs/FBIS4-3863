"We urge the developed countries to take concrete actions to meet the target of 0.7 percent of gross domestic product set by the U.N." and use the fund to help the developing world, said Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China. In this aspect, Chen said at the 50th meeting of the Group of 24 Ministers, the developed countries have "an unavoidable responsibility". "With the developed and developing countries' increasing interdependence, it is clear that not until most of the developing countries have achieved stable and sustainable growth can sound and sustained global development be attained," Chen said. The deputy governor of China's central bank said that a serious difficulty for developing countries' economic development was the uncertainty for their external environment. It included the persistent decline in commodity prices, various forms of trade protectionism and the heavy debt burden which he said imposed acute constraints on the economic development of many low- income developing countries. "We urge the developed countries to persevere in substantially reducing the debt of the low-income developing countries," he stressed. He also urged the developed countries to take more substantive action in the areas of finance and technical assistance as well as in facilitating an improved economic environment. Speaking of the world economy, Chen said the global economic activity is expected to improve in the next two years, although continuing recession in most European countries and Japan remains a cause for concern. Many developing countries, he said, continue to face severe difficulties in their economic development, while economies in most East European countries and the countries of the former Soviet Union are still enduring hardships.
