Today we learned through a Transportation and Communications Ministry communique that Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo has downplayed the National Transportation Commission's threats. Lacayo clearly said that meetings would be held on Monday afternoon. The community is afraid because everyone knows the type of actions that are carried out in conjunction with the Parales Vallejos cooperative. The people are distressed and afraid that there will be bloodshed as a result of the National Transportation Commission's threats. We have here Francisco Silva, president of the Nicaraguan Chamber of Transportation; Ivan Martinez, executive secretary; and Ramon Huertas Herrera, secretary of local and international relations. Huertas Herrera will tell us of the Nicaraguan Chamber of Transportation's position in light of these threats. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Good afternoon, Ramon Huertas Herrera. [Huertas Herrera] We want to clear up some names that could cause confusion. For example, what is the National Transportation Commission? Some people could become confused and think that the National Transportation Commission is an organization that groups the whole sector, the entire Nicaraguan transportation sector. That is not true. There is also the National Transportation Chamber, which groups another transportation sector; Fetracolnic [Nicaraguan Federation of Collective Transportation], which is a federation of collective transportation; and Fetracanic [Nicaraguan Federation of Cargo Transportation], which groups everyone in local and international freight transportation. There is also the Nicaraguan Chamber of Transportation, which is the one we represent. All of these organizations make up the transitory National Council of Transportation. The National Transportation Commission is promoting the strike called for Monday. The entire transportation sector is not calling for a strike on Monday. Some transportation organizations are calling for a strike, such as the National Transportation Commission. The Parales Vallejos Cooperative, the 110 Route, and some taxi cooperatives are part of that commission. Those cooperatives are promoting the strike on Monday. If you recall, the recent past strike that was initiated with a protest requesting the elimination of the IGV [general sales tax] and the halt in the rise of fuel prices for the remainder of 1993 degenerated into what was called a rebellion. The rebellion resulted in two fatalities, a fact still very much alive in the minds of Nicaraguans, particularly capital residents. As the Nicaraguan Chamber of Transportation, which groups many organizations, cooperatives, private passenger transportation companies, freight companies, and taxis, we do not support the strike because we know what it will become. The capital residents probably still vividly recall the disorder and how all of that got started. It began with small barricades, followed by burning tires, then the barricades became trenches from where shots and mortars were fired. Private and public property was destroyed, the windows of vehicles on the streets were broken. There was a series of disturbances that projected a very negative image of Nicaraguans. Therefore, we think that the government's timing to increase fuel prices was the worst possible. They [not further identified] were not working, they were on vacation. That was at the end of last year. [end recording] [passage omitted]
