John Major's trip, only formally announced this afternoon, was shrouded in secrecy for security reasons and full details were still not being disclosed. He will be giving a pat on the back to some of Britain's 2,000 troops working to reinforce the fragile truces in Bosnia. Mr Major, keen to build on the peace breaking out across central Bosnia, is also expected to talk with military leaders and politicians. He wants to assess the situation on the ground, and discuss future military and aid requirements should the truces around the capital Sarajevo and across central Bosnia be extended. He also wishes to consider how the burden of future help could best be shared among the UN member countries. Mr Major is expected to meet Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, the UN's commander in Bosnia. Sir Michael's leadership has been hailed as a great success. His robust style has helped secure the ceasefires. Mr Major's trip, expected to last no longer than 24 hours, comes as Serbs and Muslims signed an agreement ending the 23-month-old seige of Sarajevo. Under the deal, signed today under UN supervision, a bridge, key roads linking Serb and Muslim sections of the Bosnian capital and a route from Sarajevo into central Bosnia controlled by allied Muslims and Croats, will be freed. The Prime Minister's visit also coincides with the arrival of the 900-strong reinforcement battalion based on the Duke of Wellington's Regiment. The reinforcements will bring the total number of British troops in the region to 3,400. Britain has played a leading role in trying to resolve the conflict, and in persuading other UN member countries last week to send an extra 7,200 troops to the region following pleas from military leaders. The extra troops are needed to implement the ceasefires and create confidence. Mr Major is likely to travel to Vitez where British Battalion One has its headquarters. The battalion is based on the Coldstream Guards with responsibility for the area from Maglaj in the north to Vitez and west to Travnik. British Battalion Two, based on the Duke of Wellington's Regiment with its headquarters in Bugojno, is responsible for the area south of Vitez including Gorni Vakuf, which has been a key flashpoint, Tomislavgrad and Prozor. Mr Major will be keen to meet the two commanding officers -- Lieutenant Colonel Peter Williams of the Coldstream Guards and Lt Col David Sanat-Olalla of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment. He is also expected to meet Brigadier John Reith, overall commander of British forces in Bosnia and UN forces in the southwest sector and chairman of the Joint Commission set up with Croat and Muslim leaders. Sarajevo is certain to be on Mr Major's itinerary, and he will want to assess the capital's infrastructure needs now the shelling has stopped. Mr Major and U.S. President Bill Clinton sent a joint civil planning mission to Sarajevo to assess the state of basic services such as electricity and water following their meeting in Washington earlier this month. Mr Major will want to assess the progress of the mission, and is expected to make some announcements on it. Downing Street officials said Mr Major's first priority was to show personal support, and that of the Government and country at large, to the troops.
