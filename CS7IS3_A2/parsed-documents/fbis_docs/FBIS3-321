[passage omitted] The first point on the agenda of the Council of Ministers was a briefing on the state of security in the country. It was introduced by the minister of state charged with interior and public security and expanded by the minister of national defense. The briefing noted that security was slowly returning to normal inside the country, while in Bujumbura, especially in Kamenge, this morning the situation worsened. It should be noted that arms are being kept almost everywhere in the country, particularly in the capital. The council therefore recommends an in-depth study of ways to install appropriate mechanisms to disarm the public. Members of the government also deeply deplored the balkanization trends currently affecting Bujumbura. In the face of the generalized insecurity in Burundi, the Council of Ministers found it necessary to put in place operational structures charged with following up and solving on a daily basis questions related to security. The people will be regularly informed about the steps taken to that effect. The council recommended the strengthening of the National Security Council. The media were called upon to support the government's action towards restoring security, especially in the mayorship. The members of the government believe that the solution to the crisis will necessarily pass through a judicial process devoid of complacency and with the cooperation of the various bodies of the police and the people. Last, in order to emphasize its determination to bring about a rapid return to security and peace in the country, the council decided that until further notice it would meet at least once a week to study the security problem as a priority.
