The first question is: Why all the foot dragging and compromising in putting into practice PLO-Israel agreements calling for an Israeli withdrawal, deployment of Palestinian police, and the transfer of power to Palestinian authorities? The general consensus is that the responsibility [for the 'Afula operation] must be borne by the Israeli Government because it is letting itself be swayed by extremists, settlers, and army generals who thrive on war and bloodshed. The result has been massacres perpetrated against the Palestinian people at the Ibrahimi Mosque, in Hebron itself, in the Jabalyah camp in Gaza, and throughout the Palestinian territory where the Palestinians are being killed at random. We have been telling the Israelis that violence breeds violence and that blood [words indistinct] and that they should honor agreements to which they put their signatures and observe agreed upon dates. If the Israeli Government had met the 13 December date for implementation of the accord, much of the chaste blood spilled in Hebron, Gaza, Khan Yunus, Janin, Tulkarm, and Ramallah would have been spared. However, in appeasing terror and terrorists in the settler and military communities, the Israeli Government is turning a deaf ear to the voice of truth, and the result is a vicious cycle of violence, suffering, and blood. Will the 'Afula operation bring the Israeli leadership to its senses? Will the Israeli leaders understand that killing Palestinians cannot but have a price? Will they learn the lesson that the protection of human life depends on the establishment of peace rather than [words indistinct] and procrastination. It is hoped that acts of violence will give pause to all the parties and prompt increased determination to reach the kind of peace that obtains security for all concerned, saves lives on all sides, and assures Palestinian rights, without which peace will remain elusive.
