Tian Qiyu said: The situation of China's public security can be summed up in three sentences: 1) Society is generally safe for reform, opening up, and economic construction; 2) the number of criminal offenses, especialy major, heinous crimes, is increasing; and 3) in certain areas, the public security is poor, crimes are rampant, and people feel unsafe -- just as Premier Li Peng noted in his government work report. Tian Qiyu said: The major reform measures the state will carry out in the financial, taxation, banking, and investment sectors this year certainly will bring about all-around social progress. But we must also realize that, compared with those introduced in the last decade or so, the reform measures to be introduced this year are both the largest in number and the most difficult to carry out, and society certainly will feel some pains because of their introduction. We must have sufficient understanding of this problem. Tian Qiyu said: Public security organs' main mission is to make all-out efforts to maintain political and social stability. Public security organs will continue to come down hard on criminal offenses; give priority to "cracking major cases, striking criminal gangs, and pursuing fugitives;" and carry out special, priority crackdown projects in a way appropriate to the local situations. In areas where problems of public security are conspicuous, collective county, city, or even more widespread campaigns will be organized to crack down on crimes. Priority will be given to cracking down on murder, robbery, theft, and organized crimes. In rural areas, hooliganism jeopardizing local safety will be harshly punished according to law. A fight against guns, narcotics, smuggling, and illegal emigration will be launched in some provinces and municipalities. Tian Qiyu said: This year we also underscore the need of setting higher goals for cracking cases. We will crack more major cases, step up prosecution of cases that have been cracked, act more efficiently in handling cases, enforce the law strictly, and firmly correct the problem of reducing penalties, such as accepting fines in lieu of imprisonment. On controlling public offenses, Tian Qiyu said: Public security organs will give priority to controlling guns and explosives, and to controlling the floating population and crime-prone places. We will collectively put in order problem-ridden stations, ferry piers, trains, and recreational districts; increase the intensity of wiping out social viles; and continue to promote and improve the system of assigning policemen to patrol duty.
