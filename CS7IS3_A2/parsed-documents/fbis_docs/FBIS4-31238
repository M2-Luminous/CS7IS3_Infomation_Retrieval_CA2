In rating support, the government is only slightly ahead of the Sejm, and trust in the president is the most unsteady. Evaluations of three of the 15 establishments examined by the Center for Research on Public Opinion [OBOP] are worse than the evaluation of the president: "Solidarity '80," "Self-Defense," and private banks. For the first time, the ranking of trust has included public radio as an independent establishment (before that the television and the radio were treated as one). Right at the beginning, it gained a considerable advantage over other "competitors." A comparison of opinion polls conducted between May 1993 and May 1994 shows that support for television is the most stable and at the same time very high. Between March and May, there was a decrease in trust toward all establishments, with the exception of public television. The drop was not great--about 2 or 3 percent--with two exceptions: Support for the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity" plummeted by 8 percent, and support for the government fell by 7 percent. It is worth recalling that, in April, we witnessed the strongest wave of strikes in recent times. Thus, both sides lost as a result of this conflict. Nevertheless, the president is the record holder as far as the greatest trust decrease is concerned. Within four months, trust in him went down by 12 percent. The greatest supporters of Lech Walesa are the inhabitants of rural areas and the largest towns and cities, believers and churchgoers, and those who declare that their views are rightist or center rightist. There are no great differences resulting from age. In the course of one year, most noticeable is the increase in trust toward the Sejm, and, only to a slightly smaller degree, in trust toward the government. The Sejm, where the coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish Peasant Party is in a definite majority, is trusted more than twice as much as its predecessor. * * * The OBOP poll was carried out between 10 and 27 May on a 1,107-person sample.
