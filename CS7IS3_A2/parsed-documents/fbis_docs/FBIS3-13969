That, in plain language, would be the meaning of the stand it has now taken on Kashmir, if it decides to stick by that stand. It has stated that the next round of talks between the two countries must focus on the modalities and time schedule for holding a plebiscite in Kashmir. Such an agenda can be agreed upon between the two countries only if, and only after, they have agreed, at least in principle, that a plebiscite is to be held and the time has come to sort out the modalities. Since no agreement of the kind has been reached as yet and none is in sight, the agenda stipulated by Pakistan puts the cart before the horse. Why has Pakistan done so? One part of its motivation is clear enough. By making such a proposal Pakistan is trying to convince what remains of its constituency in Kashmir that it is still working for the Valley's exit from India. It is also trying to convince the people of Pakistan that while the Mujahideen may have failed to tire India out of the Valley, Pakistan has not lost its zest for its parallel tussle with India on the diplomatic front. Nor has it lost diplomatic initiative despite India making the first move in suggesting a substantial and constructive agenda for the next round of talks between the two countries. There is very little India can or needs to do about this part of Pakistan's game plan. It is a matter which lies between Pakistan on the one hand and on the other those who have put their faith in Pakistan's ability to undo, by one means or another, the State's accession to India. India can only wait while they come to terms with the realities. India's concern needs to be more with what Pakistan may be attempting to convey to the United States by these tactics. What Pakistan is seeking to do at that level is to blackmail the United States and other peace-makers into putting further pressure on India on its behalf, and by that means to scare India into making further concessions quickly in order to spare itself the pain of these pressures. This is a subtler game than Pakistan has played so far, which makes it all the more necessary for India to avoid either of the two opposite kinds of diplomatic fumbling, one by showing too much flexibility and the other by showing too little. Too much would only whet the appetite of Pakistan and the secessionists, too little would narrow the opportunities which have opened up in Kashmir thanks to the recent successes in the fight against terrorism. The blackmail Pakistan is attempting may seem to be convoluted. But its logic is quite simple, and it may well persuade those decision-makers in Washington who, as recent events have shown, are either intentionally unfriendly or lack the knowledge or the patience to understand the complex situations in far off South Asia. An important part of Washington's concern about Kashmir has long been known to be an outcome of its concern over the nuclear intentions or capability of India and Pakistan. The argument it puts forward is that so long as the issue of Kashmir is not resolved, there will always be the risk of a war between the two countries, and in anticipation of it each country will be tempted to arm itself with nuclear weapons. That will only aggravate the possibility that either may use them, whether pre-emptively or when faced with imminent defeat in a conventional war. Pakistan is now playing judo with this argument, by using its force to flip it over and stand it on its head. It has been proclaiming from the highest policy-making levels--for instance through Mr. Moeen Qureshi when he was the Prime Minister of Pakistan, and much favoured by the American establishment because of his commitment to economic liberalisation, and more recently through the current Foreign Minister--that there is a linkage between Pakistan's nuclear policy and its demands regarding Kashmir. More simply stated what this means is that if America is interested in forestalling a conventional war in South Asia which might escalate into a nuclear war, then it must pile more pressure on India until Pakistan's demands with regard to Kashmir are met. Reluctant as yet to go along with that, the United States has been urging both countries to enter into purposeful talks. But talks do not suit Pakistan's book. A deadlock does, and better still a breakdown, because then Pakistan can resume the game of playing upon America's anxiety to prevent any serious escalation of the risk of war by neutralising India on Kashmir. India checkmated Pakistan when it not only agreed to put Kashmir on the agenda of the recent talks but also accepted Pakistan's demand that this subject be given a separate and pre-eminent slot. India gained some more when Pakistan admitted that the talks on Kashmir had been "serious." And then, even before that round ended, a distinct possibility arose that the two countries might yet put themselves on the track of substantial and long-term negotiations because India indicated its willingness to make a series of proposals, some on very substantial issues, and from which much good could come for both countries if the talks continued to be serious and purposeful and if Pakistan refrained from making the Indian proposals a hostage to its own. Pakistan has now tried to stymie that chance with its demand that the focus of the next round of talks must be on the modalities of a plebiscite. Pakistan probably expects that it stands to gain no matter which way India moves. If India accepts the demand, Pakistan earns the gratitude of the secessionists. If India rejects it, Pakistan can proclaim that the negotiating exercise has been thwarted by India, and India must be subjected to further and perhaps terminal pressure, while Pakistan escapes the embarrassment of having to discuss India's six proposals. Pakistan is simultaneously trying to give teeth to this logic by stepping up military actions along the border to make it look more likely that the only alternative to America pressing India harder diplomatically would be a military conflict in South Asia. Therefore it is necessary for India to move on a dual track. On the one hand it must prepare itself, seriously and sincerely, for the next round of talks. To this end it should consider whether there is any way it can further enrich its own proposals, and at the same time hold its patience if Pakistan insists on putting the modalities of a plebiscite on the agenda. If and when that item is reached there will be time enough to argue the absurdity of it, but it must not be India that turns its back on the negotiating table. At the same time Indian security forces must avoid the kind of overreaction they committed on January 27 because it plays straight into the hands of Pakistan's scare tactics. On the other track India must anticipate the blackmailing of America which Pakistan is sure to begin as soon as it can find an excuse to say that it is India which has brought the talks to a dead-end. This again will require simultaneous movement on many axes. Despite the insensitivity or ignorance of many in the American administration, and the prejudice of a few, the actual score on the negotiating table must be kept as clearly before as many Americans as may be possible. This will test India's own patience also of course, and the competence of the lobbying agency which has just been engaged will have to go through an early baptism of trial under fire. A tougher axis will be for the effort which must be made at the same time to carry conviction with America at the highest level, that while India will go as far as it possibly can to win back the confidence and allegiance of the people of the State of Jammu and Kashmir--especially now, when the situation on the ground is rather more auspicious than it was before--it will not place the State either at the disposal of Pakistan's ambition to complete what it holds to be the "unfinished task" of partitioning India along religious lines, nor will it make the State available for any next generation of strategic games that the United States might be cooking up, as China suspects it is, against the new enemy America is inventing for itself. But the toughest axis is going to be the one on which India will have to make up its own mind on what and how it will face whatever it might have to face once it decides that it cannot bow any further to American interests or prejudices. India has already seen on the economic front that even a good policy like deregulation of the economy can do much harm if it has to be tailored constantly to the values and demands of those who pull the strings, and is not governed sufficiently by India's own needs and conditions for optimum benefit. But such harm is nothing compared with what can ensue if in an abject and unwarranted spirit of helplessness India gives in to pressures on Kashmir which may be wholly incompatible with the country's territorial and, what is more important, social integrity. After doing its best for obtaining America's understanding, India must learn to do without it if that becomes necessary. *
