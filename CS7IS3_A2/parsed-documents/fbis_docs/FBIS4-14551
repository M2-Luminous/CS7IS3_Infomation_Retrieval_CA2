Speaking at a press briefing in Moscow on Thursday, Kostikov said that President Boris Yeltsin is studying the text of the agreement and has already had talks with the chairmen of both houses of the Russian parliament on this matter. "The text of the agreement has no form of a finished formula yet and is open to discussion," Kostikov said. He did not rule out the possibility of publishing the draft agreement. The spokesman drew the journalists' attention to the importance of the mechanism of the implementation of the agreement. To this end, a conciliatory commission will be set up to act as an arbitrator in disputes between various political parties or organisations. "This will be an open commission which will work also openly," Kostikov continued. The commission will seek to "resolve the disagreements on early stages" and "introduce and mold the culture of political compromise in society." Speaking about the content of the agreement on civil peace and accord, Kostikov noted that it consists of 7.5 pages and is divided into several sections -- preamble of a declarative character and chapters about the ethnic and regional policies, spiritual and moral responsibility and terms of the implementation of the agreement. Yeltsin hopes to set the process of signing the agreement in motion at the end of April. The number of possible participants is about 25, but the agreement will be open to anyone wishing to sign it afterwards as well, he said.
