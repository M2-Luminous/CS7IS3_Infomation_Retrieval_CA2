"This is an entirely natural procedure: to remove the restrictive norms of the old legislation after the adoption of a new Constitution," Doctor of Economic Sciences Yevgeniya Serova, adviser to the minister of agriculture for economic questions, comments on the situation. And so what has this edict repealed? It has transferred all powers of the abolished Soviets connected with the regulation of land relations to the local administrations. It has removed from the Land Code the concept of the "holding inherited for life," which was once introduced as a palliative under conditions when it was impossible to legalize land ownership. In addition, Article 7 of the edict "on the regulation of land relations and the development of agrarian reform in Russia," which grants committees for land resources and land use the right to trade in land which, as IZVESTIYA wrote, is fraught with the danger of the emergence of a monopoly trader, has been repealed. Although this has no direct bearing on the Constitution it does correct an erroneous preceding decision. The decree and statute on holding competitions and auctions for the sale of land plots, which enshrined the unjustified rights of the Russian Committee for Land Reform and Land Resources, which followed the edict, are also being repealed. In Yevgeniya Serova's opinion, from the viewpoint of legal technique, the amendments could have been done more punctiliously. By mechanically repealing the concept of the "holding inherited for life" and failing to explain the terms under which this right is turned into property, millions of people have been plunged into an area which is not governed by law. And by depriving the Russian Committee for Land Reform and Land resources of the right to do deals involving land plots on the state's behalf (what they have in mind here is most likely the purchase of land for federal needs) they have removed competent people from this business. The "organ of state management," which will engage in this and which according to rumors should be created by the State Committee for the Administration of State Property, could be not very professional.
