The security forces foiled another plan in al-Badari last week. This is the first time that the security forces have uncovered a terrorist organization that was planning to carry out terrorist operations in Sidfa and outside that did not involve university- and school-educated people. The security forces arrested 19 people, including 14 of the leaders of the military organization in Sidfa that was involved in the implementation of terrorist operations in Sidfa and Abu Tij. Four members of the same organization were killed in Tima in an exchange of fire with the security forces. ROSE AL-YUSUF has learned that the Sidfa organization was more accurate in the implementation of its operations and the selection of its members, whose identity was difficult to uncover. It planned its operations from a cave in Tima, in Suhaj Governorate, which was difficult to reach. The organization members established training camps for their operations in the Tima desert. A security source in Asyut has said that the new organization was dangerous because all its members were illiterate peasants who are not so easy to uncover. The organization was led by Anwar Hashim Muhammad, 23, who is accused of involvement in more than one murder case. The source added that the security forces have arrested 14 members of the military organization without any resistance. But four members escaped to Tima, in Suhaj, to prepare for new terrorist operations. The security forces, in conjunction with the state security in Suhaj, discovered their whereabouts and killed them following an exchange of fire. The security forces, accompanied by armored vehicles equipped with Goryunov machine guns, cordoned off the eastern areas from al-Badari to the border of the Suhaj Governorate in one of the largest combing operations in the area to find other members of the military organization in al-Badari. Large forces were also combing the mountainous areas of Sidfa and Abu Tij from the west. The security authorities in Suhaj are deploying large forces at the northern entry and exit points of Asyut and are combing areas in Tima and Juhaynah that are close to Asyut in a pincers operation. A security source denied a claim by the popular organizations in Asyut that they can deliver Rif'at Zaydan [not further identified] within two months. The security source affirmed that the popular organizations know nothing about Zaydan because he frequently changes his identity and hideouts, and this claim is a new attempt by these organizations to win over public opinion. Only the security forces are able to identify his location and arrest him, and this is expected to take place within days.
