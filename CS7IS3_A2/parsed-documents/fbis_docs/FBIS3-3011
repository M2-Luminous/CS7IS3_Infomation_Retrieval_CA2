While addressing the National People's Congress (NPC) yesterday, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said the State Council had earmarked 52.04 billion yuan (HK$46.2 billion) for national defence for 1994. The percentage increase this year was the highest since 1979, when patriarch Deng Xiaoping launched his economic reforms, one of whose tenets was to curtail military spending and devote more resources to the economy. China's military outlay takes up 9.59 per cent of its total governmental expenditure, as compared with 23 per cent for Taiwan, 24.3 per cent for South Korea and 17.6 per cent for the United States. A total of 43.25 billion yuan was spent on the People's Liberation Army (PLA) last year, slightly more than the original target. About 42.5 billion yuan had been set aside for national defence in last year's budget, which represented an increase of 14.8 per cent over the 1992 figure. "This year's national defence expenditures have been appropriately increased because of price rises, army wage reform and higher living expenses," Mr. Liu told the 2,800-odd legislators at the Great Hall of the People. The big increase was made in spite of Mr. Liu's insistence that the overall financial situation of the country was "grim" and that the criterion for drafting his budget was "tightening control over expenditures". The 20.32 per cent surge for the PLA is also bigger than the 18.5 per cent boost for education, a "national priority area" cited by premier Li Peng on Thursday. In addition to the defence budget, Beijing has also allocated 61.36 billion yuan for"administrative expenses for building state power", which analysts said included police expenditures. The 1994 figure is 13.57 per cent more than that of 1993. Chinese sources said the State Council had succumbed to aggressive lobbying by the top brass, who complained about antiquated equipment and falling standards of living in the face of inflation. Vice-Chief of Staff of the PLA, General Xu Huizhi, said yesterday the new allocation was suited to the "practical situation" of the country. General Xu claimed that, as was true of last year's allocations, only a small part of the budget would be used to purchase weapons. General Ding Henggao, Minister of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence, added the budget bonanza was "mainly to help improve the quality of life of the troops". Xinhua (the New China News Agency) last night quoted the Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Liu Huaqing, as saying "our endeavours to modernise national defence serves solely to defend ourselves". General Liu asserted that "China's annual military expenditure is very small in the world", and that the PLA's major role was to provide a "powerful security guarantee" for the reform and open-door policy. An NPC delegate representing the PLA, however, complained yesterday that the 20 per cent rise was too small. Sources close to the PLA said the actual expenditure by the army was more than double the publicised sum allocated to it by central Government. "Much of the funds for military research and development, retirement expenses, and those incurred in conscription and in helping demobilised soldiers and jobs in the civilian sectors are covered by 'hidden budgets' absorbed by other government units," an informed source said. "A sizeable portion of the funds, including foreign currency used by the PLA to import weapons, comes from the profits made by the mushrooming PLA business empire, which is sometimes a law unto itself." Asian military analysts said yesterday the increase in the budget was in line with the PLA's avowed goal of acquiring weapons and technology that were commensurate in sophistication with the country's fast-growing economic and geo-political clout. They said a focal point of the PLA's armament modernisation drive in the mid-1990s was the navy, which was essential for China's "power projection" in the Asia-Pacific region. "The PLA is pumping funds and resources into developing nuclear-powered submarines as well as medium-range missiles that could be launched by them," a military source said. The source added that priority was set after the top brass decided late last year to scrap the plan for building aircraft carriers. "China's five existing nuclear submarines are old Soviet models that are terribly antiquated," the source said. "The PLA is testing a submarine-launched missile that has a range of around 400 kilometres." Western military analysts said the PLA's Second Artillery Unit was aggressively developing medium to long-range ballistic missiles, including the Dong Fang 25 and the Dong Fang 31 models, which had ranges of respectively 1,700 km and 8,000 km. At the same time, emphasis is being put on churning out a new generation of solid-fuel Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles. The analysts said the PLA had to spend more money developing its own weapons systems partly due to the stalemate in efforts to procure Russian military technology. They added discussions on buying another batch of SU27 jet fighters from Moscow -- as well as a co-production agreement to turn out MiG aircraft on Chinese soil -- had bogged down because of Russian reluctance to part with top- of-the-line know-how. However, with the revival of military co-operation with Europe and even the United States, the top brass is again hopeful of acquiring sophisticated hardware from the Western world. "In view of the recent 30 odd per cent devaluation of the yuan, the 52.04 billion yuan budget is not much to play around with," a Beijing diplomat said.
