More than 75 percent of all profit is attributable to industry. Profits increased 8.0-fold as compared with January-November 1992, including a 7.5-fold increase in industry. The entirety of the increase seen in profits was due to increased prices. At the same time, the financial state of enterprises continues to be adverse. The profitability factor with respect to industrial production was on the level of 41-44 percent. However, the increased prices are noticeably depreciating the income received by enterprises. Over 16 percent of all enterprises and organizations of the oblast were operating unprofitably in January-November. In industry and transportation, 14 percent of enterprises operated at a loss; in housing and municipal facilities--12 percent; in trade--over 20 percent; and in provision of everyday services--40 percent. On the whole, the number of enterprises operating at a loss decreased by 7 percent as compared with January-November 1992, but their number in industry rose 17 percent. On the whole in the state sector of the oblast economy, the proportion of unprofitable enterprises was 3.8 percentage points higher than was the case in the nonstate sector. Insolvency of enterprises is significantly aggravating the problem of unprofitability. As of 1 December 1993, the total amount of creditor indebtedness of enterprises in industry, construction, transportation, and agriculture came to R145.6 billion, of which R40 billion, or 27 percent, was overdue. Residual free monetary assets totaling R19.4 billion as of 1 December covered one-seventh (13.3 percent) of their total creditor indebtedness. Debts receivable for the above-mentioned sectors amounted to R185.2 billion, 27.2 percent higher than the enterprise debt. Low solvency (the ratio of monetary assets and debts receivable to creditor indebtedness and debts on credits and loans secured) was observed at enterprises of the coal industry (12.7 percent), the machinebuilding and metalworking industry (68.2 percent), the lumber and woodworking industry (64.7 percent), the textile industry (55.4 percent), the garment industry (69.5 percent), the food industry (54.3 percent), and at agricultural enterprises (48.3 percent). The indebtedness of industrial, construction, transportation, and agricultural enterprises with respect to bank credits as of 1 December exceeded their own monetary assets fourfold. Delinquent indebtedness with respect to issuance of consumption funds in the sectors of industry, construction, and agriculture amounted to R3.8 billion as of 1 January 1994. The amount of unpaid wages in industry decreased by 23 percent in December 1993 as compared with November, amounting to R1.7 billion; in construction this figure dropped to half its November level, coming to R0.7 billion; in agriculture, the figure decreased by 13 percent, amounting to R1.3 billion. Poor payments discipline at enterprises is complicating the generation of financial resources necessary for production and social development. The largest share of assets expended consisted of payments to the budget--55 percent (31 percent for 1992). Some R215.6 billion in taxes and other payments were made to the state budget from enterprises, organizations, and the populace of the oblast in 1993. This is seven times the amount paid in 1992. About half this figure (48.7 percent) came from tax on profits. Value-added tax accounted for 24.6 percent, and taxes from the populace--11.5 percent. PRIVATIZATION As of 1 January 1994, 1,375 enterprises in the oblast had been privatized. Of these, 439, or 32 percent, were privatized in 1993. Of the total number of privatized enterprises, 20 percent became private property through conversion to joint-stock operation (full or partial), 80 percent--through sale. The proportion of large-scale federally owned enterprises privatized increased from 5 percent in 1992 to 11 percent in 1993, while the proportion originally constituting oblast and municipal property decreased somewhat--from 18 to 14 percent and from 76 to 75 percent, respectively. The main avenues for sale of property of enterprises during the process of "small" privatization were: buy-up of leased property (21 percent of the total number of enterprises privatized); sale through commercial competition (35 percent); auctions (23 percent). Sale of the property of liquidated enterprises was chosen by only 1 percent of enterprises. The proportion of enterprises privatized through conversion to joint-stock operation rose 4 percentage points over 1992. Of three alternatives of benefits offered labor collectives when converting to joint-stock operation, the second alternative was preferred, allowing the labor collective to hold a controlling package of shares. More than three-fourths of the enterprises converting to joint-stock operation selected this benefits option. One-fifth of such enterprises chose the first alternative. In addition, 2 percent of enterprises converted to joint-stock operation through transformation of leased enterprises. The total value of property of enterprises privatized (prior to reevaluation of fixed capital) amounted to R27.5412 billion. The average value of an enterprise privatized from municipal ownership was R2.7 million, from oblast ownership--R39.6 million, and from federal ownership--R88.4 million. Competitive demand for property privatized is determined both by sector affiliation and type of ownership. On the whole, the difference between the sale price and initially declared value of the property, i.e., the average value rate of enterprises privatized, is 12-fold, including 24-fold for enterprises of municipal ownership, and threefold for enterprises of oblast and federal ownership. Total proceeds from the sale of property to new owners (including funds from enterprises privatized in 1992) amounted to R5.7 billion in monetary assets and 526,300 privatization checks. Over 60 percent of the funds received from privatization of enterprise property was deposited as revenue into oblast, rayon, and city budgets; 16 percent went to the federal budget, and 22 percent was directed to state privatization organs. As of 1 January 1994, 82,300 apartments were privatized in the oblast (30.6 percent of the total number), including 35,700 in 1993. Of the total number of apartments privatized, 99 percent were privatized at no cost. Funds totaling R59.6 million were received from the privatization of housing, R37.4 of which (63 percent) was received in 1993. The average value of a privatized apartment was R11,000. The average size--50 square meters. PRICE AND RATE LEVELS AND INDICES The fairly high level of inflation was maintained in 1993. It was spasmodic, however. Consumer prices for basic products and services increased 8.1-fold by December 1992. The maximum level of inflation was set at the beginning of the year, when consumer goods and services had almost doubled in price toward the end of the first quarter, as compared with December of the previous year. A trend toward reduced rates of inflation was seen beginning mid-year: 1.7-fold during the second quarter, 1.8-fold during the third quarter, and 1.4-fold during the fourth quarter. However, the growth of consumer prices of goods and services in 1993 was significantly lower than in 1992, when a 24.9-fold increase was seen. Thus, prices for food products in 1993 increased 8.7-fold, nonfood products--6.7-fold. These figures for 1992 were 13.1-fold and 19.8-fold, respectively. In this regard, during the first half-year of 1993, food product prices rose at a galloping rate, while this was the case for nonfood products in the third quarter. Then in the fourth quarter an alternation was seen: in October in favor of food products, in November nonfood products, and in December the rate increases were the same. Changes in the prices of individual food products were also diverse. Compared with December 1992 prices, meat dumplings increased in price 29-fold; vegetables--18-fold; cottage cheese and sausage products, meat and meat products, milk and dairy products--from 11-to 14-fold; butter, cheeses, eggs, bread, and bakery products--from seven- to 10-fold. Fluctuations in the rates of price change for industrial commodities were also observed. Prices increased significantly over the year for medicines (102-fold), operating stock (27-fold), office products, building materials, fuel, and individual commodities for children and adults (from 10- to 14-fold). A more significant rise in prices was observed with respect to paid services provided the populace. This change overall amounted to a 14.8-fold increase for the year (48.2-fold for 1992). This is 2.2 times greater than the growth of prices of nonfood products, and 1.7 times greater than that for food products. In 1993, the stipulated rates for certain notary services increased by a factor of 1,462, for legal consultation--by a factor of 61. Passes for rest and relaxation facilities increased 44-fold, tickets for the theater and museums and the initial visit to the doctor--more than 30-fold. Certain cosmetic and medical services, parental fees for child care, lodging in hotels and dormitories, photography, laundry, dry cleaning, and barber services, repair of footwear, refrigerators, and televisions, rates for electric power and intercity communications, postal rates, subscriber fees for home telephone use and cable radio--all increased in price by factors of six to 20. Wholesale prices of enterprises for industrial production in 1993 increased 9.6-fold as compared with December 1992. The rise in wholesale prices was most significant in the meat and chemical industry, electric power industry, and building materials industry (13- to 14-fold), and in the milk industry (10-fold). Nitrogen fertilizers, water-heating boiler facilities, footwear, meat products, and glass kitchenware increased from 11- to 14-fold in cost, and crushed stone--more than 19-fold. The purchase price index for grain in 1993 was 578 percent, for potatoes--330 percent, vegetables--1,545 percent. The purchase price of livestock and fowl increased 13.4-fold over the year, milk--10.3-fold, and eggs--9.5-fold. THE SOCIAL SPHERE The demographic situation. As of 1 January 1994, the population was 1,167,000, according to estimated data. In 1993, 9,600 infants were born in the oblast. This is 1,200 (11 percent) fewer than in 1992; 19,200 people died--2,900 (17.6 percent) more than in 1992. The level of natural population loss was 1.7 times greater than that of 1992, and amounted to 9,600 people. This was observed everywhere except in the city of Desnogorsk. The city population of the oblast diminished by 4,700 people as a result of natural processes, the rural population--by 4,900. Heart disease and malignant tumors remain the most frequently encountered illnesses, constituting the cause of 72 percent of deaths. Some 8,408 marriages were registered in the oblast in 1993, or 3.7 percent more than in 1992. The number of divorces increased 2.5 percent, amounting to 5,534. There are 63 divorces for every 100 registered marriages. The volume of migration (arrivals and departures) dropped 13 percent as compared with 1992, amounting to 66,800. The number of arrivals exceeded the number of departures by more than 10,000 individuals. New arrivals in the oblast included 4,374 refugees and people forced to resettle. Among those leaving the oblast, 208 departed for permanent residence in countries of the far abroad. Labor resources. The number of persons employed in the oblast economy (not including cooperatives, small or private enterprises) during 1993 was 451,000. This is 2.7 percent fewer than in 1992. Some 18,100 citizens seeking jobs filed application with the state employment service in 1993. The intermediary efforts of this service resulted in job placement for 9,200 individuals, or 51 percent of the applicants. As of the beginning of January of this year, 2,800 citizens out of work were registered with the employment service organs. This number decreased 24 percent over the year. Some 1,100 individuals were declared unemployed. Some 44 percent of the unemployed were persons laid off in connection with the elimination or reorganization of enterprises and with personnel cuts. More than 56,000 people (12.4 percent of those employed in the oblast economy) took additional leave or were shifted to employment based on less than a full work week at the initiative of the administration, i.e., constitute the potentially unemployed. For every 10 vacancies indicated by enterprises, there are 13 individuals seeking employment. In this regard, it is blue-collar workers that enterprises require most of all (73 percent of the employment requirement). Some 362 persons (3.7 times greater than at the beginning of 1993) underwent occupational training at the direction of the employment service. Monetary income of the populace in 1993, according to preliminary estimates, totaled over R406 billion, a 9.7-fold increase over 1992. Growth of income of the populace last year surpassed the growth of consumer prices during all months except January, May, and July. Income of the populace increased 10 percent over the year in real terms. Growth of income in December is explained through the regular increase in the minimum wage and corresponding increase in salaries in the budget sphere. Also influencing the growth in incomes were material-assistance payments at the end of the year and awards for annual work results. In the final months of 1993, the proportion of outlays for purchase of goods and services decreased, while the proportion of savings in deposits and securities increased. Significant amounts of ready cash stayed in the possession of the populace. Thus, in December 1993, the share of total income kept on hand by the populace came to 31.4 percent (in November this was 26.8 percent, in October--24.8 percent). Average per capita face-value monetary income over 1993 amounted to 197 percent of the subsistence minimum (157 percent in 1992). At the same time, almost one-fifth of the population had an average per capita monetary income lower than the subsistence minimum during the course of 1993. The average monthly wages of workers at enterprises and organizations (not including cooperatives, small or private enterprises) for 1993 came to R43,800--9.7 times greater than in 1992 (first quarter--R14,300, second quarter--R30,500, third quarter--R51,500, fourth quarter--R78,800). The average wage in December 1993 was R96,300--35 percent greater than in November 1993. In this regard, the average wage in the material production sectors exceeded R96,100. In the nonproduction sphere it was R97,000, and not including credit and insurance organizations--R77,000. Consumer market of goods and services. Toward the end of 1993, the decline in production of consumer goods had decelerated. The industry of the oblast produced consumer goods during the year totaling R429.5 billion, or 12.6 percent less than in 1992 (for the first quarter the reduction was 26.4 percent, for the first half year--14.2 percent). The output of nonfood products decreased to the greatest extent (by 14.4 percent). This was affected by the sharp reduction in output of light industry products (by 20.4 percent). The production decrease was 48 percent for cotton fabrics, 34 percent for knitted articles, and 14 percent for leather shoes. The output of food products decreased by 4.7 percent. Some 5,300 tonnes (14 percent) less meat (industrial output) was produced than in 1992, sausage products--1,200 tonnes less (7 percent), whole milk products--8,200 tonnes less (13 percent), bread and bakery products--44,300 tonnes less (21 percent), and confectionery items--1,100 tonnes less (9 percent). The production volume of dishware and crockery, sewing machines, electric irons, umbrellas, tape recorders, and greenhouses was higher than in 1992. Over the past year, the retail trade volume of officially registered trade enterprises and public kitchens of all forms of ownership amounted to R245.2 billion. Expenditures by the populace on the purchase of commodities increased 9.8-fold in actual prices as compared with 1992. Trade turnover in physical terms decreased by 9.7 percent. Almost half the trade turnover volume (48 percent) was attributable to privately owned enterprises. With respect to food products on the consumer market, an adverse situation has developed concerning provision of potatoes and vegetables to the populace. As far as nonfood products are concerned, sales of televisions and synthetic detergents rose significantly (1.4-fold). It was precisely with respect to these goods, however, that interruptions in trade were observed. Paid services totaling R18.1 billion were provided residents of the oblast over 1993. In current prices, the provision of paid services increased 9.2-fold as compared with 1992, while in physical terms 39 percent less in services was rendered to the populace. The volume of provision of everyday services decreased 36 percent in comparable price terms over the 1992 level. Over half the volume of everyday services were provided by officially registered enterprises of the nonstate sector. Provision of everyday services to the rural population deteriorated. According to the results of a one-time survey of the network of rural enterprises providing everyday services to the populace, 16 rural rayons lack a permanent network of consumer services, and an equal number do not have the itinerant variety of service provision. Education. As of the start of the 1993/1994 school year, there were 696 general-education schools operating during the daytime and 14 evening-session schools. Additionally, there were two nonstate schools--a private high school and orthodox secondary school. Pupils number over 153,000--1,719 (4 percent) more than was the case the previous school year. There continues to be an increase in the number of schools operating in two or three sessions. Whereas for the 1992/1993 school year, 17 percent of schools were in this category, the proportion was 20 percent in 1993/1994. The percentage of pupils attending second session increased from 23 to 25 percent, third session--from 0.7 to 0.8 percent. Some 12,300 students receive instruction in five institutes of higher education of the oblast. This number includes 9,800 students in daytime instruction. As compared with the 1992/1993 school year, the number of students has decreased by 679 (5 percent). Some 2,435 individuals obtained higher education in 1993. Only 49 percent of the graduates received employment assignments. The remainder were afforded the right to seek job placement independently. In 27 special secondary and higher educational institutions, 17,200 students are receiving instruction. This includes 7,900 students (46 percent) at nine colleges. The number of students decreased a negligible amount--by 400 (2 percent)--as compared with the (1992-1993 school year. In 1993, 4,413 specialists were trained with special secondary and higher education. Fewer than one-third of the graduates (26 percent) received an employment assignment. Crime. Some 22,700 crimes were registered in the oblast in 1993, 10 percent more than in 1992 (in 1992 the increase was 30 percent). Over half the crimes (58 percent) were solved. The proportion of grave crimes committed during the year increased by 3 percent, amounting to 13.6 percent. The proportion of property crimes continues to rise. Theft constituted almost 60 percent of all the crimes committed. MATERIAL PRODUCTION Industry. Industrial production in the oblast in 1993 was marked by instability. A trend toward deceleration of the decline in production was noted in the final months, however. Whereas the ratio of production volume for the first quarter of 1993 to that for the same period of 1992 was just 79.4 percent, the volume of industrial production on the whole as compared to the 1992 level was 88.3 percent. Deceleration of the decline in industrial production was affected by a growth in production output achieved by enterprises of the energy-producing machine building industry (137.6 percent), garment industry (112.7 percent), butter and cheese processing and dairy industry (115.5 percent), and printing industry (103.7 percent). The most significant lag behind 1992 levels was observed in the tractor and agricultural machine-building industry (37.6 percent of the 1992 level), in instrument manufacture (75.1 percent), the fuel industry (78.4 percent), and the textile industry (73.1 percent). A drop was noted in the production of electric power--by 4 percent, major electrical machinery--by 31 percent, light bulbs--by 13 percent, automation tools and devices and their spare parts--by 41 percent, computer equipment--by 39 percent, and mineral fertilizers--by 20 percent. Production of commercial timber fell by 31 percent. Due to the lack of raw timber, output of sawn lumber was reduced 17 percent. Enterprises of the construction industry curtailed their output of building bricks by 7 percent, prefabricated reinforced concrete components--by 20 percent, soft roofing materials--by 39 percent, enameled ceramic tile--by 16 percent. At the same time that production volume in industry diminished, a reduction was seen in the number of employees. This reduction in personnel is proceeding less intensively, however. In 1993 the number of employees decreased by just 5.1 percent. As a result, the drop in labor productivity was more significant--6.9 percent. One reason for this situation is the fact that the number of qualified workers has been retained in hopes that production will improve. There are 10 enterprises in the oblast engaged in conversion. In 1993 the total volume of production at these enterprises decreased 17 percent from the 1992 level, including a 47 percent decrease in military production. The proportion of the total output of these enterprises attributable to civilian production was 56.8 percent, as opposed to 63 percent in 1992. Agriculture. With respect to agriculture, 1993 saw a continuation of the redistribution of lands, their privatization, and the reorganization of kolkhozes and sovkhozes. As a result, at the end of the year the oblast had 312 partnerships and joint-stock companies of the closed variety, 60 collective farms, 31 agricultural cooperatives, 31 sovkhozes, 21 kolkhozes, and two associations of peasant (owner-operated) farms. As of 1 January 1994, there were 3,183 peasant (owner-operated) farms, with 165,800 hectares of land at their disposal. Some 633 peasant (owner-operated) farms were newly established during the year (1,947 in 1992), while more than 300 farms ceased their operation. The gross production output of farms of every category in 1993 amounted to R936.2 million (in 1983 comparable prices). This is R82.3 million (8 percent) less than in 1992. More than half (52 percent) the volume of gross agricultural output was obtained from farms of the populace and peasant (owner-operated) farms. Their share amounted to 42 percent in 1992. For all categories of farms, planted crop production output was significantly less than in 1992, as a result of reduced areas under seed and diminished crop productivity. Grain output totaled 726,200 tonnes (weight after additional processing)--88,800 tonnes (11 percent) less than in 1992; vegetable production totaled 106,200 tonnes--45,500 tonnes (30 percent) less; and flax fiber output was 6,800 tonnes--11,700 tonnes (65 percent) less. Production of potatoes increased by 8 percent, amounting to 719,500 tonnes. For the 1994 harvest, agricultural enterprises almost cut in half their sowing of winter crops and plowing of land for spring planting. The situation with respect to livestock is ambiguous. In 1993, a 2 percent growth was achieved in livestock production output for all categories of farms by increasing production in owner-operated farms and farms of the populace. Agricultural enterprises reduced their production of meat in 1993 by 7 percent from 1992 levels, eggs--by 4 percent, wool--by 45 percent. Production of milk increased by 7 percent due to increased productivity of the cows, amounting to 412,800 tonnes. The average amount of milk yield per cow for the year was 2,008 kilograms (1,677 kilograms in 1992). The trend toward reduced herd size is continuing. As of 1 January 1994, the number of cattle at all varieties of farms decreased by 8 percent, amounting to 618,300 head. The number of cows was reduced by 1 percent, amounting to 276,300 head. The number of pigs came to 318,800, 0.7 percent less; the number of sheep and goats--133,000, 6 percent less. Increased numbers of livestock on farms of the populace and owner-operated farms did not compensate for their drop at agricultural enterprises. Agricultural enterprises went into the winter season with reduced feed supplies. In 1993, 57,600 tonnes of mineral fertilizers (converted to 100-percent effective nutrient substance) were delivered to meet the agriculture needs of the oblast, 20 percent less than the quantity requested. As compared with 1992, agricultural enterprises obtained 73 percent fewer trucks last year, 67 percent fewer tractor trailers, 69 percent fewer bulldozers, and 6 percent fewer tractors. Sixty-six more combines were purchased, and 44 percent more earth movers. Capital construction. Facilities and capacities were put into operation last year in the oblast at the Yartsevo diesel engine plants, at Dvigatel (in Yartsevo), at the Smolensk printing combine, Roslavl chemical plant, and Smolensk city dairy. Hard-paved roads were constructed over 402.6 kilometers, including 285.6 kilometers of intra-farm road. This is 34 and 51 percent less than in 1992. Livestock breeding premises were put into operation in the oblast to accommodate 4,100 cattle and 660 pigs; storage facilities for grain and seed storage--for 14,600 tonnes; and vegetable and potato storage facilities--for 1,200 tonnes of simultaneous storage. The volume of capital investments from all sources of financing in 1993 was reduced by 32 percent, amounting to R118.8 billion. This is the consequence of decreased investment activity on the part of enterprises over the past two years. The rate of decline of capital investment volume was significantly higher in agriculture (53 percent) than in other sectors. The proportion of centralized capital investments dropped from 58 percent in 1992 to 36 percent in 1993. The remainder of capital investments are covered by funds of enterprises (51 percent), preferential term credits (4 percent), and investment funds (9 percent). Some 59 percent of the centralized funds are attributable to republic budget funds. Construction work is being accomplished by contractor organizations of various forms of ownership. State contractor organizations account for 23 percent of the cost of the work. The rest is accomplished by privately owned (21 percent) and mixed (56 percent) organizations. Some 63 percent of capital investments were used in the construction of production facilities, 33 percent lower than the prior year level. Capital investments in the nonproduction sphere were reduced by 2 percent, amounting to R43.9 billion. Of the total volume of capital investments, the share of funds used for housing and sociocultural construction increased from 35 percent in 1992 to 37 percent in 1993. Some 4,780 apartments with all the modern conveniences were commissioned out of all sources of financing, including individual housing construction. These covered an area of 288,700 square meters--56,200 square meters (16 percent) less than in 1992. At the same time, the volume of housing put into operation from funds of the populace increased (by 26 percent), although the share of total housing introduced in the oblast attributable to such funds is still quite low (4.9 percent). Transportation and communications. Some 16.3 million tonnes of diverse freight was shipped in 1993 by general-use transportation of all varieties--9.7 million tonnes (37 percent) less than in 1992. Shipments of freight by motor vehicle transport decreased 2.2-fold. Shipments by rail decreased by 11.8 percent. Virtually the entire volume (about 97 percent) of freight shipments by motor vehicle transport was accomplished by privatized enterprises. Passenger traffic volume in general-use transportation totaled 6 billion passenger-kilometers, a decrease of 2.2 percent. This includes motor vehicle transport--decreasing by 16.7 percent--and railroad transportation--increasing by 1.2 percent. Over 1993, 19.8 million (6.2 percent) fewer passengers were conveyed by all types of transportation than was the case a year ago, including a drop of 2.6 percent in railroad transportation and 14.2 percent in motor vehicle transport.
