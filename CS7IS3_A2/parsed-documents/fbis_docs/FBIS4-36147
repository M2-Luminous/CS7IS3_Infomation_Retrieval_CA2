By conducting a nuclear test in 1974, India proved its nuclear capability. According to the deposition of former CIA chief William Casey, India's nuclear program has advanced to a dangerous level and India has enough enriched uranium to make 60 to 80 atom bombs. For quite some time, international agencies have been giving hints about India's hydrogen bombs, and now the U.S. Senate report has endorsed them, thereby exposing India's designs. The other day, there was also a reference in the press about India's plans to manufacture Surya missiles. These will be of intercontinental ballistic missile type and have a capacity to hit a target up to 12,000 kms. Prior to this, India had also manufactured the medium-range Prithvi missile, whose final test preparations are nearing completion at Chandipur in Orissa. The other missiles manufactured by India include the Agni, Trishul, and Nag. India began a long-range missile program only to launch nuclear weapons, and it is surprising that the Cold War era has ended and the contemporary superpowers like Russia and the United States have also agreed to limit their missile programs. On the other side, even now, there is pressue from international monetary agencies to make considerable cuts in defense spending and give priority to the welfare of people rather than spending money on weapons. The irony is that India does not even care for international pressure. India did not even take the American message on the nuclear issue into consideration, which was acknowledged by President Clinton during his joint press conference with Narasimha Rao. It has made the acquisition of arms for all branches of its land, air, and naval forces a routine thing. India's blue water navy, which contains aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines, is 10 times larger than that of Pakistan. The Indian Air Force has sophisticated MiG-29 aircraft. In view of its size, the Indian Army is larger than those of all its small neighbors put together. In fact, India does not face any threat to its national security from any quarter. Until now, India took the lead in provoking its small and large neighbors. Pakistan became the target of Indian aggression three times in 1948, 1965, and 1971, and even now the target of all its preparations will only be Pakistan. India's aspirations and efforts are to accomplish the dream of Greater India and do away with the partition of mother India. Only Pakistan is an obstacle in the accomplishment of these despicable designs, and India can become a threat on our border at any time. India was constrained to reach an understanding with China. First, it is not possible for India to subdue China and second, it has realized that China does not have aggressive designs against any of its neighbors. Hence, the Indian forces, which were earlier deployed along the borders with China, have been moved and are now being deployed along the borders of Sindh, Punjab, and Kashmir. India has threatened several times that the continuing freedom movement in Kashmir can flare up into a "limited war". During his visit to the United States, President Leghari also spoke about the threat of a nuclear war. On the other side, the international powers have also identified the threat of a nuclear war in the subcontinent. It is definite that India may commit aggression in the future as it did in the past. To counter the situation, it is first the responsibility of Pakistan to not give up its policy of deterrence, and second, to make its defense impregnable. It is better to create political stability, as India will not have the guts to indulge in conflict. The global powers should also try to be aware of India's designs and not allow it to destroy peace in the region.
