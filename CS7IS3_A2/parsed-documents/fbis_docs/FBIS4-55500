It covers the exchange of information, military training, and cooperation between arms-manufacturing companies. Following the good experience of collaboration between the Mesko Engineering Works and the Swedish Bofors, both sides are hoping that Swedish participation in modernizing our Iryda and Skorpion aircraft, as well as military vehicles and warships, will be similarly successful . Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk referred to the fine cooperation traditions, especially from the interwar period. [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] Now we are going back to renewing these traditions. This refers also, or perhaps above all, to cooperation in the arms-manufacturing industry. Both sides are interested in this cooperation--Sweden and Poland equally. Our industry needs an injection of new technologies. It will thus be able to make use of its far-from-negligible intellectual and production potential. Sweden is agreeing to partnerlike cooperation--that is, not to the selling and buying of consumables but to investing their technologies in our industries. I hope the cooperation is going to be mutually beneficial. The first experiences, involving such well-known companies as Bofors and Ericsson, are behind us. These experiences were positive. [end recording] [Announcer] Minister Andres Bjorck emphasized that Poland was the first postcommunist country with which Sweden has signed an agreement on cooperation in the military field. [Begin Bjorck recording, English with superimposed translation into Polish] Poland is the first country of the former Warsaw Treaty, and we had no doubts that that is how it was going to be--first, because your country is leading in making democratic changes in this part of the region, and, second, both our countries, which are neighbors across the Baltic, are interested in maintaining peace and stability in the region. Sweden believes peace will not come by itself. It is raising its spending for defense purposes that could serve our cooperation. It is also important to give content to Partnership for Peace, in which our countries are participating. [end recording] [Announcer] Andres Bjorck also expressed the hope that Russia would join Partnership for Peace and would not be guided by particular interests. The Swedish minister was received by President Lech Walesa and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak.
