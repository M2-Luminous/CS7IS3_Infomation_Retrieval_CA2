FR940223-0-00048 FR940223-0-00021 EPA also has developed an NPL construction completion list (``CCL'') to simplify its system of categorizing sites and to better communicate the successful completion of cleanup activities (58 FR 12142, March 2, 1993). Sites qualify for the CCL when: (1) Any necessary physical construction is complete, whether or not final cleanup levels or other requirements have been achieved; (2) EPA has determined that the response action should be limited to measures that do not involve construction (e.g., institutional controls); or (3) The site qualifies for deletion from the NPL. Inclusion of a site on the CCL has no legal significance. In addition to the 57 sites that have been deleted from the NPL because they have been cleaned up (the Waste Research and Reclamation site was deleted based on deferral to another program and is not considered cleaned up), an additional 167 sites are also in the NPL CCL, all but one from the General Superfund Section. Thus, as of January 1994, the CCL consists of 224 sites. Cleanups at sites on the NPL do not reflect the total picture of Superfund accomplishments. As of January 1994, EPA had conducted 603 removal actions at NPL sites, and 1,755 removal actions at non-NPL sites. Information on removals is available from the Superfund hotline. Correction EPA inadvertently left one site off of the appendix B list in the previous final rule (57 FR 47180, October 14, 1992). This site is Foote Mineral Co., East Whiteland Township, PA, which belongs in the General Superfund Section of the NPL. Alternately, one site was included in the previous appendix B list which did not belong. This site is Broward County_21st Manor Dump in Fort Lauderdale, FL, which has been proposed to the NPL but a final decision has not yet been made. Action In This Rule This final rule adds 1 site, ALCOA (Point Comfort)/Lavaca Bay in Point Comfort, Texas, to the General Superfund Section, for a total of 1,068 sites in that section. The Federal Facility Section includes 123 sites. Therefore, there are now 1,191 sites on the NPL. An additional 96 sites have been proposed, 66 in the General Superfund Section and 30 in the Federal Facilities Section, and are awaiting final Agency action. Final and proposed sites now total 1,288. These numbers reflect that two sites have been voluntarily withdrawn from the NPL by EPA: Hevi-Duty Electric Co., Goldsboro, NC Hexcel Corporation, Livermore, CA These numbers also reflect the removal of one site from the NPL by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals: Tex-Tin Corp., Texas City, TX Information Available to the Public The Headquarters and Region 6 public dockets for the NPL contain documents relating to the evaluation and scoring of sites in this final rule. The dockets are available for viewing, by appointment only, after the appearance of this notice. The hours of operation for the Headquarters docket are from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays. Please contact the Region 6 Docket for hours.

The Agency's responses are contained in the ``Support Document for the Revised National Priorities List Final Rule_February 1994.''
