The reduction in service charges were set at 12 to 18 percent with an implementation date of 1 May. They have decided to reduce rates based on economies of scale brought on by increased traffic and hope to gain further increases in utilization based on lower rates. The current price cuts and expansion of discounted time zones will apply to marine satellite communications services offered to the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions via Inmalsat and the KDD Yamaguchi satellite station. Price cuts will cover an 18-percent reduction for Inmalsat A which consists of analog telephone and facsimile services, 12-percent reduction for digital Inmalsat B services, and 13-percent reduction for Inmalsat M services involving miniaturized and lightweight marine vessel station facilities. As an example, a three-minute call on Inmalsat A services covering the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions formerly cost 2,700 yen but will now cost 2,200 yen. As for discounted time zones, they will be expanded from six to 10 hours for Inmalsat A and B services, and expanded an additional 10 hours for Inmalsat M services. KDD first offered marine satellite communication services in 1982 in the form of Inmalsat A services. Its services are now utilized by 1,300 Japanese vessels.
