After a year-long controversy over the authorization, this was decided by the Bavarian Health Ministry yesterday. In first statements, the Bavarian Greens and the "Alliance for Protection From MOX" talked of a "disastrous false decision." It is an alarming world premiere and completely incomprehensible that Germany is the trailblazer with this nonsense, Deputy Raimund Kamm from the Greens said. In the course of the authorization proceedings, even the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna objected to the use of MOX fuel elements in boiling water reactors. Such reactors only have one cooling cycle. However, Bavarian Environment Minister Peter Gauweiler thinks that the objections are unfounded. An international safety analysis has shown that it can be safely used, he said. More than 40,000 people had objected to the use of MOX and there had been fierce controversies in the hearing in February 1993. The people who made objections complained about the vexatious transaction of the proceedings.
