These compounds have also been proposed for use in preparing ultra-pure arsenic sulfide and arsenic trioxide, as well as metallic arsenic itself. In the present work the molecular structure and vibration spectra of trimethylarsenite were studied by gas phase electronography, IR- and Raman spectroscopy. The resulting molecular constants were then used to calculate the thermodynamic functions of the ideal gas state. Standard enthalpy of formation was calculated and the standard Gibbs energy of formation of trimethylarsenite from simple substances was determined. Figures 2; references 23: 16 Russian, 7 Western.
