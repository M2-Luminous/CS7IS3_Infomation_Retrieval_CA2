"The move signifies our commitment to promote financial liberalization and internationalization," CBC Deputy Governor Yu Cheng told a news conference. Yu explained that the ceiling on investment by foreign financial institutions will be raised from the current US$5 billion to US$7.5 billion. In addition, Yu said, four local securities investment trust companies will be allowed to issue mutual funds abroad to raise a maximum of US$2.5 billion for investment in the local bourse. China Securities Investment Trust Corp., International Investment Trust Co., Kwang Hua Securities Investment and Trust Co. and National Investment Trust Co. have been authorized to issue mutual funds abroad. The central bank has approved US$4.7 billion in foreign investment in the local stock market, and some US$3.4 billion of the amount has actually been remitted here. Asked whether the central bank will further raise the foreign investment ceiling, Yu said it will depend on the domestic financial situation and the speed of foreign remittances. An influx of foreign capital in the local stock market during the final quarter of last year helped push Taiwan's balance of payments into the black. Taiwan registered a surplus of US$1.45 billion in its 1993 balance of payments, compared with a deficit of US$600 million in 1992. Nevertheless, the central bank has been very cautious in raising the capital inflow ceiling for fear of fueling inflation and appreciation of the new Taiwan dollar. CBC Governor Samuel Shieh said last week that the Central Bank will ease restrictions on capital inflow in a "gradual manner" with a view to maintaining domestic financial stability.
