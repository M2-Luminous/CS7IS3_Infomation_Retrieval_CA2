[Begin recording] [Flores Nano] The opposition has filed an amparo recourse, which will have to go through the normal proceedings and even be taken to international courts. The opposition has filed a reconsideration recourse, which still must be ruled on. The opposition will demand that the Constitutional Court Law be enacted and, with the people's support, will take the appropriate legal action to challenge the decision's constitutionality. [Sandoval] I would say this communique has been released too hastily, without first assessing the context of the circumstances under discussion in the past few days. [Reporter] According to the communique, the subject is particularly sensitive regarding the international environment, which demands a clear investigation. What would you say about these two words? [Jarama] I would say we all demand clarity in the investigation. I think we all agree on the communique's final remarks. We must reach the conclusion that the current government's officials are unwilling to create the necessary mechanisms to consolidate the groundwork for a true democratic system in the country. I am concerned over how little is being done on the positive side and how much is being done to destroy the country's institutionality. [end recording]
