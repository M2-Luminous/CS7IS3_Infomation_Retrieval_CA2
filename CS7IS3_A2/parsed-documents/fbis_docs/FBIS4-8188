"The Moslem war propaganda is hastily launching new fraud from Gorazde, calculated to call for and justify the engagement of the NATO airforce against the Serb people and army. It seems as if some senior UNPROFOR officers and officials have joined in the Moslem propaganda deceptions", the statement given to TANJUG says. NATO U.S. warplanes on Sunday evening launched air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions near the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, a U.N.-designated "safe haven" which should have been demilitarized last spring. In late March, about 10,000 Moslems from Gorazde surged into a heavy offensive against Serb territories. Moslem fabrications about attacks on Gorazde fuel hasty decisions on the use of force by the NATO aviation and contribute to the escalation of war. This prevents and postpones a lasting and complete cessation of hostilities and the reaching of an agreement on lasting peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement says.
