What is your opinion on the situation? [Yevtukhov] True, such statements already set one's teeth on edge. However, let us first decide what we mean by the notion "reform." Even specialists are not infrequently confused here. This is what I will say: Some people reduce this notion to something primitive. If the state diminishes its influence on a certain branch or enterprise, which start floating with the stream, to some people this already looks like reform. Under reforms, I understand such management of economic processes as would ensure a rise in the efficiency of production and, in the final analysis, the people's well being. It is precisely from this formula that I proceed, even though there are many critics of this approach. For some reason, there is an opinion, even shared by some economists, that reforms imply an intensive development of small businesses (of course, through a weakening of the state sector). Indeed, small businesses are a necessary element in reforming the economy. However, they have no plans of investing money in long-term projects or in the program for the state's strategic development and are in no hurry to engage in science-intensive production or in the fulfillment of other important and promising state tasks -- for example, defense, social protection of the people, and so on. Therefore, while implementing reforms, we should not ruin our own economy for the sake of privatizing at any price something that we do not infrequently observe in our state. Reforms require a sensible correlation between the state and private sectors, as this is done in advanced countries, and a cautious approach to privatizing strong and well-established enterprises, at the same time providing wide possibilities for the development of small businesses. [Kraslyanskyy] However, Vasyl Ivanovych, Western experts particularly criticize us for the fact that state control over the economy allegedly hampers reforms and stifles the development of private businesses. [Yevtukhov] Our economy needs to be reformed proceeding from common sense and should not blindly copy someone's models, which are in many cases not the best ones. In this, I support academician Pakhomov, who expounded a whole scheme of resistance on the part of various countries of the world to those reforms, which are based upon a strictly monetary approach and upon the thesis to the effect that "the less the state's interference, the more extensive the reforms." Japan became an economically strong country despite, and not owing to, such an approach. South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, and now also Malaysia have also rejected such a model. [Ludwig] Erhard [FRG postwar economics minister], whom we often quote, started not just with monetary reform but also with directives. He restored "in a Soviet manner" the severed ties and set economic mechanisms into operation through directives. In postwar Germany, there existed planning on the macro-level. It was only after the situation started to take proper shape and the economic transition to the conditions of market regulation started that prices were liberated. As you can see, the economy of the aforementioned countries developed under the control of the state in order to concentrate efforts and prevent chaos. I believe, therefore, that the thesis "the less the state's interference, the more extensive the market" is erroneous and even harmful. It is more suitable for countries with weak industry, where this model restricts possibilities of ruination. In our country, with its colossal economic potential, including missile construction and biotechnologies, such actions are very detrimental to the development of science, up-to-date technologies, or to the elaboration of fundamental projects. I am stressing: I am against administrative interference into the work of enterprises, but I am in favor of discipline and well-considered actions in all links of the economy. With your permission, I will once again turn to foreign experience. By the resolution of 1 December 1986, the principle of free prices was introduced in France (mind you, as late as 1986!). However, this document allows the government to take measures in the case of excessively high prices or in situations created by extraordinary circumstances, including crisis ones. They make it possible to establish ties between the market economy and the economy of planned distribution and, on the one hand, to avoid social shocks and, on the other -- to protect the national producer. I am convinced that we are currently in the transitional period from the strictly administrative command economic system to a market one. That is why it is necessary to chose "transitional" methods without extremes and take into account the experiences of other countries, which must be studied with a pencil in hand instead of taking for granted what newspapers and magazines write. [Kraslyanskyy] At sessions of the Supreme Council, the government was repeatedly admonished for its failure to have a distinct plan for emerging from the crisis. Do you have your own vision of such a plan? [Yevtukhov] The government has a plan. I also know what needs to be done in the sphere of which I am in charge. I am convinced, in particular, that we must start with establishing order in the banking and credits system concurrently with restructuring the economy. Today, as you know, the nonpayments, the absence of credits, the failure to pay wages, the decrease in the population's purchasing power (and also a slump in production, since an illusion of overproduction is created), and financial abuses painfully hit the economy. It is only stringent normative regulation of Ukraine's banking and finance systems that may today rescue us from total chaos in this sphere and in the entire economy. The banking legislation in the United States envisages, for example, state regulation of the functions of the credits and finance system to a larger extent than of other types of entrepreneurship precisely because the character of banking operations has the greatest influence upon the material well being of a society or upon its moods. The second, in my opinion, important problem is a reorganization of trade, primarily external trade and the related system of currency regulation in mutual settlements and control over currency receipts. Export today is becoming unprofitable due to the fixed rate of exchange of the karbovanets with regard to the dollar. The third problem is a complex of measures associated with the encouragement of the national commodity producer. [Kraslyanskyy] You, Vasyl Ivanovych, have come from the Supreme Council. How do you see, from your new positions, a cooperation between these high-level state structures? [Yevtukhov] We are jointly doing common work, and it is necessary to proceed from this. Everyone must be in his own place and be answerable for what he has been authorized to do by the law and by the Constitution. Undoubtedly, the Supreme Council, as the state's highest-level body, must control the government's activity, but not by way of demanding monthly reports after the return of the deputies from provinces, as was the case in the past. I would like to stress that reforms will not advance (even if supervised by a new Erhard), unless the power vertical and control over the economy are restored. Here, the Supreme Council, as the highest legislative body, must assume the responsibility. I see as optimal such cooperation in which the government, jointly with working structures of the Supreme Council, submits its plans for consideration, deputies thoroughly study them, analyze, and, if necessary, amend, and then ensure their implementation through legislation. I am against any confrontation, ambitions, or populism and favor constructive work and logic of mutual persuasions. In conclusion, I would like to say the following. Ukraine may be rich and strong. For this, it is necessary to work more and not whimper or give rise to hysteria about the crisis or various disasters. No one, except us, will extricate our country from the difficult period in its state development.
