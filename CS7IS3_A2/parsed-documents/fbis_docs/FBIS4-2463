He said the congress, which was given its own legislative power by the National People's Congress last month, would promulgate a procedural law governing the lawmaking process when its standing committee met next month. It will be followed by a law on how to implement China's first Taiwanese investment protection law. Mr Li said he was hopeful this second piece of legislation might be ready in the first half of this year. But the long-term aim is to set up a legal framework that matches the needs of a "socialist market economy" by 1997 in Xiamen, which is the closest mainland city to Taiwan. According to Mr Li, who is also Xiamen's Deputy Communist Party Secretary, the congress will at this stage focus on three types of legislation. These are: protection of Taiwanese interests, bringing the legal system up to par with other countries, and urban planning, management and public order. A meeting had already been held between the congress and Taiwanese investors in Xiamen to solicit their opinions, Mr Li said. Although Xiamen now has its own power to legislate, Mr Li said the Special Economic Zone would not become independent from the rest of Fujian. Instead, he said, the power would provide other Fujian cities with a "very valuable experience". Being able to legislate, Mr Li said, was important to enable Xiamen to become the third free-trade port in China. The congress will try to upgrade some of its existing regulations in order to speed up the process.
