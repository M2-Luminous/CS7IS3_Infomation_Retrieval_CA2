Sparks flew at a joint press conference given here by EU Commissioner Leon Brittan and Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, which was cut short after a heated exchange over the issue of Hong Kong and Sino-British trade ties. The press briefing followed the 13th meeting here of the EU-China Joint Committee, which was co-chaired by Brittan and Wu and focused on the EU's support for China's re-entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Responding to comments by Wu that Britain's "unfriendly and uncooperative" stance on Hong Kong would inevitably damage Sino-British trade ties and economic cooperation, Brittan stressed that EU-China relations were based on non-discrimination against separate EU member states. "Any action that discriminated against one member state on political grounds would be a very serious matter, not just for that member state but for the European Union as a whole," Brittan said. He declined to specify what action the EU might take should China disrupt trade ties with Britain, but the union's main leverage on Beijing would appear to be continued support for China's GATT re-entry. Wu's suggestion that Brittan, as a British citizen, was especially concerned with Sino-British ties drew an angry response from the commissioner, who insisted that the EU's position would be "identical" in the case of dicrimination against any other member country. "It would not be acceptable," he added. Despite Wu's reply that her comment "was a joke," the press conference was abruptly cut short. The question of China's trade ties with Britain was not actually discussed during the morning talks, but Brittan said he would certainly be bringing it up in the afternoon. The briefing began amiably with both sides voicing optimism after what they described as a "frank and constructive" round of morning talks. Brittan said the EU was "full of admiration" for China's efforts to move towards a market economy, but added that while the EU believed China's re-entry to GATT was in the interests of the global community, differences on certain issues still remain. There are problems to resolve because China's development is of course remarkable but not complete," Brittan said, adding that the terms under which China re-enters the world trade body "have to be negotiated to reflect this and accelerate the process of refom and liberalisation." Brittan also said that he expressed European concerns about aspects of human rights in China. The commissioner had brought a draft protocol outlining EU proposals on how to resolve outstanding questions and said he hoped "progress can be made on that urgently." For her part, Wu also admitted that differences of opinions remained, but stressed that both sides were willing to make efforts to resolve them. According to a western diplomat here, the EU is concerned that China will strike a deal with the United States over GATT membership that would see Beijing making exclusive trading concessions to Washington at Europe's expense. In an apparent reference to the United States, Brittan said he had stressed during the morning talks that the EU's relationship with China "must be on the fundamental basis of non-discrimination between the European Union and other powers." According to Chinese customs statistics, bilateral trade between the EU and China grew 50 percent last year to 26.1 billion dollars, with China posting a 2.7-billion-dollar deficit. According to the European Union, however, China enjoys a growing trade surplus that amounted to 9.93 billion dollars in 1992. EU figures for last year were unavailable.
