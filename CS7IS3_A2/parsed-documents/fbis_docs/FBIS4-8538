[Granic] Good evening. [Announcer] You have returned from Greece where you had talks with Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs Karolos Papoulias. According to news agency reports, you obtained support for the peaceful reintegration of the occupied areas. A visit by European Union [EU] ministers to Knin has been announced. What does this mean in concrete terms? [Granic] Greece supports the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia and the resumption of talks with the local Serbs. In this it sees a chance for the final normalization of Croatian-Serb and Zagreb-Belgrade relations. I put forward a proposal that a European troika should visit Knin, and as Greece currently holds the EU presidency, Mr. Papoulias accepted this, and he will join peace efforts to continue the peace process. Greece has a great interest in the normalization of Croatian-Serb relations and in this respect it will do everything it can. [Announcer] Today you also discussed Croatia's admission to Partnership for Peace, aid for reconstruction, and its membership of international political and financial institutions. What would you single out as particularly important from these talks? [Granic] A very interesting thing is that totally identical support was given both by Greece and Turkey as regards the demands of the Republic of Croatia toward the European Union, both in connection with an agreement on cooperation with the European Union, aid for the reconstruction of the Republic of Croatia, and its admission to certain concrete projects, such as the PHARE [Poland-Hungary -- Actions for Economic Reconversion] project. We also discussed Partnership for Peace and Croatia's admission to it. Both countries lent their strong support for this. [Announcer] You returned from an official visit to Greece and Turkey, two countries having strong links with events in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia. How much were the talks determined by this current Turkish support for the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Greek closeness to Belgrade? [Granic] It is indisputable that Turkey has a significant influence over the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but a very positive one. Throughout the entire war it has been a positive influence. We have always had very good and excellent contacts with Turkey, in the course of the entire past period, and naturally, especially now. On the other hand, Greece has good relations with Belgrade, Greece wants a final normalization of Croatian-Serb relations. We do not see any obstacles to the positive development of relations both with Turkey and Greece. [Announcer] Greece was one of the rare countries that condemned the latest NATO air strikes around Gorazde. There is a demand for a cease-fire and the resumption of negotiations between the Croatian- Bosniak federation and the Serbs. How did they assess the latest developments, particularly NATO air strikes on Gorazde? [Granic] Well, we discussed that, of course. Greece believes that nothing that would prevent the process of negotiations should be carried out. I pointed to the fact that this was, nevertheless, an aggression on Gorazde launched by the Bosnian Serbs, and that NATO had reacted in a legal and legitimate way. However, we agreed that it was of primary importance to halt all conflicts, achieve a cease-fire, and organize negotiations between the Bosnian Serbs and the [Croat-Muslim] federation. [Announcer] How do you view the latest developments? I know you have just returned from Greece, but as you are here I am availing myself of the opportunity to ask you, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is again being complicated. News has come about a fresh violation of the cease-fire in Sarajevo. It seems that shooting has again started there, that the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is restarting. [Granic] The Bosnian Serbs' reactions have been edgy. But, still, the Serbs were surprised by the NATO action. They had not believed it would take place. There are considerable differences among the Serbs themselves in their approaches. This was discussed today in talks with Minister Papoulias. Greece is ready to do everything to achieve a cease-fire and for negotiations to start. I would like to point to one more thing: Croatia's reputation in both Greece and Turkey, and particularly President Tudjman's reputation. It is interesting that both countries emphasized this, both ministers, especially President Demirel who said that Turkey has always maintained good relations with Croatia, particularly after the Washington agreement was signed. [Announcer] Mr. Granic, thank you very much for finding time to be a guest in our Slikom na sliku program. [Granic] Thank you.
