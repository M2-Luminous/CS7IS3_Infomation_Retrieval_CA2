The effect is calculated theoretically. Fiber directional couplers with continuously variable branching ratio (full range from 1/1 to 0/1) have been fabricated. Fiber core diameter is 75 microns and outer diameter is 125 microns. Coupler external dimensions are 2 cm x 2 cm x 3 cm, and the coupler has a precision adjuster for branching ratio. Figures 1-6, not reproduced, show the following: the experimental equipment, consisting of a 632.8-nm-wavelength He-Ne laser, a biconvex lens, the fiber, the coupler, two more biconvex lenses, and two detectors; the structure and side view of the coupler; a vertical view of the coupler rotating through a certain angle; a power density transform diagram; cross sections of the coupler with fiber translational movement and fiber angular rotation; and graphs of branching ratio vs translational movement distance and branching ratio vs rotation angle, respectively. There are no tables. References: 1. K. Ogawa, A.R. McCormick, APPL. OPT., 1978, 17(3):2077. 2. Song Yanrong, Wang Yangping, Zhou Guosheng, GUANGXUE XUEBAO [ACTA OPTICA SINICA], 1991, 11(4):341-346.
