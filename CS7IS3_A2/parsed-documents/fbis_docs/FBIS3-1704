In a statement to the U.S. Embassy, the Russian Foreign Ministry accused Morris, who works as a counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, of engaging in activities incompatible with his diplomatic status, noting him as an agent of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). "The Russian Foreign Ministry is lodging a protest against illegal activities of the American side with regard to an official representative of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service who has been working in Washington since the summer of 1993 by mutual consent," the statement said. "In this situation," the statement continued, "we have to declare, on the basis of reciprocity, a CIA officer in Moscow persona non grata and demand that he leave the Russian Federation." It also said that "The Russian Foreign Ministry proceeds from the fact that there are special channels for settling issues arising on both sides in connection with intelligence or counterintelligence activity. The channels can and should be engaged. This will allow (us) to find a mutually acceptable way out from the current situation and avoid its politicization." On Friday [25 February], the United States declared Russian diplomat Aleksandr Lysenko persona non grata and ordered him to leave the country within seven days.
