FBIS4-32157 "dreeu119__a94009" FBIS-EEU-94-119-A Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Coalition Continues Effort To Establish Senate Coalition Continues Effort To Establish Senate AU1706175494 Prague CTK in English 1608 GMT 17 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1706175494 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, June 17 (CTK) -- A new deputies' bill on elections to the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate was officially submitted to the parliament today, CTK has learnt. The bill was drafted by thirteen deputies from the coalition Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS), and from the Liberal Social Democratic Party (LSNS). The new bill was submitted two weeks after the Chamber failed to pass on June 2 a government bill complete with some changes and additions proposed by deputies. Elections to the Chamber are to be held in 1996, elections to the yet unformed Senate were planned for the autumn, along with communal elections. But as the law was not passed, the Senatorial elections will probably be postponed. The new bill has been drafted on the basis of the original government bill, but includes almost all the changes and additions proposed by deputies and approved at the parliamentary session on June 2. But it does not include the proposal by Miloslav Vyborny (coalition Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, KDU-CSL) that the first Senatorial elections be held in 81 constituencies, but the following elections in only 27 constituencies formed by merger of the original 81. The Senators' term is to be six years and one third of them is to altered every two years. In discussing the government bill the parliament approved Vyborny's proposal, which resulted in the bill's rejection particularly by ODS deputies. The ODS has resolutely insisted on all Senatorial elections to be held in 81 one-mandate constituencies for which it has been criticized by both coalition and opposition parties. They claim that through this the ODS wants to ensure its dominance of the Senate. Marek Benda, chairman of the KDS group, told CTK on June 9 that the preparation of a new bill "is an expression of our effort to pronounce our conviction that the Senate must be filled and that it is not possible to pretend as if everything was in order after the failure to pass one law. It is simply not a correct attitude to say that we will not implement the Constitution and will start considering how to re-write it." Since the failure to pass the law, various proposals have been made to delete the Senate from the Constitution and to divide its powers between the government, parliament, and president.
