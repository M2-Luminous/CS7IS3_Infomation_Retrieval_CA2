Juppe's course has been "the most spectacular and most convincing" in the government, he contends. The conduct of the Geneva GATT negotiations, the initiative that led to the Sarajevo ultimatum and his ability to ensure the participation of a "refractory" United States, as well as his success in re-mobilizing his ministry have all furnished proof of his "brilliance" and his "energy" as a negotiator. In addition, President Francois Mitterrand appreciates the "limpidity of his analyses and expressions," Duhamel continues. A "formerly prickly and narcissistic" Juppe is beginning to relax, he notes, adding that with an "intellectual rapidity that quickly makes him impatient, and a dominating temperament and self-confidence that do not predispose him to tolerance," the foreign minister is not a consensual politician. In Duhamel's view, Juppe's attributes make him "the most promising of the forty-somethings," together with Socialist Party (PS) luminary Laurent Fabius. Just like his "sworn enemy" Philippe Seguin, president of the National Assembly, Charles Pasqua, minister of interior, and a more "seductive and politically inclined but less coherent" Francois Leotard, the defense minister, Juppe can aspire to the prime ministership, Duhamel contends. However, "there is a hitch," for Juppe is secretary general of the Rally for the Republic (RPR), a position which, in the opinion of some, makes for "one Juppe too many." Not that the foreign minister lacks governmental loyalty, Duhamel admits. However, Juppe must daily act on two levels. While Prime Minister Edouard Balladur profits from his minister's performance, Juppe's views as RPR "number two" strengthen Jacques Chirac, notably when he insists that the latter is the party's natural presidential candidate. This leads Balladur to distance himself from Juppe and "carefully omit to compliment him in public," for he does not want him to head a single majority list in the European Parliament elections. Juppe will soon hold "redoubtable" power, Duhamel comments, for he, Charles Pasqua, and Philippe Seguin will be the "three great RPR barons" to weigh in at the time of the choice between Balladur and Chirac. Seguin is opposed to Balladur and Pasqua has distanced himself from him. Whichever of the "two Juppe's" triumphs over the other will be influential, but will also be "mutilating himself," Duhamel concludes.
