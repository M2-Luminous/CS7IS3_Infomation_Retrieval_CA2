Abu-Marzuq: It is the Movement's basic and strong presence among the Palestinian people. The Movement's cadres and organizations are in the occupied territories. The presence outside these territories is natural, be it in the form of supporters, spokesmen, or official spokesmen in the Movement's name. It has political and information presence in most states of the region. However, as a result of his failure to suppress or confront the Movement or stop its armed operations, Rabin tried to hold external sides responsible for these actions so that the Israelis would not have great room for criticizing his policies and exposing his shortcomings and his inability to provide peace and security for them. This is not the first time that Rabin has shifted the responsibility for his policies on to outside parties. When the soldier Toledano was kidnapped, Israel accused the United States of sponsoring Hamas leaders and accused Syria of sponsoring the Movement. Now it is directing these false accusations against Jordan. I must express my astonishment because the U.S. Administration supports these allegations and accusations while knowing that they are incorrect. The United States responded to Israeli's accusations in early 1993 denying the presence of any Hamas leaders on its territory and proved that the Movement's military operations are planned and executed inside Palestine. Here we must emphasize the following: 1. The Hamas Movement has confined its battle in Palestine as an occupied territory and we have the right to resist with all means available to us. The Movement has been committed to this. 2. Rabin's accusations reveal the enemy's inability to confront Hamas and its attempt to instigate our brothers against it. 3. The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam battalions have always announced their responsibility for their operations inside Palestine by various means, such as leaving a leaflet at the site of the battle, announcing the operation by graffiti or through a loudspeaker, contacting news agencies, or distributing leaflets bearing the signature of the battalions. As for statements by its representatives abroad, they are merely comments and affirmations of the Movement's methods. This also happened after the recent operation. Al-Ma'ayitah: What is happening demonstrates the state of confusion in the Zionist enemy leadership. They cannot find a place or a Hamas group to retaliate against as they do in Lebanon against the Lebanese and Palestinian resistance. It is also a continuation of the series of pressures against Jordan to compel it to sign a separate peace agreement. Abu-Marzuq: Israel does not know where to strike at Hamas within its policy of deterrence. The Hamas Movement and military apparatus are in Palestine. They directed several blows at it in 1989, in late 1990, and in 1993 and were unable to limit the Movement's military activities. This created a crisis in the Zionist entity and this prompted it to choose Jordan as a means to shift responsibility to it. It is worth noticing that for the first time, Rabin and his Foreign Minister, Peres, appeared at press conference at the same time. Rabin's words were very strong in his capacity as minister of defense and interior, something which only made his failure worse. Peres' expressions were calmer because he knows that these threats are part of the political game. Al-Ma'ayitah: There are attempts to raise Jordanian fears concerning the seriousness of Hamas activity in the Jordanian arena. Some people try to substantiate these fears by citing the history of Jordan's relationship with PLO factions. Are these fears likely to materialize with regard to the Hamas Movement? Abu-Marzuq: We believe that the security and stability of any Arab country, particularly Jordan, plays a role in supporting Palestinian rights. On the other hand, destabilizing any Arab country will have a negative effect on the Palestinian cause. We have seen this repeatedly and the result was that Arab weakness has adversely affected the Palestine question. We are aware that Jordan is facing difficult circumstances and many pressures which we understand. We also assert that Jordan's position on the reckless Zionist threats was distinguished and deserves thanking. We, from a position of responsibility, will not give our enemy an excuse to fish in troubled water and will adopt appropriate measures and steps in this connection to safeguard Jordan's security and stability. We do not carry out military action from outside. As for the statements that talk about the five revenge operations, they were contained in statements issued by the ['Izz-al-Din] al-Qassam Battalions in Palestine. Other statements only reiterated this. We think that there are no grounds whatsoever for these fears because we are concerned about Jordanian cohesion and the security and stability of this country. Al-Ma'ayitah: Do you feel that Jordan understands this position? Abu-Marzuq: The Jordanian Government is certain that the credibility of the Hamas movement is high and it has never felt anything that contravenes this policy. It knows for sure that the official spokesman or the Movement's representative in Jordan have no connection with any action inside Palestine. They know, and everybody else knows, that the Movement and its military presence as a whole are inside Palestine. Therefore, Jordan is in a strong position to reject these threats because it stems from its sincere stand and actual practice. Therefore, I think that the Jordanian Government understands the Movement's position. Al-Ma'ayitah: Is the Movement going to adopt any measures in light of the Zionists' threats Zionists to Jordan? Abu-Marzuq: Basically, we will not allow any justifications for the enemy to fish in troubled water. This is in addition to some measures that have to do with the Movement itself, which we are going to take into consideration in the future, God willing, so as not to embarrass Jordan in these difficult circumstances. Al-Ma'ayitah: How do you view Jordan's position on the recent threats? Abu-Marzuq: I think that Jordan's reply to Israeli threats was strong and characterized by frankness and objectivity. The Movement had no official offices to begin with. The government officially deals with the PLO. Jordan has not dealt with us as representatives of the Palestinian people, and we have not claimed to be so. We represent part of the Palestinian people, but we do not recognize PLO representation of all the Palestinian people. Jordan's position was open and objective and it reflects actual reality. Al-Ma'ayitah: Given the international, Arab, and Palestinian situation, it seems that Hamas is approaching a fierce war with the Zionist enemy and its allies, particularly in the PLO leadership. It stands alone in confronting the Zionist enemy militarily at a time when the rest of the 10 factions opposing the current settlement process are unjustifiably absent. The question is how will Hamas confront this fierce war? Abu-Marzuq: We realize that since the first setback [the 1948 Arab-Israeli war], the Palestinian people have been facing successive plots and making large sacrifices. The Hamas Movement is part of these people and derives its strength -- after depending on Almighty God -- from the people's resolve to continue their jihad until they attain their hopes and aspirations and regain their land. We are aware of the seriousness of the next stage and it is the same seriousness the Palestinian people faced at various historical stages in Palestine and elsewhere. What is new in this regard is that part of the Palestinian people chose another path for reasons with which we differ. These differences, however, will not affect the Palestinian people's resistance of occupation. I believe that the current attempts to resolve the conflict will not be successful because they neither deal with the crux of the issue nor remove the causes of the conflict. This means the conflict will continue. We will not transfer the conflict to the Palestinian arena and will continue to deal with this conflict as sons of the Palestinian people regardless of differences in opinion. We hope they will deal with the Palestinian arena in the same way. The Movement will continue its jihad. We, like them, are suffering from oppression and imprisonment and we will continue to make sacrifices and pay the price of freedom. Al-Ma'ayitah: Following the implementation of the full or partial autonomy, two facts will emerge: Resistance of occupation, which will be pursued by Hamas, and the autonomy institutions and the Palestinian people's living aspects. How will Hamas coexist with these institutions and the living and servicing aspects? Abu-Marzuq: We are part of the Palestinian people and cannot ignore their interests and causes, which we will continue to defend. We will also continue to be an active element in all areas of life, including education, economy, and services, whether inside or outside the framework of autonomy. As for the political issue, that is, the administrative autonomy and normalization, we will certainly not deal with them positively. We will not participate in building the institutions that do not serve the Palestinian people unless these institutions go beyond the designated framework and begin to express the Palestinian people's ambitions. The Movement can then live up to the stage and serve the Palestinian people through the same framework. We will then not create many difficulties for those administrations and will be careful to direct our efforts toward fighting the enemy. Al-Ma'ayitah: Even if the autonomy institutions dealt with Hamas as an illegal and outlawed organization? Abu-Marzuq: I think it is difficult for the autonomy institutions to do so. We are part of the Palestinian people, not a simple part which can be chased. Consequently, it will be difficult for them to take such a step and I do not think they will make such a reckless decision. Al-Ma'ayitah: The Political Bureau of Hamas issued a political statement in which a paragraph reads: "Any peace in the region must be based on Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories and holding free elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to elect representatives of the Palestinian people who will decide the next steps and the future of the [Palestine] question." Does this mean that developing the present formula of the settlement will win the approval of the Hamas Movement? Abu-Marzuq: As a resistance movement, we think that if the enemy government wants to end the ordeal it is experiencing, then this cannot take place by imposing surrender on the Palestinian people. What we are saying is that there could be a peace treaty or a truce in order to rescue the region from its complex situation and end this crisis. The resolutions of international legitimacy have considered the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem occupied territories owned by the Palestinian people who live on these territories. If they want the resistance to stop this very minute, then what is required: 1. The withdrawal of the Zionist forces from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem. 2. The dismantling of the settlements. 3. Compensation for the losses and victims as a result of the occupation. 4. Holding free elections so that the Palestinian people will elect a leadership that will express the aspirations of the Palestinian people and the future of the conflict. If the Movement gets elected, then it has its own clear stand toward the conflict. However, if it wins a minority of votes, then it will express its views freely and we will respect the opinion of the elected majority. What we are offering is a way out of the current predicament. The PLO is negotiating with the Zionist enemy on foundations which we do not think are correct. The party that has a right to present views regarding the future of the conflict must be an elected leadership that represents the Palestinian people. We do not mind seeing the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem under the supervision of international troops, Palestinian police, or the Arab administrations which had previous control over these territories or of which these territories were a part before the 1967 aggression. Al-Ma'ayitah: Is this a political initiative? Abu-Marzuq: You can call it this way if you like. You can also say this is the Movement's vision to end the predicament, if you like. Al-Ma'ayitah: "The killing of civilians" is rejected internationally. Why did Hamas do this in the 'Afula and Hadera operations? Abu-Marzuq: Over the past years, the al-Qassam Battalions have been committed to their right to resisting the occupation troops and the settler militias, and they have never violated this rule. However, the occupation troops have been killing our children, women, and old men. Also, the occupation troops do not stop the inhuman practices of the settlers, whose peak was the killing of dozens of people at the Ibrahimi Mosque. This crime was not enough for them. A series of other crimes followed in the same city, and curfew was imposed on the victim. The occupation troops also let the criminal wolves free in the land and gave them a free hand to kill the sons of our people, to the extent that they did not spare a woman in her third month of pregnancy and the baby which she was trying to protect. This is in addition to shooting schoolchildren in Bethlehem, injuring nine of them. All of this has prompted the Battalions to treat the enemy the same way, and this is approved by international law and divine law until the troops and settlers stop killing the unarmed sons of our people. Then, the Battalions will go back to their policy of resisting the occupation.
