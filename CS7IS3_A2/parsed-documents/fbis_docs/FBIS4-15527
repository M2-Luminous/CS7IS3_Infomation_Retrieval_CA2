The main purpose of the visit was to obtain prearranged credits and to sell his country's resources to business circles. In his opinion, this has been achieved. As he told ITAR-TASS on his arrival on 6 April, Alma-Ata [Almaty] did not set any other tasks. Calling for cooperation in the future, Nursultan Nazarbayev, well known for his passion for hunting, realized that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. That is why the securing of Japanese promises on credits for $220 million in aid of reforms and 12.88 trillion yen for the development of the infrastructure were described as the main successes of the visit.
