The lamellar transformation process relates to aging temperature and cooling rate, at which _a_[.sub]2[/] single phase forms. A model of lamellar transformation kinetics was developed. The stability of lamellae decreases with decreasing interlamellar spacing and discontinuous coarsening occurs during aging.
