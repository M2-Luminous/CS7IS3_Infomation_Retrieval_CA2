In deciding on the need for the constitutional conference, Gen. Abacha said the administration is informed by a basic democratic norm which has it that what touches all must be approved by all. He said that Nigerians owe it as a duty to posterity to stand up with faith and good conscience in facing the challenges of nation building. Then he asked: What is nation building, after all, other than problem solving? The 19-member commission has Dr. (Saidu Kawu) as chairman. Gen. Abacha then stated the commission's terms of reference: [Abacha] To prescribe modalities and organize a constitutional conference; b) [as heard] to invite memoranda from all parts of the country and from interest groups on the agenda of conference; c) to collate documents and compile memoranda for submission to the conference; d) to propose a reasonable and comprehensive time table for the conference; e) to advise on the number of delegates and members that will make up the conference; f) to recommend suitable modalities for electing and for selecting the delegations; and, finally, g) to advise on any other matters which the commission considers relevant to its assignment.
