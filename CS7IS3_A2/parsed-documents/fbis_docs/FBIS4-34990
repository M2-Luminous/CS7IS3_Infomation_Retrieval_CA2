To implement the reforms, the BCH Board of Directors has issued a document entitled "Regulation for the Public Exchange of Foreign Currency." According to the document, beginning today all exchange brokers must turn over their foreign currencies to the BCH, which will buy them at referenced market rates. This provision excludes dollars in on-demand savings accounts. Pino said 60 percent of the dollars acquired so far by the BCH will be auctioned off, beginning on 23 June. He also said that, before each auction, the general public will be informed on the amount and base price of the currency. To guarantee honesty, the auction will be handled by a commission comprising one delegate each from the BCH, the Association of Honduran Banks (AHIBA), savings and loan associations, and exchange brokers, as well as two delegates from independent auditing firms and one notary public. Pino reported that natural or legal individuals can directly or indirectly submit bids to buy currency, adding that the bids must fall within a range of a minimum of $2,000 to a maximum of $200,000. The daily base buying price will be the average of the prices bid the previous day. To open this process, the BCH Board of Directors has established a balanced average of 8.60 lempiras to the dollar. This base price will be modified when the referenced exchange rates consistently drop or go higher. The adjustment will be effected whenever the current price consistently changes over 15 consecutive auctions. Pino pointed out that the bids cannot be higher or lower than the base price by more than 1 percent. Once bids have been received, they will be arranged in descending order and the amount of currency available will be assigned to the highest bidders. To give low bidders a chance to buy currency, banks and savings and loans can bid for a daily maximum of $25,000, while exchange brokers will have a daily maximum of $10,000. In conclusion, Pino said currency will not be assigned to natural or legal individuals more than once during the same auction.
