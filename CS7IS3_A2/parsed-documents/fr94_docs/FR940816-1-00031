FR940816-1-00031 FR940816-1-00007 B. EPA's Historical Interpretation of Control Technology Terminology The Act uses several terms to refer to different levels of emission control technology required for existing or new sources: ``reasonable (RACT),'' ``best (BACT),'' and lowest achievable emission rate (LAER). It is helpful to consider EPA's past and current interpretation and implementation of these various control levels in determining the control level appropriate for BACM for serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. The term ``reasonably available'' was applied to control measures and control technology required to be implemented at existing sources in nonattainment areas by the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments (1977 Amendments) (42 U.S.C. 7502(c)(1)). At that time, EPA defined RACT as the lowest emission limitation that a particular source is capable of meeting by the application of technology that is reasonably available considering technological and economic feasibility. 31 Control measures were determined to be reasonable after considering their energy and environmental impacts and their annualized capital and operating costs. In EPA's view, the cost of using a control measure is considered reasonable if those same costs are borne by other comparable facilities. Since Congress, in the 1990 Amendments, did not modify EPA's interpretations of the RACM and RACT in the earlier 1977 Amendments, it can be presumed to have given some endorsement to EPA's definition of the term. 31 See, for example, 44 FR 53761&hyph;53762 (September 17, 1979) and footnote 3 of that notice. Note that EPA's emissions trading policy statement (51 FR 43814 (December 4, 1986)) has clarified that RACT requirements may be satisfied by achieving ``RACT equivalent'' emissions reductions in the aggregate from the full set of existing stationary sources subject to those requirements (see also EPA's proposed economic incentives rule, 58 FR 11110, 11123 (February 23, 1993)). Congress defined the term ``best available control technology'' in section 169(3) of the 1977 Amendments for use in implementing the requirement to prevent significant deterioration (PSD) of air quality under part C, title I, of that Act. This definition was modified by section 403(d) of the 1990 Amendments. The BACT is currently defined for the PSD program as an emission limitation based on the ``maximum degree of reduction of each pollutant *␣*␣* emitted from or which results from any major emitting facility, which the permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such facility through application of production processes and available methods, systems, and techniques *␣*␣* for control of each such pollutant.'' Thus, BACT is to be determined for the PSD program on a case-by-case basis taking into account the energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs. Section 169(3) also requires that BACT be at least as stringent as any corresponding new source performance standard (NSPS) or national emission standard for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP). Under the PSD program, BACT applies through preconstruction permits issued to major new and major modified facilities in areas where the air quality is better than the NAAQS (section 165(a)(4) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7475(a)(4)). In broad overview, BACT is determined by identifying the technologically feasible control measures, from the universe of available control techniques, which yield the maximum degree of emission reduction, after considering the energy, environmental and economic impacts of the technology, and other costs. This may include consideration of the annualized capital and operating costs for the facility. The costs of control for a major new facility or major modification of an existing facility should be considered as a portion of the overall costs of the new facility. The term LAER refers to the level of control required for issuing a preconstruction permit to major new or major modified facilities in areas where the air quality is worse than the NAAQS (i.e., nonattainment areas) (section 173(a)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7503(a)(2)). In broad terms, LAER is defined at section 171(3) of the Act as the more stringent emission rate based on either the most stringent State emission limit or the most stringent emission limit achieved in practice by such class or category of source. Like BACT, the LAER level of control must be at least as stringent as the NSPS applicable to the source. Unlike RACT and BACT, the LAER requirement does not consider energy or cost factors. In general, the costs of achieving LAER in a nonattainment area must be considered as a portion of the overall cost of investing in a major new or major modified facility, as they are with BACT in attainment areas. The EPA believes that it is reasonable to conclude that in selecting the term ``best'' to apply to control measures in PM&hyph;10 serious nonattainment areas, Congress likely considered how the term has been interpreted in other sections and titles of the Act. Several other factors (discussed below) support such a conclusion. C. BACM for Serious PM&hyph;10 Nonattainment Areas A plain-English interpretation of the term ``best'' implies a generally higher standard of performance than one that may be considered ``reasonable.'' In addition, the structural scheme throughout title I of the Act is to require the implementation of increasingly stringent control measures in areas with more serious pollution problems, while providing such areas a longer time to attain the applicable standards. This structural scheme reflects a basic underlying premise of title I. The premise is (1) That more stringent control measures are needed in cases when the current control requirements will be insufficient to bring a particular area into attainment; and (2) that the more serious the air quality problem, the more reasonable it is to require States to implement control measures of greater stringency despite the greater burdens such measures are likely to cause. The Act attempts to balance the greater burden imposed in those areas where more stringent controls are required by affording the State additional time to implement them. For example, under section 188(e), EPA is given authority to extend the attainment date for a serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area beyond the specified statutory date, provided certain conditions are met. One of those conditions is that the State must demonstrate to EPA's satisfaction that ``the plan for that area includes the most stringent measures that are included in the implementation plan of any State or are achieved in practice in any State, and can feasibly be implemented in the area.'' Thus, under this section, the Act provides such areas an opportunity to receive additional time to attain the NAAQS. The consequence of receiving additional time, however, is that the State must demonstrate that its PM&hyph;10 implementation plan contains the ``most stringent measures'' that can feasibly be implemented in the relevant area from among those which are either included in any other SIP or have been achieved in practice by any other State.
