Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner and leader of the Yemen Socialist Party (YSP), said he was satisfied with the agreement reached Tuesday but said he wanted to be briefed on security arrangements for the signing ceremony before committing himself. Al-Bid has since August been embroiled in a dispute over the running of the country with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northerner and head of the ruling General People's Congress (GPC). The agreement on a range of reforms reached by representatives of Yemen's major political forces, notably the YSP and GPC, specifies in Article 7 that a committee be created to "establish security conditions required for the signature of the accord," by Salih and al-Bid. "The committee must first present the required program for implementation of Article 7 and then we'll offer our point of view," al-Bid told AFP. More than 150 YSP officials have been killed in attacks since North and South Yemen merged in May 1990. Al-Bid's party has blamed several of the attacks on the Islamic Jihad organization which it says is protected by the northern Al-Islah Islamic party. A GPC spokesman meanwhile said Salih had unconditionally accepted the agreement "and is ready to sign, on the date and at the time specified, the accord he considers a good step emerging from the current crisis and that he is ready to translate it into action." The GPC's political bureau voiced the party's commitment to compliance with all the accord's clauses, notably those on security arrangements and administrative decentralization. Al-Bid, the president of the former south, left the capital for his home in Aden on August 19, demanding political and economic reforms. Earlier this month he refused to attend a reconciliation meeting with Salih. The vice president's comments Wednesday were in reply to a statement by Hammud Hashim al-Dharahi, a representative of the Islamic Al-Islah party and a member of the security committee, who told AFP that al-Bid was "prepared to accept the date and place proposed by the committee for the signing of the accord." The accord was drawn up during two months of tough negotiations and calls for the withdrawal within one week of forces deployed along the former border between North and South Yemen. The cabinet, meeting Wednesday in Sanaa under First Deputy Prime Minister Hasan Muhammad Makki, voiced satisfaction with the accord. Announcement of the agreement came only hours after the GPC charged that a southern Yemeni warplane had bombed a northern army brigade. GPC and YSP officials had accused each other of massing troops along the former border.
