This date of great significance coincides with the visit to China by Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, who came to China to sign the joint declaration seven years ago. We warmly celebrate the seventh anniversary of the signing of the joint declaration and wish the current visit of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva full success. The Macao question is one left behind by history. Our country, following Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great concept of "one country, two systems," began talks in Beijing in June 1986 with the Portuguese Government on solving the Macao question. Based on a friendly, frank, and pragmatic spirit, both sides reached an agreement after a short period of nine months and, on 13 April 1987, officially signed the joint declaration on the Macao issue. The joint declaration stipulates that the Macao region is Chinese territory, that the Chinese Government will resume sovereignty over Macao on 20 December 1999, that by then the Macao Special Administrative Region of the PRC will be established and will practice "one country, two systems," that Macao's current social and economic systems and way of life will remain unchanged and its laws will basically remain unchanged, and that, during Macao's transition period, the Portuguese Government will be responsible for administering Macao, and will continue to promote Macao's economic development and maintain its social stability, while the Chinese Government will cooperate in this area. The Sino-Portuguese joint declaration is a historic document of profound significance and has established a model for solving problems between countries left behind by history. The signing of the joint declaration enabled bilateral relations between China and Portugal to enter a new stage. In March 1993, the First Session of the Eighth National People's Congress examined and passed the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administration Region of the PRC. The Basic Law is Macao's fundamental law and has fixed in legal form the Chinese Government's basic principles and policies toward Macao as explained in the Sino- Portuguese joint declaration. It provides concrete regulations for the main contents of Macao's social, political, economic, cultural and other fundamental systems and has been warmly welcomed and extensively supported by the Macao compatriots. Over the past seven years since the signing of the joint declaration, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Portugal have developed smoothly. In recent years, the mutual visits by the senior leaders of China and Portugal have forcefully promoted the development of bilateral relations as well as the friendly cooperation between China and Portugal on the Macao question. Both the Chinese and Portuguese sides have seriously implemented the joint declaration and have carried out very fruitful cooperation. The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group has held 19 plenary sessions and many expert conferences. Both sides have made headway in a series of problems faced by Macao during the transition period, such as language, public service, law, and Macao's bid to join the relevant international organizations; both sides also successfully solved the problems of financing the construction of the Macao International Airport and the domain of aviation agreement. In recent years, the completion of large projects in Macao one after another have injected new vigor into Macao's economic development. Macao enjoys social stability and economic development, and its residents live and work happily. The sincerity and friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Portuguese sides in implementing the joint declaration is the guarantee for maintaining Macao's stability and development. Seriously implementing the joint declaration and realizing Macao's steady transition and smooth transfer of power in 1999 are in the common interest of both China and Portugal. Practice has proven that cooperation is good for both the Chinese and Portuguese sides and is good for Macao as well. At present, Macao has approximately five years left in its transition period, and both the Chinese and Portuguese sides are facing some difficult tasks. As long as both sides set store for the overall situation of Macao's stability and development and consistently stick to close consultations and strengthen friendly cooperation, they can surely solve various problems arising from Macao's transition period and can create conducive conditions for Macao's steady transition and smooth transfer of power. We believe that, with friendly cooperation and common efforts by both the Chinese and Portuguese sides, Macao's steady transition and smooth transfer of power can surely be realized.
