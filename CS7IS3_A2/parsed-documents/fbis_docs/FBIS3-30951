Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina will send letters to the UN Security Council demanding international supervision of Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders with the aim of finding a peaceful solution. The two sides have agreed that the commanders of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, Ante Roso and Rasim Delic respectively, will meet over the next seven days to implement the agreement on an absolute cease-fire between the HVO and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army on all fronts as the first step in resolving all issues of interest to the Croat and Muslim peoples. [Begin recording] [Granic] We are deeply aware of the gravity of the problem, especially in the field. Therein lies the great importance of these meetings, because we discussed matters openly and reviewed all burning issues. As you can see, utmost priority has been given to ending all conflicts and exchanging prisoners as soon as possible. However, we also discussed all fundamental issues pertaining to overall Bosniak Muslim-Croat relations and the agreements reached so far. We will go on talking and we believe that we will be meeting again in the near future. [end recording] [passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Silajdzic] First, I must say that we held talks in a constructive atmosphere, in an encouraging atmosphere, if I can put it that way, about very difficult and complex issues. It is not that simple to find a solution. I think that the beginning was good. We agreed, among other things, to organize a meeting between military commanders within the next seven days to discuss a permanent cease-fire. We agreed that one of the main principles is the return to their homes of all refugees -- whenever it is possible to control this -- to talk seriously and to resume talks about the exchange of prisoners and of the Mostar group in particular. We also agreed to continue talks at all levels. [end recording] [passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Mile Akmadzic, minister for interrepublic cooperation of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, identified by caption] Under the auspices of cochairmen Lord Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg, we talked about the possibility of exchanging prisoners, restoring the energy-generating system in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and about humanitarian aid. However, the focus of today's talks was the massacre in Sarajevo and the ways of establishing who was responsible for it. [end recording] [Correspondent] The Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna delegation in the talks with the Muslims consisted of Ministers Akmadzic and Zubak and General Roso. After the agreement reached last night about relations that are to be based on a union of three republics and about the possibility of setting up counties, provinces, regions, and cantons on an ethnic principle within the republics and with a degree of autonomy, the Muslims are again asking for something quite the opposite. They came up with a proposal that failed to mention the republics in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and this is unacceptable to the Croats. Observers here think that the map by Komsic [Croat member of Bosnian Muslim delegation and member of Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency] is, among other things, a maneuver to gain time. The Muslims have put forward a proposal similar to the Vance-Owen plan under which the cantons or provinces -- whatever you want to call them -- can be formed on an ethnic principle. Some parts of the Komsic-Muslim proposal are unacceptable to the Croats and some parts are unrealistic, sources close to the delegation of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna said. Croats and others studied the proposed map of the cantons and reacted by saying that it had come too late. Among themselves the republics should talk about protecting national minorities. The best way of providing protection would be through cantons and counties within autonomous units. Any decision by the Serbs to leave the union would change the situation and more precise solutions would then be needed. Both the convention in Livno and the state of Croatia itself support the EU plan, which was also endorsed by President Clinton. President Clinton's envoy Redman and diplomat Tarnoff are expected with interest here in Geneva. The [Croat-Muslim] statement is of enormous importance at this time of pressure from the international community and on the eve of tomorrow's UN Security Council session on Bosnia-Herzegovina. It will help to create a climate more conducive to defusing the tension between Croats and Muslims.
