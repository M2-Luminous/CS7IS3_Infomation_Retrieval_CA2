The foreign policy course associated with the name of Andrey Kozyrev and broadly meeting with the support of Boris Yeltsin has apparently acquired a serious opponent in the shape of Viktor Chernomyrdin. Until now the only foreign policy issue to which the head of government has devoted attention has been the territorial dispute with Japan. On Tuesday, to the surprise of many, Chernomyrdin expressed his views on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, stating that Russia is categorically against Western air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions. These words were spoken several hours after a news conference given by Andrey Kozyrev at which the minister did not rule out air strikes against the Serbs, Croats, or Muslims, in the event of an attack by them on the UN peacekeeping forces. All the signs suggest that Chernomyrdin considered the stance of the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs insufficiently firm, and hastened to modify it. The foreign media reacted immediately to the prime minister's words, devoting lengthy commentaries to "the disagreements between Kozyrev and Chernomyrdin." Smolensk Square [site of RF Foreign Ministry] is not inclined to dramatize the situation. "I believe Chernomyrdin is not in possession of detailed information. In opposing the bombing of Serb positions he was evidently thinking of the `punitive strikes' for which some politicians in the West are calling. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly stated its negative attitude toward such plans. So there are no fundamental disagreements between the prime minister and the minister of foreign affairs," a high-ranking Russian diplomat believes. Nevertheless, Chernomyrdin's encroachment into the diplomatic sphere is an alarming signal for Andrey Kozyrev. It cannot be ruled out that the prime minister is already thinking about the 1996 presidential elections, in the runup to which he must present to voters not only an economic but also a foreign policy program. Since Chernomyrdin will most likely look to the conservative part of the electorate, it is logical to assume that his remarks will not infrequently differ from the views of the foreign minister and approach the stances of the national-communist majority in the Duma.
