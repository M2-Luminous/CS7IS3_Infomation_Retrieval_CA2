This is also a need of the people in building a "prosperous people and strong country." But enemies of the revolution and political malcontents and deviates are using this struggle to weaken the people's confidence and destabilize the country. They are making use of the widespread corruption and smuggling to "generalize," viewing all of our party and state organizations as "corrupt," and encouraging the "most depraved people, who can only cause destruction, to rebuild things." They do not accept the anticorruption and antismuggling struggle being carried on by the party and state. They are spreading distorted information, smearing the leading cadres of the party and state, and charging that those people are involved in corruption and smuggling. Unfortunately, their improper activities have temporarily shaken a number of people who lack accurate information and knowledge about the present situation and increased their dissatisfaction with life today. Those black arguments, which continue to be passed on "along the street," are causing confusion in public opinion. But the black clouds cannot obscure the sun. The entire world recognizes the important and positive achievements scored by our country in the renovation movement. There is no way that the enemy can refute that. Those achievements prove that most of our cadres and party members and most of our people are adhering firmly to the wonderful traditions and, for the people and country, are exploiting the advantages and struggling to overcome the shortcoming and weaknesses in order to ensure that the revolution continues to make great strides forward. Only a few cadres and party members, including a number of high-level cadres, are degraded, and they are gradually being purged. Because of this, we think that while we must resolutely and urgently promote the anticorruption and antismuggling struggle, we must also heighten vigilance and promptly block the actions of the enemy and malcontents who are making use of this struggle to destroy the country. To do this: Maintaining political stability today must be regarded as the leading task in building a "prosperous people and strong country." The main thing is to stabilize the feelings of the people and not allow the enemy and malcontents to start a "psychological war." When propagandizing the anticorruption and anti-smuggling struggle, the mass means of information must also give attention to exposing the actions of the enemy who are misusing that struggle to stir up trouble and ruin things so that they cannot make use of the loopholes in the contents and methods of implementation. The party committee echelons must monitor things and adhere to public opinion in order to promptly implement suitable propaganda policies and actively prevent the various types of "psychological warfare" from doing any damage. Having doubts and fearing that blocking the counterpropaganda arguments will "hinder democracy" are misconceptions about democracy. Such doubts and fears represent a failure to distinguish clearly between the legitimate aspirations of the people and the plots of the enemy and arguments of the malcontents. The judicial organizations must promptly find and prosecute those who are intentionally distorting the truth with the aim of tarnishing the reputation of the honest people in the party leadership and administrative organizations and disrupting the building of the country or who are intentionally publishing illegal materials. Disrupting the stability of the country and destroying the people's confidence in the revolution can sometimes do greater damage than the material value of many cases of corruption and smuggling added together. The party and state must constantly elevate the principle of democratic centralism. Cadres and party members must make an effort to maintain a concept of organization and discipline and be on guard against the "psychological warfare" and other destructive plots of the enemy. They must not speak in an unprincipled manner or in ways that unintentionally aid the enemy. A number of people are still uncertain about the the term unprincipled "freedom, openness, and democracy." They do not realize that this is the weapon that enemies and reactionaries are using to attack the party in power. We have many good lessons to help us be aware of these plots and prevent them from interfering with the implementation of the present struggle against negative aspects.
