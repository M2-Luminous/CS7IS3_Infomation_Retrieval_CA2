He said that the country has already crossed the line dividing the old and new political, social and economic systems. To put it in medical terminology, the operation is over, but the patient may be still be in a rehabilitation center curing his muscles, Klaus added. He predicted a 2-3 percent economic growth for the Czech Republic this year. Inflation is expected to decrease to a one-digit rate, which would be the first case in postcommunist Europe, Klaus said and added that unemployment would probably slightly grow above the present 3.5 percent. He said that the Czech Republic did not need foreign loans, but on the contrary, the influx of foreign capital hampers currency policy management.
