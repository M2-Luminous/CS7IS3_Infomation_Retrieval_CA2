This was stated in an exclusive telephone interview conducted by the MBC center today. In the beginning we asked al-Bid about the reasons for the failure of all the cease-fire agreements. [Al-Bid] The leadership in Sanaa has chosen the course of war. It insists on not stopping the war [words indistinct]. Therefore, it only resorts to this course to achieve its objective. However, this is a dead end and they cannot achieve anything. [Tannuri] The UN Security Council denounced the northern shelling of south Yemen. The Council might issue a resolution on sending UN forces to Yemen. What is your stand on this? [Al-Bid] We always support international legitimacy. We supported Security Council Resolution 924. We will always support international legitimacy because we aspire to stability and peace for us and for everyone. However, we do not expect Sanaa to respond positively. The mentality of the leadership in Sanaa is different. We highly appraise the recent U.S. position which contains a clear warning. However, we hope this will be followed by tangible steps that will translate words on paper into real action. I believe the Sanaa regime will not stop. [words indistinct] What does 'Ali 'Abdallah want to do to Yemen? [Tannuri] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, do you have any indications that some states will recognize your declared state? [Al-Bid] Regarding recognition, we are there on the spot. We are fighting for the third month. [words indistinct] We are there. Our relations and contacts are continuing with several fraternal and friendly states. I am confident that the world will deal with reality. This steadfast people in Aden and all the parts of the Democratic Republic of Yemen deserve recognition. They will acquire recognition deservedly through more steadfastness and sacrifice.
