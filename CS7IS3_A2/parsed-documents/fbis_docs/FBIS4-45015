The Israel government has offered its expertise and technical know-how for sealing the border and high mountain passes along the line of control (LOC) in the Kashmir valley. Highly-placed defence sources said here today that a proposal to this effect was lying with the Indian government and a final decision was likely to be taken after the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, returned from his visit to the United States. The sources said the proposal had already been studied by de fence experts and the home ministry was likely to make a final draft for putting up before the Union cabinet. A team of Israeli defence experts was also likely to visit India in this regard in the near future, the sources said. The proposal envisages sealing in patches nearly 600 km of border stretch along the tough terrain of the valley. The Israelis have offered to install electronic wiring system with alarm and beeper signals which would detect human movement. The sources said the electronic signal system would be put on ground along the line of control and whenever there was an infiltration bid by the militants, the alarm would go off giving indications and quick reaction time to the security forces to deal with the intruders. They said if the proposal comes through and is put into action before the month of June, it would prove to be a "death blow" to the inter services intelligence [ISI] plans for massive infiltration along the LOC. If an agreement is made, it would be the first defence tie-up between India and Israel after both countries established diplomatic relations. The sources said intelligence and army had received quite a few authentic reports that the ISI was planning to send in only foreign mercenaries during the summer season. The sources said three regular battalions of Afghan mujahideens were being raised by ISI at Muzafarabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. They were being provided with the latest weaponry for infiltration The sources said they were waiting across the border along the LOC looking for the right moment to slip into the Indian side with a large cache of arms. The decision to send in Afghan veterans for fighting security forces in Kashmir had two reasons. One, the ISI is finding it difficult to motivate the local Kashmiri youth to come across the border and join the militant ranks. The second is that the ISI feels that the level of violence needs to be stepped up and for that the Afghan mujahideens, who had a reputation for being ruthless, would take over the leadership of militants and go in for massive destruction of life and property.
