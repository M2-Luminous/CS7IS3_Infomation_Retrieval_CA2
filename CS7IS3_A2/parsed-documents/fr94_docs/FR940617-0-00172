FR940617-0-00172 FR940617-0-00026 Subpart D_Emission Test Equipment Provisions §89.301&hyph;96 Scope; applicability. (a) This subpart describes the equipment required in order to perform exhaust emission tests on new nonroad compression-ignition engines subject to the provisions of subpart B of part 89. (b) Exhaust gases, either raw or dilute, are sampled while the test engine is operated using an 8-mode test cycle on an engine dynamometer. The exhaust gases receive specific component analysis determining concentration of pollutant, exhaust volume, the fuel flow, and the power output during each mode. Emission is reported as grams per kilowatt hour (g/kw-hr). See subpart E of this part for a complete description of the test procedure. (c) General equipment and calibration requirements are given in §89.304&hyph;96 through 89.324&hyph;96. Sections 89.325&hyph;96 through 89.331&hyph;96 set forth general test specifications. (d) Additional information about system design, calibration methodologies, and so forth, for raw gas sampling can be found in part 86, subpart D of this chapter. Examples for system design, calibration methodologies, and so forth, for dilute exhaust gas sampling can be found in part 86, subpart N of this chapter. §89.302&hyph;96 Definitions. The definitions in subpart A of part 89 apply to this subpart. For terms not defined in part 89, the definitions in part 86, subparts A, D, I, and N apply to this subpart. The following definition also applies to this subpart. Specific emissions, g/kW-hr, is expressed on the basis of observed gross brake power. When it is not possible to test the engine in the gross conditions, for example, if the engine and transmission form a single integral unit, the engine may be tested in the net condition. Power corrections from net to gross conditions will be allowed with prior approval of the Administrator. §89.303&hyph;96 Symbols/abbreviations. (a) The abbreviations in §86.094&hyph;3 or part 89.3 of this chapter apply to this subpart. (b) The abbreviations in Table 1 in appendix A of this subpart apply to this subpart. Some abbreviations from § 89.3 have been included for the convenience of the reader. (c) The symbols in Table 2 in appendix A of this subpart apply to this subpart. §89.304&hyph;96 Equipment required for gaseous emissions; overview. (a) All engines subject to this subpart are tested for exhaust emissions. Engines are operated on dynamometers meeting the specification given in §89.306&hyph;96. (b) The exhaust is tested for gaseous emissions using a raw gas sampling system as described in §89.412&hyph;96 or a constant volume sampling (CVS) system as described in §89.419&hyph;96. Both systems require analyzers (see paragraph (c) of this section) specific to the pollutant being measured. (c) Analyzers used are a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) absorption type for carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide analysis; paramagnetic (PMD), zirconia (ZRDO), or electrochemical type (ECS) for oxygen analysis; a heated flame ionization (HFID) type for hydrocarbon analysis; and a chemiluminescent detector (CLD) or heated chemiluminescent detector (HCLD) for oxides of nitrogen analysis. Sections 89.309&hyph;96 through 89.324&hyph;96 set forth a full description of analyzer requirements and specifications. §89.305&hyph;96 Equipment measurement accuracy/calibration frequency. The accuracy of measurements must be such that the maximum tolerances shown in Table 3 in appendix A of this subpart are not exceeded. Calibrate all equipment and analyzers according to the frequencies shown in Table 3 in Appendix A of this subpart. §89.306&hyph;96 Dynamometer specifications and calibration weights. (a) Dynamometer specifications. The dynamometer test stand and other instruments for measurement of power output must meet the accuracy and calibration frequency requirements shown in Table 3 in appendix A of this subpart. The dynamometer must be capable of performing the test cycle described in §89.410&hyph;96.
