The Balladur government states that Paris is acting for purely humanitarian reasons. And that France has an obligation to intervene due to its traditional links with Africa, and because nobody else looks to do anything. The latter argument cannot be easily brushed aside. What has happened in Rwanda over recent weeks is appalling. But no other country, no other body, seems prepared to become involved in this hornets' nest. Preparations to form a new force of blue helmets drag on. It is indeed the case that it is France or nobody at the present point in time. But the doubt remains. A doubt which is broadly based on two kinds of consideration. The first is pragmatic. Do the risks Paris is taking weigh up against the possible benefits? The second is political. Nobody believes that France is going to Rwanda for purely humanitarian reasons. At another level, considerations of a totally different nature are also playing a role. Quite unashamedly, France has long been pursuing power politics in Africa. It is above all on the basis of this clear presence in Africa that Paris is seeking to confirm its role as a "power." The operation in Rwanda is quite clearly also intended to defend and reinforce this role. The fact that Rwanda is a former Belgian and not a French colony is beside the point. Belgium set aside any colonial ambitions -- insofar as it ever had any -- at the time of the first colonial troubles in 1960. It is likely that France will take advantage of its temporarily increased military presence in the region to finish off a couple of odd jobs that it prefers not to see exposed to broad daylight. The claim that France, or at least French mercenaries, were involved in shooting down the plane carrying the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi remains unproven at present. But there are strong suspicions that the French still have men on the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] side of the front lines. More important than any of this is the question as to whether the benefits of the French operation will outweigh the costs, and not only in terms of soldiers' lives. France readily uses its legendary Foreign Legion forces for operations of this kind, and the life of an anonymous "legionnaire" is less politically costly than that of a soldier in the regular forces. One man who is certainly going to help spin the "turquoise" web is Mobutu Sese Seko. The French right has recently been buttering up the Zairian president. This has been made all the easier due to the poor performance of the opposition in Kinshasa. The fact that the French have to make use of their treaties with Zaire in order to implement their humanitarian operation can of course only further strengthen the president's diplomatic hand. RPF spokesmen rightly point out the possible consequences of the French operation for stability in the [Zairian] Kivu province and in Burundi in particular. The operation could provoke both Hutu and Tutsi extremists in this neighboring country to insane actions. At the same time, there is something squalid and perverse in the way the RPF is able to present itself as an African version of the Salvation Army. Many media people -- out of revulsion at the extent of the slaughter by Hutu extremists -- completely ignore the disastrous role the RPF played in upsetting the balance in Rwanda. In assessing the disaster that now afflicts Rwanda, there is an inclination to pass all too lightly over the fact that it was the RPF which, in October 1990, attacked a country where a tentative start to democratization was already under way. And that this aggression was only possible thanks to the full support of neighboring Uganda.
