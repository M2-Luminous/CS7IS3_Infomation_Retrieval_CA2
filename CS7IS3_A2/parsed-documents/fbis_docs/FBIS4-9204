Gazde: "Inaugural Congress of HSLS (Croatian Social-Liberal Party) for Split-Dalmatia Zupanija: A Year of Peace for Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia!"] [Text] The chairman of the Croatian liberals, Drazen Budisa, emphasized at the congress that there is certainly no Croatian political party that will not wholeheartedly support the recently signed document on a Croatian-Bosnian federation; 1994 is a year of peace for both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, because there is real hope that the temporarily occupied Croatian territory will be reintegrated into the Republic of Croatia [RH]. "There is certainly no Croatian political party that will not wholeheartedly support the recently signed document on a Croatian-Bosnian federation," the chairman of the Croatian liberals, Drazen Budisa, said at the inaugural congress of the HSLS [Croatian Social-Liberal Party] for Split-Dalmatia Zupanija on Saturday, adding that he believes that the HSLS assembly scheduled for May will be held under conditions of peace. According to Budisa, 1994 is a year of peace for both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, because there is real hope that the temporarily occupied Croatian territory will be reintegrated into the Republic of Croatia. Drazen Budisa sees the reality of these hopes in the efforts by the great powers to solve the territorial problem of the former Yugoslavia through political means; paraphrasing U.S. President Clinton concerning "building destroyed bridges, but also bridges between people," Budisa noted that there should be support for the expressed flexibility of the Croatian political leadership which, Budisa reminded, recently adopted in the Croatian Assembly a declaration on foreign policy with a different approach. Thus, there can also be no talk of "continuity in policy," because the viability of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state was questioned. Emphasizing his conviction that the Bosnian-Croatian federation will be joined by Bosnian Serbs as well, Budisa added that it is necessary to wait before building a confederation between the RH and the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, because even without a confederal framework, good political, economic, and other relations can be developed. In Budisa's opinion, what has happened is not a new Yalta in this region; indeed, international players, especially the United States and Russia, are trying to stop the war, and he noted that it is realistic to expect pressure from Moscow on the Bosnian Serbs to join the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. "Responsibility for the fighting between Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina is shared by Croatia, because we in the HSLS have long said that this senseless and unnecessary fighting should be avoided. Thus, in order to introduce the principle of responsibility for wrong assessments and policies to Croatian political life, I believe that the question of political responsibility for this fighting as well must be placed on the agenda," Drazen Budisa asserted, suggesting that the liberals include the signing of the Geneva document on normalizing relations with Serbia as one of the wrong moves. Explaining that the HSLS considers that move premature, the leader of the Croatian liberals asserted that they are in favor of the best possible relations with neighbors, but only after the Serbo-Montenegrin federation recognizes Croatia's internationally recognized borders. As far as the liberals' organizational structure is concerned, Budisa announced that branches of the HSLS will be founded in Croat cantons of the future federation as well, because during the war such a move, he says, would have contributed to the chaos. In Croatia, the liberals are already organized by zupanija, and Budisa noted that there will be no radical changes in the party. Candidacies will be announced by the end of April, and besides his own candidacy for president, each member of the HSLS has the right to run for office. Complementing his party colleagues "for being in the good company of honorable and capable people," Budisa said that "attempts to destroy the party from within will not succeed." At the same time, the inaugural congress of the liberals of Split-Dalmatia Zupanija did not get a leader of its own. The votes of those in attendance were evenly divided between Ante Beljan (Trogir) and Niksa Viskovic (Makarska), so that until new elections are held the duties of chairman of the HSLS Zupanija Committee will be performed by vice chairman Ante Skeljo, who received the largest number of votes of support. Also elected as vice presidents were Edo Boban, Josko Dujmov, and Roko Vuletic, while the secretary is Petar Krolo and the treasurer is Marija Stambuk. The gathering of the zupanija's liberals was also greeted by Split Mayor Nikola Grabic, who acquainted the attendees with the difficulties the city faces in articulating its policy, since all that remains of the proclaimed local self-rule is a few words on paper. He also emphasized that he expects support from the zupanija level because, he said, he hopes that this dimension of political support will be a critical factor in the upcoming elections. The HSLS zupanija congress was also attended by representatives of the HSS [Croatian Peasant Party], the HNS [Croatian People's Party], and the SDP [Party of Democratic Changes], who also greeted their colleagues, whereby Josko Kovac (HSS) noted that there are 53 registered parties in Croatia, but only three of them came to greet the liberals. Endorsing cooperation with the liberals, with whom an coalition election victory was won in Split, Miro Granic (HNS) asserted that this success would be repeated on the zupanija level as well. Also participating in the HSLS congress were Goran Granic, Damir Zoric, Tereza Ganza-Aras, and HSLS Assembly deputies.
