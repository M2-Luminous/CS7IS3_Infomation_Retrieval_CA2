They said that the foreign ministers of Syria, Egypt, and Yemen, who are now in Cairo to attend the Arab League Council's meeting, will, after the Arab League meetings, hold talks to redefine the framework for future action. Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih held a closed meeting in Damascus last Thursday. They discussed Yemeni developments and ways of ending the disputes and restoring stability to the state of unity. It was not known what agreement was reached by the two presidents and there was no indication of their future plans. Yemeni sources, however, have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that, during his visit to Damascus, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih tried to "break the ice" between him and Syria and to regain Syria's trust after the position he took during the Gulf war. His closed meeting with President al-Asad lasted one and a half hours. The talks were frank and in depth. Yemeni opposition sources said that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih realized the terrible mistake he made when supporting Saddam Husayn during the invasion and the Gulf war, and he has been trying to restore confidence and understanding with the states which supported Kuwait. They added that none of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] members attended the Syrian-Yemeni meetings despite the official announcement -- according to the list sent from Yemen -- that YSP Political Bureau Member and Fish Resources Minister Fadl Muhsin would be a member of the Yemeni delegation. The sources said that the Syrian move coincided with a similar Egyptian move on Yemen, with Gulf support based on confidence in these two states and the fact that neither has any ambitions in Yemen. President Hafiz al-Asad might invite President Salih, Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and other leaders to Damascus for a dialogue to end the crisis. Al-Bid had himself expressed support for such a move. Syria and Egypt are expected to uphold the Pledge and Accord Document and act as a third-party witness to that. Diplomatic sources believe that Syria and Egypt might, with Arab League approval, send military forces to Yemen in the event of a threat of a military explosion and partition there. They add that the Yemeni parties would be well advised to take this matter into consideration and show commitment to stability in Yemen. They sources also say that President al-Asad has so far been focusing on restoring trust between the Yemeni parties and finding common grounds for understanding among them on the way to ending the crisis.
