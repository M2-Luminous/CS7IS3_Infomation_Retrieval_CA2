FR941212-2-00036 FR941212-2-00031 7. The Sponsor believes that the operation and implementation of the deferred sales charge program will be disclosed adequately to potential investors as well as unitholders. The prospectus for each Series will describe the operation of the deferred sales charge, including the amount of and date of each installment payment. The prospectus also will contain disclosure pertaining to the trustee's ability to sell portfolio securities if the income generated by a Series' portfolio is insufficient to pay an installment. The securities confirmation statement sent by the Sponsor to each purchaser will state the amount of the ``up-front'' sales charge, if any, and the amount of the deferred sales charge to be deducted in regular installments. The annual report of each Series will state the amount of annual installment payments deducted during the previous fiscal year on both a per Trust and per Unit basis. 8. The maximum sales charge on Units acquired in the secondary market normally ranges from 5.75% to 3% of the public offering price of the Units. The Prior Orders permit applicants to allow unitholders to exchange Units of one Series for Units of another Series subject to an additional sales charge not to exceed 2% of the public offering price of the acquired Units. The additional sales charge is calculated as the greater of (a) a flat fee, or (b) if Units of any Series are exchanged within five months of their acquisition for Units of a Series with a higher sales charge, an amount which, together with the sales charge already paid on the Units being exchanged, equals the normal sales charge on the acquired Units. 9. Applicants seek to amend the Prior Orders to permit offers of exchange of Units subject to a deferred sales charge. If Units subject to a deferred sales charge are exchanged for Units of a Series not having a deferred sales charge, the deferred sales charge will be collected at the time of the exchange. If Units subject to a deferred sales charge are exchanged for Units of a Series having a deferred sales charge, installment payments will continue to be deducted from the distributions on the acquired Units until the original balance of the sales charge owed on the initial investment has been collected. In either case, the additional sales charge permitted under the Prior Orders will be imposed at the time of the exchange. 10. The Sponsor offers certain Series which have short-term stated maturities. Upon termination of such Series, the Sponsor may create a new Series with the same investment objective and the same type of portfolio securities as the terminating Series. Applicants wish to make Units of the new Series available to the unitholders of the terminating Series at the net asset value of the new Units plus the reduced sales charge permitted under the Prior Orders (the ``Rollover Option''). Although applicants believe that the Prior Orders already permit the Rollover Option, they request that the Prior Orders be amended to cover the Rollover Option explicitly.
