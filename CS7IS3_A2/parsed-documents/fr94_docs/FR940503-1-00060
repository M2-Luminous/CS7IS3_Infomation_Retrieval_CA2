FR940503-1-00060 FR940503-1-00012 40 CFR Part 80 [AMS&hyph;FRL&hyph;4879&hyph;7] RIN 2060&hyph;AF13 Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Individual Foreign Refinery Baseline Requirements for Reformulated Gasoline AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The EPA is proposing to amend the reformulated gasoline regulations to define criteria and procedures by which foreign refiners establish individual refinery baselines that reflect the properties and volume of the gasoline that was produced at a foreign refinery in 1990 and imported for use within the United States. EPA is seeking comments on a wide range of matters in this proposal, including the air quality effects of the proposed approach. Where the requisite showing is made through a petition process, importers of reformulated gasoline produced at the foreign refinery would be allowed to use the individual foreign refinery baseline values to demonstrate compliance with the reformulated gasoline standards with regard to gasoline produced at that foreign refinery and imported into the United States only during the period 1995 through 1997 and only up to a volume of gasoline each year that equals the foreign refinery's 1990 import volume, and subject to certain limitations and conditions that are proposed as well. This amendment would allow imported reformulated gasoline to be evaluated relative to individual refinery baselines in a manner that is similar to that applicable to reformulated gasoline produced at domestic refineries. Individual foreign refinery baselines could be used only with reformulated gasoline under this proposal, and such baselines could not be used with conventional gasoline. EPA specifically states that it seeks comments on the proposed approach for foreign refinery baselines and on any underlying assumptions, as well as any other options for regulating imported reformulated gasoline that would be fair to all regulated parties and would achieve the environmental benefits intended for reformulated gasoline by the Clean Air Act. DATES: The comment period will close on June 23, 1994. EPA will hold a public hearing on this proposal on May 23, 1994, beginning at 10 a.m. ADDRESSES: Send comments to Public Docket A&hyph;94&hyph;25 at the address below.
