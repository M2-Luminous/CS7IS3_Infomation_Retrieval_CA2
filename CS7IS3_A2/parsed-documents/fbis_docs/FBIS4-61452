He balloted for the legislature seat in the Cherkassk constituency No. 427 in which the runoff was held on 3 April. When the results of all the Ukrainian runoffs were known, our reporter met with People's Deputy Yuriy Mykhaylovich Karasyk. [Kozoris] Yuriy Mykhaylovich, I prepared a traditional question for you: With what are you going to begin your deputy's activities? [Karasyk] I have already met with some deputies-agrarians. We are drafting a package of documents which will foster the work of the agricultural sector. First of all, these are documents on taxation because a value-added tax is a regular element in the processes of production, processing, and realization of agricultural products. In fact, taxation in the agricultural sector should encourage neither production, nor the budget, but the producer and the consumer. Experience shows that it should be flexible, and dependent on volumes of production and sales of products. However, our taxation is stable, agricultural products are not in demand (because people cannot buy them), and this triggers a drop in production. The second block of issues is as follows. People's Deputy Viktor Martynovych Kalnyk, deputy minister of economy, and I are drafting a price formulating mechanism. It is closely connected with taxation. The third package regards our credit policy. I can say that a single document on taxation, crediting, and price formation is being drafted. This package also includes proposals on the banking sector, first and foremost, on the setting up of a land bank which will service enterprises and persons representing all forms of ownership in the production sector. Now about the work in the new legislature. We know how many socialists and Rukh members it has. I can only pin hopes on that -- irrespective of what parties and movements are represented in the Supreme Council -- their representatives will be sane enough to unite their efforts on economic issues. Professionalism must unite us. [Kozoris] The new legislature will be professional. Will you drop your ministerial post or unite your ministerial and legislative work? [Karasyk] It is up to the Supreme Council. A new government will also be formed in line with the Supreme Council's decisions. If I suit the governmental team as minister of agriculture and food, then I will consult my voters in what post I will be of more use both to them and to the state. [Kozoris] Many newly elected deputies said during the election campaigns that they will come to the legislature with their teams. Have you your own team in the Supreme Council? [Karasyk] Our team will be the most numerous among the ministries in the new legislature. Five newly elected deputies come from the central state bodies: My three deputy ministers, the head of the concern "Ukragrotekhservis," and myself. Therefore, if you ask about a team, we have it. For example, Oleksandr Borovyk, chairman of the All-Ukrainian Council of Kolkhozes [KSP], KSP Chairman from Kiev Danilenko, and a range of other leaders of agricultural enterprises. In my opinion, we have the proper agrarian team. [Kozoris] Is newly elected People's Deputy Oleksandr Tkachenko, former Ukrainian minister of agriculture, also a member of your team? [Karasyk] In my opinion, Tkachenko suits our team professionally. We could have different political standpoints, however, from the point of view of professionalism, he should be a member of the agrarian team. [Kozoris] Why did I ask you this question? Currently, some politicians issue statements regarding the existence of at least two groups of agrarians -- Karasyk's and Tkachenko's -- in the legislature. [Karasyk] This will be our greatest problem. If agrarians begin setting up separate groups, this will cause a deadlock. Then we should lay down the office not to make people laugh. Given the current situation, we should drop our ambitions and assess objectively the life, and political and economic developments. Eventually, legislative deputies should work and not rally. [Kozoris] Yuriy Mykhaylovich, you are an expert of, let us simply put it, the old Supreme Council. It also did not suffer from a lack of kolkhoz chairmen and experienced agrarians. Why did their activity not have a positive effect on our agricultural sector? [Karasyk] Experience shows that the Supreme Council only dealt with adopting laws, the executive bodies did not live up to our expectations, and we missed the mechanism of the implementation of laws. I believe that the laws should be adopted together with a mechanism for their implementation, and they should be economically grounded to avoid the adoption of populist laws. It is better to tell people the truth, however, this truth should make people believe in the necessity of adopting corresponding laws. I do not blame the old Supreme Council, because, to blame, one should first try to work there. We aimed to become Supreme Council deputies to work. [Kozoris] When can we expect real changes in the Ukrainian agrarian sector? [Karasyk] I believe that in two or three years, the situation in the agrarian sector will become stable.
