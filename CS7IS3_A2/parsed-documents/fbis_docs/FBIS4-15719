ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Spain. The newspaper points out that the Spanish journalists, upon the arrival of President Boris Yeltsin in Spain on Monday, drew the attention of their Russian counterparts to the fact that a Russo- Spanish treaty of friendship and cooperation would be signed in Moncloa Palace where the Moncloa Pact had been signed. The pact "made it possible to take Spain out of the crisis and lay foundations of civil peace". We hope, they said, that an agreement on achieving civil accord in Russia, which is to be signed in Moscow on Yeltsin's initiative, "also has a chance to go down in the history of the motherland". RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on the bombing of Serbian positions in the area of Gorazde by U.S. F-16 jetfighters: "As Russia begins to play an increasingly active diplomatic role in the Balkans, the Western countries' attitude to the Serbs grows tougher. "This time Russia has been confronted with an acomplished fact, for fear, probably, that a military conflict would be prevented diplomatically with her help. "Some people do not like, apparently, that Russia ceases to be an obedient executor of Western countries' decisions and tries to play solo in the diplomatic orchestra". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (Independent Newspaper) on Russia's not being consulted about air strikes in Gorazde area. "The failure to consult with Russia prior to the delivery of an air strike fits quite well into an increasingly distinct new U.S. attitude towards her. Nevertheless, no one, it seems, is in a hurry to write off her role in a settlement of the Balkan conflict". TRUD and PRAVDA quote Yeltsin as saying at Vnukovo Airport prior to departure for Spain that "I insisted and continue to insist that such matters as the bombing of Serbian positions should not be decided upon without prior consultations between the United States and Russia".
