He answered: "It is inappropriate to set specific numerical targets." Commenting on this at a news conference on the evening of 8 March, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said: "The prime minister and I share the same view that setting numerical targets is very difficult. However, it is unnecessary to assert that it will never happen (for Japan to set numerical targets). Mr. Hosokawa has not yet made a final decision." Takemura then added: "Current account surplus bears more uncertain factors than any other economic indexes. At least, Japan should not set numerical targets as a pledge to the international community and make a commitment to the United States." Takemura's remark indicates that although Japan should never commit to Washington about setting numerical targets to reduce its current account surplus, it is possible that it will voluntarily set targets for reducing the surplus.
