On April 4, Libya and Chad signed an agreement concerning the practical modalities for the implementation of the judgment delivered by the international court of justice regarding the Aouzou strip. They agreed that the withdrawal of Libyan administration and troops from Aouzou should start on April 15, under the supervision of a mixed team of 25 Chadian officers, 25 Libyan officers and UN observers. Butrus-Ghali wrote to the Security Council Wednesday on his intention to send a reconnaissance team to the area to conduct a survey of conditions on the ground for the possible deployment of UN observers to monitor the Libyan withdrawal. Noting that the team would travel to Libya by UN aircraft, the Security Council decided that paragraph 4 of Resolution 748, which imposed sanctions, including aviation embargo, on Libya, should not apply in respect of the UN aircraft flying to or from Libya for the purpose of conveying the team. Resolution 748 was adopted in March 1992 because of Libya's refusal to hand over to the United States and Britain two Libyan suspects for the Pan Am jet bombing over Scotland in 1988 which killed 270 people.
