Kim Yong-sun, who was sacked as a candidate Politburo member in December, has been placed in charge of affairs with the United States, the sources said. Kim met with U.S. Undersecretary of State Arnold Kanter in New York in January 1992 for the highest level contact ever between the two nations to discuss concerns arising from North Korea's suspected program to develop an atomic arsenal. North Korea and the U.S. held two rounds of talks at the vice ministerial level last June and July aimed at resolving the impasse over international inspections of North Korea's suspected nuclear facilities. Pyongyang has indicated a desire to upgrade the contacts after the third round meeting, which has not yet been held. Kim, who has served in a number of foreign relations positions in the Workers Party and in the government over the years, was removed as a candidate Politburo member in a party reshuffle last month. Meanwhile, the vice chairman for the party's section on reunification of the Korean peninsula, Kang Chu-il, was placed in charge of working-level affairs with South Korea, which had been directed by Kim, the sources said. They expected little change in Pyongyang's South Korea policies in the wake of Kang's appointment. With the recent political revival of Kim Yong-chu, the younger brother of North Korean President Kim Il-song, there have been reports that the younger Kim would have a special hand in South Korean affairs.
