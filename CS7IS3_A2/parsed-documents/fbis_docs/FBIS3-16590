According to Askar Akayev's expert on world politics, the possibility of his country's joining the program is being studied, and "the approach to it is very cautious," since Bishkek is bound by its commitments in the framework of collective security treaties signed with CIS countries. As INTERFAX learned from the chief of the Kyrgyz Defence Ministry's press center, Lt.-Colonel Akzhal Isayev, his ministry has not determined its attitude to the NATO program yet, since the military are not acquainted with it.
