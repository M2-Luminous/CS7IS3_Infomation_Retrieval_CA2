The meeting is hosted by the Iraqi Teachers' Union and will last five days. The President leader Saddam Husayn deputized Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan to attend the council meetings on his behalf. Upon the arrival of the vice president, the band played the national anthem. The council meeting opened with a recital from the Koran and an invocation in memoriam for our and the Arab nation's martyrs. This was followed by a speech by the vice president. He said: "I have the pleasure to act on behalf of President leader Saddam Husayn, may God preserve, in opening the meetings of the Arab Teachers' Union Council. I have the pleasure of conveying to you the greetings of his excellency and his wishes to you and for the success of your conference." The president's representative added: "Convening your conference in Baghdad, the Baghdad of Arabism and victory, during the critical times your nation is passing through, abounds with evidence and proof that confirms that the sons of Arabism always rally in support of their lofty national objectives in which they believed, adhered to, and struggled for their sakes throughout the ages. All the treasonous and treacherous methods have failed to thwart them, nor aggression and betrayal did. On the contrary, the wider the circle of treason and conspiracy becomes the more resolved and the stronger they become. Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan added: "The enemies, the Zionists, the imperialists, and the henchmen from among some of the traitorous Arab rulers and midgets believe that stepping up their conspiracies and aggression against Arab nations will achieve their ulterior objectives and designs for them. These people have forgotten that they all have joined hands against one particular Arab country, namely strong and powerful Iraq, in order to obstruct its path and inhibit its leadership." He said that they believe that destroying all the economic, educational, service, cultural, and social structures, which the Iraqi people have built will break their resolve and will force them to abandon their principles and raise their hands in surrender. He added: "It would perhaps benefit your conference to become acquainted with President leader Saddam Husayn's personal interest in teachers' affairs and the educational sector, beginning with kindergarten and ending with university. It is also to get acquainted with the resolutions passed by the leadership providing benefits for the teachers and university professors in order to raise the educational standards of schools and universities and realize a compressive educational progress. This is in addition to creating the right educational atmosphere for our students. It is to be borne in mind that the conditions of the siege and its difficulties did not diminish the concern to continue to promote education and knowledge." The secretary-general of the Arab Teachers' Union made a speech in which he said: Your brother members of the Central Council of the Arab Teachers' Union are honored to be holding their meeting on this pure soil, the soil of proud Iraq, the Baghdad of Arabism, and the Baghdad of challenge under the banner "God is great." He added: "Your brother teachers throughout the Arab arena have stood with you in support of your cause, which is the cause of us all. Iraq has been the target of treacherous aggression by 30 countries [al-thalathini, reference to coalition forces] and of the shameful stands the Security Council adopted against Iraq with its unjust and iniquitous resolutions against the steadfast Iraqi people." Fahd al-Shakrah, chairman of the National Union of Iraqi students, made a speech on behalf of popular organizations welcoming the Arab teachers participating in the conference. He wished the conference success in the country of the triumphant leader Saddam Husayn. He was followed by Hatim al-'Ukaydi, doyen of Iraqi teachers, in which he said the glorious mother of battles will forever remain a bright page in our contemporary history. He added: "The educational sector in Iraq, Iraq of education, Iraq of knowledge, and Iraq of inspired leader Saddam Husayn, has enjoyed special care in that the great revolution has provided this important and vital sector with all the means of success and comprehensive scientific progress. It also charted a bright future for this proud nation." The republican anthem was then played marking the end of the opening ceremony of the conference. Separate meetings were then held. The first meeting was held last night to discuss research papers submitted to it. Those who attended the opening ceremony included heads of popular organizations, the governor of Baghdad, and a large number of teachers. 13305
