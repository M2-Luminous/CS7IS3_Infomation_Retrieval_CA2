The resolution -- based on a draft bill submitted by legislator Pedro Garcia Saavedra (NM-C90 [Change 90-New Majority Faction]) -- is divided into seven articles and three final and transitory clauses. The first article establishes that the registry will have an updated data base that will make it possible to identify and place the people arrested by Armed Forces and National Police members and by court order. Moreover, it is intended to adequately accompany all the steps of the legal process involving people subject to judicial investigation, including their imprisonment. The resolution states that the Attorney General's Office, which will be in charge of appointing the registry's executive director, is charged with organizing and administrating the registry. The second article states that the Interior and Defense Ministries, the Judicial Branch, and the National Prisons Institute will supply all the information required by the registry regarding detentions, investigations, and imprisonments. The third article states that any individual or institution has free access to the information contained in the registry. According to the approved text, a coordinating committee of the registry also is created. This committee will comprise two representatives from the Attorney General's Office -- one of whom will preside over the committee, and one representative each from the Justice, Interior, and Defense Ministries. The committee also will include a representative from the judicial branch and from the congressional Human Rights Committee. In its first transitory clause, the document states that the first stage of the registry will include information on individuals arrested on charges of terrorism and treason against the fatherland, the state, and the national defense. Finally, it is stated that the guidelines contained in the letter of understanding signed on 23 January 1992 by the Attorney General's Office, the Interior Ministry, AID, and the Latin American Institute for Crime Prevention and Treatment of Offenders will be followed in creating the registry.
