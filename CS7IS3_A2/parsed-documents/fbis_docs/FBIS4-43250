As these two pillars have been dealt a serious blow by the results of the European election, the system appears today on the verge collapse. Paradoxically enough, yesterday the Left could be made to look strong still if one referred to its performance in the European election of June 1989: 33.7 percent. And yet it never appeared more fragile, probably because of its fragmentation. A fragmentation that cannot be blamed solely on the presidential ambitions of the men leading its various lists -- "European Solidarity" [headed by PS Secretary General Michel Rocard], "Radical Energy" [Bernard Tapie], and even "Alternative Policy" [Jean-Pierre Chevenement]... -- but on significant differences in methods, rhetoric, and even platforms, to such an extent that one comes to wonder whether the Left remains a single entity or it has truly lost its cohesion. New Strategy Can this situation pave the way for [European Commission President] Jacques Delors' return, so often announced and postponed just as often? By claiming throughout the campaign that he would run for president "no matter the results on the evening of 12 June," Michel Rocard had finally impressed his determination on those who make up the very fabric of a Socialist Party that increasingly resembles the Radical-Socialist party of the early 1900's: the mayors. However, those Socialist leaders who were invited to attend a joint meeting with Michel Rocard and Jacques Delors at the Lutetia Hotel last Friday came out of it with the disquieting feeling that Michel Rocard had paled into a meek novice when faced with Jacques Delors' supreme determination and confidence. Worse for the former advocate of the "second Left": by proposing a "new alliance" as the campaign was nearing its end, he jeopardized the only structure he managed to build: the "Conference for Social Change." Bernard Tapie and Jean-Pierre Chevenement's negative answers were hardly a surprise for Socialist policy makers. However, the biting reply of Communist Party [PCF] Leader Robert Hue, who still has not been granted a meeting with Michel Rocard, does not bode well for the would-be alliance. And it is no secret that most Socialist and Communist leaders and elected officials have focusing on the May 1995 presidential election, and also (above all?) on the municipal election scheduled to take place shortly thereafter. What the mayors need is not so much a leader as a new strategy. The results of 12 June clearly showed that the Left cannot continue along the same road as the one followed by Michel Rocard, a leader discredited after the parliamentary election of March 1993. It is now too late to provoke a "big bang." Indeed, if there was one, it took place in the ballot box. Left-wing parties must now come up with something new. Who is to be their leader this time? Will it be with or without the party apparatus? Or with or without Bernard Tapie? The field is wide open for those who often chose to bet on imagination, but never has time been in such a short supply for them.
