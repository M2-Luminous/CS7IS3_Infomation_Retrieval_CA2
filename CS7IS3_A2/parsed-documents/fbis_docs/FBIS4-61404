Zaveryukha dismissed reports in the Western media of projected purchases of grain in the USA saying no talks had been held on this issue. According to his information, enterprises of Roskhleboprodukt stored 17 million tons of grain, while another 1.5 million tons may be purchased from domestic farmers. Therefore, given a monthly consumption of 2.8 million tons, the stocks will last for six months. Zaveryukha pointed out that the minimum purchases of grain would be made only for Russia's northern most regions and the Far East due to a high cost of shipping grain to the regions from Central Russia. However, these purchases, which have already amounted to about 200,000 tonnes, will be made exclusively on a commercial basis, without state participation. Moreover, Russia has already exported three million tons of last year's grain to neighboring republics. Zaveryukha established the fact that given average harvests of 100 million tons Russia was quite capable of providing itself with grain. At the same time, he refrained from prognosticating about the future harvest, because "much would depend on weather conditions." Over recent years, Russia has traditionally imported grain. In 1992, as many as 26 million tons were delivered to Russia, while in 1993 grain imports exceeded 10 million tons.
