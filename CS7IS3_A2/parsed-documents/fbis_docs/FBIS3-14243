Information Minister Michel Samahah, who announced the measures at the end of a five-hour cabinet meeting on Wednesday, accused Israel of colluding with Lebanese parties in a bid to destabilise Lebanon. The government charged that Israel was carrying out "terrorist activities in a bid to harm unity and peace in Lebanon, and the chances of peace in the region." Samahah said that the media ban would take effect from midnight Wednesday until the government can come up with a law to regulate the media in Lebanon. The cabinet would meet next Tuesday to discuss the legislation, he said. But until then news coverage would be strictly limited to state-run Radio Liban [Beirut Radio Lebanon] and Tele Liban. Radio and television stations that violate the ban will be shut down, Samahah said. The unprecedented moves came after Lebanese police arrested on Wednesday Fu'ad Malik, the second-in-command of the Lebanese Forces (LF), a militia disbanded at the end of the 1975-1990 war which had become a political party. Malik was taken into custody in connection with the bombing of a church last month in which 10 worshippers were killed. The judge investigating the attack identified seven other suspects as members of the LF. The measures amount to "an unofficial declaration of a state of emergency in the country," a government official told the independent Arabic-language newspaper AL-NAHAR. "It's a counter-coup to the coup which would have taken place if plans for destabilisation had been successful," he added. "Good for them. The Lebanese Forces made us cower in shelters for 20 years while they destroyed the country," a taxi driver said about the former militia's involvement in the Lebanese war. He also applauded the decision to ban private news program saying: "We've been poisoned by too many news bulletins each day, too many radios giving their opinion. It's just as well." But opposition MP Najah Wakim warned that he will try to fight the government's media ban, stressing that it was an infringement on political freedoms. "The right to broadcast news should not be confined to the state run media only. Every radio and television has the right to broadcast news," he said. The Lebanese press hailed the measures while Lebanon's 20 radio and television stations -- except for the pro-Israeli Voice of the South -- complied with the ban, which also covered political talk shows. LF radio, Voice of Free Lebanon [(Clandestine) Radio Free Lebanon], and their television, Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, broadcast music instead of its scheduled news bulletins. Sawt al-Sha'b [(Clandestine) Voice of the People], run by the Communist party, issued a statement saying it would abide by the ban but urged the authorities to take immediate steps to issue a law regulating the media in Lebanon. Authorities earlier this month lashed out against private stations for leaking findings of the investigation into the bombing of Our Lady of Deliverance church north of Beirut. They charged that some private media, which flourished during the country's civil war, were spreading rumors that it said could fan disputes between the country's Moslem and Christian communities.
