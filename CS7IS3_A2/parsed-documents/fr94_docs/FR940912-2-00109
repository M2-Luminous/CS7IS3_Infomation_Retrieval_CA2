FR940912-2-00109 FR940912-2-00074 Public Health Service National Toxicology Program; Announcement of Intent To Conduct Toxicological Studies of 22 Chemicals Request for Comments: As part of an effort to inform the public, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) routinely announces in the Federal Register the lists of chemicals for which it intends to conduct toxicological studies. This announcement will allow interested parties to comment and provide information on chemicals under consideration for short- and long-term toxicology and carcinogenesis studies. Chemical 1. Riddelliine (CAS No. 23246&hyph;96&hyph;0)_2-year studies via oral gavage in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. Riddelliine is a pyrrolizidine alkaloid found in plants of the genus Senecio in the Western United States. Riddelliine and other alkaloids in these plants if ingested in high quantities can cause the death of livestock, or may contaminate meat as a residue. Riddelliine may also contaminate commercial grains, milk and honey, and is found in some herbal teas. In NTP 90-day studies Riddelliine was found to cause hepatic toxicity in mice and rats and hepatic neoplasia in rats. Two-year carcinogenicity studies of standard design are proposed to determine the shape of the dose response curve for carcinogenicity in rats, and further evaluate the toxic and carcinogenic potential in mice. Chemical 2. Urethane/Ethanol mixture (CAS No. 51&hyph;79&hyph;6/64&hyph;17&hyph;5)_2-year studies via dosed-water in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. Urethane and ethanol are byproducts of fermentation and are commonly found in alcoholic beverages and in many foods. Urethane has been recognized as a rodent and Non-human primate carcinogen, while the International Agency for Research on Cancer has determined that alcoholic beverages are human carcinogens. Risk assessment efforts for urethane are complicated by information in the literature suggesting that the metabolism and perhaps the tumorigenicity of urethane might be inhibited by the co-presence of ethanol. NTP 13-week studies were inconclusive in demonstrating an effect of ethanol on urethane carcinogenesis. Two-year studies are planned to examine this issue further. The studies will include separate groups of male and female mice exposed to urethane, ethanol, or to several levels of urethane and ethanol in the drinking water. The studies will include an assessment of the toxicokinetics of urethane, with and without ethanol, following repeated dosing. Studies of urethane DNA adducts are planned to address the issue of the dosimetry of DNA alterations. Chemical 3. Urethane (CAS No. 51&hyph;79&hyph;6)_2 year studies via dosed-water in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. The studies planned for urethane are outlined in the plans for urethane/ethanol mixture studies described above. Chemical 4. Ethanol (CAS No. 64&hyph;17&hyph;5)_2-year studies via dosed-water in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. The studies planned for ethanol are outlined in the plans for urethane/ethanol mixture studies described above. Chemical 5. Dichlorodiphenyl sulfone (CAS No. 80&hyph;07&hyph;9)_2-year studies via dosed-feed in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. Dichlorodiphenyl sulfone is a component of high temperature plastics. Specific production figures are unknown, but the production of plastics made from dichlorodiphenyl sulfone and related monomers was over 1.5 billion pounds in 1988. Very little toxicology information is available on this chemical. One study reported liver and cardiac lesions in animals exposed to dichlorodiphenyl sulfone. A known inducer of cytochrome P450s, dichlorodiphenyl sulfone was shown to cause marked hepatomegaly in NTP prechronic studies. Other studies have shown facile oral absorption and a relatively simple metabolite pattern, as well as self induction of metabolism with repeated administration.
