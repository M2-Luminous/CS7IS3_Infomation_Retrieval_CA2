[Chanturia] It was our wish that a Georgian delegation should go to Geneva. Of course, we are not naive and did not expect that, as a result of these negotiations, Abkhazia would be returned to us and that those who were forcibly displaced would return to their own land. Diplomatic work is also necessary. Some radically-minded people say that they do not want any negotiations, which, of course, is wrong. However, we should not go to the other extreme. Unfortunately, in reality, the return of Abkhazia is probably only possible by military force; nevertheless, diplomacy should contribute to the victory of Georgian weapons and to the subsequent consolidation of this victory. In this way, the meeting in Geneva would have been more significant had Georgia been better prepared. Unfortunately, in my view, this memorandum is not serious; it does not correspond to our interests and is unacceptable to our state. What is the sense of holding a meeting just for the sake of it? [Jguburia] You probably know what happened during your absence concerning the bread situation; it has become more acute; people are joking that those behind the acts of sabotage must be magicians as it has been impossible to find them.... [Chanturia] We really cannot blame Russia for this situation. This is our fault. It is an institute of state violence. When reason and morality have no effect upon a part of society or specific individuals, the state is obliged to use force to put a halt to illegal actions. What is happening in our country...? Members of the mafia appear on television and speak about the mafia; bread thieves appear on television and speak about bread thieves; robbers speak about the evils of robbery. That is to say, these people have installed themselves in fairly high echelons of the state structures. I doubt that we will achieve any serious measure of success in the struggle against the mafia unless new people come to power. Believe me, it is possible to resolve this problem within a month. We simply have to catch certain people. Those giving protection to the Tatishvilis [bandit gang] must be caught first. The "big fish" have to be caught before the small ones. In Georgia, the "small fish" are being caught while the "big fish" wander about free. Everything here is done unsystematically, including the struggle against crime. I repeat, it is possible to establish order in Georgia but this can only be done by new people who are not connected with the mafia and who do not take money from criminals. When one's conscience is clear, one can arrest someone and punish him if need be. There is great support for the truth. [Jguburia] Batono [Georgian polite form of address] Giorgi, people believe that the current Parliament is not the one that Georgia needs and are thinking about new elections.... [Chanturia] Parliament is, to put it mildly, far removed from international standards. This "is not a new one but an old one." However, does the government look any better?! Is there, in general, any structure in Georgia that is more or less civilized? Unfortunately, there is not. It is the fault of the electorate for chosing such a parliament. Blocs are formed and called "Mshvidoba," [Peace], "Siqvaruli," [Love], "Aqvaveba," [Well-Being], and "Gapurchkvna," [Prosperity], one or two popular composers or "violinists" are made their leaders, and people vote for these blocs, which have been formed artificially and soon disappear. These people may be prominent cultural figures but many of them understand nothing when it comes to politics. Parliament is a place for politicians. [passage omitted] As regards early elections, of course, they are necessary. The elections should be held according to party lists. We should introduce strict barriers: 5 percent for parties and 10 percent for blocs. Whoever fails to overcome these barriers will not be able to have any representatives in Parliament. Parliament will be composed of [the members of] three or four parties, which will be a step forward. We also have to learn that the government is not an economic mechanism. Ministers should be politicians and, moreover, party members as, in this case, there will be greater responsibility. When the government is formed on the basis of party principles, then it is already a united team. [passage omitted] [Jguburia] If it is not inappropriate..., speaking of professionalism, was the sudden formation of the "Union of [Georgia's] Citizens" not premature? It must take a lot of time and work to form a party. A union of like-minded persons is formed slowly and gradually, according to what the party's concept, orientation, point of view, and aims are.... As soon as the "Union of Citizens" was formed, people flocked to it. They probably blindly trust the head of state and have faith in him, and that is the reason for joining it in a hurry. People can probably be forgiven this. However, was such haste on the part of the head of state not a little inappropriate? If we take a look at the path pursued by the NDP, we can see what a difficult one it had to follow. The NDP needed almost 70 years to become a strong party. [Chanturia] What is formed quickly disappears just as quickly. We can mention the Rustaveli Society, to which collective membership was possible. Unfortunately, the society has become a fiction, something that awaits the "Union of Citizens" and others such as the Party of Reformers, the Progressive-Democratic Party, and groupings that were formed ostentatiously and artificially, all with different interests. [passage omitted] Of course, Shevardnadze should have a party and he himself should be a party member since he is the head of state. I have often said that it is nonsense that the head of state should stand apart from his own political force. There is nothing incomprehensible about the desire of Shevardnadze himself to form a party. What is incomprehensible are the means and style in which all this was done and the hullabaloo surrounding it. This is neither a political force nor a movement. The election of a 200-strong presidium is, to put it mildly, a wholly apolitical step. I fear that the same fate awaits this organization that befell the Democratic Union (formed by Shevardnadze) and later the "Mshvidoba" bloc. This will place the head of state himself in an unenviable position. We are interested in having strong and firmly established rule in Georgia. The defeat of the "Union of Citizens" could lead to a more serious political defeat and this, naturally, does not correspond to our aims. [Jguburia] It has not been possible to start a period of construction in our country. Gamsakhurdia destroyed and divided everything. The forum [as published] was split, families were split, and brother was set against sister. There was an attempt to set regions against one another but this, thank God, did not succeed. Today, when people take a nostalgic look at the recent past, they see Shevardnadze also more as a destroyer than a builder. In their view, Shevardnadze and Gamsakhurdia are both destroyers. The first destroyed the empire, which was vitally necessary, and also made German unification possible through the destruction of the famous "wall." The second destroyed his own motherland, which led us to civil war. One can say that neither is the very image of Aghmashenebeli [king of Georgia 1089-1125]. Davit Aghmashenebeli was devoted, first and foremost, to domestic affairs. He made Georgians love work and religion. He created a powerful army and, when it became necessary to launch an offensive against the enemy, he blocked off their roads of retreat and, naturally, won a great victory. Incidentally, probably the time has finally come to create a united army in Georgia, do you not think? [Chanturia] How can a united army be created when certain criminals in military uniform are being awarded medals and decorations? The impunity syndrome reigns not only in the army but everywhere in society. A person can be a traitor or in alliance with the enemy and he will still be decorated, offered a post, and not be short of respect and glory. That atmosphere that prevails in the higher echelons of power and also at a relatively lower level stimulates this immorality, irresponsibility, and non-state activity. Let us return to the subject of the CIS. A wholly non-state attitude also exists toward such an important question as Georgia's membership of the CIS. Let us recall what Russian historians themselves have said. [passage omitted] Russians write that a Russian will not abandon the empire and, at the same time, an equal alliance between the people of the empire and its former or current satellite states is impossible. [Jguburia] You often quote from Mazzini in your speeches. I recall one phrase: It is impossible to think about harmony, understanding, and Christianity in a country where one person is very poor and one is very rich (let us take our coupon and the Russian ruble). People here think that we apparently need Russia very much. When they need to justify joining the CIS, they say that, just as we cannot do without Russia, so it cannot do without us. [Chanturia] In general, it would be better if Georgia and Georgian politicians did not view matters from the point of view of having to justify themselves. I am grieved that certain people do not intend to acknowledge that joining the CIS represents a defeat. If, only a short while ago, it meant a defeat and a humiliation, how did it become a great political step following the loss, destruction, division, and ruin of Abkhazia? Why are we deceiving ourselves? [Jguburia] Such a view exists: Why should we not join the CIS when such and such a state belongs to it...? When I overhear such a statement, it immediately brings to mind one of our sayings: "He is not stupid who has put the unripe corn in the attic but he who has befriended him." Joking apart, they also say that Batoni Shevardnadze apparently joined the CIS so that he could take on a different mission, which will benefit not only us but also others.... As regards the attitude of members of our government to the CIS, their hesitancy was exposed in a masterly way by Kalbatoni [Georgian polite form of address] Irina Sarishvili [Chanturia's wife, former vice premier who resigned in protest against Shevardnadze's decision to join the CIS] during two sessions of Parliament. [Chanturia] There are people in the government who not only hold the CIS close to their hearts but also would gladly welcome the restoration of the Soviet Union in any form. I am convinced that Shevardnadze did not want this but, as a result of mistakes made and proceeding from objective or subjective reality and what took shape in our country, it became necessary to take this step. However, we should be frank and say that this is a defeat. The very fact that, following our being dragged into the CIS, we lost Abkhazia and Gamsakhurdia returned to Georgia and inflicted a civil war [upon the country] shows that this is a defeat. We nevertheless have to say this so that we can leave something for posterity. Our moderate position regarding relations with Russia is known to you. We are categorically opposed to anti-Russian hysteria but this does not mean that we would conduct a pro-Russian and antistate policy and leave the flag, emblem, and anthem as vestiges of our independence. When we speak of an antistate approach, this characterizes a certain section of our society, people who are collaborators by nature. Consumed with revanchist feelings and hiding behind anti-Gamsakhurdia sentiments, they are now bent on wrecking the ideals of the national movement (that date from the time of Ilia Chavchavadze). Nevertheless, I believe that Shevardnadze has sufficient forces and will free himself of this entourage; this is essential for him, as a politician, so that he can get a realistic view of the existing situation in Georgia. I have witnessed how people have been feeding him with disinformation and painting a picture that does not exist in reality. When one is given incorrect information, this causes one to take incorrect steps. Naturally, we have to be very wary and correct in our relations with Russia but we should not compromise our state interests. [passage omitted]
