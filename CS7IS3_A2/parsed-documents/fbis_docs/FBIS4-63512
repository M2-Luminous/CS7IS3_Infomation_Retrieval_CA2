"The ministry staff are working according to plan. Officers on duty keep working, while the others are having a rest," he said. To quote Kuznetsov, the Crimean interior ministry units were not put into a state of combat readiness on Saturday. "Only individual precaution measures were taken," said Kuznetsov. He said that on Saturday evening, he was informed that the Ukrainian national guards had planned to seize the Crimean TV, radio and communication centers, and the buildings of the parliament, Cabinet and bank. "A group of Crimean deputies, who visited a unit of the Ukrainian national guard, could see that the national guards were ready and wanted to do so. Moreover, national guards themselves told the deputies that such a task had been assigned to them," said Kuznetsov. He also announced that on Sunday this information was partially confirmed by Ukraine's First Deputy Interior Minister Valentin Nedrigailo, who admitted that at his request the task of establishing control over the Crimean TV center had been assigned to the national guards. "The TV center and the parliament building are always guarded by the police," said Kuznetsov. He pointed out that no weapons had been given either to the police or to the special unit Berkut, because both of them were always armed. Berkut units daily patrol the streets. On Sunday they detained a 29-men strong grouping. On Saturday Berkut units were asked to find out what was happening near the parliament building, so they came to the place, assessed the situation and went away, he said. Kuznetsov admitted that he had issued the order to enhance vigilance and that he had put only part of the personnel into a state of alert. "Now everything has got back to the initial situation. We are working tranquilly and are not planning any moves," he said. To quote Kuznetsov, Crimea remains part of Ukraine. "If Kiev does not explode the situation, everything will go tranquily," he said. He said that the hysterical campaign (over the Crimean parliament's decision to restore the constitution of 1992 -- INTERFAX) had been launched by the forces which intended to foil presidential elections scheduled for 26 June, not by the whole of Ukraine. He pointed out that he meant President Kravchuk in the first place. [sentence as received] He noted, however, that other forces' attitude to the Crimea was "not quite loyal," either. He believes that Crimea's position in relation to Kiev is similar to the position of Tatarstan in relation to Russia prior to the conclusion of the bilateral agreement. "Who has suffered from the agreement signed by Kazan and Moscow? The same might be said about Crimea," said Kuznetsov. Kiev is absolutely unpredictable, he went on to say. "But if the Kiev politicians show common sense, everything will be normal: there are no reasons for fanning tensions. All problems can be solved at a negotiating table," he said. He expressed hope that the talks between the Russian and Ukrainian prime ministers, to be held in Moscow on Monday, would be a success. "I think this meeting will confirm once again that all disputable issues must be tackled through talks. No one has the right to issue the order to use force," he said. He pointed out that the political events had not had any impact on the crime situation in Crimea. He acknowledged, however, that at this dramatic moment the interior ministry personnel were alarmed. He said that the people of Crimea had the right to a choice within the limits not affecting the territorial integrity of Ukraine. "Nothing has changed. The constitution has been restored, but Crimea has not drifted away from Ukraine. One must simply give Crimea economic independence, so we could take care of our people on our own," said Kuznetsov.
