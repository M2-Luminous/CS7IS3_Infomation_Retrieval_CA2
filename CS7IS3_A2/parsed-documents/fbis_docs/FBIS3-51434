The firm Paraguayan position even forced the presidents to meet again yesterday afternoon after which the respective economy ministers were instructed to meet next April, in a place yet to be determined, to express each country's commitment to comply with the treaty's chapter on coordination of the economic policies. Only under these conditions will Paraguay agree to continue negotiating the common external tariff to establish a customs union as of 1 January 1995. In principle there is an agreement to reach a common external tariff within the following guidelines: the tariffs of 80 percent of products agreed upon by the country members will converge according to the technical criteria adopted by the negotiators. That is, they will reach a common external tariff. A list of sensitive products will be drawn up immediately. These products will be treated on an exceptional (that is, protectionist) basis until the year 2001. Very sensitive products will be protected until the year 2006. Within these latter products, which have yet not been totally specified, Paraguay managed to obtain zero import tariffs for raw materials or inputs for its national industrial production. The country members can negotiate the list of sensitive products until April, and the very sensitive products until 30 June 1994. In his speech, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy said that Paraguay understands that the integration of Mercosur should develop through symmetrical and simultaneous progress in all market areas. The establishment of the common external tariff, he added, demands a coordination of macroeconomic policies and the harmonization of general and specific laws. This must be implemented by the country members together if the much desired common market is to be attained. "This is why it is preferable to discuss the situation in the present and not on 31 December 1994 if we want to be efficient administrators of the Treaty of Asuncion," he said. "Paraguay, as it has always been, is currently faithful to its integrationist vocation and ratifies its commitment to achieve a common market. Our four countries must act jointly and with solidarity, making a simultaneous and balanced effort to overcome the basic problems we just referred to," the Paraguayan president said. The Paraguayan president also pointed out the need "to accept the reality and make the political decision of establishing reasonable deadlines to ensure that the final objective be reached in harmony with the adjustment process of the economies that will be integrated." Wasmosy added that "it is also worthwhile to reflect on the possibility of creating a solidarity program in favor of the countries with less developed economies to stimulate the redistribution of resources in the region and to minimize the negative aspects that may come about with the adjustments that will be made to form the common market." This solidarity, he said, could consist of technological and financial support to allow the industrial structures of the less developed economies to improve their level of efficiency and competitiveness which, without doubt, will benefit the community interests. He also asked for special treatment within the common external tariff framework for a greater amount of products sensitive for the less developed economies. President Juan Carlos Wasmosy talked with the media and said he left the meeting very satisfied with the talks held with the presidents in Colonia. He said they spoke sincerely and that between now and 1 June it will be known with certainty whether Mercosur will work as a common market. Such is the period of time Paraguay asked for so that the country members could define and assume their commitment to make adjustments within their respective economies.
