The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is quoted as saying: "After the training course held at the proposal of the Central Committee of the party for the party cell secretaries from all parts of the country in 1991, a vigorous movement was launched to create loyal party cells throughout the whole party under the slogan, `Let us make all the party cells loyal cells ', and their militant function and role have been enhanced as never before." Comrade Kim Chong-il's work "Let us strengthen party cells" fully encompasses the principles in making all party cells remain unfailingly loyal to the party and the leader, ranging from proper party life, guidance and work with the masses to the enhancement of the role of party cell secretaries. The paper says in a by-lined article: The loyal party cell movement has been waged vigorously throughout the party over the last three years. As a result, a new change has taken place in the ideological and moral traits of our party members, the singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses further consolidated and a constant innovation and upswing effected in socialist construction. Our party members think they can neither live nor make revolution apart from the embrace of the dear leader, and they are all determined to become vanguard fighters and rifles and bombs to defend the party and the leader with their lives. Amid the vigorous loyal party cell movement over the last three years, tens of thousands of party cell members wrote letters pledging loyalty to the dear leader, and he replied to the members of a many party cells. In the course of making loyal party cells, our party members' revolutionary spirit of absolutizing and unconditionally implementing the party policies has risen beyond comparison. Today the entire party members and other working people are constantly working new miracles and performing feats in all sectors of socialist construction, with the firm belief that their leader, their party, their chuche idea and their socialism are the best.
