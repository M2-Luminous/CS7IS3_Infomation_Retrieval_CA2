This crop now faces eradication of its surplus production. However, the budget for eradication has been cut, and new forms of activity have been adopted to achieve technical viability and provide favorable economic prospects, thereby creating a natural way of changing economic life. FACETAS spoke with Dr. Daniel Sanchez Chavez, director of the National Directorate of Agricultural Reconversion (DIRECO), who has been the director of this organization since April 1992. A specialist in this subject who has done post-graduate work in Japan, San Jose, Costa Rica, and Brazil, Daniel Sanchez analyzes and considers the process of agricultural reconversion in this interview. [LOS TIEMPOS] Is DIRECO a repressive agency or a technical organization? [Sanchez] The National Directorate of Agricultural Reconversion, or DIRECO, is an institution which has, among other purposes, the objective of planning, executing, and supervising plans for reducing the cultivation of coca leaves in the illegal and surplus transitional production areas, as provided for by law. All of this is done within the framework of voluntary cooperation with the farmers producing coca leaves. Therefore, it can be seen that our work is clearly technical in character and distinct from any kind of repressive activity. [LOS TIEMPOS] In view of the changes in DIRECO what kind of work does it perform? [Sanchez] In the work program of the National Directorate of Agricultural Reconversion (DIRECO) the efforts of its officials to develop goals and objectives are of primary importance. Consequently, some of their efforts have been devoted to improving working conditions by providing our employees with annual vacations; arranging for their reassignment to other duties, which means higher salaries for better trained and more efficient, professional workers; and making the 200 employees of DIRECO eligible for the benefits of social security. Furthermore, we have restructured the agency to make it function more efficiently and to integrate the operational, technical support, and administrative areas. We know that this effort has still not gone far enough, and some unsatisfied expectations remain. In the operational area, beginning in 1992, DIRECO undertook a new type of activity called "Reduction Programs," which consist of carrying out public works of a social type, in exchange for the farmers' reducing a certain number of hectares of coca leaf cultivation, in a framework of negotiation and cooperation with the communities benefiting from such work. In this way, during the 1992 operational year, 17 public works of different types were undertaken in several communities, at an overall cost of 224,225 bolivianos. During the 1993 operational year, 32 public works costing 317,071 bolivianos were completed. As a result, DIRECO has been turned into an agent of change which makes it possible for it to achieve credibility and develop a technical and nonrepressive identity. [LOS TIEMPOS] What is the framework under which DIRECO carries on its activities, under the existing, bilateral agreements? [Sanchez] The Bilateral Agreement contains an understanding between the American and Bolivian Governments. In it the government of the United States of North America commits itself to provide aid to the Bolivian economic recovery program, and the Bolivian Government commits itself to implement the Law on the Production of Coca Leaves and Controlled Substances. This law provides for crop reduction, substitution, and development, through the application of an integrated development and substitution program involving 5,000 to 8,000 hectares planted to coca each year. In the framework of this basic document DIRECO must prepare and execute an Operational Plan aimed at satisfying the objectives contained in the policy approved by the Bolivian Government. This policy provides for the cooperation and voluntary participation of coca leaf producers in the illicit and surplus coca leaf producing areas of Bolivia. [LOS TIEMPOS] "Reduction, Substitution, and Development"--is this the trilogy of alternative development in which DIRECO is participating? [Sanchez] I believe that, given the complexity of this process, it is difficult to identify the actions and responsibility of each of the organizations implementing this program. However, the concept and techniques involved in this activity must be understood, together with the disinterested contribution of each of these organizations and based on their full cooperation and understanding. [LOS TIEMPOS] It was stated in a local publication that plans for the eradication of coca fields are far from complete. It has even been insinuated that there has been a kind of political boycott of the process. How much of this is true? [Sanchez] The newspaper OPINION published an article indicating that plans for the eradication of coca fields are far from complete, within the approved time framework. It even insinuated that we are in the midst of a kind of political party boycott. As of 31 December 1993 DIRECO had completed about 60 percent of its operational plan. During the next three months of the initial, planning period, the remaining 40 percent of the preparations can be completed, in accordance with existing plans, to carry out "Reduction Programs" in several communities. Although this prospect is not particularly encouraging, we believe that, thanks to the efforts made by the personnel involved, we have succeeded in completing the second section of our plan. This was accomplished despite the serious limitations which we faced in 1993, such as a sustained and steadily rising increase in the price of coca leaves, the temporary suspension of funds earmarked for compensation and agricultural grants, and the unyielding opposition of the leadership of trade unions and elite groups in Bolivia which are opposed to the plans for a reduction in the planting of coca leaves. We believe that, thanks to the efforts made by our personnel, we have successfully completed the second segment of our plan. Regarding the publication to which we referred, I must assume that the author of that article is completely ignorant about our policies and plans for a reduction in coca planting and the context in which this is taking place. The article in question gives the impression that we have hidden objectives. This does not reflect the ethical and moral behavior of a serious and responsible reporter. [LOS TIEMPOS] "Reduction Works"--is this a new plan for the eradication of coca plantings? [Sanchez] I would say that it is a new way of doing things which made it possible for us to meet the urgent needs of the communities involved and to satisfy them to the extent that our budget allows us and given the predisposition of all members of the communes concerned to carry on a plan of concerted and negotiated reduction. In that way we can contribute to change and to the social and economic development of the region. [LOS TIEMPOS] Will the limitations be dealt with in the context of the program of agricultural reconversion? [Sanchez] Agricultural reconversion is a long-term program and is a function of the emphasis on agriculture in the subtropical area of Cochabamba. It should be said that, on the basis of agricultural and ecological conditions in the region, the change in the patterns of production is based on permanent or perennial species of plants which begin to provide their "harvest" over the medium term. Consequently, this is a slow process, on the one hand. On the other hand, to be most effective, it requires very close coordination with all agencies involved in the agrarian sector. So far, significant progress has been made in all of the programs undertaken by the IBTA/Chapare Project [Bolivian Institute of Agricultural and Livestock Technology at the Chapare]. A transfer of technology has taken place, involving systems of production which aim at accomplishing that mission. We think that what has been done so far is not enough, and there is a long way to go. We hope to do this in a coordinated and jointly agreed way, so that we will be able to get the best results. [LOS TIEMPOS] How would you summarize the social and economic background of coca leaf plantations? The peasant producers have accepted this program. Has there been any follow up? [Sanchez] Although coca leaf growing has a cultural value in the Andean countries and is the means of support for many families in the subtropical areas of these countries, it is also used for illicit purposes which attack the morals and proper behavior of the people living in the countries which produce coca leaves. Consequently, plans for the reduction of coca planting have the objective of eradicating surplus production, while respecting the production of acceptable amounts intended for traditional, medicinal, and legal usage, related to our culture. The farmers who voluntarily accept the plans for a reduction in the size of their fields planted to coca receive $2,000 in compensation, through the Agricultural Donation Fund. We believe that if the money from this fund is reinvested in planting a new area with a crop having technical viability and good marketing prospects, a change in the economy will come naturally. DIRECO does not follow up on changes made by those who own this agricultural land because there are other institutions working in this area. [LOS TIEMPOS] A reduction in North American aid has been reported. What is the truth about this? [Sanchez] Any agreement is based on the implementation of its various parts, and any digression from this standard may involve a failure to comply with the goals that have been set. From that point of view it is necessary for all of the sectors involved in this problem to sit down to discuss and present our best considered points of view, while we remain fundamentally concerned about the best interests of our country and society. [LOS TIEMPOS] Following the layoff of employees at your directorate, there has been some discussion that DIRECO will soon be abolished. What are the facts about this? [Sanchez] The personnel reduction at DIRECO is the result of financial problems and in no way was caused by false arguments which have been spread in the course of discussion of the problem. It is a good thing to emphasize that the budgetary reduction which DIRECO has suffered has confronted us with the painful need to do without the services of some very capable people. The instinct of self-preservation demands that we face up to the lack of understanding and the critical remarks made by the people concerned.
