Our correspondent has informed us that at this hour only the representatives of the Alfa Cartel Trade Union Confederation are in Victoria Square. Mr. Bogdan Hossu stated to our correspondent that his trade union is preparing a communique in response to the government spokesman's communique issued last night. The Alfa Cartel assesses the government communique as biased and irritating, which does nothing except establish conditions to push out demonstrators, even by force, from Victoria Square. Likewise, we have been informed that buses and cars that arrived from Hunedoara, Cluj, and Vilcea Counties are currently present in the Victoria Square. The Alfa Cartel spokesman in Victoria Square informed us that, at this hour, representatives of trade unions in the area of mining and metallurgy have also been joined by employees of Bucharest enterprise who are members of the Alfa Cartel Trade Unions. Our correspondents also informed us that at around 1210 local time, participants in the Victoria Square trade union rally tried to break through the law enforcement bodies deployed around Victoria Palace. However, as a result of repeated appeals through a bullhorn by the unit commander and Alfa Cartel Leader Bogdan Hossu to the demonstrators to refrain from violence, the demonstrators gave up the attempt to break through the law enforcement unit. Anti-government slogans are currently being chanted.
