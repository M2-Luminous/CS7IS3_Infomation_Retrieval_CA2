In this process, it is clear that the basic intent is to examine, from the standpoint of each workplace, the true causes of economic inefficiency and its impact on the financial imbalances, and to suggest methods of combining economic and political considerations in the actions the country must undertake. Stimulated by the call of their union leaders, the workers must be cognizant of their active role in the country's economic reorganization, and must be willing to accept the financial measures that are ultimately adopted, even if they involve some sacrifice. It is obvious in these discussions that the most important thing in our economy is to be efficient in every possible way, and the only reasonable means of achieving that goal is to cut costs, boost labor productivity, and get the most out of the inputs we have. With the authority of those who do not abandon their posts, the speakers are demanding more than ever before that we maintain a high degree of labor discipline, which at a time like this depends on attitude, awareness of social duty, and patriotism. What is at stake, more than anything else, is the defense of the workers' most genuine interests. We must not wait for any external measure, but must adopt those measures we can implement right now to make our economy more effective. Those measures are in areas where we have raw materials and where the productive processes have not been halted and top-quality service is being provided for the country: the sugar harvest, sugarcane and agricultural production, fishing, mining and mineral processing, tourism, pharmaceuticals, science centers, and vital activities such as health and education, among others. Few imaginable financial proposals do not involve real or apparent conflicts of interest or differences of opinion. Thus, when a worker proposes to raise the prices of certain products, another worker may remind him that there are relatively low wages in a wide range of occupations, while a third may argue that it would be better to accept increases in certain items that the family budget can afford rather than having to pay for vital services such as education and health, which are difficult to pay for on an individual basis. ks it is better to give subsidies to low-income people than to subsidize the sale of products at below-cost prices, another will explain how difficult and complex such subsidy mechanisms are. Among the workers' concerns are the intolerable presence of crime, its relationship to the black market, and its impact on social and labor discipline. The workers want to find ways of eliminating the theft and diversions that are driving up costs, demoralizing the collectives, and enriching money hoarders and traffickers. They demand that the authorities take drastic measures that will set an example at all levels. In connection with the above, they have expressed the need to readjust and properly enforce the financial requirements for collections and payments between enterprises. The present situation is in fact promoting a lack of discipline and may actually cover up crime. In any event, the workers and their unions must monitor efforts in the field to solve this problem. Another frequent topic of discussion is the tax system: what it consists of, how it may be expanded, what economic activities may be sources of additional funding for the state, and how citizens can increase their support for it. These and other issues are debated. The fact is that the workers are fully involved in the consideration and solution of the problems that affect them the most. After four years of heroic resistance, the people of Cuba are entering a phase that is in significant ways more aggressive in the struggle to safeguard the sovereignty of the fatherland and the socialist nature of the revolution. It is hoped that in 1994, signs of economic recovery will be seen in some vital activities and areas of production, thanks to the process of financial adjustment based on a high degree of political consensus. Once again, we hail the wisdom of the National People's Government Assembly in postponing decisionmaking and categorically denying that the intent is to formulate a so-called "packet of measures." The truth is that the idea of a "packet of measures" smacks of Third World capitalism, of neoliberal policies under which the workers wake up one day to the news that prices have skyrocketed, enterprises are being privatized and half the employees are to be laid off, wages are falling, and social benefits have been abruptly eliminated. Reality forces us to make an economic adjustment, but we will do it in the socialist way, the Cuban way, with democratic formulas that are truly unimaginable for other societies. We are aware, of course, that the harsh situation of an economy that has had to withstand devastating blows, as ours has, causes many people to lose their patience and to yearn for "rescue measures." Considering the complexity of our problems, however, we realize that it is naive to expect that measures can act like a magic wand, graciously granting every wish. We urgently need to improve our economic efficiency, but we must not rush into technical solutions without first reconciling them with their political repercussions. Hence the importance of continuing to expand and improve this democratic and educational process that is so aptly named the Workplace Parliament, without allowing the slightest hint of ritual or formalism to taint it. The workers' voice must be heard loud and clear everywhere. It is imperative that management be forthcoming with accurate information so that the economic and financial situation of each workplace can be assessed. Trade union leaders must devote their energies to carrying out this lofty political task, the true path to the economic efficiency that Cuba needs to triumph.
