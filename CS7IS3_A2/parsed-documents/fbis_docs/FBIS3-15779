The plan was drafted by independent centers for political intiative with a group of leading political scientists and economists taking part. According to the draft, "if documents on the integration of the monetary systems of Belarus and Russia are not signed by mid March through the Russian leadership's fault", Belarus will immediately start building up its frontier with Russia, will introduce a national currency (by available information, money bills were printed in Germany long ago and are currently stocked in the republic - IF), and will impose heavy custom duties on all Russian commodities transported across Belarus. However, the key points of the program are those that presuppose "energetic steps to be taken by Belarus to set up an alliance of Baltic and Black Sea States". Such an alliance would unite Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, and a number of East European countries and would possibly be maintained by NATO as a "buffer" between Russia and Western Europe. The plan provides for closer ties between Belarus and NATO up to a revision by the country of its proclaimed neutrality and a withdrawal of all the Russian troops deployed in Belarus by the end of this year. Besides, the draft envisages dismantling the key Russian strategic facilities at Vileika and Gantsevich at an early date. By military experts estimates, the dismantlement would do more than 150 Tn [Trillion]-rubles-worth damage to Russia and would disorganize the management of sveral Russian fleets, the nuclear-submarine fleet included. The Belarusian Prime Minister's Spokesman Vladimir Zametalin has neither confirmed nor denied the existence of such a program. He told Interfax that "Russia's unjustified stalling with signing the documents on the formation of a monetary union for improper reasons make the Belarusian leadership weary and compels it to plan steps in advance."
