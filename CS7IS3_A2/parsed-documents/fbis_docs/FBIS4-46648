(On Development and Problems of Russian Military Science)"] [Text] VOYENNO-ISTORICHESKIY ZHURNAL No 9, 1993 published an account about a conference held in the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Military History Institute. The question discussed was on the place of military historical science in day to day activity of the Russian Armed Forces, which caught the interest of many of our readers. Fulfilling their numerous wishes, the editors asked specialists for their opinions on this problem. At the same time, we do not consider the materials published below to be indisputable and suggest that readers continue the discussion. The present state of Russian military science could be characterized by one word--crisis. It stands to reason that this relates not only to the area of military knowledge, but to all other social sciences as well: philosophy, political economy, political science, history and so on. All are experiencing a period of profound conceptual change. The previous scientific-methodological base is collapsing and basic views and many fundamental aims and propositions are being revised. Seemingly settled and unshakable categories and concepts are being swept aside to be replaced by new ones in a number of cases, but a void often forms in their place. Thus, a very complicated, contradictory process is going on in which both negative as well as positive trends, and elements both of growth and of decline are interwoven. This clearly reflects characteristic features of Russian society's present development: the country's difficult situation, confused public thinking, loss of precise reference points and of the majority of previous values, painful transition to new economic relations, exacerbation of internal struggle, a change in the foreign policy course and a reorientation of very important military doctrinal aims. Hence also the vagueness of development of military-theoretical thought. In the history of Russian military science this is not the first sharp turn caused by radical transformations in politics and in the material means of warfare. The October Revolution became one of the first critical, destructive stages, but at that time Soviet military science, the successor of previous traditions, still was able to create the nucleus of rational Russian military scientific aims by relying on what had been achieved in the past, was able to rework them with consideration of the altered historical conditions, and on this basis was able to achieve a high level of development, which helped us win the supreme victory in the Great Patriotic War. Will the crisis in military science be overcome now? Evidently it will, but it is also obvious that this process in all likelihood will be more painful and will stretch out for a lengthy time. The present crisis in military science is extremely distinctive. At any rate, it is dictated by a very complex set of closely interwoven political, economic, ideological and strictly military reasons, by very profound changes for the better in the entire world military-political situation and, most important, by the intensive reideologization of the majority of aims and views. In cleaning communist dogmas from military science, modern theorists persistently try to reorient it toward standards of a new ideology. At times not just irrational, but also many rational kernels and true propositions are tossed overboard if they are based on Marxist dialectics or are linked with the names of classics of Marxism-Leninism and their statements, regardless of whether or not they meet the truth and actual practice. Doubt often is cast even on obvious things, particularly propositions about the essence of war as a continuation of politics by other, violent means, on the class sources of wars, on dependence of methods of waging war on methods of production and so on, although the truth of these propositions is confirmed clearly both by a millennium of experience as well as by everyday life. Almost all Soviet military history is being defamed. Instead of filling in the gaps in our country's history, many heroic pages of our past often are blackened. The very concept of "Soviet," "socialist" military science is refuted, just as is that of "bourgeois" military science, on the grounds that any truth is abstract, independent and international, although it is known that various social groups interpret many provisions of social sciences from their own standpoints, relying on different methodological principles. Doubt also is cast on the national character of military science, particularly the legitimacy of existence of a strictly Russian military science, in view of the fact that military knowledge knows no boundaries. The influence of national traditions and traits, which inevitably are reflected in the direction of military theory and practice and especially in the character of military organizational development, military strategy, operational art and tactics, is ignored, not to mention that it is impossible to separate military science from specific military thinkers, theorists and practitioners of military affairs and from their national soil. It is without question that it would be incorrect to idealize Soviet military science and regard it as exceptional, sinless, and free of shortcomings and mistakes. Soviet military thinking interpreted many questions in a biased, tendentious, oversimplified manner, primarily from a class standpoint, giving little regard to other objective factors. Nevertheless, only it (with appropriate corrections, of course) can become the basis of modern Russian military science, which always essentially was its main nucleus. The crisis of Russian military science is being aggravated now by decreased interest in basic military-theoretical research and by attempts at substituting chiefly applied and momentary short-term developments for it. In the future this is fraught with serious miscalculations, loss of a general course, and a general lag in studying fundamental problems of military affairs, of ensuring national security and of strengthening the country's defense. A serious danger also is being created in connection with the sharp reduction in financing of military science and RDT&E and in connection with leading Ministry of Defense scientific research establishments being bled dry from the drain of skilled cadres. As a result, science's potential and capabilities are narrowing and timely, full-fledged development of military science problems demanding high professionalism and appropriate funds and time is being impeded. Of course, with all this one cannot help but admit that Russian military science lately has succeeded in solving a number of important problems, moving forward in the study of new trends in development of military affairs, delving more deeply into problems of preventing war, and creating a scientific base for producing a new Russian military doctrine. But these achievements are relative and quite incommensurable with the enormous volume of problems which still must be solved. I would like to single out the following among the large number of problems facing Russian military science. Evidently it is necessary to move away from the past narrowed interpretation of military science, which limited its subject only to one aspect of war, armed warfare, and that in a strictly professional sense. Obviously, war as a whole must become the subject of military science as a specific social phenomenon, including all its aspects and inner relations and new forms of warfare. This of course does not preclude the study of specific elements and components of war by other sciences, but their comprehensive study also is required, which can contribute to a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of war and to a revelation of its logical patterns, reasons for appearance, course and outcome. Clarification of interrelationships of military science with other sciences and military art, and especially with military doctrine, is gaining urgency at the present time. This is determined by the fact that already now an intensive process is under way in the majority of world states for revising and reworking military doctrines. This is linked with global improvements in the disposition and correlation of world military-political forces. Radical changes in the direction of Russia's policy and new conditions for ensuring international and national security cannot help but affect all spheres of states' political and military activity. The Russian Federation presently has adopted a fundamentally new military doctrine, but its scientific substantiation and, most important, development of rational mechanisms for its realization are required. Military doctrine relies on conclusions of military science in one way or another. Depending on the extent to which this is supported, military doctrine may be progressive (vital) or adventuristic (faulty). Progressive military doctrine usually is built on a firm scientific foundation; adventuristic military doctrine, submitting to the aims of politics, most often ignores the demands of military science and is founded on attendant factors. Such military doctrine, however, cannot reliably guarantee either a state's security or attainment of other military-political goals. Therefore sooner or later it leads to military collapse, as happened with fascist Germany. The Russian Federation military doctrine presently adopted as a result of lengthy, strenuous work is scientific in its basis, but its theoretical substantiation has not yet been completed. Specific principles of implementing basic provisions also have not been developed; moreover, some are not distinguished by clarity and definiteness, are at times abstract and are outlined with insufficient precision. This relates in particular to the classification of possible wars and military clashes, to an assessment of the nature of military danger and probable military threats, and to a determination of methods of deterring and routing an aggressor. It is asserted that Russia has no enemies, but Russia is forced to reckon with a broad set of hypothetically dangerous actions. Politically this is understandable, but from a theoretical and practical aspect this is tantamount to admitting that all states may be potential enemies of Russia, not to mention that reality is ignored with that statement of the matter. Most important, it is impossible to conduct military organizational development and prepare armed forces purposefully, since it is impossible to build them regardless of with what means, against whom and under what conditions they may be employed. Military science must find a solution to this contradiction and come up with rational approaches to an assessment of the geopolitical and military-strategic situation; to an analysis of military threats, the sources and causes of war, and measures for preventing it; and to principles of waging war against an aggressor who is pursuing particular goals and possesses a varying military-technical potential. Evidently the internal structure of military science also needs refinement. A new approach to principles of the general theory of war, which until recently was artificially substituted for by the methodological base of science, is necessary in particular. It would appear that in this initial, determining division of military science it is advisable to examine the totality of general, fundamental problems of war, including its essence, content, reasons for appearance, classification, laws of development, factors determining its course and end results, and all forms of warfare being used (armed, ideological, economic, diplomatic and so on). In our view, the opinion developed in the General Staff Military Academy is sufficiently substantiated in this respect. Complex tasks arise in specific areas of military science, especially in theory of military art, theory of military organizational development, theory of military training and education, arms theory, military command and control theory, and in all closely related areas, above all military history. The following are becoming very important tasks in developing the theory of military art: revealing the nature of possible wars, armed conflicts and other military clashes of varying scale and intensity both at the present time as well as in the future (for 10-15 years ahead at the very least); forecasting models of possible development of large-scale and limited wars waged using the newest and future weapon systems or only certain traditional kinds of military equipment; and revealing features of regional wars and armed conflicts. Not only must we take into account dominant traditional trends in the military-political and strategic situation and in the economic and military-technical base of warfare and means and methods of warfare, but also possible new objective and subjective factors affecting the content and forms of war as well as internal processes occurring in Russia and in the near, middle, and far abroad, new relationships forming in regions, the probability of disintegration or, conversely, unification of a number of states into regional blocs of varying orientation, and transformations of existing military-political alliances, above all NATO. A completely new page must be opened in this matter, since those wars toward which the Soviet Armed Forces oriented themselves and prepared for in the past, above all a global world war between the two world systems, now are absolutely ruled out. New forms of military clashes, insufficiently studied for now, have come to the foreground. A theory of the modern system of armed forces operations as applied to missions of preventing war, deterring an aggressor, and being involved in medium and high intensity conflicts is to be studied comprehensively and essentially developed anew, and a finished theory of strategic and regional operations in their new conception and operations of defensive and striking forces, mobile groupings and peacekeeping forces is to be created. Special attention evidently should be given to researching methods of repelling aggression in its various forms and preparing and conducting protracted and fast-moving strategic and operational missile-air operations and joint operations of all branches, and to substantiating countries' broad military cooperation for ensuring regional and international security and organizing a collective defense and a defense designed primarily for one's own forces within limits of national boundaries or moved onto territories of neighboring friendly countries if necessary. Fundamentally new directions are opening up in the theory of armed forces organizational development. We are speaking of developing fundamental principles of forming and developing a Russian military organization under new conditions with the country's altered geostrategic position and transformed political, economic and military systems. The urgency of this requires no proof. Military reform is proceeding with great difficulties specifically because it was begun not with development of new theoretical principles, but with the resolution of separate, scattered practical problems and measures, with the vacillations, miscalculations and other costs inevitably stemming from this. It would appear that Russian military science has to ensure formation of a refined concept of full-scale, comprehensive military reform envisaging not particular transformations, but implementation of fundamental, radical, long-term solutions encompassing all aspects of armed forces organizational development and activity without exception. In the area of arms theory, scientific principles of a new Russian Federation military-technical policy and corresponding military-technical concepts for the transition period and subsequent years are to be developed, figuring on a radical modernization, reduction, standardization and universalization of arms with a simultaneous significant increase in quality characteristics using the most advanced technologies. It is important to concentrate efforts on problems of creating and producing (in rational amounts) above all advanced, highly effective weapons with full factual realization of the "effectiveness-cost-time" principle and with consideration of the economy's transition to market relations, deep conversion, introduction of dual technologies and the need for establishing new scientific-technical and production ties. A scientific base thereby should be created for forming the future technical look of the Russian Armed Forces, developing more rational arms programs, and faultlessly determining priority and superpriority systems and kinds of weapons and military equipment. Very important, labor-intensive tasks arise in the sphere of military command and control theory. The question arises of the most rapid development of principles of many-sided perestroyka of entities, the material base and the entire armed forces command and control system in peace and wartime based on changed missions, new conditions for conducting military operations, and promising directions of military-technical progress opening up in information assets. Research and development of more effective forms and methods of command and control of troops and naval forces using new-generation automated systems and advanced communications equipment assume special significance. Special mention must be made of military history. A new work front is opening up here connected with a reinterpretation of military-historical events of the past, with an in-depth study of World War II and the Great Patriotic War and their lessons and experience, with the development of military art, and with the study of military conflicts. At the same time, the need arises for a more thorough analysis of various military phenomena which accompanied past wars and of their immediate and long-term consequences. A fundamental assessment both of deciding battles as well as of many local (including unfinished) operations, and an objective demonstration of all processes of war and of the real military leadership hand of military leaders of all belligerents are required with consideration of new facts and data. In this connection an objective need has matured for an urgent renewal of work to create both a multivolume history of the Great Patriotic War as well as other capital works on the history of military art and on individual problems of war. The development of military art in Russia should be researched especially. At the same time, work must be activated to study foreign military experience, and the preparation of fundamental works on the history of wars and of military art from ancient times up to our days must be organized. In other words, we are entering a new stage of development of Russian military science, realization of which will require a sharp intensification of military-scientific work at all levels and the conduct of a set of closely interconnected, basic and applied military-political, military-theoretical and military-technical research. In accordance with this, the entire system of the scientific research structure needs reorganizing--involvement of a wide circle of skilled military cadres in performing tasks of scientific support of armed forces organizational development, evolution and employment, and genuine mobilization of the country's entire military-scientific potential. The discussion which has unfolded in the journal's pages can contribute actively to successful resolution of these problems. Colonel General A. A. Danilevich Candidate of Military Sciences * * * Philosophical problems of military theory are especially pertinent now, when Russia's national-state interests and military policy are forming and the Russian Federation Armed Forces are being reformed. To create a modern army it is necessary to develop new ideological principles, determine basic directions, and formulate value ideals distinct from those which existed in Marxist-Leninist ideology. This task can be accomplished within the framework of various sciences, both traditional as well as embryonic: military science, military-historical science, philosophy of war, military political science, military economics, military sociology. For this it is necessary to "audit" them to establish the truth and depth of cognition of war and the Army and, most important, create new concepts meeting Russia's socioeconomic and strategic situation. From this standpoint I would like to examine the interrelationship, social role and functions of totalitarian socialism and Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism's function was to support CPSU and state political strategy theoretically, ideologically and spiritually and to protect and glorify the Communist Party and socialist system. This task was accomplished both by developing true and truthful knowledge as well as by distorting reality and creating myths and legends. I will name some of them: world socialist revolution, dictatorship of the proletariat, complete and final victory of socialism, developed socialist, decaying capitalism, imperialism as the eve of socialist revolution, international duty, peaceful coexistence, and so on. The Marxist-Leninist teaching on war and the Army played an important role in theoretical support of CPSU policy. This is explainable. It was impossible to achieve world socialist supremacy without armed violence and wars. Therefore the corresponding concepts, myths and legends were created here too: theory of socialist violence, absolutization of the economic factor as the source and cause of wars, concept of just wars, absence of a domestic function in socialist armies, victory with little blood, right to be first to initiate war, fight on foreign territories, victory in a nuclear war, the system of capitalism will cease to exist after a nuclear war, and so on. The very nature of the totalitarian socialist state was creating hothouse conditions for developing Marxism-Leninism and its teaching on war and the Army, and it contributed to establishment of its theoretical and organizational monopoly among all social and natural-technical sciences. It was more than the science of sciences. It was a superscience, having monopolized methodological and ideological functions with respect to all military theory. Only party leaders and general secretaries acted as creators of Marxism-Leninism and the teaching on war and the Army. Only they could utter "truths." The CPSU created a powerful propaganda system, which forcibly introduced Marxist-Leninist ideology to the awareness of people, including Armed Forces personnel. The party created the "Iron Curtain" and isolated spiritual life and military-theoretical thinking from world spiritual values, from world military science. Party ideologues distorted scientific ideas of western scientists, falsified military history, and subjected the achievements of western military theorists to criticism using primitive arguments. Political slogans and actual reality often contradicted each other in the Soviet Union. For example, party documents proclaimed that the socialist army performed only an external function, but practice did not conform to the myth. The army was used in putting down the Kronshtadt revolt, the Tambov uprising, and in Novocherkassk, Vilnius, Tbilisi and Baku. Therefore the question is especially acute today: Just what is to be done when Marxism-Leninism and its teaching on war and the Army are in a state of crisis? Marxism-Leninism cannot be reformed, just as it is impossible to reform totalitarian socialism, although its evolution is not precluded. Marxism-Leninism and its teaching on war and the Army cannot be the spiritual, theoretical basis for creating a new Russian Army. World military-philosophical and military-theoretical thought, a great contribution to which was made by Russian and Soviet theorists, must become its basis. Marxism-Leninism contains true and false knowledge; it cannot be expunged from the history of the 19th and 20th centuries. True knowledge of the Marxist teaching on war and the Army should, in my opinion, be included in the newly forming sciences, above all the philosophy of war, military political science and military sociology. False propositions of Marxist-Leninist teaching are subject to oblivion. A system of scientific knowledge on war and the Army was created in the Soviet Army. It needs substantial correction of course. And the most important thing in it is the replacement of Marxism-Leninism and its teaching on war and the Army with new sciences: philosophy of war, political science, sociology and its military aspects. In my view, in forming a new system of knowledge it is advisable to remember that any science has an international character. There was no Soviet, socialist or bourgeois military science. There is no American, Russian or Ukrainian military science now. There is a single military science. But the contribution of each state's scientists to various sciences is not equivalent. One can speak of leader states and their outstanding achievements in particular areas. One people left the world more of a military-theoretical heritage, and another less. We can be proud both of the Russian as well as the Soviet military-theoretical heritage. A correction of the scientific system of knowledge on war and the Army and formation of a new methodological base will contribute to creation of a powerful Russian Army and to a theoretical and spiritual base of a new concept for educating its officers and men. Major General (Reserve) Yu. Ya. Kirshin Doctor of Philosophical Sciences Professor * * * The importance of the problem under discussion is difficult to overestimate. Military theory is the unified ideological-methodological basis for many theories encompassing military science as a whole. As a form of scientific knowledge, military theory provides an integral conception of its fundamental principles and in particular of its important components such as object, subject, structure, boundaries, and correlation with other sciences. It is systematic in nature and quite legitimately includes other interrelated theories of those relatively independent disciplines and sectors of knowledge which are its components. It is common knowledge that there was a period in the history of domestic military science when it was called "Soviet military science," and it was then that it was dissolved in the teaching of "Marxism-Leninism on war and the Army." As the principal object of cognition and research of military science, war was studied above all by Marxist-Leninist philosophy, political economy and scientific communism. The objects of historical materialism were wars and armies in all historical epochs; objects of political economy were the interrelationships of economy, war and the Army; objects of scientific communism were revolutionary wars. And in the early 1960's a new direction also appeared--the "Marxist-Leninist teaching on protection of the socialist homeland, achievements of socialism, and communism in the process of being built." This was one of the reasons why military science, divided up among many sciences, just was not recognized as an independent field of knowledge. And to this day there is no department of military sciences in the Russian Federation Academy of Sciences (previously the USSR Academy of Sciences). The object of military science, war, and its subject, warfare, were defined fully correctly for military science. But it seems to me this now no longer fully reflects reality, since significant changes also occurred in the functions of armed forces. This is especially clearly visible in the new Russian Federation military doctrine recently adopted. Functions of the Armed Forces are defined here such as operational localization of the beginning of tension, stopping possible military operations, peacekeeping operations, involvement of Russian Federation Ministry of Defense troops in assisting organs of internal affairs and internal security troops, and so on. Nuclear weapons also have new functions now. They no longer are a means of conducting military operations, but have become a political tool for deterring aggression. Thus, the subjective area of military science substantially broadened and went beyond the bounds of warfare. Perhaps for now only in the first approximation it can be called the "employment of armed forces," which would conform to these changes to a greater extent. I agree that the new situation in Russia as well as in its Armed Forces requires resolution of long urgent problems of military theory. The teaching of Marxism-Leninism on war and the Army considered general sociological laws and wars as a whole and was a unified methodological foundation of many sciences, including military science. Now this proposition is being revised. Basically this unified methodological foundation simply is being rejected, but nothing new is offered in its place. A distinctive vacuum has formed in military theory, which hardly will be filled by new areas of military knowledge which have appeared such as geopolitics, military political science and security theory. I would like to continue the thought connected with the study and research of military history problems. We studied this scientific discipline a long time with great distortions, since in fact military history and military art of the CPSU was studied in curricula of military educational institutions. We even looked at military history of ancient eras from this aspect. Evidently it still is not soon that we will have an impartial military history such as it must be in reality. Not everything also is correctly stated in the methodology of research of military history problems. As a rule, scientific methods are absent from dissertations being defended in this science. Basically there is only an enumeration of what occurred when. In the best instance, new historical documents are placed in scientific circulation, but little attention is devoted to the direct development of military science. Major General V. I. Slipchenko Doctor of Military Sciences Professor, Corresponding Member, Russian Federation Academy of Natural Sciences * * * The ideological and moral reassessment of values generated a profound, largely painful turning point in the life of the country and world, and we are its contemporaries. Society found itself in a situation where past scientific work, moral reference points and regulative standards are not working, but there are no new ones which characterize modern realities with objective precision. This has a pernicious effect on all walks of life of society and all kinds of human activity. The absence of a generally recognized system of value orientations has a devastating effect on statehood and all its attributes and institutions, including the Army. The eroded nature of ideological principles which consolidate the state's military organization and elevate people's military activity turns the Army into a phantom, whose existence becomes a useless or even harmful waste of people's efforts and state assets. A particular theoretical resolution of ideological, moral and ethical questions as well as rejection of any resolution of them whatsoever hardly is only of cognitive significance. It either gives the state and society reliable reference points of endeavor or directs their activity into a false channel and leads to costs and defeats. Suffice it to recall that a unilateral interpretation of conversion turned out to be not only a ruinous destruction of the military-industrial complex, but also a weakening of the country's scientific-technical potential; official discussion about unified and then Combined Armed Forces of the CIS and about a unified defense space engendered many problems for Russia in military organizational development that are difficult to solve to this day; the slogan "the Army is outside of politics" seriously disoriented the political elite and counterelite (opposition), society, and the Army itself. Today the "Army's peacekeeping activity," as any use of the Russian Armed Forces and various forms of its activeness (including combat operations and "fire for effect") are called more and more often, is included among such phantom words today. Thus, development of a political and philosophical concept of the state's military activity must precede the establishment of constitutional and legal rules regulating the military sphere of society's life and a determination of specific measures in this area. Until recently the Marxist-Leninist teaching on war and the Army provided the "only correct resolution" of all such questions in our country. But the new conditions showed that this aggregate of officially approved theoretical propositions on the military-political realities of social life does not meet modern needs and requirements. For familiar reasons, the "Marxist-Leninist teaching on war and the Army" acquired in fact the nature of an illustration and substantiation of decisions made by the country's political leadership and became a canonic code of ideologized dogmas, which did not explain life, but drove it into the framework of a given scheme, leaving everything that did not fit into it on the outside. The sober, even harsh reassessment of values natural for a transition period leads to the conclusion that propositions brought together into the Marxist-Leninist teaching on war and the Army are not, strictly speaking, Marxist-Leninist, since they include many conclusions and assessments formulated not only by K. Marx, F. Engels and V. I. Lenin, but to a considerable extent before or after them, and they cannot be viewed as a teaching, since they do not provide an integral, comprehensive development of the theory of war and the Army. In reassessing the system of knowledge in question from the standpoint of new political thinking, it is impossible to slip to the position of reckless denial. It is necessary to see that there are propositions in it that were incorrect and erroneous from the beginning, that there are assessments correct for their time but now obsolete, and that there are generalizations of permanent significance. The task is to separate the wheat from the chaff. How can this be done? What must come to replace the Marxist-Leninist teaching on war and the Army? Without taking the liberty of providing an exhaustive final answer, I would like to direct attention to several points. A realization of the need for a social-science, humanitarian analysis of the military sphere of life is the result neither of Soviet nor of post-Soviet specifics. For example, N. N. Golovin was insisting on this back in the early 1930's. It is hardly possible and advisable to constitute a new system of views within the framework of a unified metascience. The nucleus of this system evidently is formed by military political science. This is a special branch of social science studying the theory and practice of military organizational development, the mechanisms, structures and institutions of military policy of modern states, and the status and development trends of military-political attitudes in individual countries and in the world as a whole. It studies those aspects of political life directly linked with the creation and use of military force as a factor of policy, and those military phenomena and processes which carry in themselves political content. This determines its difference both from general political science disciplines (science of the state, international relations theory, ethnology, conflictology and so on) and from military science (strategy, military art, theory of military organizational development and so on). The development and spread of philosophical, political science, economic, psychological and other knowledge about war and the Army are not a strictly academic task and are of great practical significance. By acting as an important aspect of political culture of society and the individual, they help people independently understand political contradictions of history and modern times, see the deep-seated springs of political dynamics, and understand their own capabilities for entering into those dynamics.
