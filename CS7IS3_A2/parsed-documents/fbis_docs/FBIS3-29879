The two sides have already reached agreement on control transfer points. Last week, they agreed on beyond-point rights where South Korea would connect to Europe from Beijing while China would fly to the United States via Seoul, the officials said. They also agreed on letting multiple airlines serve the Seoul- Beijing route from both countries, allowing Asiana and Korean Air to fly into the Chinese capital. While China is expected to service only Seoul, South Korean carriers are likely to acquire other destinations such as Qingdao, Dalian and Shenyang, according to the officials. "Technical questions remain, however, and they are issues for airline companies and transportation authorities to handle," said one official. The technical issues deal mostly with industrial profits as South Korean companies are likely to earn more than their Chinese competitors on the Seoul-Beijing route, officials said. Chinese authorities are said to be asking for special measures to balance out the profit margins.
