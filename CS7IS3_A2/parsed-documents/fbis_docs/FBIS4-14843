First of all, I would like to express my gratitude for the big contribution that you are making to the matter of the peaceful settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia. I note with great satisfaction the extremely objective and constructive character of your speech. It clearly points out those counteractions that are hindering the achievement of substantial progress at the Geneva negotiations, which is the fault of the Gudauta grouping. I would like to emphasize that this grouping does not want to see a successful conclusion to the Geneva negotiations and, primarily, the introduction of UN troops into the region, which should ensure the dignified and safe return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes. The separatists want to maintain the existing situation and transform the democratic structure, which has been changed by force, into an irreversible phenomenon. I would like to point out also that, if we need UN troops to ensure the security of the refugees and displaced persons, the aim of the Gudauta grouping is to use them to violate the territorial integrity of Georgia and camouflage the filtration of refugees and displaced persons. It was pointed out at the session of the Security Council that the introduction of UN troops into the region and the return of refugees and displaced persons are interrelated issues and humanity demands that these problems be resolved in the shortest period of time. It is also significant that, in its Resolution 901 of 4 March 1994, the Security Council requests that the secretary general submit to the Council by 21 March a report on "any progress" achieved at the Geneva negotiations and on the existing situation in the area, with particular attention paid to those circumstances that could be used as a basis for the deployment of peacekeeping troops, and on the forms for the creation of these troops (Paragraph 2; there is an English text). We believe that, in accordance with existing rules, in order to deploy these troops, both the agreement of the two sides and the achievement of progress at the talks are necessary. In the memorandum on mutual understanding and the communique, both sides involved in the conflict request that the UN introduce peacekeeping troops. Thus, the first condition has been satisfied. As regards the second condition, the situation here, as you know, is very complex: What can be considered as "any progress" on the path toward a full-scale settlement?! At the third round of negotiations held in Geneva and New York, two documents were the focus of attention: The joint statement and the quadrilateral agreement on the voluntary return of refugees and displaced persons. We believe that the point that stipulates the creation of a standing committee for the elaboration of proposals on the political and legal status of Abkhazia is of particular significance. In order to guarantee the preservation of both the distinctiveness of a small nation and Abkhazia's statehood, we are ready to give them the following rights: 1. The territorial supremacy of Abkhazia's state power (or the impossibility of changing the territory of Abkhazia without its agreement). 2. The right to have its own constitution. 3. The right to have its own state language (or languages). 4. The right to have its own state symbols. 5. Representation in the highest body of state power in the Republic of Georgia. 6. Respect for the rights of the entire multinational population of Abkhazia. 7. Broad local self-administration. Apart from the aforementioned, we are ready to guarantee the possibility of Abkhazia's self-organization within specific limits in accordance with the Republic of Georgia Constitution and the Law on Abkhazia, which implies: 1. The right to determine its own system of supreme and local state bodies; 2. The right to determine its own administrative and territorial division; 3. The right to have its own legislation; 4. The right of legislative initiative in the Republic of Georgia's supreme state bodies; In order to raise Abkhazia's political and legal status and impart real and specific substance to its jurisdiction, we are ready to implement the division of the objects and powers of administration between the supreme state bodies of the Republic of Georgia and Abkhazia, for which purpose the following has to be determined: 1. Abkhazia's exclusive jurisdiction; 2. The Republic of Georgia's exclusive jurisdiction; 3. Joint jurisdiction. The list of specific objects appertaining to each of these points will be determined during the course of the negotiations. We support the maximum expansion of both the jurisdiction of Abkhazia and the joint jurisdiction of the center and Abkhazia within the limits established by world constitutional practice. As regards the mechanism for legitimizing the agreements adopted on the division of the objects and powers of administration, I believe this should be implemented by means of a law on Abkhazia. I think this law should be adopted either by a special constituent body created by the sides involved in the conflict or by the whole population of Abkhazia in a referendum and then approved by the Georgian Parliament. In order to ensure the protection and implementation of the adopted agreements, it is desirable to have international guarantees from the UN and the CSCE. As regards the agreement on refugees and displaced persons, the provision that is being proposed to us by the Abkhazian side is unacceptable since it prohibits a large number of the refugees from returning home peacefully. Almost all family members have been fighting with weapons in their hands for the territorial integrity of their motherland. Many of them belong to armed formations even today. However, all of them are awaiting a peaceful settlement of the conflict and are ready to lay down their weapons and return peacefully to their native homes. The groundless demand of the Abkhazian separatists was rejected by the Security Council that, in its Resolution 896 (1994), recognizes the right of the refugees and displaced persons to return without "any prior conditions." Hence, the Geneva negotiations were deadlocked on account of the position adopted by the Gudauta grouping. In our view, UN troops should be deployed in Abkhazia immediately and talks on the organized return of refugees continued. Otherwise, hundreds of thousands of desperate people will spontaneously enter the region, which will make it impossible to preserve peace. The deployment of UN troops in Abkhazia will bring about a change in the atmosphere of anarchy and terror and will force the separatists to fulfill the obligations that are recognized on the basis of the memorandum and communique. All these formations and people who entered the region to take part in the armed conflict should be disarmed and expelled. In this way, taking into account these views, we consider it possible to return once more to a discussion of both documents but, if the Abkhazian side again wrecks the conclusion of the quadrilateral agreement, of the two variants of the joint statement proposed by us, one should be enough for the adoption of the decision on the deployment of UN troops by the Security Council. As regards the assertion by representatives of the Abkhazian side that the decree adopted by the Georgian Parliament on 10 March of this year has ostensibly hindered the continuation of the process of negotiations, this does not correspond to the truth. I would like to explain that Point 2 of this decree states that the Supreme Soviet of the Abkhazian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in its present composition has been disbanded, without referring to Abkhazia's autonomous statehood as such. We have always conducted negotiations (and will continue to do so) with our opponents from Gudauta in their capacity as a side that is participating de facto in the conflict and not as the legitimate power in Abkhazia. This cannot be otherwise as a body of power, in whose work exactly half (32) of the 64 elected deputies have not been participating for almost two years now and are resident outside its borders, cannot be viewed as being legal. All the more so as, owing to the quotas established by an apartheid electoral law, it is precisely that half of the deputies who have been banished that represents the largest part of the Abkhazian population -- 300,000 people, whereas the other half can be viewed as representing at best the 160,000 inhabitants left in Abkhazia (30 percent of the prewar population). There is no time to be lost. Mr. Chairman, what is needed is a swift response. It is now clear to everyone that local hot spots and aggressive separatism are bringing us to all-out war. I hope that you will take into account the arguments outlined above and will do everything to ensure a peaceful end to the conflict in the shortest possible time.
