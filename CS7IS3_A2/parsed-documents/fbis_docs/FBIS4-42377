The plight of Bosnia's Muslims has become the latest anti-Western rallying cry for Iran's leadership, which is trying to whip up revolutionary fervour to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the Ayatollah Khomeini's death on Saturday. Photographs depicting the suffering of Muslims in the besieged Bosnian town of Gorazde are prominent in the lobbies of several hotels in the capital, and the subject has dominated Friday prayers at Tehran University for months. In spite of its economic crisis, Iran is sending arms to Islamic fundamentalists in the West Bank and Gaza, Algeria and Sudan, and last month donated 1 million pounds to Bosnian Muslims. Tehran radio began broadcasting propaganda in Serbo-Croat on short-wave transmissions to Bosnia. Iranian government officials and diplomats in Tehran believe President Rafsanjani would like to see better ties with the West, but is being forced to retreat by pressure from hardliners. Iran's foreign policy has hardened markedly in recent weeks. Tehran attacked Saudi Arabia after Riyadh prevented Iranian pilgrims holding anti-Western demonstrations during the annual haj pilgrimage. And yesterday the Iranians arrested two Iraqis they claimed were high-ranking intelligence officers sent to organise sabotage. Iranian leaders are using the row with Britain to prove their revolutionary credentials while at the same time presenting Tehran as the Islamic world's leading champion of dispossessed Muslims. Radical groups which have the upper hand are urging Iran to sever ties with Britain following accusations that a listening device was planted in the Iranian Embassy in London. Hojjat-oleslam Rafsanjani tried to tackle the hard-liners last autumn by dissolving the 15 Khordad Foundation, a shadowy pseudocharitable organisation based in Qom which put a 1.3 million [currency not specified] bounty on Salman Rushdie's head. However, the move was blocked by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, who went on Tehran Radio to insist that Muslims worldwide were duty-bound to murder Rushdie. "The two men have had at least one screaming row over (Salman) Rushdie," an Iranian official said. "Rafsanjani would love to crush these autonomous religious circles that are getting in his way, but they are financially independent and constitutionally they are answerable to Khamenei. The Rushdiefatwa remains a rallying cry for radicals hoping to reinvigorate waning revolutionary fervour, but it has impeded the President's attempts to improve relations with the West and win investment crucial to the faltering economic reforms on which he has staked his reputation. Iranian hard-liners have gained strength following the economic crisis which is blamed on Hojjat-oleslam Rafsanjani's programme. The President surprised diplomats last month by taking a high profile in the row with Britain by alleging that M16 was bugging the Iranian Embassy in London. He incited the Iranian media, and several newspapers urged the government to sever ties with what one paper called "the ageing father of colonialism." Despite the unpopularity of Iran's Islamic leadership, its attempts to incite anti-British sentiment are guaranteed some success in a society ready to believe conspiracy theories against the old colonial master whose history of meddling in Iranian affairs is taught to children in all schools.
