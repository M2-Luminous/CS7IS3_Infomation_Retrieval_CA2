FBIS4-47814 "drafr086_c_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Article Views Possible Make-Up of New Cabinet Article Views Possible Make-Up of New Cabinet MB0405121494 Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English 4 May 94 p 1-2 MB0405121494 Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY English BFN [Report by Tim Cohen] [Text] A bruising fight for the deputy presidency had developed between ANC chairman Thabo Mbeki and secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa, while Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee and Finance Minister Derek Keys were likely to hold their posts, ANC insiders speculated yesterday. Mandela, who is due to announce his Cabinet next week, is likely to select three to five "Cabinet secretaries" to oversee Cabinet Departments and make up the ANC's exclusive "inner sanctum". Tipped for these posts are Mbeki or Ramaphosa to oversee Foreign Affairs and Defence, ANC economic planning department head Trevor Manuel to oversee economic and financial matters and SACP [South-African Communist Party] chairman Joe Slovo to oversee judicial and constitutional issues. Other Cabinet secretaries will oversee welfare, education, social services and administration. Having a "cabinet within a Cabinet" would allow Mandela to retain Keys and Coetsee in their posts by making them responsible to a higher, but less experienced, authority. The debate over a Reconstruction and Development portfolio is continuing, with some arguing that it would cut across too many other portfolios. Former COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] general secretary Jay Naidoo is favoured to take such a portfolio. Other good bets would be mainly from the ANC's national executive committee, including: Law and Order -- Sydney Mufamadi; Trade and Industry -- Tito Mboweni; Mineral and Energy Affairs -- Marcel Golding; Health -- Nkosazana Zuma; Posts and Telecommunications -- Pallo Jordan; Science and Technology -- Mohammed Valli Moosa; Women and Youth -- Gertrude Shope; Information -- Gill Marcus; Sport -- Steve Tshwete; Constitutional Development -- Zola Skweyiya; and Commission for Administration -- Josiah Jele. Other NP [National Party] members could be Foreign Minister Pik Botha, Constitutional Affairs Minister Roelf Botha, Constitutional Affairs Minister Roelf Meyer and Public Enterprises Minister Dawie de Villiers. Meyer could be offered Justice, but speculation that Botha will retain Foreign Affairs is understood to be unfounded. Mandela has indicated his desire to placate right-wing whites and could retain Agriculture Minister Kraai van Niekerk or his deputy, Tobie Meyer. He also wants to include a PAC member in the Cabinet and could be constitutionally required to include Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Several minor posts, including Transport, Water Affairs and Forestry, could go to these candidates. Education could go to ANC education desk head John Samuels, although he may not be elected in which case Randell van den Heever could be a candidate. Former ANC Youth League leader Peter Mokaba has positioned himself to be Tourism Minister, while Mac Maharaj and Pravin Gordhan are likely to be included. Former COSATU members, including Chris Dlamini and Alec Erwin, seem likely candidates for Manpower Minister.
