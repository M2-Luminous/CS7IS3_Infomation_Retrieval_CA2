The Americans did it for the first time in World War II, precisely on Orthodox Easter in April 1944, when they bombed towns of their Serbian allies, including Belgrade, in order to allegedly destroy facilities of the German army. This time they did it while Croats in the U.S. were "democratically" celebrating in their clubs and churches throughout the U.S. April 10 -- the day when the Nazi puppet independent state of Croatia was created under Hitler's patronage in World War II. If one adds to this the fact that the world has recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent state on April 6, 1991, at the 50th anniversary of the German bombing of Belgrade, it is hard to resist the impression that someone has deliberately been playing with historical dates. It is impossible at this point to foresee the consequences of the NATO (i.e. U.S.) raid on Serb positions in Bosnia but this heinous act should be a signal for the Serbs to sober up and give up their illusions about "the country of brave and free," as the Americans like to think of themselves. What they did near Gorazde is a cowardly act of power-wielders manipulated by the flickering images on the TV screen who have lost the ability to form judgement under the loads of money offered by Moslem, Croatian, Jewish and who knows whose else lobbies. Giving the "green light" for air strikes on Bosnian Serbs, the U.N. and its secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali waded even deeper into the moral swamp from which they can hardly be expected to walk out clean. Butrus-Ghali's spokesman Joe Sills said on Monday that the real objective of the air attack had been to protect the Moslem enclave of Gorazde while protection of U.N. monitors had been only "a moral framework" for the action. In other words, it was a false excuse. Even Butru-Ghali himself clearly indicated in a report to the U.N. Security Council that Moslems had used the U.N.-declared "safe havens" for training and resting of their troops and for armed provocations against Serb positions. The U.N. Secretary-General's Adviser Chinemaya Garrehan and current Chairman of the U.N. Security Council Colin Keating last week also confirmed that the fighting around Gorazde had been initiated by Moslem forces. All these facts, however, were completely forgotten under the pressure of U.S. and NATO hawks, who were eager to drop bombs on Serbs and thus force them to bow to unacceptable conditions for peace. All things considered, the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) commander, British General Michael Rose, who has proved himself highly sensitive to his media image, seems to have played the most dishonest role because he requested air strikes despite the fact that he had previously given 48 hours to the Moslem and Serb sides to think again about possibilities for reaching a comprehensive peace accord. Such an accord has been proposed by the Serb side, and rejected by the Moslem, but even that fact has been hidden from the public at East River. After the air strikes on Serbs, Washington can expect new Moslem provocations and terrorist actions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, because crime is obviously worth their trouble. Even Bosnian Moslem Deputy Prime Minister Ejup Ganic made hints in that direction when he told the U.N. Security Council on Monday that Moslems would not negotiate unless Serbs withdrew from their positions around Gorazde to the positions they held on March 30. He called for new air strikes -- including the blowing up of bridges, roads and lines of supply in the Bosnian Serb territories -- in order to force the Serbs to agree to a peace solution fashioned to fit the interests of the Moslems and the West.
