The mediator and the troika of observers succeeded in having the two sides agreeing to four of the five [as heard] points of the second document under discussion. The four points are: general principles on political tolerance, nondiscriminatory coexistence of all ethnic groups, the involvement of all Angolans in the process of national reconciliation regardless of their political, ethnic, and religious origin, and the adoption by the news media of a behavior that conforms with patriotism and a unitary state. This afternoon's plenary session was scheduled to deal with the only outstanding issue, but it was replaced by separate consultations because the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola introduced a proposal that the government delegation rejected outright.
