And we even fail to pay very much attention to the statistical data which, even if they do not speak about the opposite situation, in any case force us to subject to doubt the thesis that is being propagandized -- the thesis concerning the unbearability of the conditions for existence. As is attested to by the data provided by the oblast statistics administration, consumer prices of the basic commodities and services by December 1992 rose during the year that had passed by a factor of 8.1, but the population's monetary income during 1993, according to preliminary computations, rose, as compared with 1992, by a factor of 9.7. During 1993 the average per-capital nominal monetary income with respect to the living wage constituted 197 percent (in 1992, 157 percent). Nevertheless, during last year almost one-fifth of the population had a per-capital income lower than the living wage. The situation in the labor market also is not as catastrophic as is usually depicted. As compared with 1992, last year the number of workers in the oblast economy (excluding cooperatives and small and private enterprises) dropped by only 2.7 percent. As of the beginning of January 1993, employment-service agencies had 2800 unemployed citizens on their rolls. During the year their number decreased by 24 percent. Eleven hundred people have been recognized as being unemployed. As compared with January-November 1992, profit in 1993 increased by a factor of 8, including 7.5 in industry. But the profitability of production in industry was at the level of 41-44 percent. (For purposes of comparison: according to data in BSE [Large Soviet Encyclopedia], the profitability of industry in the USSR in 1970 was only 21.5 percent.) True, it was achieved as a result of the fact that the enterprises are unjustifiably raising the price of their output, which is also attested to by statistics: the entire increase in profit last year was obtained at the expense of the increase in prices. More than 16 percent of all the enterprises and organizations in the oblast operated unprofitably in January-November 1993. The number of enterprises operating at a loss, as compared with the same period in 1992, dropped by 7 percent, although in industry their number asincreased by 17 percent. For the oblast as a whole, however, in the state sector of the economy the share of the enterprises operating at a loss is larger than in the nonstate sector, by 3.8 percentage points. Industrial production in 1993 was distinguished by instability. The slump in production continued, but by the end of the year one could note a tendency toward a slowing down in it. Whereas the correlation of the volumes of production during the first quarter of 1993 and the same period of 1992 constituted a total of 79.4 percent, for the year as a whole the volume of industrial production as compared with the 1992 level came to 88.3 percent. And in such branches as energy machine-building, the garment industry, and the butter and cheese, dairy, and printing industries, the volumes of production even surpassed the 1992 indicators. The production slump in agriculture last year was lower than in industry, and came to only 8 percent. For a long time people have tried to convince us of the farmers' inability to feed us in the next few years, but the 1993 indicators say just the opposite: more than half (52 percent) of the volume of the gross output of agriculture was produced on the population's personal farms and peasant (individual-farmer) farms. As of 1 January 1994 the number of the latter in the oblast was 3183. They had use of 165,800 hectares of land. Economic difficulties had a considerably stronger effect in capital construction. In 1993 the volumes of capital investments at the expense of all sources of financing dropped by 33 percent and come to 1188 billion rubles, which is the consequence of the reduction during the past two years of the investment activity rate of the enterprises. The rates of the slump in the volumes of capital investments in agriculture (by 53 percent) are considerably higher than in the other branches. Capital investments in the nonproduction sphere decreased by 2 percent and came to 43.9 billion rubles. However, the share of funds for housing and social-cultural construction in the overall volume of capital investments rose from 35 percent in 1992 to 37 percent in 1993. As of 1 January 1994, 1375 enterprises in the oblast were privatized, of which 439, or 3 percent, were privatized in 1993. The share of the privatized large-scale enterprises that are federal property increased from 5 percent in 1992 to 11 percent in 1993. The number of enterprises that were oblast and municipal property dropped somewhat, respectively from 18 to 14 percent and from 76 to 75 percent. On the average, the value of one privatized enterprise that is municipal property was 2.7 million rubles; oblast property, 39.6 million; and federal property, 88.4 million rubles. The total proceeds from the sale of property to new owners (including the funds accruing from enterprises that had been privatized in 1992) came to 5.7 billion rubles of monetary funds and 526,300 privatization checks. More than 60 percent of the funds received from the privatization of enterprise property became part of the income of the oblast budget and the rayon and city budgets. As of 1 January 1994, 82,300 apartments (30.6 percent of the total number), including 37,500 in 1993, were privatized. The demographic situation in the oblast remains strained. In 1993, 9600 persons were born in Smolensk Oblast. That is 1200 (11 percent) less than in 1992. The number of persons who died was 19,200, or 2900 (17.6 percent) more.
