The request came as Home Affairs Minister Hajime Ishii, of the key coalition party Shinseito, was preparing to hold a seminar on Sunday in Kobe for a fee of 20,000 yen per participant. Ishii insisted that he will go ahead with the seminar, arguing, "It's not a fundraising party but a study session." Organizers expect about 1,000 people to attend the seminar, at which Construction Minister Koji Morimoto and Economic Planning Agency chief Toshio Terasawa will deliver speeches. Kumagai, also a member of Shinseito, has repeatedly urged Ishii to drop the plan. Ishii says the seminar was planned before he became home affairs minister in late April.
