FR941130-2-00087 FR941130-2-00054 (i) St. Tammany Parish Library, Slidell, LA. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Dominic A. Amatore, Deputy Director, Public Affairs Office, Code CA01, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL 35812, 205&hyph;544&hyph;6533; or Ms. Myron Webb, Director, Public Affairs Office, Code PA00, Stennis Space Center, MS 39529&hyph;6000, 601&hyph;688&hyph;3341. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: To meet the technical and programmatic challenges of developing a new space vehicle(s), key advanced technologies in propulsion systems must be explored. The Program would be designed to demonstrate the technology maturity levels necessary to reduce the development risk of the selected propulsion system(s) to an acceptable level and to produce a highly operable, high thrust-to weight propulsion system. Therefore, NASA is proposing to develop and test one or more liquid engines and components that could be used in the final configuration(s) of a new space vehicle(s). Engines under consideration would use liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. The fuel would be either liquid hydrogen, kerosene, or a combination of the two. Facilities under consideration for testing these engines include, but are not necessarily limited to, those located at MSFC and SSC. Existing test facilities at these two NASA Centers would need to be upgraded to accommodate Program objectives. Modification may include addition of a kerosene tank on the test stand(s), a common structural and functional interface, and an engine mounting adapter. Many aspects of the Program would parallel test activities of propulsion systems undertaken in the 1960's for the Apollo Program. All test facilities at MSFC are located in the southern portion of the Center; in turn, MSFC is almost centrally located within Redstone Arsenal's 15,400 hectares (38,000 acres), with the closest private property being approximately 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the proposed MSFC test facilities. SSC occupies 5,480 hectares (13,480 acres) in western Hancock County, Mississippi, and is surrounded by 50,600 hectares (125,000 acres of acoustical buffer zone. Alternatives for this proposal include, but are not necessarily limited to, (1) alternative test sites, (2) test facility construction and modification options, (3) alternative fuels and engines, and (4) cancellation of the proposed Program (``no action''). The EIS will consider the potential environmental impacts associated with the Program and any needed construction or modification of facilities. An initial assessment of environmental effects suggests that the greatest impacts are likely to arise from noise and air emissions. However, analysis indicates that air quality would remain within the National Ambient Air Quality Standards at both MSFC and SSC. IF MSFC and/or SSC were selected, little environmental impact is anticipated on biological resources, threatened and endangered species, cultural resources, wetlands, and recreational or scenic areas. A public scoping meeting will be held near MSFC at the Ridgecrest Elementary School, 3505 Cerro Vista SW, Huntsville, Alabama, on December 6, 1994, starting at 7:00 pm. Another such meeting will be held near SSC at the Hancock County High School, 7084 Stennis Airport Drive, Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, on December 13, 1994, starting at 7:00 pm. Written public input and comments on environmental issues of the proposed Program, including, but not limited to, test site and facility options and fuel and engine alternatives, as well as related environmental concerns, are hereby solicited. Dated: November 23, 1994. Benita A. Cooper, Associate Administrator for Management Systems and Facilities. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29415 Filed 11&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7510&hyph;01&hyph;M
