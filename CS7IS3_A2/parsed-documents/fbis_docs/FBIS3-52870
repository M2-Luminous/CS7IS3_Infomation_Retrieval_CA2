In conversation, U.S. officials do not hesitate to brandish the "terrorism list" that they prepared themselves and according to which they have classified the world. They keep reminding Syria that it remains on this list and that Hizballah and other organizations working against the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon are being directly supported by Damascus with the blessing and nonobjection of Beirut. With this two-faced stance the Americans are sitting on the fence, as the popular saying goes. They are not opening the door completely to Damascus and Beirut but they are not closing it completely. In common parlance, this is called "blackmail" or "bargaining." In politics it is called "gathering paper" and "negotiating from a strong position." It might be comprehensible and even logical for the Israelis to resort to this method of dealing with an Arab party, including Syria and Lebanon. But it is incomprehensible and illogical for such behavior to come from the United States, which presents itself sometimes as an "honest mediator" and at other times as a "full partner" in the peace process. It is also incomprehensible and illogical for successive U.S. Administrations to continue this policy if they really want to close the file of 50 years of war in the Middle East. Such a policy leads to further Israeli intransigence and to keeping the file open. Assuming that the U.S. logic is correct, "Arab terrorism" is new to the region. Given the age of the crisis and the wars it has spawned, terrorism was first introduced by the Zionists. Hizballah and the various Palestinian and non-Palestinian organizations before it won't be the last if no "just, comprehensive, and permanent" settlement is reached. No one doubts the importance of this summit for settling the Arab-Israeli conflict and for the future of the region in this transitional phase in a world with one superpower. But the world might see the reemergence of two superpowers, even three, four, or five superpowers. President al-Asad is the kind of leader who does not view tomorrow as the next 24 hours, but measures it by decades and generations in human history. This has always been his problem, not only with the United States and the West, but also with his Soviet friends. The Geneva summit in one week's time might be an opportunity for President Clinton, the leader of the sole superpower, to get acquainted with President al-Asad's concept of Syria's "basic role"--to which U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher referred yesterday--not only in a settlement, but in the regional landscape after a settlement and under the new world order.
