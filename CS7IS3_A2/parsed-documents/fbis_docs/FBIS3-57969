The new party's convention has been set for January 18. The regional coordinators named by Martinazzoli as the backbone for the re-baptised formation will organise regional liaison committees, which will then appoint candidates to run in the coming general elections. According to a cartel of incumbent Christian Democrat MPs, however, Martinazzoli has chosen the coordinators badly and is moving wrongly in seeking to create a conservative force to offset the progressive one emerging on the Left. In one move, the "neo-centrists" as they have dubbed themselves, sent Martinazzoli a registered letter demanding the urgent convening of a session of the Christian Democrat National Council, saying that they were not planning to leave the party for the time being. But they also ventilated the possibility that they could break ranks and vote against the Ciampi government in the confidence now scheduled on January 12. [as received] "The confidence debate will be a test case," said one of the group, Pier Ferdinando Casini, alleging institutional bias in favour of the Left Democrats, the major opposition party. "The fact is that the government is cross-eyed. Despite its majority, it looks leftward. I can't exclude any hypothesis, not even a vote against the government." According to the "neo-centrists," Martinazzoli and his planned People's Party should be seeking to form a "grouping" with ex-Christian Democrat Mario Segni, the Northern League and Berlusconi, who has recently thrown his weight as entrepreneur and media mogul behind attempts to stop a left-leaning victory at the polls. Casini welcomed this afternoon's over 2-hour meeting between Berlusconi and Martinazzoli at the latter's villa at Arcore near Milan. No details were available on the meeting, though Berlusconi invited the press in and, after making sure Martinazzoli had made no statement on leaving, described it as "very cordial, let's say the discourse continues." Berlusconi also commented that the conservative parties have so far failed to emerge from the mentality created by proportional representatives into the sort of alliances needed to create a winning bloc in the coming elections by simple majority. Asked how he assesses the objections raised by some of Martinazzoli's aides to an alliance with himself or the Northern League's Umberto Bossi, he said: "It's the death sentence for their party, in other words, a ploy that is openly advantageous to the Left Democrats." The "neo-centrists," who will be releasing a policy document tomorrow, say cooperation with Berlusconi and the League is possible. But, for the time being, unless a "serious revision" is seen, they draw the line at a "tactical" alliance for the elections with the conservative hardliners of the Italian Social Movement, the post-war heir to Benito Mussolini's Fascist Party. But, in an editorial to be published Thursday morning by IL POPOLO, the Christian Democrat mouthpiece, Martinazzoli said he sees a platform including the League or the Social Movement as its reference-points would be "an exercise verging on a short circuit." He also said that, once the Christian Democrat Party had been freed of the "dross" accumulated during decades in power, it would still be able to reflect the need for a balance between "the values of liberty and the aspirations for justice" that are needed to govern an "orderly democratic progress."
