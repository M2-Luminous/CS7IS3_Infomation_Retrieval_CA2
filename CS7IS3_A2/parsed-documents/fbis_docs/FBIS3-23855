As a rule, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA does not intervene in the disputes and conflicts involving colleagues within the editorial offices. But there are exceptions. We decided to publish the interview with Valentin Logunov, former editor in chief of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA (he calls himself the "organizer of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA" and "one of Boris Yeltsin's associates") for several reasons. First, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA is a budget-financed organization and this means that it is paid for by the taxpayers, and if only for that reason its destiny is more than the private affair of the editorial staff alone. In the second place, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA was drawn in to the extremely fierce conflict between the two branches of Russian power and did not emerge from it without losses. In the third place, in the corridors of the State Duma there are discussions of the need to return the parliamentary ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA to the legislators. Valentin Logunov is a former USSR people's deputy and a member of the coordinating council of the Interregional Deputy Group [IDG] of the Union Congress. At the end of September 1993 he was discharged by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin from the position of editor in chief of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. [Koltsov] ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA was shut down twice in three years. The first time by a decree of the State Committee for the State of Emergency and the second time--on the basis of Yeltsin's edict. Why? [Logunov] You see, from the autumn of 1991 through September 1993 ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA made a marked shift in the sense of supporting political leaders. And from the standpoint of past authorities--the State Committee for the State of Emergency--and present ones--President Yeltsin--it turned out to be a politically dangerous publication for both. [Koltsov] You said that the newspaper had made a marked shift. Does this mean that the editor in chief also recanted his initial political views? [Logunov] It is sufficient to leaf through the files of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA to be convinced that this is not true. The newspaper and I, its editor in chief, never betrayed those ideals of the IDG. Remember which ideas came from the IDG: power to the soviets, separation of powers, parliamentarianism, a multiparty system, freedom of the press and speech...and who cast off these white robes when they came to power? Was it not Popov and Yeltsin, the former cochairmen of the IDG? Was it not Burbulis and Poltoranin, former members of the coordinating council of the IDG? Time and the actions of these people showed that the main thing for them was power for its own sake. Even now I think that the Supreme Soviet, with all of its shortcomings, was a most influential and responsible political force, one capable of opposing the antinational policy of the Yeltsin team. And this political, I repeat, political force was suppressed by arms, by the army. The Constitution was trampled upon, dozens of federal laws were grossly violated, and citizens were killed. After what happened I cursed the days when I supported and aided Yeltsin. So others have committed the betrayal. [Koltsov] You fiercely condemn the Yeltsin team but what is your attitude toward politics and politicians close to Khasbulatov? [Logunov] You apparently want to know mainly my attitude toward Khasbulatov. In my view he is one of the politicians of the new wave, after 1990. Apparently his fairly good education, his analytical mind, and his exceptional ability to work have had their effect. I am convinced that he could have done a great deal of good for Russia if the Supreme Soviet had not been forced into a confrontation. I have already had occasion to speak about this but I repeat: The irreconcilability and hostility between the president and the Supreme Soviet was fanned artificially and those I have already mentioned in our conversation were especially successful at this. They were constantly getting the president riled up and agitated. They deliberately drove the parliament into a right-wing, "conservative" corner. Remember how they badgered Khasbulatov. Yeltsin's team, the press, and television used the same devices and methods that were used against Yeltsin himself at one time. All this was loathsome and I am surprised that he could endure such a thing. I chanced to find him in a depressed condition after a regular attack. What can you say to a person when buckets of mud have been slung at him? I said: "Ruslan Imranovich, hang on another year. In a year Russia will understand who is who." He laughed: "A year?! What are you talking about!" Approximately a year later they were shooting at parliament. Of course Khasbulatov had many shortcomings. It seems to me that he had a poor sense of people's psychology. He did not listen enough to others' opinions. He was trusting and untrusting at the same time, depending on his subjective idea of a person. Sometimes he admired himself and was restrained in his assessments of his opponents, which caused him a great deal of harm. But I am convinced that Russia will need Khasbulatov as a politician. True, I am not sure that he will want to work at this after all they have done to him. [Koltsov] Do you think that the suspension of the publication of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA during September and October and your dismissal from your positions--was all this not done to get back at you personally? [Logunov] Well that was probably not the only thing and not the biggest thing that provoked them to take such measures. You see, by that time ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA really had become an influential publication both in Russia and abroad. The newspaper adequately reflected the Supreme Soviet's position and we discussed the political situation in the regions in detail and objectively. And, well, could the authorities who decided to physically destroy the Russian parliament fail to turn their gaze to the newspaper of the Supreme Soviet? Look: On 21 September 1993 the famous Edict No. 1400 came out and on 23 September Chernomyrdin signed the decree on ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, and on 24 September I was dismissed from my position. What speed! [Koltsov] They say that they had to force you to leave your office. [Logunov] The "assumption of power" of the new editor, Natalya Polezhayeva, took place in the presence of three or four armed men. Later I was told that these people were from Mikhail Poltoranin's guard. I do not know, perhaps things would have reached the point of the use of force but I left the office of my own accord. That happened on 5 October, after the White House was fired upon. [Koltsov] You probably do not regard with favor the current editor in chief of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. [Logunov] This person was promoted by Poltoranin. She told me in our first conversation that she could not refuse Mikhail Poltoranin because she owed him a great deal. It is known that Poltoranin went through dozens of applications but they all refused, apparently thinking it unethical to break into a house that was built by others. It seemed to me that Natalya Polezhayeva also was experiencing shame; her entire face was covered with red spots. I even sympathized with her at that time and said that it was not very gentlemanly of Poltoranin to heap such moral responsibility upon a woman's shoulders. But later she obviously overcame her sense of embarrassment and awkwardness. [Koltsov] How do you feel about the talk of turning ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA over to the State Duma? [Logunov] I am convinced that ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA readers do not want this. The circulation of newspapers depends to a certain degree on their political biases. The reader of one newspaper or another is the person who sees in the newspaper he selects a corroboration of his own views. We tried to be an objective newspaper, to present various viewpoints, but at the same time we resolutely defended parliamentarianism, the unity of Russia, the priorities of domestic entrepreneurship, and the spirituality of the nation. It is precisely with these qualities, in my view, that we attract readers. And suddenly, all at once, the reader starts getting a different newspaper. This is like it would be if you paid for one thing in a store and they slipped you something else. Of course the government cannot but understand how unceremoniously it has dealt with the readers but apparently it wants very badly to get its hands on this tidbit. The second point is related to the interests and rights of the journalists of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. About 40 journalists have left it in three months--for political reasons. They could not and did not want to change their political convictions. So I wish to ask the "fathers of Russian democracy": Is this your democracy when a journalist does not have a chance to perform his professional duty, to write in his newspaper what he thinks is true, of that which he is sincerely convinced? And, finally, the third point: To whom should the newspaper belong? I am convinced that it should be either the State Duma or the federal assembly as a whole. The president and government have adequate mass media where they can present their viewpoint. The legislator should have the same opportunity. Possibly the times will come when the mass media really do become independent, but to talk of this today is a deliberate deception. We found out about the "independence" of Bragin television and the pro-presidential newspapers, and we know quite well who supports them and how. Also the utmost in hypocrisy are discussions to the effect that the authorities should not have their own newspapers. When waging these discussions that same Poltoranin had in mind only one authority, the one that did not suit him: the legislative. Now he and people who think as he does have ended up in the Duma and you can be sure that they will gain control of the mass media with the same persistence. The formula is simple: Where Poltoranin is, there too is the power. And it is both funny and sad at the same time. I think that returning ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA to the legislature is one of the first tasks that should be resolved by the State Duma. Then the Duma would be able to communicate with the voters in plain language. But we must not allow this cause to be joined by people who have compromised themselves with destructive qualities, who have manipulated the mass media all these years.
