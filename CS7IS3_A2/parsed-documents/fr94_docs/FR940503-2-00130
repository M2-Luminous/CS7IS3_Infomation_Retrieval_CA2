FR940503-2-00130 FR940503-2-00085 DTC will begin the expansion of its MMI programs with the institutional CDs programs. DTC will begin the pilot program with four bank issuers and will expand the pilot program over the net two months. Until DTC secures the additional $500 million line of credit, the pilot program will be limited to: (1) 120 CD programs, (2) A value not to exceed $20 billion on deposit with DTC, (3) A percentage of the total CD market on deposit at DTC not to exceed 5.7%, and (4) A daily average face amount of CD issuances not to exceed $1 billion. 16 DTC has agreed that if prior to securing the $500 million line of credit the addition of CDs according to the schedule increases simulated breaches of its liquidity resources (currently $760 million), DTC will slow down or stop the addition of CD programs after consultation with the regulators. DTC also has agreed that if subsequent to attaining the additional line of credit, simulations show breaches of DTC's new overall liquidity resources, due to the expansion of the MMI program to include different types of MMI instruments, DTC again will slow down or stop expansion of the program after consultation with the regulators. 17 16 Supra note 11. 17 Supra note 15. The Commission believes that the additional risk management controls to be implemented with the new and enhanced MMI programs in conjunction with the current SDFS system risk management controls should help further reduce the possibility that a double default scenario will exceed DTC's liquidity resources. In addition, the Commission believes the controlled expansion of the SDFS program to include additional types of MMIs will reduce the costs, inefficiencies, and risks associated with the clearance and settlement of physically transferred securities by providing the benefits of centralized, automated, book-entry clearance and settlement. III. Conclusion On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and in particular with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 18 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;93&hyph;12) be, and hereby is, approved on a temporary basis until April 30, 1995. 18 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2). For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 19 19 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
