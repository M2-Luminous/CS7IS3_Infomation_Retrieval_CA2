As in other sectors of the national economy, problems have been building up here and they are holding back production development. The situation is aggravated by the fact that prices of this metal have slumped on the world market (we are largely responsible for this) and demand has fallen in Russia itself. The enterprise leaders addressing the conference insisted that some kind of influence be brought to bear on the energy industry, which has raised the prices of its products -- in their view, this is inhibiting the sector's development. But, as Railways Minister Gennadiy Fadeyev, who also came in for a great deal of criticism, said at the conference, you cannot generate your own economic prosperity at the expense of others. After the conference First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets answered journalists' questions: [Question] How is the government reorganization going to continue, indeed there is still one first deputy chairman vacancy? [Soskovets] There isn't a second first vice premier's post in the plan that I possess. Nor is there an industry commission, which I allegedly head. [Question] The resignations of Gaydar and Fedorov got people saying that the reforms were over. What do you think? [Soskovets] I do not see in what way Fedorov and Gaydar are more market-orientated than I.... The government's main task? We must bring order to Russia.
