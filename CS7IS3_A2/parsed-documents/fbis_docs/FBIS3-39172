[Begin Bambis Bikas recording] A high level diplomatic official and main member of Skopje's negotiating team, who did not want to be identified, told ET-3 exclusively that the three Greek conditions have been accepted for some time, and that Skopje is ready to discuss all issues under dispute with Greece. In a private discussion, this distinguished diplomat and close associate of [Macedonian] President Kiro Gligorov outlined the direction that relations between the two countries will follow. He said we should leave behind the period in which the symbols of our differences prevailed, allow time for tensions to relax, soften our voices, and view the issues in their real dimensions. He added: The U.S. recognition ended a cycle and leads things in the above direction. A move by our side will soon induce the Greek side to move accordingly, but Greece should help us by showing practically that it is indeed interested in improving relations. If the people here see from the approach of the two sides that they will have specific gains, then they will think it is to their benefit for Skopje to make an offer to Greece. Finally, this high level diplomat of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia told us that the government of Andreas Papandreou and the ministry of Karolos Papoulias really want the two sides to move toward defusing tensions and normalizing relations. He stressed: We know there is a willingness for something like this, but first there should be a reduction of tension, less shrill tones, and then a resumption of negotiations. There will be a jointly accepted solution to all unsettled issues. Anyway, no one is interested in the flag with the Star of Veryina, a symbol which our people do not associate with very much. Regarding the name, we can easily agree on a compromise solution, without a winner or loser, which will benefit both peoples, provided the above cooling off period is allowed. [end recording]
