[passage omitted] The Tzomet faction is demanding that the prime minister make it clear whether Zvili's remarks were made with Rabin's knowledge. Tzomet said Rabin had made a commitment that a Palestinian state would not be established, and that not all of the Golan would be handed back. Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan said that if Zvili's remarks were correct, then the State of Israel's days were numbered, and the countdown had started. Likud Bureau chairman, Knesset Member 'Uzi Landau, said after two years of misleading the public and deception, Nisim Zvili had finally spoken the truth on the prime minister's secret intentions. The Likud demanded that Rabin immediately submit to the Knesset the agreements formulated with Jordan and the draft accords with the Syrians. The head of the Golan settlements committee, Eli Malka, said Zvili's remarks were a scandal and deceive the public. If the Labor Party had decided to hand over the Golan, what was the purpose of negotiations? And, if that was the Labor Party's position, he demanded an immediate referendum. On another matter, Absorption Minister Ya'ir Tzaban told the Hashomer Hatza'ir council that residents of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip are making it difficult for the Army to carry out its duties, and their behavior requires a sharp reaction. The residents are demanding security for places that should never have been set up, but refuse to rent empty buildings. Foreign Minister Peres said one should ask out loud what is the point of keeping Netzarim where there are only 28 families and a company of soldiers had to defend them. The chairman of Netzarim's secretariat, Shlomo Kostina, said Peres' remarks disclosed his intentions regarding settlement in the Golan, the Jordan Valley, and Judaea and Samaria. He invited Peres to visit Netzarim now and in 10 years time.
