He said this decision is necessary and may create new dynamics for a Cyprus solution. Addressing the Cyprus-EU Association Council in Luxembourg tonight, Mikhailidhis stressed the need for the balanced expansion of the Twelve to the south with the accession of selected Mediterranean countries such as Cyprus. The foreign minister asked the EU to improve trade relations, particularly regarding Cypriot agricultural products, by extending the exports calendar and increasing the percentages. He also asked for broad Cypriot participation in EU programs. Mikhailidhis suggested tripartite cooperation programs between Cyprus, EU, and the Middle East. Referring to the issue of the EU providing financial support for the occupied areas in an effort to balance development throughout Cyprus, the foreign minister said this could only happen after a Cyprus solution and with the consent of the Cyprus Government and through it. He stressed that providing financial aid before a solution is an act dangerously close to being illegal and supportive of separation, and, therefore, it is unacceptable.
