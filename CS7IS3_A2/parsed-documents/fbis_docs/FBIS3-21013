He expressed the opinion that the market would not improve suddenly as if by magic. Figures relating to the second half of 1993 show that while a nadir has been reached, there were a few bright spots during the year: 1) AEROSPATIALE not only consolidated, but in some cases improved its market position in spite of the difficult period. a) Civil market was particularly down in 1993: -- In the case of aircraft with more than 100 seats, cancellations and new orders balanced each other out. The three major constructors thus consider 1993 to be a year of status quo; -- Demand for commuter aircraft was more vigorous during the 2d half of the year and the ATR [Regional Transport Aircraft] significantly strengthened its position; -- The civilian helicopter market was also in deep depression, although EUROCOPTER increased its share to more than 50 percent of the world market; -- Space products, the Ariane and satellites proved that they could successfully compete, notably, with American products. Key events during the year 1993 were seven faultless Ariane 4 launchings, anticipatory launcher procurement by ARIANESPACE and the starting up of a new satellite platform, Spacebus 3000 with the Arabsat II. b) In the field of military helicopters and missiles: In spite of a continuing slump in the market, there was a definite improvement in export orders which indicated the ability of the company to remain competitive. The French Defense budget for 1994 is better than might have been feared with a market poor in promise for military expenditures. During 1993 orders for civil aircraft and helicopters retracted to around 29 billion francs [Fr] against nearly 40 in 1992, in spite of an improvement in military and space export contracts. At the end of the year, order books stood at Fr130 billion, representing two and a half years of activity. The 1993 revenue of the AEROSPATIALE group was around Fr49.3 billion, a retraction of only 5 percent compared to 1992. 2) Trim-down Steps Already Show Significant Results in 1993. While net profits were still in deficit phase in 1993, there was a significant improvement. This improvement, vital for AEROSPATIALE, was not obtained, as we have seen, through any recovery in the general situation, worse in 1993 than in 1992, but through rigorous restructuring efforts by the company and a remarkable willingness of personnel to accept them. These efforts will continue through 1994. At the time, andebtedness stabilized and even diminished. Now the aim is to return to a balanced situation as soon as possible, and, in any event, no later than 1995.
