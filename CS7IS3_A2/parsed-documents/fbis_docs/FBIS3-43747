The organization says Schutte must go because of his inability to stop right-wingers from operating radio station. ANC northern [Orange] Free State Branch Chairman (Johannes Tlali) has condemned the establishment of the right-wing Radio Koppies [small hills] in his area. The station has been on the air for about a month. Radio Pretoria is continuing broadcasts this week despite the expiry of its temporary license, and Radio Vryheid [freedom] has been set up near Bloemfontein. (Tlali) says Schutte seems unable, or unwilling to deal with the stations. He has called on the Transitional Executive Council to set up the independent broadcasting authority as soon as possible to control all broadcasting frequency bands without bias.
