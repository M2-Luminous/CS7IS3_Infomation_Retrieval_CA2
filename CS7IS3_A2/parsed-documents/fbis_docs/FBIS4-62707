Glinskiy; place and date not given: "The Black Sea Fleet Is Holding Out Thanks to Russia"] [Excerpt] [Glinskiy] Aleksandr Ivanovich, over the past two years, the destiny of the Black Sea Fleet has been sorted out. The Russian and Ukrainian presidents signed protocols in Yalta, Zavidovo, Moscow, and Massandra; they agreed on an urgent and honest resolution to the problem that worries our people. Impressive statements in the press and television followed these meetings. However, when the presidents returned home, their statements acquired another meaning and the protocols' clauses remained unfulfilled. What, do you think, is the reason for this? [Frolov] We will soon celebrate the 10th anniversary of perestroyka, but the old guard still holds the power. People cannot keep the administration in check. To prolong its existence, the powers-that-be exercise the meanest methods: They set the Ukrainian and Russian peoples against each other. These people have been living in peace for over 300 years. What is terrible is that the army is involved in political battles. Over 50,000 servicemen of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are stationed in the Crimea. The Crimean president's decisions are adamantly opposed. The young democracy is under the heel of bureaucracy. [Glinskiy] Aleksandr Ivanovich, our editorial office receives many letters and phone calls. Crimean residents ask: What should we do? They voice concern over the situation around the Black Sea Fleet. You participated in the recent negotiations and I would like to know your opinion: Who is to blame for their failure? [Frolov] I would not draw your attention to the details of the work, which was conducted by the delegations and groups of experts at the Black Sea Fleet headquarters. Mass media published a detailed report on this event. The participants in the negotiations adopted a resolution to divide the fleet. The agreements on the separate location and division of its infrastructure were not implemented. Instead, old bureaucratic tricks were used. The Ukrainian side used dual interpretation of the clauses of the Moscow agreement: The breakdown of the Russian-Ukrainian negotiations was prompted by nothing else but a regular political order from the bureaucracy during the campaign for electing Ukrainian president, setting up a new legislature, and, hence, a new government. Young generals use this high political wave for career purposes. [Glinskiy] Was public opinion or the wishes of the local authorities considered at the negotiations? [Frolov] By the time the Russian and Ukrainian delegations began working, Crimean President Yu. Meshkov and V. Semenov, chairman of the Sevastopol City Executive Council -- who had their own opinion and stance on the issue -- arrived at the Black Sea Fleet headquarters. For example, one in every four Sevastopol residents is directly or indirectly connected with the Black Sea Fleet. Ukrainian Defense Minister V. Radetskyy, head of the Ukrainian delegation, categorically opposed the participation of the representatives of the Crimean and Sevastopol executive branches, even as observers. This is how military bureaucracy views the local authorities. Public opinion is taken into account in civilized states. However, we have another approach. Bureaucrats, who never loved the people and only gave orders, currently do not want to take public opinion into consideration. [Glinskiy] You know that the Army is maintained at taxpayers' expense. But our bureaucrats forget about this. Let us, for example, take the Ukrainian Navy with only three ships that are moored and do not go out to sea due to lack of fuel, ammunition, etc. At the same time, the Ukrainian Navy headquarters has eight admirals, over 500 officers and warrant officers! They have official cars, high expenses, and apartments. They are satisfied with their "duties." Billions of karbovanetses of people's money are spent. [Frolov] It would have been incorrect on my side to speak about the military readiness of the Ukrainian Navy. However, there is no smoke without fire. The [Ukrainian] Defense Ministry has a voracious appetite, however, if wishes were horses, beggars might ride. Having, for example, taken control over two first-class military colleges in Sevastopol, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry simply cannot maintain them. Unique equipment is dismantled and buildings fall into disrepair. Cadets and teaching staff live in poverty. On the basis of these two colleges, a military-naval institute was established. Nothing came of this. Currently, they are speaking about setting up a military academy. Ukraine has not been financing the Black Sea Fleet since last October. Not because it does not want to, but because the coffers are empty. I do not pin hopes on any replenishment in the near future. The Black Sea Fleet is holding out thanks to Russia. It does not simply hold out on its own. I am a deputy fleet commander for combat training. Last year, the Black Sea Fleet ranked second in combat training in comparison to the Northern one.
