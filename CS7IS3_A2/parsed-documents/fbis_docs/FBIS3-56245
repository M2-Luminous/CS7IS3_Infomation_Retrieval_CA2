In a joint statement, Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas and Deputy Romualdas Ozolas demand the oblast's "demilitarization" and "deoccupation," a review of its international status, and the creation of a new state, integrated into the structure of North Europe. Ozolas stated: "At the Potsdam Conference in 1945, the victorious countries entrusted the oblast's administration to the USSR for a period of only 50 years." The Potsdam Conference decision to transfer what is now Kaliningrad Oblast to the Soviet Union was final, irrevocable, and indefinite, which unequivocally follows from the text of the relevant accord. The fact that territorially the oblast belongs to the USSR, and correspondingly to Russia, was subsequently enshrined in the Treaty on the Final Settlement Against Germany of 12 September 1990 and the Treaty on Good-Neighborliness, Partnership, and Cooperation Between the USSR and the FRG of 9 November 1990. As regards the Russian military presence in the oblast, it is and will be determined exclusively by Russia's defense needs. Do the Lithuanian deputies realize that their irresponsible comments could complicate Lithuanian-Russian relations and that they can only play into the hands of the notorious extremist forces in Russia?
