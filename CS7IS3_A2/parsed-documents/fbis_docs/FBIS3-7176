Kim told a breakfast meeting with Korean journalists stationed in Japan that China, in principle, does not want to see a nuclear-armed North Korea but it also does not want to choose a path that would isolate North Korea from international society. Pyongyang's refusal to permit complete inspections of its nuclear facilities, suspected of being used in a secret nuclear weapons development program, was referred to the Security Council by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier this week. Beijing, Pyongyang's lone major ally, has repeatedly said it opposes trade and economic sanctions against North Korea. Security Council members, however, are reportedly drawing up a resolution without sanctions that calls upon Pyongyang to accept complete IAEA inspections but analysts have suggested that the next step would be a resolution calling for sanctions. Kim is currently in Tokyo meeting Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and will travel to China on Saturday calling for support in demanding North Korea be transparent with its nuclear program.
