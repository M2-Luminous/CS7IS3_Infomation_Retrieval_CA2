How true is this? Were there unification attempts in the past? Why did they fail? [Habib] Al-Jihad will remain al-Jihad, and the Islamic Group will remain the Islamic Group. Unification has not been proposed because there are major differences in our methods of action. Undoubtedly, the Islamic Group is now more prominent than al-Jihad, but this is because the two organizations have different views. While al-Jihad believes in comprehensive change, the Islamic Group believes in the promotion of virtue and the suppression of vice. The small operations that gave the Islamic Group prominence are part of the group's method of action. Al-Jihad, on the other hand, believes in comprehensive change as the basis of its movement. Therefore, al-Jihad is now weaker than it was in 1981. It lacks organizational foundations and has no unified leadership. In addition, it received many blows since the assassination of President al-Sadat in 1981. [AL-SAFIR] Do you believe rumors that there is a split in al-Jihad between Ayman al-Zawahiri and Colonel Makkawi? [Habib] Colonel Makkawi's story is really strange. I think there is an attempt by the media to highlight some names and suggest there is a split in the organization. At any rate, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Colonel Makkawi, or others represent only themselves or small groups within al-Jihad; they do not represent the al-Jihad Organization. Within al-Jihad, there are many schools of thought that take independent actions; it is known that al-Jihad groups work independently. Therefore, I believe that the groups representing al-Jihad are too varied to be incorporated into one organization. I stress that there is no organization for al-Jihad in the full sense of the word; there are groups that believe in the general thought but express themselves with different mechanisms. [passage omitted] [AL-SAFIR] Is daily violence in the Egyptian streets a way to achieve power? Does al-Jihad believe that violence is needed at this particular stage? [Habib] Violence and clashes with the state will not produce positive results; indeed, they will not serve the Islamic movement in general. It is better to open up society and try to establish the Islamic presence inside its normal structure. The strategic outlook should be given precedence over this "din," which will not lead to necessary changes. In short, the current violence does not benefit al-Jihad or the Islamic movement in general. Those in the Islamic movement who practice violence are a sector that has been forced by the state to do so. They feel their lives are threatened at any moment by military courts, even when they live abroad. Therefore, they are practicing violence irrespective of its results. We must stress that, historically, it was the state that started violence against the Islamic groups and counterviolence was thus imperative. In addition, the absence of the Islamic shari'ah forces Muslims to demand its implementation, even through violence. [AL-SAFIR] After each operation, people wonder what the Islamists really want. We are posing this question to you. [Habib] It should not be taken for granted that the Islamists are the ones who are carrying out these operations. Egyptian society has been infiltrated and the perpetrators could be the Mosad, some armed Christian organizations, or even the state itself. We do not want to assume that the Islamists are terrorists. Although there are some groups deviating from the general course, such as al-Shawqiyun and others, al-Jihad has a clear cultural mission. I, therefore, rule out the possibility of al-Jihad carrying out such operations. We hope the state will implement the Islamic shari'ah so that people can rest. [passage omitted] [AL-SAFIR] The government is now calling for national dialogue. How do you view this dialogue, knowing that the Islamic groups, especially al-Jihad, are not participating? [Habib] The government's call is not serious. I believe the president made the call without realizing that there are other forces stronger than him. Concerning the mechanism of implementation, the call for the dialogue is not serious. If it was, then all political forces would have been invited. I think al-Jihad and the Islamic Group have conditions for joining the dialogue. These include releasing detainees, refraining from intervening in Islamic preaching in mosques, and refraining from desecrating sanctities. These are simple and legitimate demands. Dialogue is needed to end Egypt's crisis, but dialogue in its old form is fruitless. [passage omitted] [AL-SAFIR] Where are the political Islam groups heading? [Habib] Those groups need to revise their mechanisms and plans to link them to reality. I believe violence will not produce results. It will not serve the Islamic movement and will not decide the issue. All of society needs a change and the outlook toward change must be comprehensive. Islam in Egypt will inevitably remain, and when the Islamists reach power there will be no struggle among them, as there is in Afghanistan.
