FR941004-1-00102 FR941004-1-00018 The Executive Order also encourages agencies, as appropriate, to provide the public with meaningful participation in the regulatory process. As described earlier in the preamble, ACF held focus group discussions with State, local, and tribal officials, and a broad range of private nonprofit agencies, organizations, practitioners, researchers, parents, and others to obtain their views on planning and implementation issues for this new title IV&hyph;B program. We believe this NPRM reflects, to a considerable degree, the recommendations of the focus group participants for flexibility, accountability, and reduced administrative burden on both States and Indian tribes. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. Ch. 6) requires the Federal government to anticipate and reduce the impact of rules and paperwork requirements on small businesses and other small entities. Small entities are defined in the Act to include small businesses, small non-profit organizations, and small governmental entities. This regulation, if promulgated, will affect only States and certain Indian tribes. Therefore, the Secretary certifies that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule contains information collection activities which are subject to review and approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C 35). In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department will submit for OMB approval the reporting requirements for the five-year comprehensive child and family services plan (CFSP) and Annual Progress and Service Reports in 45 CFR 1357.15 and 1357.16. The CFSP incorporates previously approved planning requirements for title IV&hyph;B, subpart 1 (OMB control number 0980&hyph;0142). The Annual Summary of Child Welfare Services (CWS&hyph;101) also will be modified and submitted to OMB for approval. (The CWS&hyph;101 currently is approved under OMB control number 0980&hyph;0047.) Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection and recordkeeping requirements should direct them to the agency official(s) designated for this purpose whose name appears at the beginning of this preamble, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10235, New Executive Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20503.
