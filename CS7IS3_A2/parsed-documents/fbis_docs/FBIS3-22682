However, until very recently there was no opportunity to block the spread of this disease. Now the situation is changing. Under a decision by the Greater Sochi Administration, all foreigners coming to our country, including inhabitants of the Transcaucasus, must present an international certificate saying they have been tested for the virus, or undergo a test then and there on the border. It is a harsh measure, but a necessary one.
