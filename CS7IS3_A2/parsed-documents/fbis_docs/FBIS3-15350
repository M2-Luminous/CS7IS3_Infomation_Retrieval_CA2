Apart from publications in the Israeli press, Reuters recently quoted Israel's Justice Minister David Libai as saying that "the Lithuanian Government must bear responsibility for punishing war criminals and returning Jewish property stolen and confiscated in World War II." The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry is still trying to obtain the official text of the Israeli minister's statement, but did not have it as of noon Wednesday. In an interview with Lithuanian TV, Paleckis said relations with Israel must be based on the future as it is done in relations with Russia, Germany, Poland and other countries, but not on the past. "There is every possibility to have very good relations with Israel." Vidmantas Vaicekauskas, senior investigator of the Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office, said "this soap bubble about the lawfulness of rehabilitation is only a pretext,...everything lies in property problems of Jews." Restitution in Lithuania is applied only to Lithuanian citizens who permanently live in the country. Vaicekauskas said the Lithuanian legislation does not provide for a possibility to open a branch office of the Simon Wiesental Center in Lithuania because it is "a social organization of a foreign state."
