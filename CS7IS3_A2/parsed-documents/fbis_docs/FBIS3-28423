The situation has become even worse with North Korea's forward disposition and the U.S. Pyongyang occupation strategy. We want to ask the government and the Army if we really need to worry about our security, and if we would be able to deter and ease the worst possible situation. The best combat capability is deterrence. Therefore, our government should have confidence in the following five areas: First, strengthened acquisition and analysis capability of intelligence concerning North Korean affairs. The North Korean nuclear issue is not an issue of the United States or Japan. Second, military morale. The recent survey showing that our soldiers do not have self-confidence in their profession could result in a crisis. Third, establishment of a reliable military image, that is, to clear up all doubts regarding arms purchase irregularities. Fourth, answer doubts concerning the arms system, including the jamming system of the F-16's and other Yulgok projects. Fifth, establishment of a unified reunification policy and a consistent security policy.
