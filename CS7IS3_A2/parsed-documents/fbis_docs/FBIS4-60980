National Bank Chairman Daulet Sembayev and his deputies answered numerous questions and said that "the banking system has not yet been properly formed in our state." Founders of commercial banks pursued only one aim--to ensure themselves with credits--and did not take into consideration the needs of their customers. In addition, they were short of money and qualified personnel. The possibilities of such banks were reduced to a minimum due to granting unjustified or wrongly documented soft loans. A great deal of work is currently being done in localities in order to increase the authorized funds of loan granting banks and to reduce the interference of local administrations in these banks' work. The board of the National Bank came to a logically based conclusion: Decisions on granting soft loans should be made primarily by the government and banks, to this effect, should be given additional money. The board of the National Bank will hold news conferences regularly. This will enable the population to make an informed choice and to participate in various financial events and not to fall prey to dubious deals. The number of other transgressions will also decrease.
