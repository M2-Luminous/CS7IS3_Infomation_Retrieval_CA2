A reason for active work of the chamber is the "absence of factionalism and division on party principle. It is not important for us who suggests a proposal if the latter is good," he said. In the words of Shumeyko, the presidential message to the Federal Assembly will be discussed at a council plenary scheduled for March 15. The deputies have discussed some problems related to the message, including a resolution on measures against crime in the Russian Federation. The deputies believe that order is even more important than the economic reform. In their opinion, it is a "comprehensive problem that starts from the question of power". They favor the creation of a solid system of vertical power in order to control implementation of resolutions. Shumeyko thinks that anti-crime measures include aspects of the economic reform. While the old system has been ruined and a new one has not been formed, the use of laws to expand criminal activities should be prevented. These also include the border issue which is to be settled by the Federation Council. Unestablished borders enable any person to penetrate into the Russian Federation and carry arms or drugs. The introduction of a state of emergency is another prerogative of the upper parliament chamber. A lot of arms have been accumulated in the state of emergency zones, which also results in the increased crime rate. Shumeyko does not exclude parliamentary hearings on enhanced measures against crime may result in the parliament's proposal to the president to introduce the state of emergency in some Russian areas in order to remove arms from the residents.
