Valery Pavlov, Deputy State Secretary for National Security and Crime Fighting, thinks that "the Belarusian army will be short of funds for purchases of up-to-date weaponry and personnel training even though parliament met all Defense Ministry's requirements." Belarus will need nearly $33 Mn, he said, to honor its commitments to the treaty on limitation of armed forces in Europe.
