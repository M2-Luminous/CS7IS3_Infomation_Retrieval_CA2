Such calls have increased greatly recently, on the eve of the trial of Fatos Nano, Ramiz Alia, and other blocmen. The Public Order Ministry reports that it will act with the force of law against anyone who seeks to exert pressure on Albanian justice, which has an independent and inviolable power. At the same time, it undertakes to guarantee order, calm, and stability for the organs of justice, so that they can develop their legal activity as normally as possible. The Public Order Ministry warns all violators, whoever they are, that they will be responsible before the law.
