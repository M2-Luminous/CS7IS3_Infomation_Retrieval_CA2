He wanted to give each citizen 100 million zlotys, but nothing happened. He wanted to leave only socks on affair mongers, but he did not manage to do that, either. Recently, he has wanted to give people the right to submit their own draft constitutions, but the Sejm rejected his initiative in the first reading. It is also not clear how the issue of the recall of Marek Markiewicz will end up. Movement in the Business Lech Walesa feels bad when nothing is happening in politics. He likes to see some movement in the business. However, since the dissolution of the parliament last year, he has not had many occasions to really act. He kept the government coalition in suspense for a while, wondering whether he should appoint Waldemar Pawlak to the post of prime minister. He teased the politicians for a little while by demanding three candidates, but that was all. Only the National Council of Radio and Television [KRRiT] gave him more reasons to act: It appointed Wieslaw Walendziak to the position of president of the Polish Television. Following the decision, the president withdrew political support for the members of the council whom he had himself appointed; he waited for them to submit their resignations, which did not happen. He provoked the next confrontation himself by submitting the bill of the so-called people's initiative; because of that, the Sejm divided into supporters and opponents of the president, which livened up the usually boring plenary debates. The rejection of the bill was instantly taken advantage of by the president, who withdrew from the work on the Constitution. Before the public opinion forgot the issue of the Constitution, the president recalled Marek Markiewicz from the post of KRRiT chairman and queried the decision granting a nationwide television license to Zygmunt Solorz. What Does the President Want To Achieve? The politicians whom we asked about it unanimously answered that he wants to gain the post of president for another five years. The thing is, he is doing it rather unskillfully. "It is clear to me that the president is making uncoordinated movements. By withdrawing from the work on the Constitution, he wanted to make a political gain; however, there is no one that could do that with him," says Ryszard Bugaj of the Labor Union. Bugaj believes that the recall of Marek Markiewicz from the post of KRRiT chairman is an element in the fight for influence on the mass media. It is also possible that the issue of Zygmunt Solorz, owner of PolSat and a license for nationwide television, is supposed to be the implementation of the slogan: I will leave only socks on affair-mongers. At any rate, the president, who has always acted chaotically, has now really gotten lost. Contrary to the law, he refused to participate in the work on the Constitution. It is not known whether the decision on the recall of Markiewicz was legal as well. Such inappropriate activities only show his political helplessness and the incompetence of his entourage. "The game that he is involved in is drawing him increasingly deeper," says Bugaj. "In addition, detrimental to his opinion are such things as the repair of the Namiestnikowski Palace and buying expensive cars for his family members. He is waging his campaign clumsily." Andrzej Potocki of the Democratic Union entirely shares Bugaj's opinion. He believes that the president's activities will not endear him to many voters. Some of his decisions cannot be accepted even by those who support him. As a result of his actions, soon in Poland there may be no issue that would not be entangled in politics. KRRiT activities should be excluded from political gamesmanship; however, Walesa encroaches on the area of the political independence of KRRiT in order to subordinate the mass media to himself. A Man of Action "The president is a man of fight and action," says Zbigniew Siemiatkowski of the Democratic Left Alliance. "He does not like a stable democracy. His experience suggests that he always benefits from direct confrontations, and that is why he is seeking them." According to Siemiatkowski, the president's entourage does not fully understand that, in a democracy, everyone is submitted to certain specified rules of the game. The parliament does not have the duty to adopt a bill only because it has been submitted by the president--all the more so because Walesa did not make any efforts to create a favorable atmosphere around his bill. The same goes for KRRiT. Respect for the president is not the same as absolute obedience to him. The council's representatives, who have been appointed by the president, attempted to act much too independently. This attempt encountered resistance and resulted in the recall of Markiewicz from the post of chairman. All of this is an element of a political campaign because only through criticism can one gain the disgruntled. Information Noise According to Janusz Piechocinski of the Polish Peasant Party, the president is trying to show that he is active on the political scene and has a lot to offer. He is employing his favorite tactics: He attacks, usually before leaving somewhere, and waits to see what positions the pawns on the political chessboard will take. "The situation of the president is difficult," says Piechocinski. "At the moment, he has no political friends. Apart from that, he is asking himself the question of whether he can get rid of political duties or whether he must participate in this game and for the second time run for the position of the head of state." Piechocinski believes that the president's activities are not easy to interpret. It is not clear whether the president is against KRRiT or against the division of the mass media, which has been made by the council. Perhaps he is concerned about the fact that the mass media are getting away from his control. All this is not entirely clear. "Walesa does not have a large combat scenario," says Piechocinski. "Actually, he has never had it. The aim of his activities is another term as president; however, so far he has been making merely information noise and giving the impression of total instability of the political world." Only Leszek Moczulski of the Confederation for an Independent Poland believes that the purpose of Lech Walesa's actions is first of all the strengthening of the position of the president in the political life. He wants to exert greater influence on what is happening in the country. Political activeness, however ineffective, is better than lack of activeness. Inaction disqualifies a politician.
