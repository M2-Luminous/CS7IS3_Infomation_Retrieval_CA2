FR941213-0-00010 FR941213-0-00003 Do State Speed Control Programs Appear To Be Among the Most Effective in Reducing Crashes, Injuries, and Fatalities? NHTSA and FHWA stated in the NPRM that state programs that have been conducted to date demonstrate that speed control countermeasures are extremely effective in reducing deaths and injuries, and cited a number of examples. (For details, interested persons should read the NPRM.) The California Office of Traffic Safety (OTS) interpreted this statement to mean that the agencies were placing more importance on State, rather than local, programs. NHTSA and FHWA did not intend to give this impression. In fact, the agencies recognize that many countermeasures in the Speed Control area can be carried out most effectively at the local level. The agencies' reference to ``State programs'' was intended to cover programs conducted at either the State or local level within a State. California OTS went on to indicate that many countermeasures have been employed successfully throughout the State to address the speeding problem. The Department of California Highway Patrol (CHP) stated that effective countermeasures exist only for localized speed control. CHP claimed that the success of these programs is almost always localized and/or temporary. The agencies agree that localized enforcement efforts alone generally result in only localized, short-term impacts. However, it has long been established that enforcement efforts, when combined with a vigorous public information and education campaign, have much more long-lasting effects. (See, ``Evaluation of the New York State Police 55 MPH Speed Enforcement Project,'' August 1969, by the Institute for Traffic Safety Management and Research.) Commenters, such as IIHS and Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, supported this view. Advocates further commented, ``A national effort [which provides a greater level of public information and awareness regarding the safety dangers associated with speeding] will establish the safety context for state and local speed control efforts under the 402 Program and provide those efforts with added credibility.'' West Virginia questioned the validity of the examples cited in the NPRM. The State argued that ``the reductions in speed [experienced in South Carolina and St. Louis] were minuscule'' and ``the sample [used in California] was very small.'' West Virginia continued, ``the Notice states a belief that the programs were effective but it gives no measures of statistical significance or indications of necessary seasonal adjustments or other information to back up this conclusion.'' The agencies disagree with West Virginia's comments. The success of the South Carolina study, for example, was not measured by reductions in speed, but rather using other factors. As stated in the NPRM, there were 12,472 fewer crashes (a 10% decrease), 2,331 fewer injuries (a 7% decrease) and 106 fewer fatalities in 1991 in South Carolina as compared to 1989 (an 11% decrease). The vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in South Carolina increased from 32,780 million to 34,456 million (a 5% increase) during this period of time. The agencies believe the State's rural initiative contributed to these reductions and that these reductions are significant. The agencies agree that the reduction in average speed (from 62 mph to 61 mph) experienced in the first year of the St. Louis enforcement operation (Operation Gateway) was not a significant reduction. However, the NPRM stated that the St. Louis program was continuing and was expected to result in further speed decreases, and further results have in fact been achieved. The Missouri Division of Highway Safety did not report the reduction in average speed as part of the second phase of Operation Gateway. The State did report, however, that, prior to the kickoff of the operation, the average speed of vehicles stopped for speeding on I&hyph;270 was 78.3 mph, and the average speed of vehicles stopped during the Operation Gateway kickoff was 74.3 mph. This represents a 5% reduction in speed. The agencies believe this reduction is significant. With regard to the California study, the sample used may have appeared small, as compared with the general motor vehicle population, but the study's focus was on commercial motor vehicles, and the study used as its sample a census of all crashes where the commercial motor vehicle was at fault. As the agencies explained in the NPRM, speed control efforts targeted commercial motor vehicles, and the data revealed that the number of crashes where commercial motor vehicles were at fault decreased by 3.5% (from 810 in 1986 to 782 in 1987). The number of crashes caused by commercial motor vehicles which resulted in injuries also declined, by 11.2% (from 259 in 1986 to 230 in 1987).
