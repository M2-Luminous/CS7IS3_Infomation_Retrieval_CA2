The meeting of the Russia's Choice faction scheduled for Thursday, to quote Gaydar, will finally fix this agreement. Gaydar also pointed out that the representatives of the Union of December 12 group again raised the issue concerning rendering assistance to them with people. This issue concerns that fact that the Union of December 12 group needs six more people to be registered; now there are 29 members in the group instead of 35 in accordance with the State Duma's regulations. Gaydar believes that the Russia's Choice meeting will find a positive resolution to this issue. Meanwhile, in his interview with Interfax leader of the Union of December 12, Fedorov, refuted Gaydar's assertion stating that members of the group asked him to help in staffing the group. "We raised the issue so that Russia's Choice did not hinder its members who expressed their wish to join the Union of December 12 group by different means," stressed Fedorov. Fedorov also pointed out that they had reached an agreement with Russia's Choice "to jointly discuss the tactics on the agenda of the State Duma "without any mutual obligations and without creation of any blocs or coalitions." He reaffirmed that such an agreement had been already reached with the Yabloko faction.
