FR940418-2-00010 FR940418-2-00005 Treating these liabilities and losses as a subsidy to ILVA is consistent with the Department's determination in Certain Steel from Austria at 37221. In that case, we examined a government-owned operating company (VAAG) which was split up into numerous operating companies, one of which was subject to the investigation. In order to effect this split-up, the assets and liabilities of the original company were divided among the new companies. We determined that the creation of the new companies was merely a redistribution of existing assets which, in and of itself, did not give rise to any benefits. However, we also determined that a benefit arose because losses that had been incurred by VAAG were not distributed to the new companies. Therefore, we determined that the company under investigation effectively received a grant in the amount of the losses that should have been distributed to it. Similarly, in the case of TAS and ILVA, the transfer of assets to ILVA is, in itself, a redistribution of assets which does not give rise to subsidies. However, a substantial portion of the liabilities and the losses associated with the assets were not distributed to ILVA. Instead, they remained behind in TAS. We are countervailing these amounts as grants to ILVA. To calculate the benefit during the POI, we used our standard grant methodology (see section 355.49(b) of the Proposed Regulations). Finsider's 1989 forgiveness of TAS' debt and the loss resulting from the 1989 write down were treated as grants received in 1989. The second asset write down and the debt outstanding after the 1990 transfer (adjusted as described below) were treated as grants received in 1990. After the 1990 transfer, certain non-operating assets ( e.g., land, buildings, inventories), remained in TAS. These assets are being disposed of in the liquidation process and the proceeds from the sale of the assets are available to pay off TAS' remaining liabilities. In order to account for the fact that certain assets were left behind in TAS, we have adjusted the amount of liabilities outstanding after the 1990 transfer. We did this by writing down the value of the assets by taking a weighted average of the earlier write downs and subtracted this amount from the outstanding liabilities. We then divided the benefits by ILVA's sales in the POI. On this basis, we determine the estimated net subsidy to be 12.10 ad valorem for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise. B. Interest-Free Loans to ILVA In 1992, ILVA received a 300 billion lire payment from IRI. At verification, we reviewed documents which established this payment as a ``provisional'' or ``anticipated'' capital increase. The reason that the payment was provisional was that before it could be considered as an equity infusion, authorization was needed from: (1) The shareholders, and (2) the EC. IRI clearly intended that the money become share capital, as there were no arrangements for repayment ( e.g., a repayment schedule), nor was interest to be paid. Therefore, as IRI was the sole shareholder in ILVA, its approval was a formality and the only real condition was the EC approval. If the EC approval was not received, the amount would have to be repaid to IRI. Although the GOI asked for the EC's approval, it was not granted during the POI. ILVA's 1992 Annual Report shows that the company received a similar payment from IRI in 1991 which was entered in its accounting records in the same way as the 300 billion payment received in 1992. At verification, we learned that the background to the 1991 payment was the same as for the 1992 payment. Because these payments were not converted to equity prior to the end of the POI, we cannot find the payments to be equity infusions. Thus, we have determined to treat the payments as short-term interest-free loans, which are being rolled over until such time as they are repaid or converted to equity upon EC approval. The typical maturity in Italy for short-term loans is at most six months and roll-overs are common. In accordance with ยง355.44(b)(3)(i) of the Proposed Regulations, we used the 1992 International Monetary Fund's annualized ``lending rate,'' converted to a semi-annual interest rate as the short-term benchmark interest rate. Since ILVA paid zero interest, the benefit to ILVA was the interest it would have owed on both payments. These benefits were then divided by ILVA's sales in the POI. On this basis, we determine the estimated net subsidy to be 0.49 percent ad valorem for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise.
