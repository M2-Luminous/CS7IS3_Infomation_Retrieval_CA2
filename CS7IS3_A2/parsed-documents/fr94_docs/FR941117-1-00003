FR941117-1-00003 FR941117-1-00001 Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;07.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;07, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299. Discussion On January 4, 1983, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 78&hyph;09&hyph;07 R3, Amendment 39&hyph;4538 (48 FR 1482, January 13, 1983), to require inspections for wear, and replacement, if necessary, of the impulse coupling assemblies on certain Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) (formerly Bendix) S&hyph;20, S&hyph;1200, D&hyph;2000, and D&hyph;3000 series magnetos equipped with impulse couplings. That action was prompted by reports of numerous magneto failures. That condition, if not corrected, could result in magneto failure and subsequent engine failure. A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was published as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register on September 21, 1993 (58 FR 48987). That NPRM would have retained the repetitive inspections for wear required by the current AD, but would have also required replacement, if necessary, of the riveted impulse coupling assembly with newly designed, improved, snap ring impulse coupling assemblies. In addition, the proposed AD would have required marking the magneto data plate to indicate installation of a snap ring impulse coupling assembly. Installation of snap ring impulse coupling assemblies would have constituted terminating action to the inspection requirements of this AD. That NPRM was prompted by the manufacturer redesigning the impulse coupling assembly to include snap ring fastening technology which strengthens the cam axle and reduces wear. The snap ring impulse coupling assembly was believed not to have the failure mode of the previous design. Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has received reports of snap ring impulse coupling assemblies being worn beyond limits. This supplemental proposed AD would therefore retain the 500 hour repetitive inspections for wear required by the current AD, but would require these inspections for magnetos equipped with snap ring impulse coupling assemblies as well. Since this change expands the scope of the originally proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for public comment. The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of TCM Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB) No. MSB645, dated April 4, 1994, that describes procedures for inspection of the impulse coupling assemblies for wear; and TCM SB No. 639, dated March 1993, that clarifies procedures for installation of impulse coupling assemblies. The FAA estimates that 130,000 magnetos would be affected by this proposed AD, that the required inspection would take 1 work hour, plus 1 work hour to change the impulse coupling, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The average utilization of the fleet of these airplanes is estimated to be evenly divided between commercial/commuter service and private owners. The commercial/commuter service population is estimated to operate 500 hours time in service (TIS) per year; therefore the cost to perform the inspections required by the proposed AD would be approximately $3,575,000 per year. The FAA estimates that private owners operate their aircraft between 50 and 100 hours TIS per year; therefore it will take approximately 5 to 10 years to reach 500 hours time in service. The estimated cost for these owners would also be $3,575,000 spread over a time period of 5 to 10 years or 715,000 per year for 5 years or $357,500 for 10 years. The cost to replace the impulse coupling assembly is $125 per magneto plus one work hour at $55 per work hour for a total of $180 per magneto. While all the riveted impulse coupling assemblies will eventually have to be replaced, it is not possible to estimate the cost per year. The total cost for replacement for U.S. operators would be $23,400,000. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.
