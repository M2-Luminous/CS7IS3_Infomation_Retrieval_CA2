According to an official from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the aim of the project, the memorandum of understanding of which was signed in 1992, is to assist China in mitigating environmental degradation caused by the depositing of mine waste through introducing suitable technology from Australia. Another purpose is to develop rehabilitation plants at mine sites, and make policy on mine waste management, the official said. She added that the Australian Government has supplied 3.5 million U.S. dollars and technology for the project. Australian experts have inspected the project facilities, some of which have already been set up. The Beijing General Research Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, the Zhongtiaoshan Nonferrous Metals Company of north China's Shanxi Province and the Tongling Nonferrous Metals Company in east China's Anhui Province are participating in the project. Among those present at today's inauguration ceremony were Qin Zhongda, vice-chairman of the Environmental and Resources Protection Committee of the National People's Congress, He Boquan, deputy president of the China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation (CNNC), and Sam Gerovich, minister of Australian Embassy. He Boquan told the ceremony that over the past decade China's production of ten nonferrous metals has tripled, with a total output of 3.29 million tons last year. However, the volume of mine waste is also on the rise. Each year, he said, CNNC affiliates generate a total of 60 million tons of mine tailings, accounting for 89 percent of the sector's industrial solid waste. So far, he added, the accumulated mine tailings amount to one billion tons, taking up two million ha of land, and with only a small portion reutilized. Gerovich expressed the hope in his speech that the project would become a catalyst for future two-way investment in the field, and further the cooperation between the two countries in various aspects. According to him, the Australian investment in China totals one billion U.S. dollars, encompassing 1,200 projects. He added that Chinese investment in Australia currently stands at 350 million U.S. dollars.
