According to Lei Aizu, official in charge of opening affairs, overseas money has now turned to industry, agriculture and infrastructures from real estate and tourism, which were hot spots in recent years. Industrial and farming projects accounted for 69 percent of the 239 foreign-funded enterprises newly approved in the last quarter. Ten of them have been invested with over 10 million U.S. dollars each. Lei said that 80 percent of the newly-approved projects are funded by investors from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. He also noted that foreign investors have started to expand their businesses into the mountainous areas. At the beginning of this year, a special committee led by the region's top officials was set up to promote investment from abroad. The region's growth of foreign investment in 1993 topped the list among the provinces in China's coastal areas.
