The agreement was reached with the conclusion of the fourth round of negotiations on the issue. Chinese chief textile negotiator and Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng said that during the three-day negotiations, the U.S. side agreed not to insist on reductions of between 25 and 35 percent in import quotas of Chinese textiles. According to him, the United States has withdrawn articles of arbitrary deduction regarding illegal transshipment of textiles from the proposed new agreement. Shi said that the Chinese side also made substantial concessions during the talks. China has agreed to accept a quota reduction of no more than three times the amount of textiles conclusively proven to have been illegally transshipped. Besides, China also agreed to major adjustments of some categories of the textile quota proposed by the U.S. side. The new agreement is the fourth of its kind China and the United States have reached. Shi and U.S. top textile negotiator Jennifer Hillman signed the new document on behalf of their respective governments. He attributed the success of the talks to the fact that, during the talks, both sides took into consideration the overall interests of bilateral trade and economic ties and adhered to the principle of equality, consultation and mutual understanding and accommodation. He said he believed that signing the new agreement will be conducive to a healthy development of textile trade as well as other economic and trade ties between the two countries. Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, met with Hillman and her delegation before attending the signing ceremony. The previous textile trade agreement expired at the end of last year and the first round of talks on the new agreement started last September in Beijing.
