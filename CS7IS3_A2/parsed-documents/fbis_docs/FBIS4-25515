They also exchanged views on the measures that should be adopted this summer when planting, harvesting, and field management are underway. Cheng Weigao stressed: According to the relevant state regulations, we should give to the peasants all the interests that should be given to them. None is allowed to violate regulations to add burdens on the peasants. There must be no increase in added burdens, even 1 yuan. Due to the scissors movement of the prices for farm and sideline products, the comparative efficiency of agriculture has been reduced over the past years. Along with the decreases in the output of the province's cotton and oil-bearing crops, the peasants' real income has become stagnant, and that in some localities has even been reduced. It is a foregone conclusion that the province will have a summer grain harvest this year. Thus, the peasants engaged in summer grain production will possibly register a bigger increase in their income. The problem at present is that we must not think of adding burdens on the peasants when the agricultural situation is better, and the peasants' income increases slightly. At present, we must realistically adopt measures and concentrate energy on grasping the planting, harvesting, and field management in the rural areas. According to the state regulations, the grain departments should do a good job in purchasing summer grain. Those who violate regulations to reduce [words indistinct] and prices and to damage the peasants' interests should strictly be punished. We should not only ensure to give to the peasants the interests that should be given to them according to the state regulations but also strictly prevent the occurrence of a rise in the peasants' burdens after a fall so as to mobilize their enthusiasm and to ensure a sustained, faster, and smooth development of agriculture and the national economy. In regard to the issue of ensuring the supply of electricity for the rural areas' three summer jobs and the issue concerning electricity charges, Cheng Weigao pointed out: The provincial discipline inspection commission, the provincial supervisory department, the power industrial department, and the pricing department should continuously regard the issue concerning the rural areas' electricity prices as an important task and firmly grasp it. The staff and workers contingents of the power industrial units should well be consolidated and managed. Cheng Weigao pointed out: At present, we should also strengthen the propaganda and education for the peasants and urge them not only to resist unreasonable burdens but also to fulfill the duties that every citizen should fulfill. So, the peasants should ensure the delivery of grain in good quality and full quantity and automatically hand over to higher levels the money to be obtained by the higher levels in a reasonable and unified way.
