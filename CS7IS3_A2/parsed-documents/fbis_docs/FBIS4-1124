[Viljoen] Yes, we came in very late and it will certainly affect the final result. But we have been surprised by the positive reaction we have seen countrywide. People countrywide are very reluctant to vote for the NP [National Party] -- just about everybody, even the coloureds. Everybody is very uncertain about what the ANC is going to do. Somehow they think the Freedom Front will be that party which will be able to give guidance which might be of better quality than what they've had in the World Trade Centre between the NP and the ANC. I think everybody opposes the idea that we must give full autonomy to those two players. They've worked together in the World Trade Centre, no doubt. They are going to work together again and they need a strong opposition. On his party's support. [Viljoen] We were so late in registration that it is virtually impossible to make an estimation (but) we have had, so far, a very good attendance at our meetings. We attract full halls. People are very interested. What is also of great value to me is the fact that (when) many Afrikaners who resisted the idea of voting attend meetings and hear the explanation we give on why we are going for the vote, they accept. On whether the FF will get 35 percent of the Afrikaner vote. [Viljoen] Sure. On whether he would take a Cabinet seat if support exceeded the required 5 percent. [Viljoen] The FF is more constitutionally oriented than governability oriented. I haven't even thought of such a possibility. The major contribution we can make it to apply the principle of self-determination in order to find a real solution for the big problem of South Africa. We have come to the conclusion that SA has always had the wrong constitution, the only reason why it worked is because of the laws we had which put the white people in a position where they could suppress and where they could govern with all the means available. We repeated the mistake in 1961 when we had the Republic established. We made a mistake with our policy of separate development in that. There was nothing wrong in creating a separate area for the Tswanas or the Zulus. But we made the mistake of forcing these people out of the system, totally on their own, without caring for a proper economy. This is the danger about the future too. Even in the (new) provincial system in SA, you will find that the different provinces will not be able to go for independent economies for each province. You will have to go for a united SA. And I think this is the problem with many of the volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] people too -- those people that think you can take the volkstaat out of SA and put a wall around it -- this is not on. So, when you think about a volkstaat, you should think about it as an area -- say a 10th area -- where you have, based on the principle of asymetry, special powers, in order to satisfy the principle of self-determination. Economically, there will have to be negotiated agreements on how the total economy of SA will be a unitary economy. Not only of SA but we favour the idea of southern Africa. So, what do we want. We want political stability and satisfaction by accommodating the people according to their wishes. Let me quote you an example. You know the Zulus as well as I do. There's no way that the Zulu people will accept being subjected to Mr (Nelson) Mandela, who is regarded by them as a Xhosa. And its not good to say we are past that stage and this is racism again and ethnicity again. It is a fact, it is a reality in SA, and we have to bear that in mind. Same thing with the Afrikaner people. Same thing with the other people too. Funny, you know, we are now the big propagandists for the idea of self-determination. When I arrived at the Cape we got this idea about the Cape Republic Movement. They approached me and said please, we are also looking for self-determination for the Cape, between the coloureds and the whites. Because they reckon they have built the Cape up to now. And they are being flooded by people being bussed in in order to manipulate the voting. Now they say the solution is to have self-determination. Even some of the other black states are catching on to this idea. The point I am making is we have always had a basically wrong constitution in South Africa because it never really gave space to the accommodation of all people. And we believe, by applying the principle of self-determination for political autonomy within a territorial base. On comments by Nelson Mandela that there will be no volkstaat. [Viljoen] He is electioneering. (Viljoen shows a hand-written letter from Mandela dated December 18 apparently giving in-principle support for the concept of self-determination). He and his whole national executive find acceptable that accord (on a volkstaat) that we never signed. That accord did say the concerns of self-determination must be addressed and it did say we must have joint teams that will work on this. What Mr Mandela is saying in the public is not really in line with what happens on a negotiations' level and I therefore think Mr Mandela has the wrong idea of a volkstaat. The negotiation is done at the level of Mr (Thabo) Mbeki. Maybe he (Mandela) thinks this idea amounts to taking out the volkstaat, having its own economy, divorcing the rest of South Africa from the assistance that the Afrikaner can give, which is not what we have in mind. On the constitutional principle making provision for a volkstaat council. [Viljoen] We negotiated the 34th principal. We are negotiating at the moment the accords that will reinforce the legislation and I would therefore not say we are not putting our faith in the Volkstaat Council, but this is the constitutional instrument created for this purpose. On differences in strategy with other right-wingers. [Viljoen] If they can produce a volkstaat before April 27 then I will consider leaving the voting. But if there is no volkstaat, then I would call on those people to vote for us. I have full respect for their views of the emotion of not voting in the election. But strategically, there is no other option. If we want to get...self-determination as soon as possible after April 27, if we want to work with the kwaZulu people in regard to the establishment of such an idea of self-determination, the best way for us to do it is to climb into the system. Because if you are in now you can always get out, but if you are out now you can never get in. On whether IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] participation will help the FF cause. [Viljoen] There is one major difference between the Zulu people and the Afrikaner people: they have an area, a territory, we don't have a territory. The moment we have proved substantial support and the moment we have more or less identified the most suitable core area for the volkstaat, then the whole idea will run parallel and great advantage will exist between us. On how long it may take to establish a volkstaat. [Viljoen] Within a month we will have a volkstaat council, (and) there is a constitutional provision for the fact that the whole of the provincial boundaries must be completed within 12 months. On forms of self-determination not based on territory. [Viljoen] No, we want to have a territory for the Afrikaner. We believe that is very important. What we also hope to do is supplement the idea of self-determination within the volkstaat with that of self-determination outside a volkstaat, not coupled to a specific area. The way that we wish to do this is, if we can succeed in establishing community councils -- and we have gone a long way in the negotiations to get this accepted -- then, let us say from the provinces of the country, they can have five delegates per province, elected from the community councils and they can then be part of an advisory body to the volksraad [Afrikaner national council]. The other idea is the idea of cantons. Let us say we have a concentration of Afrikaners in the northern Cape that would like to be linked to the volkstaat, then maybe we can have a conton of them. They can, through a referendum, prove their desire for self-determination as a community, and they would be allowed to link up constitutionally with the volkstaat. So those are the three ideas: self-determination within the volkstaat, self-determination outside the volkstaat not coupled to the specific area but linked to the volkstaat, and then the idea of cantons. On his future in government. [Viljoen] My main concern is a constitutional solution to South Africa. I have always been involved in security, I have always been involved with peacemaking. On being a military man in the political field. [Viljoen] A completely different culture. The one thing that is common about this, though, is that if in battle you are given an objective, you get totally devoted to capturing that objective. The approach is that no matter what the sacrifices, you have to achieve your objective. I think the same with politics. Having decided on your objective, you get the same obsession. I think organisationally, the demands of what we are doing at the moment are as big. When you speak to me, you don't speak just on the political side. On whether he believes a military option is still viable. [Viljoen] Of course, yes. Its always an option. I believe that strength is important in South Africa and I believe (in) self-defence ability, especially if you consider the vulnerability of our people within isolated farming areas, and so on. Remember the commando system, self-defence has been part of our culture ever since we faced the dangers of a new land. I have never back-pedalled on the military option. I have always said that I will use all peaceful means available, and I have often said that I will have to satisfy my own integrity in this regard. I will have to be able to stand before God and say that I have tried all the other options. I don't believe that our solution can come from war. On the effect of the toppling of Mangope in Bophuthatswana on the Right. [Viljoen] The AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] made a terrible mistake. It's such a pity because what happened to them is only discrediting. If you consider the rest of the undertaking it would have been a perfect success. As a matter of fact Mr (Lucas) Mangope might still today have been in power had the mess of the AWB not caused the revolt or the uprising (by Bophuthatswana troops). We were not going to make use of the AWB, we were specifically requested not to bring the AWB because it was mentioned to me that the presence of the AWB might bring resistance from inside. On his present relationship with the AWB. [Viljoen] We have broken the relationship. I have often found in the past that whenever we make use of the AWB, for some or other reason we land up being discredited. I don't believe that we ca have joint operations of great importance. And I am referring to, if necessary, military operations. It is very important in military operations that we should exercise discipline and restraint.
