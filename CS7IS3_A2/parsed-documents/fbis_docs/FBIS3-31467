How do you assess the present condition of our banks? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] The situation is largely unchanged. Several new banks were set up, and they are now in bad shape, too. In addition, those that were in trouble six months ago have failed to ameliorate their condition. [Kreft] So far, the Polish National Bank [NBP] is almost the only one prepared to come to the assistance of other banks when they find themselves in difficulties. The parliamentary debate on this year's budget contained charges that the NBP was too involved in "pumping" money into private banks. What is the government's position on this problem? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Naturally, both the government and parliament demur at taking on tasks of such nature. After all, such tasks are not part of any supervisory bodies' brief. The NBP should merely recommend the appropriate steps to be taken; it cannot take upon itself the entire burden of the remedial operations. The involvement of the NBP and the Bank of Economic Initiatives in the rescue operation in aid of the Development Bank of Lodz and the takeover of the Prosper Bank and the First Commercial Bank of Lublin (set up by Bogatin) was necessary because the threatened collapse and liquidation of those banks would have put an intolerable burden on NBP finances. Although we still have not set up a deposit insurance society, we would be inclined to protect our clients' interests up to a certain limit, remembering that, when one bank collapses, as happened in the Coastal Region, a decidedly dubious climate soon develops around all of the other ones. I will not deny that I found it rather difficult to persuade the previous government to embark on the process of restoring our banks to health. I trust that I will have an easier job of it with the current government. [Kreft] Did the divergence of views between you and the previous government concern some specific cases, or did it rest on a range of general phenomena common to the whole banking system in Poland? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] It concerned institutional solutions, notably five fundamental instruments of the system of restoring banks to sound health applied universally throughout the world, whose application in the Polish banking system was recommended by the NBP. [Kreft] Immediately after the parliamentary election, without knowing the new government's makeup, you advised the left to spread the realization of its election promises over several years, did you not? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] More and more people from the very core of the left-wing orientation are now talking about the need to spread these promises over a longer period of time. [Kreft] You also stipulated at the same time that the post of finance minister should be given to a person ready for compromise and...for a fight against inflation. Did Minister Borowski [who resigned after the interview] fulfill these expectations? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Minister Borowski is a rather determined person, but he has not pressed for an unjustified monetary supply. Such pressure was exerted by members of relevant Sejm commissions. [Kreft] During the Sejm debate on this year's budget, the NBP became a target for intense attacks. The Union of Labor charged it with not allowing a sufficient flow of funds to the economy, did it not? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I am quite immune to such pressures. The present Sejm is, as a whole, oriented toward a loosening of monetary policy. When we compare the attitudes of the budget commissions in the previous and the current Sejms, we must conclude that, in the former case, the coalition members demonstrated greater coalition discipline. However, I still remember the statement made by Jerzy Osiatynski shortly after he was made finance minister. He said that the "hole" in the budget would come up to 100 trillion zlotys [Z]. That frightened me quite considerably. Of course, we soon came to an agreement over that question. The present parliament is characterized by a greater differentiation of positions even within individual parties. Pressure to print more money has always taken place and will continue to take place everywhere under the sun. In 1992, I was there when the German deputy finance minister launched an attack on the Bundesbank's financial policy, and that, after all, is something that does not happen all that often. [Kreft] How do you assess this year's planned budget deficit? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] It is contained within fairly decent limits, although even this could be the subject of a lengthy debate. The beginning of the year has been promising. I do not remember another year with such a substantial prevalence of revenues over expenditure. [Kreft] The NBP will finance the budget to the tune of Z30-35 trillion. But the parliamentary act on the NBP lowers the ceiling of the central bank's involvement in the budget to a much lower level. [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] The relevant article of that act was routinely suspended for a great many years in the past. During the life of the Olszewski and Suchocka governments, the level defined by the act was very seriously exceeded. Such extensive involvement on the part of the NBP has its roots in the insufficiently developed money market. [Kreft] Do you share the opinion that, in the present economic situation, devaluation of the zloty would create more problems than it would solve? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I believe that devaluation always causes more damage. Decisions to introduce abrupt devaluation are usually made when something is very amiss with the state monetary reserves. On the other hand, a lack of equilibrium in the trade balance is a natural phenomenon in a country experiencing an economic recovery process. As a result of the latest, 8-percent currency devaluation, we gained an increase of only 1 percent in our export figures. I believe that encouraging results can be achieved only through applying such government measures as, for example, an imports tax. No one has ever managed to improve a national economy permanently by a drastic devaluation of the currency rate. [Kreft] But your views on this matter are not shared by a sizeable group of politicians, are they? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Nevertheless, my views are presented more and more often in the public forum. And they are certainly more popular today than when I assumed office as NBP chairman. [Kreft] To go back to your "wish list": Two years ago you wished to see an increase in the level of economic education available to the public that would bring it to the level of economic knowledge displayed by the German public. Over there, the main thing the population expects is the lowest possible level of inflation. [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] My adviser at the Bundesbank insists that the Germans have always remembered the massive inflation in the 1920's, as well as the inflation of the postwar years. I believe that we should just remember our own inflation in the 1980's. [Kreft] But we are, on the contrary, all too ready to forget it.... [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] During the election campaign, inflation was not too painful. Recent violent reactions to the November inflation should make advocates of a greater "loosening" of our monetary policy aware that inflation threatens their voters' interests. [Kreft] You have an excellent opportunity to make comparisons: Is the present Sejm's level of economic education higher than that exhibited by the last one? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Naturally, I will refuse to answer this question. I can only refer you to statements made by representatives of the present Budget Commission, who maintain that theirs is the best budget commission ever.... [Kreft] Recent opinions quoted in NBP circles indicate that it is perfectly feasible to accelerate the rate of inflation. [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] You are talking about the so-called press-generated facts, which create their own reality and reinforce public expectations of continually increasing inflation as if a proportion of the press believes in the principle that the worse things look for the present government, the better for them. I believe that, regardless of our individual sense of financial ease and comfort, we should all be interested in stabilizing inflation at a reasonably low level. [Kreft] But press commentators suggest that this is positively the last moment to increase the rate of inflation.... [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] We must stay cool and watch the developments calmly. I can only say that we hold constant discussions on precisely that subject. [Kreft] It is hardly reasonable to expect that inflation will be stemmed without the need for sacrifices and without lowering the level of social benefits expenditure. Don't believe that we have again arrived at a moment when it will be necessary to tighten our belts? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] The problem lies not so much in being forced to lower the social benefits expenditure but in changing the entire concept of budgetary expenditure as such. I am, of course, speaking here of the huge sums allocated to social benefits funds in the past budgets. Over the past few years, we have not been able to bring about a reform of the social insurance system, and this has made a vital difference to the independence of decisions in the sphere of public finance. We cannot begin to hope for a decrease in inflation to a level below 20 percent without some radical cuts. In this sense, Poland is very much like Hungary, where they now have inflation on the order of 23 percent, and where they cannot even begin to reduce it because they also have been unsuccessful in dealing with the basic underlying difficulties. [Kreft] Do you agree with the claim that our greatest financial threat comes from the need to service the internal debt? The only noninflationary way to reduce the deficit would be teh purchase of our treasury bonds by foreign banks. But the latter are not at all keen to buy them.... [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Because, among other things, they are afraid of devaluation. It is true that the servicing of our internal debt does present great difficulties at the moment. We are facing a whole range of so-called inflexible expenses, which seriously hamper our ability to maneuver within the budget framework. On the other hand, I am pleased that that problem has now, at long last, been noticed and acknowledged. [Kreft] How do you assess the development of the Stock Exchange? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] So far, our Stock Exchange has enjoyed the opinion of being the best in the countries of the former socialist bloc, as well as enjoying a high--maybe even too high--degree of public confidence. The Stock Exchange is an institution of the market economy system, and the latter is only now beginning to expand in our country--hence, a number of anomalies that are perfectly natural at this stage. However, it would be dangerous to overestimate it and place excessive emphasis on stock exchange operations at this stage. That is why it is vitally necessary that the Stock Exchange be expanded and that many more companies enter it soon. This will make it much more stable. I believe that this is exactly what will happen. Minister Kaczmarek is determined to privatize further enterprises as soon as possible. [Kreft] You are very protective of the watertight quality of our banking system. How, then, do you assess the unrestricted freedom of draining stock exchange profits away from our country by foreign investors? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Without them, the stock exchange would not be able to develop at all. [Kreft] The stock exchange and the banks are seen as good places for laundering dirty money. How much truth is there in that belief? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I believe that we have very good and very precise legislative regulations protecting our banking system against that danger. We are able to check up on our bank investors, and we have a good system of verifying their agents' credentials. There have been instances in which, at our insistence that they disclose the identity of the true investors, such agents withdrew their offers to invest their capital in our banks. Among other things, this is also one of the reasons behind our decision to engage the NBP in the operation of restoring Prosper Bank and the First Commercial Bank of Lublin to financial health: The provenance of the money that was originally supposed to shore up these two banks proved on closer inspection not to be satisfactorily explained. There is no doubt that the practice of laundering dirty money should be prosecuted by the law. It will not be much good if the only course of action open to us is mere monitoring of financial transactions. There must be statutory legal sanctions, too. [Kreft] Where does the NBP chairman invest her savings? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] In the bank. I also bought some state treasury bonds in order to be able to claim personal tax allowance on them. [Kreft] Thank you for talking to us.
