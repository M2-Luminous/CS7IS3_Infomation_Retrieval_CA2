The purpose of the exercise has not been given. Yesterday PRAVDA informed readers that Brigade General Leonard Holder Jr., commander of the U.S. Army's 3d Infantry Division, had already visited Orenburg. He was involved in preparing for the tactical exercises which it turns out are to be held this summer. Here just a few ideas for starters. Orenburg Oblast has been announced as the scene of the exercise. The military are aware that the Totskiy test range, where the now-famous exercise involving the detonation of an aerial nuclear bomb took place 40 years ago, is the only place in Orenburg Oblast where such an exercise can be held in the summer until the harvest has been brought in. In terms of training the Totskiy test range is not the most convenient for this kind of exercise. But it is the closest of Russia's test ranges to the Central Asian republics. It is also well-known that a sizeable Strategic Rocket Forces grouping is stationed in Orenburg Oblast and a top headquarters is stationed in the oblast center. There are also other installations of military and economic importance in the southern Urals that are of interest to certain foreign states' services. The U.S. infantry division comprises 18,000 personnel, 54 M1 tanks, 200 guns and mortars, nine multiple launchers, 410 antitank guided missiles, 133 armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles, 218 helicopters, several thousand vehicles of various categories and purposes, antiaircraft, engineering, communications, and other combat and auxiliary hardware. What is more, the division will be accompanied by a certain number of interpreters, various advisers, and various support personnel.... This all has to be accommodated, housed, provided with food, fuel and lubricants, and other items and pieces of military gear in accordance with U.S. standards. A corresponding quantity of supplies will also come with the division. The Americans do not even pay a social call without bringing in supplies. And this is no social call.... Plenty of aircraft -- U.S. aircraft, of course -- will be required to deliver and subsequently provide these forces and facilities with backup and it will be based at Russian airfields. Thus, there will be a foreign combined military formation and a foreign air base with vague rights and duties on Russian territory, creating a situation with no normative-legal base. The scenario and plan for any exercise are formulated on the basis of the exercise's clearly defined objective. What might be the purpose of the scheduled exercise, and why is it not being given? For Russia the purpose of this kind of exercise is to rehearse cooperation between the two states' combined formations in combat operations against an adversary that one state's armed forces cannot handle alone, in order either to carry out or to rebuff aggression. First, Russia has no aggressive intent against any neighbors near or far, as the country's supreme military-political leadership has repeatedly stated. Second, there are no aggressors in the immediate vicinity of Russia that Russia's Armed Forces could not rebuff autonomously. Apart from military alliances like NATO, of which the U.S. Armed Forces form the basis. A spontaneous exercise to rehearse cooperation between the armed forces of two states that recently opposed one another is pointless. So say military theory and military practice. Thus, for instance, command and control of combat operations includes the processing and analysis of very varied battle management, support, and other information. But how is information from sources that have a totally different informational-linguistic and concept base and uncoordinated means of conveying information to be processed and analyzed? Here is how a Russian specialist describes U.S. Army combat documents: "Combat orders in the U.S. Army are characterized by their own unique features. They are formulated in accordance with a definite, unified, rigorously prescribed format, which is regulated by corresponding instructions and impossible to understand if you do not possess a sound knowledge of them." The Persian Gulf, for instance, effectively saw operations by a single military bloc, within which information flow was formalized and coordinated along with the concept and the informational-linguistic base, means of conveying information were coordinated, and conferences, seminars, and dozens of exercises of various kinds and levels are held every year. But even there, notwithstanding the pace of combat operations today and the flow of information, linguistic and other barriers have arisen in the way of information and it has not proved possible to overcome these barriers rapidly. We know that the Americans had to deliver 10,000 personal computers and the appropriate software to the combat operation zone in order to automate the process of overcoming these barriers. Nevertheless it did not prove possible to overcome all the barriers and the commander of the multinational forces was forced during both defensive and offensive operations to give all national forces their own area of combat operations.... However, there is a certain hypothetical situation in which Russian and U.S. divisions will be able to operate together without prior preparation. Namely a civil war situation. Is the country's supreme political leadership not preparing for that situation by inviting along foreign divisions? What is the U.S. military-political leadership's objective in carrying out this exercise? Throughout the 20th century the United States has tried to gain a footing for its armed forces on the continent of Asia. A tremendous amount of money has been spent and plenty of blood has been shed, U.S. blood included, but it has only succeeded in getting hold of a small piece of the Korean Peninsula. That is why the U.S. side sees it as one of the most important aims of the scheduled exercise to introduce its armed contingent onto Russian soil and open up a new theater of combat operations. The U.S. "Partnership for Peace" concept is for naive fools, a cover for another U.S. concept -- "Peace U.S.-Style" -- and the strategy of world domination. The aim is no simple one and includes a whole series, a lengthy set of tasks that would take a long time to list. Although I should do so to enlighten Russian citizens who have lost interest in military problems over the last 50 years of peace. Some of the details of the coming exercise cause suspicion and doubts among military people who are able to assess events critically and competently: Is this the main aim being pursued by the Americans, who are stage-managing events in Russia? Remember late 1992. A trend toward consolidation developed in the CIS republics, among not only peoples but also governments and presidents. Preparations were made for a summit-level conference and a package of important documents was made ready for signing. Then all of a sudden a U.S. President who had had his day and was effectively an ex-president challenged the Russian president to sign the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Arms Reduction -- a treaty that was still half-baked and in need of considerable finalization. And our president obediently rushed in, without squaring his actions with his CIS colleagues or the Russian Supreme Soviet. He rushed in and signed the treaty, creating a host of military, economic, and political problems and dealing an arrogant blow to the ambitions of his fellow presidents and legislators. The conference did of course go ahead, but the atmosphere was different and no one has implemented the documents that were signed. I could go on giving examples of interference by U.S. stage managers. A similar situation is developing once again. A wave of unification sentiments has once again arisen among the peoples of the former USSR republics. Do U.S. strategists want that? No! How can it be stopped? How can they cause chaos? How can separatists and nationalists be revived and inspired to vigorous activity? It is hard to think of a better means than an exercise in the south of Asian Russia. And if it involves U.S. troops and is accompanied by certain propaganda details, the reporting of the exercise as well as the actual fact that it is taking place could prove extremely heartening for anti-Russian forces. Russia does not need the planned exercise, and the presence on Russian territory of any foreign military contingents is unnecessary and harmful. World practice has seen examples of a foreign military legion being stationed on the territory of prostrate and weak states. No one has ever conquered Russia, and it was not and will not be weak. The Americans do not have to teach the Russians how to fight. It is high time that the Russian military department conducted its own military exercise -- a strategic war game to repel aggression by a coalition of nuclear powers, to repel a massive nuclear attack. And all officials whose functional duty is to take charge of repelling aggression should be involved in the exercise. That kind of game could establish what the Russian Armed Forces and their leadership are capable of. Back in the days of the Union the Russian [as published] General Staff was so assiduous and spent so long persuading the Armed Forces, the military public, and military science of the primacy of politics over strategy that it lost its role and niche in the system of state governance and turned military science into the servant of political libertarianism. The result was that fundamental natural sciences -- mathematics, physics, cybernetics, etc -- were not called for in resolving military-strategic problems. That is why the present spontaneous attempts to set up research directorates and centers under and within the General Staff in imitation of the foremost capitalist states are rather reminiscent of the efforts of the monkey in I.A. Krylov's fable who tried to improve his age-impaired vision. That is why it is at the very least naive to rely on the General Staff and military science to conduct an exhaustive and systematic analysis of Russia's geostrategic position. The only feasible option in the current situation is a real-life war game [naturnoye modelirovaniye igri], staff and command-staff exercises -- unilateral, bilateral, and trilateral -- extensively involving staffs and outlining the actions to be taken by troops from all categories of the Russian Armed Forces. Were the Russian Defense Ministry to organize and carry out that kind of game, it would help clear up many problems of the Russian state's security. But the Russian Defense Ministry's refusal to carry out this kind of game is also a result which clarifies the stance espoused by the top brass.
