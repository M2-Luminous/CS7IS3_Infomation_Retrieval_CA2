The meeting concluded a short while ago. Before that, another meeting took place at noon between PLO Leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. According to ROMPRES, the head of the Israeli diplomacy said the following, at the end of the meeting: The negotiations are not yet over. For the time being, there is nothing to announce yet. Asked whether he is optimistic, Shim'on Peres said, quote: I am always optimistic. This optimism is also shared by Yasir 'Arafat. [no reference to close of quotation as heard] We have now received from our correspondents the statements made by the three participants in today's talks at Cotroceni Palace. First, the statement made by President Ion Iliescu. [Begin Iliescu recording] We will not make any special statements now. Another meeting will take place at 1700, whereby Chairman 'Arafat and Mr. Peres will briefly report on the stage of the negotiations conducted last night and this morning and the prospects for finalizing certain positive and concrete aspects related to the ongoing negotiations in Cairo. I would like to point out the political significance of these meetings and talks in Bucharest as well as the effort and political determination of the two leaders to achieve something. If one usually talks about courage and heroism in the military struggle, I believe that one needs no less courage and heroism to build peace, overcome conflicts, and struggle against the trend of hatred and immobility accumulated over a long period of time. I believe that this was a display of true courage from the politicians of both Israel and the Palestinian side. What both Chairman 'Arafat and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Minister Peres are striving to achieve these days is an act of courage, which we appreciate as such. I believe it is in the interest of the international community to support these realistic and brave politicians in their efforts. [end recording] [Announcer] Then, Mr. Yasir 'Arafat said: [Begin 'Arafat recording, in English with superimposed translation into Romanian] We have to thank His Excellency, the president, for his contribution to the progress of the peace talks, by arranging the meeting between myself and His Excellency Mr. Shim'on Peres. We hope to enjoy your hospitality, in Bucharest this time, to continue our talks and negotiations, so that we can finally implement the agreements reached last September at the White House. I repeat, we need courageous people. Mr. Rabin and Mr. Peres are the courageous leaders who are making this peace. We are not doing it for our or their sake, but for all the people in the region and the Middle East, something which will have a positive impact on the entire world and on peace throughout the world. I am convinced that we are at the end of this long march. Thanks to this hard work and our feeling of duty, we will be able to finalize this long and difficult process. [end recording] [Announcer] Here is Shim'on Peres' statement: [Begin Peres recording, in English with superimposed translation into Romanian] I would like to thank Mr. 'Arafat and Romania's president for having facilitated this meeting. It seems that there is something in Bucharest's air that enables us to sit down and calmly talk over the peace process. I know that Mr. 'Arafat is leading the Palestinian people toward a new destiny, toward something they have never had in the past. We wish, from the bottom of our people's heart, that we will be successful and that we will see the end of violence, terror, death, and suffering. We hope to see the Palestinians as neighbors, embarked upon the road of success and prosperity, following their historical destiny. As Chairman 'Arafat said, we are at the beginning of the end of this process and we are trying to find a way to conclude this great historic road of the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. This is a new relationship and a new beginning. I would like to thank Chairman 'Arafat for the attempt he has made, together with us, to end our difficulties. We would also like to thank the president for his kind hospitality. [end recording]
