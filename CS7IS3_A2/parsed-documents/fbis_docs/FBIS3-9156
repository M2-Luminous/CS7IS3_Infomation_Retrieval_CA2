[Pancea] The source on which the article published by [daily] EVENIMENTUL ZILEI relies intends, in my opinion, to mislead, rather than correctly inform public opinion. Probably we have to deal with certain circles that are interested in circulating information that can deceive and especially mislead public opinion in Romania. As a matter of fact EVENIMENTUL ZILEI is known as a daily that, rather unfortunately, instead of following a line that could lend it a note of seriousness in the way it discusses the approached issues, has for a very long time proved to be rather a scandal paper, a sensation paper, and it still seems to be following that line, in its usual style. [MEDIAFAX] Still, who do you think offered them that piece of information? [Pancea] I do not merely think, but I am also certain that all this information has been forged by someone who uses it to cause a sensation. It may not be the daily itself, but rather certain circles that are interested in such a thing; I do not wish to name anyone, because I do not have absolute evidence about the existence of such enemies. That is life, I think that one may have friends as well as foes, but sometimes it is very difficult for one, in the middle of this flood of information, to spot the persons who might be envious of one. [MEDIAFAX] Have you or have you not been transferred to reserve duty by President Iliescu? [Pancea] I have no knowledge of that. I did not discuss that issue with the president, either before he left or after he returned home [from his tour of Lithuania, South Korea, and China]. Of course, the president knows about my intention to retire, considering my advanced age compared to the [retirement age] currently existing in the armed forces. I am almost 66, so you realize that, in the army, I am considered one of the oldest officers, even among the generals. As it is known, according to both the currently valid status of military cadres and to the one that is being discussed in parliament, the maximum age is 62 years. This means that I already exceeded that limit by four years. [MEDIAFAX] Have you spoken to the president about your problem? What is his opinion? [Pancea] I have not spoken with the president because -- and you will have to agree -- his agenda is full of other issues, far more important ones than my problem, and if he were to deal personally with everything that is published by the press, he would not have enough time to deal with the issues he, as the country's president, is expected to solve. [MEDIAFAX] The item that accused you of espionage also claimed that you have been recruited by Tudor Anescu. What are your relations with that person and, of course, with the other two: Lucian Cornescu and Radu Petrica Popa? [Pancea] If we also take into consideration the things published by other papers (EXPRES MAGAZIN and TINERAMA), initially I was a KGB agent who was recruited, as TINERAMA claimed last year, by some KGB agents in the old days, while I was a military attache in Paris. What do I see now? Probably because they did not achieve their goal by claiming that I was a KGB agent, they changed course and called me an agent of the French secret service recruited by Mr. Anescu. As far as I could understand from the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI item, they claim that I recruited Anescu, and later on, he, as a double agent, managed to exploit me for intelligence purposes; I am mentioning all this in order to be correct and to refer exactly to the things published by EVENIMENTUL ZILEI. They are all aberrations and imaginary assertions made by a person who is not in his right mind, lest I should call him insane. In connection with Lucian Cornescu, I can tell you that during my service in Paris I had contacts, but not with him, but rather with many other French companies, with the purpose of purchasing military technology and equipment needed by the Romanian army. Of course not all those deals were eventually concluded with French companies. I can give you one example of a deal that was concluded and I can also tell you that nothing came out of the ones [mediated by] of Cornescu, because he did not offer terms and items that were of any interest to the Romanian army. Contrary to him, other companies were successful, such as the Alouette-3-type helicopter, for which, initially, we imported spare parts, after which we imported the whole manufacturing technology. [MEDIAFAX] Do you mean that their connecting Lucian Cornescu's name with this issue was purely accidental? [Pancea] That is right, he has no connection with this. That was merely business. The allegations in the aforementioned item are mere hallucinations. Radu Petrica Popa is the person who swindled my son of $30,000, in the sense that he promised to obtain an apartment for him and requested an advance payment; besides my son, other persons were swindled in the same way and their cases were reported by the press. Radu Petrica Popa is a notorious, or a professional, crook; I have never seen him and I talked to him just once, over the phone. What actually happened was that he began to blackmail my son, threatening that if he would not withdraw the complaint he filed with the police requesting his money back, "your father will be kicked out of Cotroceni" [presidential headquarters]. [MEDIAFAX] Is he really such an influential person? [Pancea] I do not think so. However, I think that he was manipulated by other influential persons who were interested not so much in discrediting me personally or my son, but rather in discrediting me, the Pancea who works for the presidency, that is, their attacks were actually directed against the presidential institution and the president, personally. [MEDIAFAX] Do you think that you are standing in someone's way? [Pancea] Personally, I cannot think of any elements from which I could draw the conclusion that I am standing in someone's way, I mean, in the way of some other physical person. I believe that here we have to deal with the interests of certain circles or forces that are very interested in weakening certain structures of the Romanian state, including the council or the secretary of the Supreme Defense Council, which, after all, is one of the principal bodies of the defense structures of this country, considering the issues it is expected to discuss during its sessions and the decisions it is expected to take regarding national security. I do not think that I, as a person, could be standing in someone's way; the institution I represent could, perhaps. [MEDIAFAX] Do you think that they are the same circles I referred to in my first questions? [Pancea] I believe they are the same circles, because the events were connected among themselves in such a way so as to turn an incident between two individuals into an attack against an institution, namely the presidential one. Their attempt to try to deal a blow, not against the place where the events actually took place, but rather way up, against the presidential institution is quite obvious. [MEDIAFAX] Is it true that during one of the sessions of the Supreme Defense Council it was suggested to the president that he should renounce his visit in France precisely because of the problem with you? [Pancea] That is a totally wild aberration, which has absolutely no connection with reality. Besides, during the sessions of the Supreme Defense Council, we do not discuss the visits of the president. That is the task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our embassies, and the presidency, and not at all that of the Supreme Defense Council, which has no authority in such issues. [MEDIAFAX] You are a French agent, Mr. Adrian Nastase [speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and executive chairman of the ruling party] is a CIA agent (according to Corneliu Vadim Tudor); how do you account for their "silence" about the possible KGB agents? [Pancea] Actually we should not talk about the "silence," but rather try to assess this "rain of agents" in the press and handle it according to what it deserves. I, as an expert in this field, can tell you that it does not deserve any attention. The fact that such things are published by the press, in my opinion, is a consequence of our not having an appropriate bill on the press, on the basis of which one could seriously call to account all the persons who circulate such concocted things lacking all real grounds. Being an agent is a very grave thing, it is high treason against one's homeland, and agents do not deserve to remain among society, they ought to be shot or isolated in prisons. [MEDIAFAX] Many personalities have been accused of spying for Western powers [reference to Greater Romania Party leader Corneliu Vadim Tudor's open letter claiming that top government, presidential officials are working for Western intelligence agencies]. How do you account for the fact that, over the past four years, very few people have been accused of working for the KGB? Do people's minds and imagination not work in that direction as well, in that of [the officials'] cooperation with the KGB? [Pancea] As an expert in this field, I can tell you that all intelligence services, regardless of the state they belong to, have to establish the goals of their intelligence activity in such a way so as to best serve the interests of their state, be they military interests -- which currently are not quite plausible, especially after the dissolution of the Warsaw Treaty -- or be they scientific or economic interests, on the one hand, or in the field of arms and drugs trafficking and terrorist activity, because currently these are the fields of major interest at the international level, and therefore the majority of the intelligence services of various developed states, which do have such specialized structures, are principally targeted in these directions. This does not mean that they neglect military aspects. If we take just the military part of the intelligence work, beginning with Napoleon's time, all military attaches had the task to gather military information with the purpose of preventing the adversary from taking one by surprise in case of a possible crisis.
