The council was concerned over the situation in the Muslim enclave and regretted that a UN military observer died of injuries suffered in the Serb onslaught there, according to council president Colin Keating of New Zealand. The council "condemned this blatant violation of council's resolutions," he said. He added that the council supported the efforts made by the UN protection force in Bosnia to improve the situation there, and welcomed diplomatic initiatives to the same end, including those of Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will visit the region early next week.
