In a meeting on Friday, 25 February, with Japanese delegations led by Mr. Shozo Azuma, vice minister for foreign affairs, and Mr. Eisei Ito, vice minister for construction who had come here to attend the inaugural ceremony of the Cambodia-Japan Friendship Bridge, the Cambodian prime ministers said although the Royal Government had made a number of concessions the Khmer Rouge were still continuing to resort to their military activities. "However the royal government is capable and optimistic to solve this problem because Cambodia has got legitimate government, Constitution, National Assembly and political unity among the two biggest ruling parties, and the support from the people," they said. Another problem to be settled is, according to them, the rehabilitation which they said would prevent the return of Khmer Rouge if successfully done. The Cambodian prime ministers called on the Japanese investors [words indistinct] ventures in Cambodia especially in the agricultural field and in the restoration of hydro-electric station in Prek Thnaot, which, they viewed, are the basic factors for the development in Cambodia. The Cambodian leaders expressed thanks to the Japanese delegations for having visited Cambodia and attended the inaugural ceremony of the Cambodia-Japan Friendship Bridge built by Japan. The bridge is the vivid proof of good relations of friendship between the two peoples, they said. They thanked the Japanese Government for having invited them to attend the international conference on the reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC) to be held in Tokyo in March this year. Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr. Shozo Azuma, who will preside over the ICORC, pledged to explain to the donor countries to address the basic needs of Cambodia in its rehabilitation.
