Besides Savisaar, Siiri Oviir, Gennadi Golubkov, Tdnis Kaasik, Olev Laanjirv, Ants laos, Jaak Leimann, Vello Lind, Rein Loik, Rein Miller, Juri Raidla, Aleksander Sikkal, Jaak Tamm, Raivo Vare, Tiit Vihi and Harri Eunapuu attended the meeting and signed a joint statement. President Lennart Meri (foreign minister in Savisaar's cabinet) also attended the meeting. The statement pointed out that the actions of a government have effect only after some years and declared that only history will judge the actions of the present government. Estonia's freedom is not yet irreversible and the necessary national unity is being undermined by the deepening rift between the poor and the wealthy, the former cabinet members warned. Twelve ministers, including Savisaar and Vihi, held a news conference yesterday. Savisaar called for democratic society, systematic work and the involvement of competent specialists in the government. He also pointed out that politics has degenerated into petty squabbling between different forces. Tiit Vihi declared that his cabinet did not differ principally from that of Savisaar. Both ex-premiers rejected suggestions that they may be forming a new alliance, but assured that they are both ready to dedicate themselves to Estonia's progress.
