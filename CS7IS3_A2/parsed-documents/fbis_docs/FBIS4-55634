FBIS4-55634 "dreeu095__a94018" FBIS-EEU-94-095-A Daily Report 14 May 1994 ANNEX Hungary Embassy Dismisses LE SOIR Claims Embassy Dismisses LE SOIR Claims AU1605070294 Budapest MTI in English 1729 GMT 14 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1605070294 Budapest MTI English BFN [Text] Budapest, 14 May (MTI) -- On authorization from the Hungarian Government, the Hungarian Embassy in Brussels forwarded an official communique to the Belgian news agency BELGA on Saturday, in connection with the articles carried in the Friday and Saturday issues of the LE SOIR newspaper. The communique states that the primitive allegations made by those persons arrested recently by Belgian police in a gold selling case form a mix of crude lies and fabrications. The Hungarian authorities firmly reject these, as attempts that are suited to disrupt the ongoing Hungarian election process, and at creating a bad reputation for Hungary. As MTI reported on Friday, Hungary's National Police Command (NPC) dismissed the Friday news in the Belgian LE SOIR of a coup being plotted for the second round of Hungarian elections as totally groundless. LE SOIR said, quoting well-informed sources, that during an action to thwart the sale of 30 kg of false gold Belgian security forces had found documents allegedly referring to plans of purchasing weapons to be used in a "coup attempt" at run-off elections on May 29. The Belgian newspaper has not yet provided concrete details or evidence confirming the news. Police will do its utmost to prevent the second round of parliamentary elections from being disturbed by any unexpected events, the NPC said on Friday. According to a Saturday report filed by MTI's Brussels correspondent, following the brief report on Friday, LE SOIR continued the false gold sale affair, and the alleged related weapons purchasing action, in a more detailed article on Saturday, but still relying on unofficial sources. Saturday's article specially mentioned the alleged Hungarian implications. It was in connection with this that the Hungarian Embassy in Brussels issued its official denial, based on authorization from the Hungarian Government. The article in Saturday's LE SOIR repeats that in the course of a search carried out in the home of one of the persons concerned in the selling of false gold, police found a telefax message about orders for large amounts of ammunition, grenades and missles, that bore the name of an American weapons trading firm. According to the article, two of the five persons arrested in the false gold case were Hungarians (a woman and a 50-year-old man), however, it is not clear from the article if they are Hungarian citizens or of Hungarian origin only. (The Hungarian consulate in Belgium does not believe the persons concerned are Hungarian citizens, as Belgian authorities have in no way contacted the Hungarian foreign representation in the matter by Saturday noon, although the arrests were made on Wednesday.) The article attributes a central role to the "Hungarian" woman, who heads an export-import office in Munich. The article mentions as an example that the Belgian man in whose home the fax message was found confessed that this woman was behind the order, and that she said she was organizing the transaction on behalf of the Hungarian Government. According to LE SOIR, the Belgian man also added that the woman held out the prospect that the order would be realized after the second round of the Hungarian parliamentary elections on May 29. The Belgian security organs and Interpol are carrying out coordinated investigations into the affair, writes the Belgian newspaper. Similary to Friday's LE SOIR article, the Saturday report also lacks any official confirmation or sources.
