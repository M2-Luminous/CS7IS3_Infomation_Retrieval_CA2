The report prepared by the Colombian Government and delivered 12 January by the Colombian foreign minister to President Ramon J. Velasquez establishes that the aircraft entered illegally Colombian territory, violated international and internal rules of states as well as the safety and property of individuals in that country. The Venezuelan foreign minister has said he read carefully the document and found that it is not sufficiently comprehensive. Ochoa Antich has said: "It is said National Guard members fired upon the helicopter themselves, because the shots were fired from the side, instead of from bottom to top. The defense minister made an explanation to me, and I, who also have some knowledge in this regard, believe that it may have occurred while the helicopter made a turn; therefore, this is not enough evidence." Ochoa explained that the Colombian Government has reached negative conclusions regarding the actions of the helicopter crew members and that the reasoning leading to this hypothesis is insufficient." The reason why the report has concluded that the members of the patrol fired the shots is because two empty cases of a 562 projectile appeared near the place where the helicopter was found." For Ochoa, the evidence supplied by Colombia is not sufficiently strong or accurate, and he added that the report's conclusions were based on statements by residents of the area." This leads us to wait for the investigation being conducted by the Defense Ministry." He added that the helicopter case does not merit issuing a letter of protest. When questioned on whether good conduct was the main condition for repatriating Colombian inmates, Ochoa stated flatly: "No. The agreement clearly establishes that the reasons are very specific; they should be sentenced prisoners and must be willing to be sent to the other country." That requisite "is not included in the agreements," he concluded.
