FR941122-0-00026 FR941122-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 38 CFR Part 8 RIN 2900&hyph;AF69 Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: This document amends the Department of Veterans Affairs regulations relating to Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance (S&hyph;DVI) prefixed ``RH'' (pertaining to life insurance acquired by veterans with service-connected disabilities) and ``ARH'' (pertaining to gratuitous life insurance benefits provided to veterans with service-connected disabilities who are not competent to apply for such insurance) to reflect that the statute regarding such insurance has been amended by the Veterans' Benefits Programs Improvement Act of 1991 to provide for a two-year eligibility period and to provide that ARH gratuitous insurance benefits must be paid in one lump sum. These amendments are necessary to conform the regulations to statutory provisions. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 1, 1991. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Gregory C. Hosmer, Senior Insurance Specialist/Attorney, Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office and Insurance Center, P.O. Box 8079, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19101, (215) 951&hyph;5710 . SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 201(b) of the ``Veterans' Benefits Programs Improvement Act of 1991,'' Public Law 102&hyph;86, in part, amended 38 U.S.C. 1922 to increase the S&hyph;DVI eligibility period from one year to two years for veterans found to be eligible for S&hyph;DVI on or after September 1, 1991. Section 202 of Public Law 102&hyph;86 amended 38 U.S.C. 1922 to provide that S&hyph;DVI ``ARH'' benefits must be paid in one lump sum. VA, accordingly, hereby amends 38 CFR 8.0 and 8.116 to reflect these statutory changes. VA has determined that prior publication for notice and public comment is unnecessary since the amendments merely reflect statutory changes and are not subject to rule-making requirements. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs hereby certifies that these final regulations will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason for this certification is that these final regulations merely reflect statutory changes. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program number for these regulations is 64.103. List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 8 National Service Life Insurance. Approved: November 8, 1994. Jesse Brown, Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
