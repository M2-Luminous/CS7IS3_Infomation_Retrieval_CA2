[Nazzal] Hamas' decision is to boycott and not participate in the autonomy elections. This is because these elections are an inseparable part of the Gaza-Jericho plan. Hamas believes this plan eradicates the Palestinian cause. Consequently, not participating in these elections is harmonious with our rejection of this political plan. [AL-SHA'B] However, there are those who demand that you act as an opposition within these Palestinian institutions. What is your reply? How do you envisage the intifadah under these new conditions? [Nazzal] Hamas' opposition to this agreement is continuous. We do not believe there can be opposition through participation in these institutions. It is our opinion that participation in these elections is an acknowledgement and a tacit recognition of the legitimacy of this agreement. The issue is not related to an existing political system but concerns the land and the homeland. As for the intifadah, it can be clearly seen that the military action has escalated quite a lot. It is clear that the number of Israeli casualties is constantly increasing. Perhaps it is one of the few times in which the number of Palestinian martyrs is equal to the number of dead Israelis. [AL-SHA'B] This has caused great apprehensions about the possibility of Palestinian infighting as a result of this wide gap in positions. What practical measures have you taken to prevent this infighting? [Nazzal] We believe the other side [PLO] is required to prove its good intentions regarding infighting. For our part, we have reiterated that we are against Palestinian fratricide. Political assassination is not our course. It is the other side that has issued threats and statements. Therefore, the other side is required to prove its good intentions. For our part, an indication of our good intentions is that during the long course of the negotiations Hamas has not harmed any of the Palestinian negotiating delegation's members. We have issued no threats against anyone. Hamas has not assassinated any Palestinian for political reasons. [AL-SHA'B] Shaykh Ahmad Yasin [Hamas leader now in Israeli jail] has recently sent several letters to Hamas which some lawyers believe contain directives to the Hamas leadership to adopt other means of struggle. [Nazzal] Shaykh Ahmad Yasin's letters are clear and have been published by the media. He has clearly stated that he supports the continuation of military action against the occupation and the continuation of the resistance. He has answered some questions that Hamas has submitted to him, seeking his view on them. I do not believe there is disagreement. The escalation of the confrontation against the occupation is unanimously supported by all Hamas quarters. [AL-SHA'B] What is your current status in the unified leadership of the intifadah? [Nazzal] Hamas has never been a part of the so-called national leadership of the intifadah. This leadership was comprised of the parties participating in the PLO, namely the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the People's Party, and the Fatah movement. However, after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, Fatah and the People's Party withdrew from the unified national leadership in compliance with 'Arafat's commitment to halt the intifadah. Thus, the unified national leadership has ceased to exist from the theoretical point of view. Moreover, it has also ceased to exist from the practical point of view, since the start of the negotiations in Madrid. Following the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the 10 factions have decided to form the so-called national and Islamic leadership of the intifadah. This leadership will comprise the 10 factions' forces in the occupied territories. This leadership exists and we are a member of it. However, so far no final formula has been formulated for the work mechanism of this leadership. However, there is a real determination on our party to work through this leadership in the near future. [AL-SHA'B] How do you evaluate the relationship between you and these factions, especially as there are huge ideological differences among you? Some analysts believe your agreement with them will not last long. [Nazzal] The 10 factions are a formula that has existed despite the presence of ideological and political differences. The 10 factions do not share the same view regarding a settlement. Some factions believe in a political settlement. The 10 factions agree on their stand on the current settlement which is based on the Madrid conference. They agree on the need for the intifadah to continue. Therefore, we can say there is an agreement on a minimum common denominator. [AL-SHA'B] Within the Islamic circle, is there coordination between you and the Islamic Jihad? [Nazzal] In principle, we have no reservations about cooperating with any Palestinian group calling for the continuation of the resistance against occupation and rejecting the current plan. Hence, our hands are extended to all Islamic and non-Islamic Palestinian forces. [AL-SHA'B] Does this mean there is no joint coordination within the Islamic ranks in particular? [Nazzal] There is coordination with the Islamic Jihad within the framework of the 10 factions. [AL-SHA'B] How do you see the next phase? [Nazzal] I can say that as far as we are concerned, the resistance must continue in the next phase. We believe the continuation of the resistance will keep the Palestinian issue alive and will blow up all the bases of coexistence with this entity [Israel]. I believe that the Gaza-Jericho agreement will be the bridge that the Israelis will use to enter the Arab region. Therefore, the Arabs and Muslims must fully realize that they are targeted by this agreement.
