The declaration was made in a leaflet disseminated in Hebron to mark the 29th anniversary of the establishment of Fatah -- 1 January. The establishment of "the militia of Force-17 at this time is part of a well-defined work plan," the leaflet notes, "and is not an attempt to jump the leading wagon or ask for power or leadership positions -- as some believe. We chose this date to make the declaration in order to express our adherence to and confidence in all branches of the Palestinian leadership. We will use our full force to serve the leadership and provide our people with stability and security. We renew our pledge of allegiance to the Palestinian revolution." The authors of the leaflet further explain that Force-17 in the territories will be a pillar of support for "the best men of our nation." In the past, the force served as Yasir 'Arafat's personal guard, but later on 'Arafat distanced himself from the members of the force. The leaflet promises that "today, we begin our journey for the construction of security for our Palestinian nation." Palestinian sources have estimated that behind the leaflet are hawkish Fatah elements which are not pleased with the decision to end terror attacks against Israeli targets, especially after the settlers' riots and the freeze in the negotiations. According to the sources, another possibility is that the Fatah central leadership wishes to demonstrate determined presence in view of the eroding support for Fatah among the residents of the territories. Fatah also wishes to prove to Israel that, should the negotiations with Israel fail, its leadership has other options. About a month ago, Fatah Hawks squads were set up in Hebron. Unlike the original squads in Gaza, the Fatah Hawks in Hebron are not made of armed fugitives, but of activists of the al-Shabiba youth movement. The fact that Fatah Hawks squads, and now Force-17, were established in this region indicates a radicalization of Fatah in the Hebron region, mainly in view of exacerbating confrontations with the city's settlers. Another leaflet Fatah disseminated yesterday to mark the anniversary of its establishment says that the struggle must continue in all forms -- on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.
