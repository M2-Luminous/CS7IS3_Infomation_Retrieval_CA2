To give you more information on the issue, let us speak to Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammadi on the telephone right now: [Announcer] As you know, our president revealed the British espionage activities against Iran. We will be grateful if you can provide more details for our listeners. When was the affair discovered? [Mohammadi] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. In the first week of Ordibehesht [21 April-21 May], when work was being carried out on one of the walls in our embassy in London, workers found a British electronic surveillance device planted in the wall. The issue was assessed so that all the British espionage activities might be investigated and every action that contravenes diplomatic parlance and the Vienna Convention regarding Britain's official espionage might be exposed. The British politicians tried to preempt this with a hasty defensive reaction to cover up this aberration and actions that violate diplomatic practices. They thus committed another blunder. They propounded the issue of our collaboration with the IRA. [Announcer] Thank you. It appears that in its efforts to cover up its humiliation stemming from its espionage, the London government is pursuing other objectives with this propaganda clamor. How do you appraise Britain's overall objectives with this latest propaganda outcry? [Mohammadi] Initially, these were attempts to conceal the espionage affair and violation of diplomatic practices and ethics. At the same time, Britain sought to mask the domestic problems with which it has been grappling for quite some time. By raising such issues in its foreign policy, Britain aims to divert attention from internal and external policy issues. We must mention our diplomatic efforts and moves regarding the rights of the oppressed people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the conflict between our support for Bosnia-Herzegovina and British policy. In this context the hue and cry raised by the British was designed to counteract our policy. When the British perceived their vulnerability and isolation in their support of Rushdie against Muslim public opinion they were forced to concoct a new issue to divert their public and replace the Rushdie issue in this manner. As a result, the objective pursued by Britain was that world attention should be directed toward a new issue that would in some way relate to the United States' accusatory and domineering policies against the Islamic Republic of Iran. [Announcer] I thank you for your explanations and Your Excellency's participation in this talk. [Mohammadi] I thank you. Goodbye. Esteemed listeners, the latest news given to me by my colleagues cites the BBC quoting a British Government spokesman on the revelations of London's espionage against the Islamic Republic of Iran. The spokesman said: We have nothing to say in this regard.
