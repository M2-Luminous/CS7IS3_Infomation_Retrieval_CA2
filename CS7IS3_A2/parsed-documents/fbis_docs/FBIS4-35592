[Shams al-Din] [passage omitted] We have witnessed with great regret that the Zionist movement has been successful over the Arabs and Muslims, though not in an actual war. This is also the case regarding our society and ummah. I do not wish to use unrealistic or anachronistic terms. In view of the fact that the designs of the Zionist movement have been implemented in Palestine, we can say that from this angle we have sustained defeat. They have completely driven us out of Palestine. Similarly, they have pushed us back in all areas, in our position in the world; so at present the issue is not just Palestine. Therefore, we are not pitted against a victorious enemy but we are an ummah who have been beaten back. However, defeat does not mean that we have lost all our means of defense. I stress that the ummah has not used all its offensive resources but has merely suspended the use of its means for defense. [passage omitted] Our condition at present is such that the Arab plan has failed and the Islamic plan has failed. The only place where the Islamic program continues is the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is also under an embargo that is being tightened in the political, economic, and security fields. I fear that the Zionists will drive a wedge thus paving the way for the infiltration of the enemy's designs of our ranks. After the Arabs went to Madrid, I studied the pre-Madrid period in the light of the Fiqh and the shari'ah and I perceived many secondary elements, which cannot be considered primary ones in any way. First of all, I noticed that there were many unfortunate divisions prevalent in many areas. One was a division within the ummah at the political level with regard to political beliefs. The other was a dichotomy of interests between these forces and the ruling system. On this basis, we observe that some systems were facing a split in their ranks. [passage omitted] In my opinion, we should study issues that are important and of primary interest. We are facing problems ourselves, such as the issue of the return of the government of Islam, victory of Islam, the application of the Islamic shari'ah and so on. We have the problem of Arab unity, of Pan-Arab nationalism, which is pressing. There are certain issues which would make the present systems appear illegal. We have problems such as democracy and public freedoms; these are very widespread. From the late 1940's to the 1970's we experienced policies of coups d'etat in Arab countries. Saudi Arabia was the only exception in this regard. [passage omitted] In principle, whatever is going on at present cannot be considered a peace. This is also not a compromise, because we define a compromise as when a person has a right to one of two disputed things. In such a case, the one who has the most relinquishes some of his rights for the sake of peace. What is going on now is actually between the rightful owner and a thief. This is not compromise, it is theft. Thus, it is incorrect to term this a peace process when it is based on the retreat of one side. This is a retreat only on the part of one side and that is the one which is the rightful owner. What is going on now is for the purpose of legislating future interests; since it has resulted from domination, this form of legislation has no legal basis. Western politicians say that this situation is a reality and has evolved this way. We tell them that evil is also a reality in this world, but should we bow down to it? We should resist it instead. [passage omitted] The fact is that the ummah's struggle against Zionism is not a struggle of one generation at one particular time. The Zionist plot belongs to a nation which has placed itself in the thick of international interests; right from the outset, the ummah should fight against it, and it should be considered a struggle spanning many generations. A long-term strategy should be formulated; part of this strategy is to ignore governments, because this struggle does not end with the death of a king or a president. It the battle of all the ummah, whether it spans one generation or three generations. We should also accept the fact that we will have many losses on this path. This is because the plot that we have to fight against is not confined to Palestine, but is a worldwide plot. This is one of the strategic errors--that is, the Arabs thought they could combat Zionist plots in the short term. It is for this reason that we state that the ummah should reassert itself to combat the Zionist plot, as the ummah is not limited to a single generation.
