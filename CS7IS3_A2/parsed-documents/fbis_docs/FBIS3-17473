Zhirinovskiy yesterday sent a letter to Estonian Ambassador to Russia Juri Kahn stating that "coercive measures and provocations against the well-known Russian defender of the law and RLDP activist" Pyotr Rozhok may bring about "unforeseen consequences" in relations between Estonia and Russia. "Estonia's statehood, gained thanks to communists, may in the troubled times of the 20th century, if Russia's interests are disregarded, become an ordeal for Estonia. Provocations and pressure are not the right key in relations with a 150-million nation. Let the organizers of such actions think deeply about the possible consequences," Zhirinovskiy said in the letter. The Estonian Security Police on March 24 seized Rozhok and took him to psychiatric expertise. After that the police, in the presence of the Russian vice consul, searched Rozhok's apartment. They confiscated five brochures published by the RLDP and a manuscript intended for publication "in a Russian-language newspaper," Rozhok told BNS. Security Police Director General Juri Pihl told BNS investigation of Rozhok's case will soon be completed and the materials turned over to the court. The Security Police on March 16 filed formal charges against the 55-year-old Rozhok under Article 72 of the Criminal Code, accusing him of "fanning ethnic and political hatred." Addressing a meeting of the Russian Citizens' Union of Narva on Jan. 18, Rozhok said Lennart Meri "is, at best, the president of Estonians, not of Estonia," since the Russian-speaking population did not take part in the presidential elections. The same applies to the parliament, he said. In an interview to the Russian-language newspaper published in Sillamae, Rozhok claimed Estonia is an ancient Russian territory. In Rozhok's opinion, the retired Russian military living in Estonia should form armed units "to defend their honor and dignity" in case the authorities decide to deport them from Estonia.
