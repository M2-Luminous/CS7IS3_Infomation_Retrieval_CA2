CARENA intends to gather together about 100 participants in Port-au-Prince on 6 and 7 February, including five representatives of the legally recognized political parties, as well as representatives of the socioprofessional and religious sectors. The organizers' optimism is not dampened by the fact that most institutions have not yet designated their official representatives. According to Adyjeangardy, spokesman for the organizing committee, the parliament is ready to legitimize the resolutions of the CARENA conference on 6 and 7 February. He asserts that some senators have already advised CARENA of their intention to ratify all preparations for the conference, which should attract more than 1,000 [as heard] participants. [passage omitted]. CARENA also asserts that the countries called the Friends of Haiti have welcomed its demand for postponement of reinforced sanctions against Haiti. CARENA is satisfied with the decision of the country's friends of the UN secretary general to favorably answer its request to postpone reinforcement of the sanctions against Haiti, while awaiting participation by all sectors in the national conference in Haiti on 6 and 7 February. Contacts at the highest level have been made with the United States, France, Venezuela, Canada, the Vatican, the UN and OAS secretaries general, and the current president of the Security Council for this position to be adopted and maintained following the efforts of CARENA, which will continue so that future resolutions of the national conference can be executed at the national and international level.
