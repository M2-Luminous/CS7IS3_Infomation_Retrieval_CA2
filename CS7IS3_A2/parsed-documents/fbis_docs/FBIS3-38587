FBIS3-38587 "drweu024_e_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-024 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Feb 1994 UNITED KINGDOM Major Attempts To Quell Rift Within Tory Party PM0402121894 London THE DAILY TELEGRAPH in English 4 Feb 94 p 1 PM0402121894 London THE DAILY TELEGRAPH Language: English Article Type:BFN [George Jones article: "The Feuding Has To Stop, Major Tells Tory MP's"] [Text] Mr Major sought to bolster his leadership last night with an impassioned appeal to Tory MPs to stop their feuding which, he said, could result in the Tories being thrown out of offlce at the next election. He served notice that ministers whose personal or political behaviour fell below acceptable standards would be asked to resign immediately and not try to ride out unfavourable publicity. Mr Major said the Government's "good news" message on the economy was being drowned out by the trivia, artificial rows, disagreements and divisions within the party. The party must transcend personal ambitions and feelings. In future he would put concern "for the country and party before the personal feelings of others." His appeal for unity came as the latest Gallup poll, published in THE DAILY TELEGRAPH today, showed that the so-called sleaze factor -- the recent spate of personal and political scandals involving Tory politicians -- was beginning to damage the party's standing with the voters. According to the poll nearly two-thirds of voters -- including more than a quarter of Tory supporters -- believe "the Conservatives these days give the impression of being very sleazy and disreputable." Mr Major, exasperated by weeks of internal bickering and sniping at his leadership, stepped up his efforts to reassert his authority by making a direct appeal to the backbench 1922 Committee. It followed his rebuff on Monday [31 January] for leaders of the right-wing 92 Group of MPs who had been pressing for a Cabinet reshuffle. They were shown the door after two minutes. Usually the party leader delivers an end-of-term message to the troops, and Mr Major's decision to address MPs last night was a direct response to calls for him to "take a grip" on his party. He told them: "The sniping has to stop. The feuding has to stop. The squandering of energies on petty factionalism has to stop. "We have to unite and fight for what we all believe in. That means self-discipline, hard work, back to the basics of politics with a vengeance." He went on: "I am not prepared to stand quietly by and see our party squander its power and lose its opportunity for good." Mr Major rounded on those he accused of criticising him behind his back. "I do not flinch from criticism but I would rather have it direct than anonymously, face-to-face rather than behind the hand." There was laughter when he added: "I will stop reading the papers if you will stop talking to them." In what will be seen as a warning that such feuding could cost the Tories the next election, he said he had never been in Opposition but he believed it would be "miserable and frustrating." His tough talking delighted most Tory MPs, anxious to be given a lead after several weeks in which the Government has been blown off course. He was given a two-minute standing ovation. Mr Tom King, former Defence Secretary, said it was just what the party needed.
