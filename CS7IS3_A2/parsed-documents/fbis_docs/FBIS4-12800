Using various types of weapons, the Serbian troops poured their wrath on the Muslims surrounded in Gorazde, the paper says. In an editorial today, the mouthpiece of the opposition Wafd Party blames the UN Security Council for what is happening to the Bosnian Muslims, saying the UN resolutions lacked the necessary measures to deter the aggressors. The paper expresses surprise at the stance by NATO, the owner of the biggest military force, which sent one plane once and two planes another time to attack Serbian positions. It describes the American stance as insufficient, the international stance as feeble, and the Russian stance as odd, because it tolerates the slaughter of Muslims in Bosnia and threatens a fierce war if the air strikes against Serbs continue. AL-WAFD notes that Russia's stance costs it the sympathy of the Third World, sympathy that it has gained over the years, because it is turning from a state that defends peace into a state that propagates war and the killing of innocent people.
