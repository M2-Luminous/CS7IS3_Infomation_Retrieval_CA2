Especially in recent years, among the local faction in Yunlin County, under the law of the jungle's "struggle for survival," the discard rate of local political figures has been particularly high. To understand the strong figures who have newly appeared on the political stage, I'm afraid we must search the "Record of Instability in Western Taiwan" in the news archives for society in the past one or two decades, and not the local political records. "First become a brother and then become a member of the legislature" is the "mood of a drifter" on Yunlin's page. From the local legislative council to the center's National Assembly halls, there is no lack of "big brother-type" figures who in these years made a big splash. After the recent elections of county members of the legislature and of heads of townships and towns, in Yunlin County inroads were made by more local political figures who in past years were important armed criminals or who were trained to be gangsters. Moreover, at the side of local faction leaders there is even no lack of "wolves" whose previous crimninal records as important armed criminals in cases of robbery created a stir in their early years. Because of the sudden increase in "huge profits" politically from "changing to inferior election styles," these "brothers" who can frighten people do not just engage in shootouts for control of gambling halls and bars; they have expanded their undertakings to aggregate construction, land brokerage, election canvassing, and entertainment, and have established national connections of enormous power. Ordinarily, local affairs amount at the smallest to traffic accident settlements and disputes over debts and business operations, and at the largest to local elections and factional grievances. Provided that these "brothers" make their appearance, everybody will be fearful and the dignified ones will be the "black peacemakers." The recent election of the principal and deput speakers of the legislative body is the best example of this. Precisely like the samurai films depicting Japan's Shogunate Era, the leaders of local factions care for and harbor "samurai" who excel in the martial arts in order to consolidate their own political and economic domains. When each faction sticks to its own position, the factions do not hesitate to develop their "strength" by letting the "brothers" go into action on their behalf. Last year there was even performed a play in which a "venerable godfather-type" figure in the political world was forced to withdraw from an election. This "retired" godfather in that year may be said to be the "First Ancestor" who "pulled" many "small brothers" into the political world; at the same time he was also the benefactor who got cases dismissed for "little brothers" wanted by the police, but the "little brothers" of the hostile factions that had become big and strong forced the "big brother to yield." Opening the "Record of Instability in Western Taiwan," we see that in each of the 60th and 70th years of the republic there was a sensational gangland robbery case as well as several top news stories about factional fighting in society between "big brothers." The figure with real strength now on the political stage in Yulin County was not involved in these cases; rather, he was the benefactor who, after the event, spared no effort and lost no time in guaranteeing that the "brothers" got out of prison. Therefore, after getting out, these "brothers" gravitated to the side of the local politician. In the 60th year of the republic, a "venerated" "model brother" of Yunlin County who had committed armed robbery and murder was sentenced to 11 years in prison. When in Chiayi while being escorted to prison, he was forcibly freed by his father and his subordinates Ting Jih-ch'ing [0002 2480 3237] and Hsu Hsiu-ch'uan [6079 4423 3123]. This first case in the country of a forcible freeing of a prisoner greatly enhanced the fame of the "model brother" and Ting Jih-ch'ing along the underworld's "grapevince," and established their positions in gangland. In particular, the way Ting Jih-ch'ing's getaway car evaded police roadblocks was enough to make him proud as a peacock. However, after fleeing for a period of time, they were caught and returned to prison. It is said that during the years that the "model brother" was a fugitive he got financial aid from a certain member of the legislature from Yunlin. In October of the 70th year of the republic, when old Ting Jih-ch'ing of the Read Sealine Gang in western Taiwan was carousing in the Hungyulin Bar in Hsilo Town, his subordinates for a time carelessly relaxed their guard, and Chang Chin-shu [4545 6855 2885], a subordinate of "Little Lin" [1420 2651], a member of the "tiger tail" "Central Plains Gang," which was as incompaptible as fire and water with Ting's gang, fired three shots killing Ting. Not long afterward, Chang Chin-shu was shot and severely wounded in Paochung Township by Liu An-yuan [3966 1344 0337], a "hitman" instigated by Ch'en Lung [3086 7127]. After Ch'en Lung and Liu An-yuan were arrested, their subordinate 15-year-old Huang [7806] X in collusion with Li [2621], Lin [2651], Hsu [6079] and other "brothers," in July of the 72d year of the republic, brandishing swords and guns in front of Yunlin's local court, openly freed Liu and Ch'en, who were being brought to the court for trial as the suspected criminals in the shooting case. Among those taking part in this action was Ting Hsueh-ching [0002 1331 4842], who once drove a getaway car for Lo Ch'ing-chin [5012 3237 6930], an important criminal. When he was in a reformator, Ting wrote a story about an underworld drifter entitled "Wind and Cloud in Western Taiwan." Now the "model brother," who more than 20 years ago was forcibly freed from police custody, has become an official of a certain large entertainment company and a certain sandstone plant, both in Yunlin. He was involved in an arms smuggling case but was protected by a certain heavyweight member of the Legislative Yuan from Yunlin. In recent years, although he has not bothered to settle old gangland scores. when an election battle heats up this "big brother" takes action to repay an old favor or old injury. Moreover, "Little Lin," a circular order for whose arrest has been put out, in legendary style ran for county legislature member 12 years previously; later, after the strong protection of a certain "godfather" got a case against him dismissed, he was elected to be county legislature member, thereby beginning the meteoric rise in his political career. And "model brother" Ch'en, who 12 years before had been forcibly freed from police custody, also this year was elected by a big margin to be a Yunlin legislature member. It is said that among the current members of the legislature from Yunlin County, there has been an increase of four "big brother types" who had been in police custody or who had a previous criminal record. In addition, many "brothers" wha had been involved in the forcible freeing of police prisoners have now become "big brothers" who stick to the sides of a certain government VIP. Furthermore, the chief of staff "black dog" of Lin Lai-fu's [2651 0171 4395], who three or four years ago headed the list of most wanted armed criminals, is said to be the trusted lieutenant at the side of this government VIP, who had gone abroad for medical treatment, and he has made this "underworld" force the biggest faction in Yunlin County. Such being the case, how could a local election not be a case of "black heaven and dark earth"?
