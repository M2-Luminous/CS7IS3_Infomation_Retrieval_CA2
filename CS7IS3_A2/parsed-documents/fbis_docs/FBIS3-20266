The negotiators, who have approved all the non-controversial documents which are to be presented to the GATT ministerial conference in Marrakesh from April 12 to 15, also set aside a document approving the creation of a committee to prepare for the setting up of the World Trade Organisation which is to replace the GATT in 1995.
