In a statement published by London-based AL-WASAT magazine, carried yesterday by the UAE's news agency, UAE's Minister of state for foreign affairs Hamdan Bin-Zayid Al Nuhayyan said his country, along with the other GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] member states, would remain keen on establishing good relations with Iran. But it will never accept the policy of threats and occupation, he said. As the UAE will never give up even one span of its territories, then the problem of the three islands will constitute an obstacle before normalizing relations with Iran, he said. If the Iranians have the historical documents which prove their ownership of the three islands, then they should present them before the international justice court, he said and added 'we will accept the verdict issued by the international court'. Al Nuhayyan pointed out that refusal of Iran to arbitration would mean that it has no sovereignty on the three islands. On the problem of Yemen, Al Nuhayyan said his country does not support any of the conflicting parties in Yemen. He noted that the UAE had mediated to settle the Yemeni dispute before the break-out of the war between Sanaa and Aden. We have shown our keenness on Yemeni unity, but we believe that this unity should not come by means of force, he said highlighting the assistance extended by the UAE to Yemen before the announcement of the unity. Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, the president of the UAE, has made it clear to the Yemeni leaders that unity cannot be imposed by force, he said.
