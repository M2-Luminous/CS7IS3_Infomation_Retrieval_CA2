FBIS4-10702 "drlat074_c_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-074 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 MEXICO Government: Peace Not Jeopardized Government: Peace Not Jeopardized PA1604000894 Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2236 GMT 15 Apr 94 PA1604000894 Hamburg DPA Spanish BFN [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 15 Apr (DPA) -- The Mexican Government has said that today's predawn attack on a military checkpoint in southern Chiapas does not jeopardize the peace process in this strife-torn region that borders Guatemala. A spokesman for the Mexican presidential palace told DPA there does not seem to be any relation between the attack on the checkpoint near Tuxtla Gutierrez and the armed conflict that broke out in this state on 1 January. In this way, the government dismissed reports that the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), which took up arms on New Year's Day, waged the attack. Chiapas Attorney General Arturo Becerra said that so far there are no indications the EZLN was involved in the attack on the checkpoint located on the highway leading from Tuxtla Gutierrez to Chicoasen, a town that is far removed from the guerrilla's zone of operations. Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno, in turn, stressed that the truce between the insurgents and the Mexican Army, which has been in effect since 12 January when the government ordered a unilateral cease-fire of its offensive actions, "is alive." The Defense Secretariat today said an Army sergeant died as a result of wounds sustained when "a small group of unidentified civilians" opened fire on the military checkpoint. According to the official report, the Army repelled the "armed assault" and the assailants fled. It is believed that they are hidden in caves in the mountains near the site of the skirmish. There is no word on casualties among the attackers. An hour afer the clash, which began at approximately 0530 (1130 GMT), several Armed Forces helicopter gunships were still flying over the area and firing, according to reports from residents. The area was reopened to traffic after it had been sealed off for several hours. The EZLN recently charged that the Army has been mobilizing troops and warned that such deployments threaten the peace process, which began on 21 February. The first phase of the peace process ended on 2 March when the government announced its responses to a 34-point list of demands submitted by the rebels. In the wake of the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's presidential candidate, the EZLN suspended its consultations on the government's proposals -- consultations that were being held within Indian villages located in the EZLN's area of influence.
