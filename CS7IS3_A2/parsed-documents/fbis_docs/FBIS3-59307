Naturally, there is intense conflict between the local civil servants and foreign civil servants hired abroad, but even among local civil service groups, there is dissention. This has cast a shadow over Hong Kong's social stability in the post-transition period, which is most regrettable. The Hong Kong government has suddenly announced the policy of allowing foreign civil servants to turn local contract workers, and this has evoked strong repercussions among Hong Kong's more than 100,000 Chinese civil servants who believe that this is clearly the Hong Kong government's attempt to undermine the localization program. The Hong Kong media are almost unanimous in their opposition to this new policy. The British-Hong Kong government probably had not anticipated this loud voice of opposition toward this foreign civil servant conversion system, and except for sending a minister-level officer to hurriedly explain to Hong Kong's several large civil service associations to minimize the impact of the incident, it tried to defend itself saying that the plan in no way contradicted the policy of localization of civil servants. Ford Misleads the Public According to the British-Hong Kong government's official explanation, the British rushed through the foreign civil servant conversion plan without prior deliberation or consultation because the government was concerned that the foreign civil servants might sue the government on human rights grounds, charging the government of depriving them of their right to continue to work in Hong Kong after 1997. In particular, many among the foreigners have lived in Hong Kong for seven years or longer, which would qualify them as local residents under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law's definition. Upon making its studies, the Legal Department concluded that if the overseas employees should sue the government, there was a good chance that the government would lose. Even before there is a lawsuit, the government has declared that it would lose. This is quite unheard of. Subsequently, the British-Hong Kong government's Chief Secretary Ford defended this new plan saying it complied with the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the pertinent articles of the Basic Law and that it was an effective measure to keep the talented people in Hong Kong after 1997. Ford may be guilty of taking things out of context and misleading the people, because the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the articles in the Basic Law never discriminated against foreign civil servants. Except for a handful of minister-level positions which must be filled by Chinese nationals after 1997 to give expression to Chinese sovereignty and the policy of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong, other government department positions are to be recruited openly, and anyone with ability, regardless of nationality, is eligible for consideration. Thus, after the Hong Kong SAR government is established in 1997, the criterion for recruiting civil servants will be "appointment based on ability only," and foreign-born civil servants will not be denied their right to continue to serve Hong Kong; however, the special privileges and benefits they enjoyed in the past under the rule of the colonial government will not be extended beyond 1997. British-Hong Kong Has Always Discriminated Against Local Public Servants An editorial in a Chinese language magazine actually called upon the Hong Kong people to be generous in accepting foreign civil servants to continue to serve Hong Kong after 1997, so that Hong Kong could retain its characteristic as a large international city. Some pro-Britain Legislative Council members even expressed concern that any rejection of foreign civil servants would infer or border on racial discrimination. This is pure "slavish comprador philosophy." In the past, the British-Hong Kong colonial government has always favored foreign civil servants and has always discriminated against native Chinese civil servants. It was only as a result of the arduous struggles of the local civil servants a decade or so ago that the Hong Kong government agreed to implement the policy of localization of civil servants. But there has never been any clear results, and the local public employees have long harbored much resentment. But now the British-Hong Kong government has executed a sneak attack by suddenly announcing the foreign civil servant conversion system, permitting those who meet the qualifications to convert to local civil servant status; they even called that a part of the localization process. This is stealing the sky and putting up a sham sun -- a gigantic fraud. The original meaning of the policy to localize the public servants is pure and simple. It means to give the local Chinese employees who make up the majority of the contingent of civil servants a better chance of being promoted. But today, the government is trying in vain to call the foreign civil servant conversion plan a part of the localization process and even saying that this plan applies to less than 200 foreign public servants. This is a sly manipulation of statistics, because this handful of foreign employees all hold high-ranking positions in various government departments, and if they are considered local employees after 1997, they will never leave, and this will directly jeopardize the promotion opportunity for hundreds and thousands of local Chinese civil servants. No wonder when this new policy was announced, local Chinese civil servants were in an uproar. The authorities announced this new policy on the third day after Governor Patten had gone on vacation. Was it a coincidence, or was it pre-arranged? Before Patten left Hong Kong, he had said that during his vacation, he would read no official documents, nor did he want his subordinates to fax him anything which could spoil his holidays. Is Patten going to ignore everything and wait until the whole affair blows over before coming back to work, so that he would not have to face the local Chinese civil servants? The fact is, since Patten took office in July of last year, he has consciously or unconsciously let the foreign civil servants keep all the privileges they enjoy in the Hong Kong government. He not only has announced the continued employment of Chief Secretary Ford who should be retiring, but he has also deliberately ignored Chen Tsu-tse [7115 4371 3419] who was expected to be the first Chinese to become chief secretary before 1997. Chen has become so discouraged that he eventually quit his position at the Education and Manpower Planning Department and quietly left the Hong Kong government. The British-Hong Kong Government's Move Divides the Civil Servants One of the main reasons for the Hong Kong government's announcement permitting foreign civil servants to change systems is that if qualified overseas employees were not allowed to turn local and keep their jobs, the government could be sued by the Overseas Employee Association for human rights violations. But according to the terms of employment of overseas workers, once the contract expires, the government has the right to renew or terminate any overseas employee's contract as warranted. In other words, even if an overseas civil servant meets all the requirements of becoming a local employee, it does not mean that his or her contract will be automatically renewed upon expiration or that he or she can continue to work in the government. This is but the government's deliberate attempt to mislead the public. The already not very stable contingent of civil servants is badly torn and divided over this new measure suddenly introduced by the authorities allowing the conversion of foreign employees. Between the local and foreign employees, there naturally are serious conflicts, but even among local civil service groups, there are dissentions. This has cast a shadow over Hong Kong's social stability in the post-transition period, which is most regrettable. Today, some local civil service groups are prepared to sue the Hong Kong government, and others are drafting private lawsuits to prevent the conversion of foreign civil servants. The matter has become even more complicated. It is learned that the Chinese authorities have formally asked to discuss the matter at the 27th round Sino-British Joint Liaison Group Meeting to be held in Beijing in mid-September. This no doubt will add another variable to the Sino-British negotiations over Hong Kong's political reform. Prospects are grim.
