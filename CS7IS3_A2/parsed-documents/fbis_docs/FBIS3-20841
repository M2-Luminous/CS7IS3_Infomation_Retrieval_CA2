People are waiting patiently around the telephone to call their friends and relatives on the other side of the front, in the Muslim section of Sarajevo. The telephone represents life, hope and anxiety, and it is the only line for direct dialing of the number unless it has been changed or the line is down, and it is located in the room of the Exchange Commission. The lads in camouflage uniforms are also here: Rajko Sforcan, Slavisa Tusevljak and Dragan Divcic, all members of the commission. What dramas they have witnessed in these two years of war! How many human destinies have been recited in the room with the gray telephone on the little black shelf... Grbavica and Vrace, which are Serb sections of Sarajevo, seem ghostly in the twilight. Broken windows, buildings riddled and wounded by shells and shrapnel, lights flickering behind drapes, a stray dog here and there, silence in which one can hear the whistle of the sniper bullet. And in some parts of Sarajevo there are not only private bordellos, both voluntary and involuntary, and private prisons, but there are even private cemeteries. For 20 to 50 marks the professional killers will murder anyone, and to prove their rating as 'bad guys' they bury their victims in their own orderly private cemetery. It is an open and ongoing competition, and various Celos, Josos and Musos are masters of the life and death of innocent civilians. The "Comanche" Bunker The Lukavica Garrison is a forward command post of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps of the Army of the Srpska republic. Maj Gen Stanislav Galic, that corps's commander, lives here at a crowflight's distance of 400 meters from the Muslim positions on Mojmilo Hill, but that does not disturb him very much. His two bodyguards, military policemen, have the coldest miens the author of this article has seen on any battlefield in the world: neither smile nor grimace, no talk, no questions, no answers. Ice and only ice, so that the atmosphere becomes unpleasant. General Galic, fortunately, is a sociable fellow who knows what the media can do. Capt 1st Class Predrag Glusica, a mechanical engineer from Sarajevo who has spent three years living and working in Chicago, is also here as his officer for finance, physical inventories and supply. He is actually the financial genius of this corps, and he goes right to the first line of combat. That front line has somehow been pushed into the background in the media, so that members of the crew of the Comanche Bunker on Zlatiste, that is, Babin Zub, emphasize that there is not a single regular army officer among the fighting men in that area; they are all reserve officers. Mladen Popovic, Novica Skrba, Dragisa Tusevljak, Vladimir Skrba, Milutin Trifkovic and Nevenko Divcic, members of the combat team of the Comanche Bunker, are only 50 meters from the Muslim positions. "We exchange shouts with the Muslims every day, both they and we have enough of war. Half an hour ago a Muslim came to have coffee with us. We invited him. Now he just keeps hanging around," the "Comanches" say. The bunker was improvised from corrugated sheet metal, bricks, wood, small drums, earth and logs. Inside there is a tin heater, fire and moisture. Three beds, four chairs, automatic weapons and rifles with telescopic sights on the walls. Only the weapons are clean and shiny. "We spend one day, all 24 hours, on position, the next day we go to nearby houses to rest," they say. They are all from Sarajevo or environs. What is the food like? Bad, couldn't be worse. "We have not seen meat for five months, nor, by God, have we seen our defense minister visiting the front lines. Our teeth are going bad, falling out, our vision is failing because of the poor diet, but what can you do, we know that this is war, and there is no other way." A Serbian Pentagon Underground The "Comanches" squat in their bunker, the tin heater roars with the wet wood, the observers strain their eyes at the loopholes and ramparts, staring into the darkness. The dark vilayet of Bosnia... Part of the 4th Battalion of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps is in a little wood a bit further on from Zlatiste. An elite unit of the Army of the Srpska republic. Its commander is Maj Radomir Kojic, height two meters, weight 95 kilograms. When he talks to the officers and men of the French battalion that is part of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force], the French get an inferiority complex, since Maj Kojic is one of the best commandos of the Serbian army in Bosnia, a participant in the most difficult missions and operations, always in the front ranks. The French know that, and that is why they respect him. To be sure, they have no choice, since they have come from hot Africa, from Chad, to icebound Jahorina, where Maj Kojic washes with snow, naked to the waist, and the French wear bulletproof vests even when they go to the toilet. As a matter of fact, as soon as it gets a bit 'thick,' the French flee to Kojic for his care and protection, and he receives them and looks at them as a snake does a frog.... At least for the present. The deadline for the NATO ultimatum has passed, the Army of the Srpska republic is nevertheless still on the alert. False positions are being built, the real ones are being fortified. The UNPROFOR has already lodged an official protest because the Serbs are building false positions. "It is up to you to distinguish the real ones from the false ones," the Serbian side replied. In this game of one-upmanship and electronic surveillance NATO is especially monitoring the activity of the general staff of the Serbian army, which has its central post in the hills of eastern Bosnia. This is actually an underground command complex that dates from the time of the former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], the army command post and headquarters for the Supreme Command of the former Yugoslavia in case of war. It is all underground, in the hills, resistant even to the shocks of atomic bombs up to 50 kilotons, everything is completely self-sufficient and automated. The people who live in that underground city can be out of touch with the outside world for as long as six months, that is the extent of their stocks of food, fuel and ammunition. There is everything under the sun in that underground command post: dormitories, a kitchen, a mess hall, a storeroom, offices, an operations center, a meeting room, a hospital, sanitary facilities, a computer center, a tangle of corridors, steel doors operated hydraulically, special tunnels and camouflaged entrances, filters or ventilation and kilometers of cable and pipe. The systems of communications from this command center of the Army of the Srpska republic cannot be jammed unless the site is attacked with 50-kiloton atomic bombs. Communications have been interrupted twice, when the Serbian side was simulating a nuclear attack: on 7 August 1992, lasting 35 minutes, and on 16 June 1993, lasting 15 minutes. Even the NATO experts were immediately wondering: Why has the Serbian Pentagon gone silent?
