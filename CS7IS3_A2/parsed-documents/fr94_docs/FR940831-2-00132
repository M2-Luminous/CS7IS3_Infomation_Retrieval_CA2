FR940831-2-00132 FR940831-2-00098 The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for McCarran International Airport, also effective on August 19, 1994. Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements for the submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to approval or disapproval of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or before February 15, 1995. The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 150, Section 150.33. The primary considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety, create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses. Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments, other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable. Copies of the noise exposure maps and of the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program are available for examination at the following locations: Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Room 617, Washington, DC 20591 Federal Aviation Administration, Western-Pacific Region, Airports Division, Room 3012, 15000 Aviation Boulevard, Hawthorne, California 90261 Federal Aviation Administration, San Francisco Airports District Office, 831 Mitten Road, Burlingame, California 94010&hyph;1303 Mr. Robert N.
