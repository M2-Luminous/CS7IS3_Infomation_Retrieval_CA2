FR940314-2-00069 FR940314-2-00043 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. General Primary Care Services Delivery Grant Amounts It is estimated that approximately $521 million in discretionary continuation grants for CHC activities (i.e., approximately $478 million for general primary care services delivery and $43 million for CPCP and SIMRI activities) and approximately $59 million in discretionary grants for continuation of MHC activities (i.e., approximately $57 million for general primary care services delivery and $2 million for CPCP and SIMRI activities) will be available under sections 330 and 329 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 254c and 254b, respectively). Of the total $45 million available for CPCP and SIMRI activities, approximately $10 million will be for SIMRI. In addition, approximately $16 million will be available for existing C/MHCs to support the increased cost of providing services to their current patients. Within the $16 million, approximately $10 million will be available for current service adjustments, including support for the recruitment and retention of health care providers in C/MHCs, service education linkages with academic institutions, school-based or school-linked programs, and activities to address high prevalence morbidity and mortality (e.g., HIV/AIDS). Current service adjustments, where applicable, enable C/MHCs to show the need for additional funds to maintain the existing range of services for the current number of patients when existing levels of service cannot be supported with the total Federal and non-Federal revenue. The remaining $6 million will be used for C/MHC improvement proposals to enhance the provision of required services. Such improvement proposals should be presented in priority order. The improvement proposals for which funding may be made available include the following required services: dental, pharmacy, culturally sensitive/ translation services, and case management. Number of Awards A total of approximately 600 C/MHC grants will be made available, of which approximately 223 ($216 million) will be for competing continuation grants and approximately 377 ($364 million) will be for non-competing continuation grants. Approximately 300 of these grants will include CPCP and SIMRI activities. Grants will range from approximately $200,000 to approximately $2 million for general primary care services delivery (C/MHC). Grants will range from approximately $24,000 to approximately $450,000 for CPCP and SIMRI activities in C/MHCs. Awards will be made for a one year budget period. SIMRI grantees will continue to have budget periods beginning September 30 for FY 1994. Project periods will be for up to three years. Requests for current service adjustments and improvement proposals will be included in the continuation grant application.
