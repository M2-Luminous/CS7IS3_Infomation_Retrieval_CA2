The floodgates for investors to go to Vietnam is now wide open. Don't you think that this will affect the Philippines' potential for investment in our part of the globe? [Ramos] You know, within three hours of our hearing of the lifting by President Clinton of the trade embargo in Vietnam, I issued a statement -- which already has been published in our newspapers, and that should already be there in Cebu by now because that was last week -- supporting the lifting of the trade embargo because in the overall, our assessment -- my assessment -- is that the opening up of trade all over the world -- especially here in Asia and the Pacific; our region -- will lead to advantages to the Philippines also. And we need not be panicked again by a possible competitor on the part of Vietnam in regard to the capturing of investments as well as the sale to the world market of similar products. As far as I'm concerned, there could be some complimentarity between the Philippines and Vietnam. We can even be partners with each other to put out cheaper and high quality goods, even if our raw materials are about the same. We can also help Vietnam, as we have helped them in the deepest moments of their crisis since the middle 60's. We have good rapport with the people of Vietnam, and now even the government of Vietnam. We can help them in certain types of expertise because of our higher level of technical experience. But I think most of all we should look at the advantages inherent in the Philippines itself. Labor costs are higher here than Vietnam, but I say that we are more strategically located in terms of Asia and the Pacific. We're the gateway here, with access both to the mainland of Asia as well as the Pacific rim of North America. We're also, I would say, better -- much better -- in communications. We don't need an interpreter in the Philippines to do international business in the Philippines. [passage omitted] [Angelo Abarico, in Davao City] Mr. President: Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia was here last Sunday and he spoke about the need for intensifying trade among ASEAN members and spoke about AFTA, which is the Asean Free Trade Area. Today, Ambassador Negroponte of the U.S. Embassy in Manila was here in Davao and he also spoke about the need for more trade and less aid to this country. In fact, he said that the United States Government is phasing out aid to foreign recipients. He also spoke about the NAFTA, or the North American Free Trade Area. Mr. President, are we prepared to take advantage if there are any advantages in the AFTA? And are we prepared also for the possible adverse effects that might come through NAFTA? [Ramos] [passage omitted] AFTA itself as a program was launched 1 January 1993 -- during my time -- as a result of that summit decision. So we are into it. What it envisions over the next 15 years after 1993 is a gradual reduction of tariffs within our six countries in ASEAN, so that at the end there is nothing bigger than a 5 percent tariff. Now, in between are milestones that we must achieve also, meaning we lessen the number of items which are to be benefited by protective tariff. At the same time, we reduce the rate of tariffs. In general, that is what is the agreement in AFTA. With NAFTA, I have said that there are complimentarities in NAFTA and AFTA. It is not necessarily one against the other, or they are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Although in two areas... [pauses] You people in Bacolod, listen to this. Regarding sugar, that might be threatened. Garments might also be threatened, because these are Mexican products, and it is easy to bring them into the United States. Under a NAFTA situation, there could be lowering of tariffs also, and so their products -- coming from Mexico for sugar and garments -- might be more competitive than ours. But so far, we have been assured by the U.S. Government that Philippine sugar and garment products will not be jeopardized. In fact, the quota for garments has been increased as between the Philippines and the United States, and we're seeing this as a very good opportunity for expanding exports in garments to the United States. During the APEC meeting in Seattle last November, I emphasized that since we are in the middle of it -- we have both AFTA and NAFTA historical connections -- we should try to look for the complimentarities between the two systems. Meaning our garments have an advantage, because it is not necessarily true that just because Mexico is nearby, that they can produce products needed in the United States better than those of us in the Philippines. That is not necessarily true. So let's look for our comparative advantage, even if there is NAFTA. Then let's press on that because we have also this advantage of proximity if we are looking at the Pacific states of the United States and even Canada itself. [passage omitted] [Hector Villanueva, MANILA CHRONICLE, in the PTV-4 studio] What are the most urgent reforms or legislations are you pursuing now? [Ramos] Well, I told you Chito that out of that legislative- executive minisummit, or caucus, we came up with about 15 agreed key priority, urgent legislative proposals. Now, when we discussed this with the people in the multisectoral survey, or summit, this ballooned to about 93 executive-legislative proposals. But we have refined that since then, and this was done as a result of the agreement to cease fire the unicameral issue, about three weeks ago. Before they resume their sessions on 24 January, and the 15 top bills, if I remember, are: Amendments to the BOT [build-operate- transfer] law -- this is now being done in the Senate under Senator Arroyo; the liberalization of the banking system; the amendments to the Foreign Investments Act, FIA; the so-called higher education bill; the dual education and training system, meaning private sector must come in to help in the transfer of science and technology to our young people; refinements to the VAT [value added tax]; the improvement of our geothermal exploration effort, because certain incentives will be added there; the upgrading of science and technology in our country; and then there is that body of laws, resolutions, ratifications, related to the Uruguay round of GATT so that the Philippines can accede to the forthcoming world trade organization; and then there is a set of bills on population stabilization. Now, it is not all tax measures, but some of them are revenue enhancement in terms of organization, policy, computerization, etc., and I think they agreed on this being the calendar for the next several weeks in both houses in Congress. [passage omitted] I am very confident that our economy is on the verge of take-off. In 1993, the economy performed very well in spite of the fact that we achieved targets not as high as our neighbors. We are also enjoying unprecedented stability as well as social cohesion. If we use as a base the fine cooperation between the executive and the legislative, that is something in our favor. We are also seeing now a greater appreciation of our neighbors around us of the value and the worth of the Philippines as an investment, tourism, and trade destination. The result is the influx of investors and visits by high government officials and just plain tourists. One of the fruits of our making visits abroad last year are the return visits of our colleagues in government, and they always bring with them large trade and investment delegations, like last week, when Prime Minister Mahathir came here, and yesterday, very quickly, President Li of Taiwan, and there will be some more coming as scheduled.
