FBIS4-9032 "dreeu076__a94050" FBIS-EEU-94-076-A Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 ANNEX Poland Archival Material From Russia Said Incomplete Archival Material From Russia Said Incomplete LD1904202194 Warsaw PAP in English 1959 GMT 19 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY LD1904202194 Warsaw PAP English BFN [Text] Warsaw, April 19 -- Prof. Krystyna Kersten on Tuesday told the Sejm constitutional accountability committee that Soviet archival materials, conveyed to the Polish side by President Boris Yeltsin, are very incomplete and selective and they do not allow for forming an unequivocal stand on whether and in what circumstances the Warsaw Pact forces could have been engaged in Poland in the years 1980-1981 and whether Wojciech Jaruzelski "had rational premises to seriously take into account the possibility that the Hungarian and Czech scenarios of 1956 and 1968 may come true" in Poland. According to her and other historians, experts of the committee, the archival materials do not make it possible to reconstruct a coherent picture of intentions and activities of the then Soviet authorities towards Poland. Experts opinions were presented on Tuesday to the committee which is examining an initial motion to bring to constitutional accountability persons responsible for the imposition of martial law on December 13, 1981. Prof. Andrzej Werblan expressed the opinion that the entirety of documents should be presented if one thinks of achieving historical goals and not political ones. In his opinion, Yeltsin aimed at political manipulation and interference in Poland's issues. General Wojciech Jaruzelski, testifying on Tuesday before the committee, said that the threat of external intervention had been real but it corresponded to Poland's internal situation and the then international situation. He also said that martial law would not have been necessary if "Solidarity" had decided to start talks with the government on setting up a council of national reconciliation, if it had not violently opposed the government's motion to limit the right to strike and if it had recalled a large demonstration scheduled for December 17, 1981.
