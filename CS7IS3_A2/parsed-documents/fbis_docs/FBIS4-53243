FBIS4-53243 "dreas096_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-096 Daily Report 17 May 1994 North Korea Emergency Meeting on Rights of Koreans in Japan Emergency Meeting on Rights of Koreans in Japan SK1705045794 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0437 GMT 17 May 94 SK1705045794 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 15 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- An emergency meeting on the human rights of the Koreans in Japan was held here on May 10. At the meeting, Shigeru Tokoi, chairman of the executive committee of the Forum on Human Rights of Koreans in Japan, made a report on the recent crackdown on the Osaka Prefectural Headquarters of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and its branch offices by the Japanese police. "The search of Chongnyon by the Osaka prefectural police took place against the background of the Japanese Government authorities' moves for effecting `economic sanctions,' `emergency legislative arrangements' and `right to collective self-defence' on the pretext of `North Korea's nuclear issue'," said the appeal which was adopted at the meeting. Political suppression gives rise to new human rights violations and national discrimination, the appeal said, adding that the recent search and the ensuing violence and outcries against the Koreans in Japan are all violations of the human rights of the Koreans in Japan, which create a terror-ridden atmosphere every day. "We declare with indignation that the national discrimination and human rights violations against the Koreans in Japan are a specially grave and serious problem in Japanese society," said the appeal.
