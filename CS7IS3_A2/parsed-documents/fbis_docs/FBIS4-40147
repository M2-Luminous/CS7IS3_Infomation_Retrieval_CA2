ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on Russia's Democratic Choice party congress: "The choice has been made in favour of a party. This means that illusions about a broad democratic orientation in post-Soviet society in Russia are finally receding into the past". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the same subject. "The congress went off well but nevertheless Russia's Democratic Choice party did not manage to resolve all differencies in its ranks. It can be supposed that main struggle inside the party still lies ahead, since Russia's Democratic Choice party is an organisation with a strong Moscow-based centre and weak regions. However, the centre itself is not monolithic either". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article headlined "Russia's Foreign Policy" by First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin. The writer of the article expesses his ideas in connection with the newspaper's earlier published article "Strategy for Russia" ("theses of the council on foreign and defence policies". Adamishin believes, in particular, that "when advocating rapprochement with the west, which of cardinal importance for Russia, one should do so not by belittling what divides us, for we run the risk of deceiving ourselves, but must have a realistic understanding of the fact that the change of course from confrontation to cooperation, which in itself is exceptionaly salutary for Russia, does not guarantee positive-to-Russia solutions to problems that are inevitably encountered in the pursuance of this course in practice." KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev's tour of Yerevan, Tbilisi and Baku: "Notwithstanding the lack of specific accords in Baku, the tour can be regarded as succesful. The present round of military diplomacy strengthens Russia's positions in the Transcaucasus". PRAVDA carries an article about Yuriy Andropov, former KGB chief and subsequently the general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee, on the strength of reminiscences by people from his entourage, who worked side by side with him for many years. TRUD comments on presidential decrees signed last Friday: "As we see it, the new decrees are quite topical and are designed to expedite the reform process. It is important that they begin to work, not remain on paper. Much in this respect will depend on the government's ability and purposefulness..." RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA analyses the presidenttial decree on allocations to Russia's social insurance fund: "Presidential decree no.1,004 is certain to get on a list of inane deeds of Russian reformers. At the hardest time, the state leaves the work collectives at the mercy of fate, depriving them of last support". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on North Korea's decision to withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency: "The seriousness of the situation that has arisen in view of the statement is also compounded by the fact that North Korea continues to equate possible U.N. sanctions agains itself with a declaration of war. It follows from the North Korean Foreign Minustry statement that an expansion of sanctions, would entail a wider scope of Pyongyang's 'protective measures'".
