Estonian TV Already Paying for Its Closure"] [Text] Tallinn -- Under a government directive the retransmission in Estonia of the last Russian channel -- "Ostankino" -- has ended. The reason given for the ban is that Russia is not paying for its programs to be shown. But the victory over "Ostankino" has been very costly -- communications workers have lost their main source of funds. The government has had to allocate 1,580,000 krooni ($115,000) to meet the expenditure generated by the ending of Ostankino retransmissions. The communications workers used to receive a much higher rental from Ostankino than they do from Estonian TV and local commercial TV firms. To all intents and purposes Russia had been subsidizing the local TV. Having now lost their Ostankino hard currency, the communications workers have been forced to set realistic tariffs for state TV and commercial studios. But these are claiming that they are unable to pay in full. The government was then forced to provide compensation out of the budget for some of the former Ostankino subsidies. The Ostankino ban has hit the taxpayer.
