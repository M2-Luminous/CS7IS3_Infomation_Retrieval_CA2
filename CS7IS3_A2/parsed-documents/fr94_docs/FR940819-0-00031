FR940819-0-00031 FR940819-0-00012 Treasury Department Approval To Designate Proposed Ports Section 9(f)(1) of the Act also provides, in part, that: ``For the purpose of facilitating enforcement of this chapter and reducing costs thereof, the Secretary of the Interior, with approval of the Secretary of the Treasury and after notice and opportunity for public hearing, may, by regulation, designate ports and change such designations.'' Approval from the Secretary of the Treasury was obtained in accordance with these provisions. Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, the Service is adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule. Effective Date The effect of this rule is to grant an exemption from 16 U.S.C. 1538(f), which generally prohibits importation of wildlife and plants except at such ports as may be designated. Accordingly, it may be given immediate effect under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1), which permits a rule that ``grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction'' to be given immediate effect. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under Executive Order 12866. The Service believes that establishing the USDA ports at Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, as designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES will have a positive economic impact. These ports are major ports of entry for logs and lumber, but they had not been designated as ports for the importation of logs and lumber from listed trees (prior to the effective date of this rule). Presently, importers wishing to import logs and lumber from listed trees into a U.S. port on the Gulf of Mexico can use only Mobile, AL, New Orleans, LA, and Houston and Brownsville, TX. Importers wishing to import logs and lumber from listed trees into a port in the northwestern United States have only the port of Seattle, WA. Adding Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, to the list of designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES will result in a savings in time and transportation costs for importers of logs and lumber. Under these circumstances, the Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities, as described in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). National Environmental Policy Act The Service has determined that this final rule adding designated ports under authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 for the importation of plants is not a major Federal action which will significantly affect the quality of the human environment within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Paperwork Reduction Act This final rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .). List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 24 Endangered and threatened species, exports, harbors, imports and plants. Accordingly, we are amending 50 CFR part 24 as follows: PART 24_IMPORTATION AND EXPORTATION OF PLANTS 1. The authority citation for part 24 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 9(f)(1), 11(f), Pub. L. 93&hyph;205, 87 Stat. 893, 897 (16 U.S.C. 1538(f)(1), 1540(f)). ยง24.12 [Amended] 2. In ยง24.12, paragraph (e) is amended by adding the words ``Gulfport, Mississippi;'' after ``Baltimore, Maryland;'', by adding the words ``Portland, Oregon;'' after ``Wilmington and Morehead City, North Carolina;'', and by removing the words ``and Norfolk, Virginia,'' and adding the words ``Norfolk, Virginia; and Vancouver, Washington,'' in their place. Dated: July 18, 1994. George T. Frampton, Assistant Secretary, Fish and Wildlife and Parks. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20407 Filed 8&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;55&hyph;P
