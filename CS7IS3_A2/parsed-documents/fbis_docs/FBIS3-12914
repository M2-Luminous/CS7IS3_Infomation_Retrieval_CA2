In a statement to MENA, al-Tarifi said today that the Israeli forces have arrested 1,000 Palestinians since the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron while announcing the release of 800 Palestinian detainees. Al-Tarifi denounced the repressive Israeli measures, noting that the Palestinian people have been living under a security cordon imposed on them for 10 days now and that schools and shops are closed as a result of the curfew imposed on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. He said that the Palestinians could not perform Friday prayers last week in al-Aqsa Mosque, where thousands usually pray especially during the month of Ramadan, due to the arbitrary Israeli closure of al-Aqsa Mosque to all worshipers and visitors. He added that a mood of despair and disappointment prevails among the Palestinian people in the occupied territories and even among the Palestinians of 1948 [Israeli Arabs]. He stressed that the resumption of the negotiations process with Israel should take into account the new developments, because the Israelis have always spoken about guarantees of their own security but the recent massacre shows that it is the Palestinian people who need protection. He said that the Israeli settlers are the ones threatening the peace process, not the Palestinian organizations. Al-Tarifi, who resides in Jerusalem, came to Cairo to meet with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, who earlier today ended a one day visit to Cairo.
