A security source considered the internecine clashes of Hezb-e Wahdat over the appointment of the future party leader as the reason for the attack. The report adds that the adventurist section of Hezb-e Wahdat wants to hide its internal problems from the public by fanning conflict between the Islamic Army and Hezb-e Wahdat. However, Islamic Army units have been emphatically instructed to exercise forbearance before such provocations.
