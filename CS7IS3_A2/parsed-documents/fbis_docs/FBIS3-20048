Stability is looking increasingly remote." He added: "The Burundian Government must no longer have to bow to the dictate of the Army. I still believe that the presence of the 180 OAU troops could partially ensure the maintenance of a democratic system." Mr. Claes, who recently visited Rwanda and Burundi, again said in substance: "I have warned the Burundian authorities that their attitude toward the Army, which clearly refused to accept a democratic solution, would lead to fresh confrontations." [passage omitted] According to the latest news from Bujumbura, calm seems to have returned to the northern districts of the capital on Friday morning after violent clashes between Hutus and Tutsis.
