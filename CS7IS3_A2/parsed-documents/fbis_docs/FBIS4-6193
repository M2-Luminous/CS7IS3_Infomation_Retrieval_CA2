Radio Moscow quoted him as saying that his country will be strict with human rights protection requirements in renewing the logging contract with North Korea. Moscow should consider applying Russia's domestic laws on all people living on Russian soil, and their human rights have to be guaranteed at maximum level, Kozyrev said according to Radio Moscow. But he indicated his country was against intervention by a third party, saying Moscow plans to resolve the issue without participation by international organizations. The Seoul Government announced Friday it will accept all North Korean loggers who wish to settle in South Korea. Some 100 North Koreans, virtually trapped inside logging camps in Siberia where escapees tell of rampant beating and near starvation, have asked to be sent to Seoul. Seoul officials said they want to refer to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in arranging their resettlement. The logging contract between Russia and North Korea was to expire at the end of last year but the two sides are still negotiating renewal after Moscow demanded human rights condition improvement inside the camps. Next negotiation is expected in Moscow within first half of this year.
