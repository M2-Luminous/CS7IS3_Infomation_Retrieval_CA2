Both issues have become the focus of a Japan-U.S. trade row in economic framework talks. Toyota Motor Corporation and Nissan Motor Company have begun to study plans to purchase American-made auto parts. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and major automakers plan to finalize details of plans to purchase American-made auto parts in mid-March, at the earliest, in line with government plans to open the Japanese market. Strained Japan-U.S. economic relations following the breakdown of economic framework talks over the issue of numerical targets have prompted the automobile industry, which has insisted that Japanese purchases of American-made auto parts are not the province of government negotiation, to judge that the industry now needs to announce measures to resolve the issue.
