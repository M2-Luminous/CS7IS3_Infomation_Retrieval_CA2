The Council of Guardians had found faults with the bill concerning articles 52th and 53 of the Constitution. It had also referred to some of the notes in the bill as ambiguous and against Islamic law. According to the 53th article of the Constitution the whole money the government gains is concentrated in the state treasury and all payments are performed on the basis of the approved credits and according to the law. Article 52 says that the country's annual budget should be proposed by the government as stipulated by the law and should be submitted to the Majlis for deliberations and approval. Any change in the figures should be according to the law as well. After the Majlis completed debates over the next year budget bill in its open session Wednesday, the bill was sent to the Council of Guardians for final approval. The Council, after some study, returned the bill to the Majlis to correct the faults. The Majlis did some amendments to the bill in its Saturday session but the council regarded the amendments as insufficient and retured the bill to the Majlis for the second time.
