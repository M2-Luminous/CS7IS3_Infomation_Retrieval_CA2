President Rawlings, who was accompanied by the first lady, Nana Konadu Agyeman Rawlings, and officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was met on arrival by the vice president, Mr. Ekow Arkaah; special adviser on governmental affairs, Mr. P.V. Obeng; the chairman of the Council of State, Alhaji Mumuni Bawumiah; Captain Kojo Tsikata, a member of the Council State; and service commanders. Briefing newsmen on behalf of the president, the chief director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Victor Gbeho, said the inauguration symbolized the importance of upholding the rights and freedoms of the individual, the triumph of right over wrong, and the victory of the forces of good over the forces of division. He said the most important lesson that came out of the ceremony was the pervading sense of feeling of the black majority to forgive and reconcile with the white minority, so that they can move into the new democratic era in unity. Mr. Gbeho said while in Johannesburg, President Rawlings seized the opportunity to interact with world leaders. They included President Fidel Castro of Cuba, Vice President Al Gore of the United States of America, and Mrs. Hillary Clinton, wife of the U.S. president. Others were the heads of state of Botswana, Mali, Senegal, Nigeria, and Guinea. He discussed the situation in the world and how to expand inter-African trade. On South Africa in particular, Mr. Gbeho said President Rawlings was convinced that Ghana should move with speed to commence diplomatic relations with her within weeks. President Rawlings also discussed with South African leaders how to improve economic relations between the two countries. Mr. Gbeho said President Rawlings hoped that the modest beginnings in South Africa would inspire all Africans to rededicate their efforts towards the total elimination of all forms of racism on the continent.
