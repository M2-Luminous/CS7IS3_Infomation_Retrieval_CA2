In the document, the government's delegation to the CCF says Renamo's verbal accusation that the government abducted (Renuge Paconote) in the city of Nampula is outrageous. The government delegation says it regrets the undignified attitude of the head of the Renamo delegation to the commission and adds that to make unfounded accusations, kidnap witnesses, and pretend to be innocent is to be simultaneously plaintiff and judge. (Renuge Paconote), a former government soldier, has alleged that the government is training a battalion in Tanzania. He went missing after the first session on the issue was held. In the CCF meeting held on 19 May the government requested the suspension of the investigations on the alleged training of the battalion because the main witness was missing.
