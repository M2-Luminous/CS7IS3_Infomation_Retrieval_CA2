FR940719-1-00078 FR940719-1-00015 Commenters suggested that the term ``dry chemical'' would be more appropriate than the term ``dry powder'' used in the existing standard. The Agency agrees and the proposal would adopt this suggestion. Under paragraph (f)(6), an additional exception is provided for mobile equipment when no persons are inby other than persons directly engaged in the use or moving of the equipment. The continuous mining machine exception recognizes that the fire suppression system for the continuous mining machine often relies on a water supply that may be impracticable to provide during moves. Paragraph (f)(6) is being proposed to permit the necessary movement of face equipment between sections and to permit the primary escapeway to be properly maintained. Under paragraph (f)(6) of the proposal, mobile equipment not having a fire suppression system may be in the primary escapeway if no persons are located inby except those directly engaged in the use of or the moving of such equipment. For example, when moving longwall shields, no one would be permitted to be inby equipment used to move the shield if this equipment is not provided with a fire suppression system. With no persons working inby, the use of machinery without a fire suppression system would not expose persons to the hazard of toxic gases and fumes carried inby. It has been suggested to the Agency that certain types of emergency equipment, such as diesel powered ambulances, should also be exempt from the requirements for fire suppression systems. While the Agency recognizes the potential benefit that can be attached to the use of this type of equipment, the proposal does not exempt this equipment. Comments are solicited on this issue. During the informational meetings, the Agency became aware of a concern that existing §75.380(i)(2) would permit slopes of significant length and inclination to exist without any mechanical escape facilities. An example used is a slope of 900 feet inclined at 18 degrees from the horizontal. It was suggested that such a slope could be particularly difficult for passage of injured persons under cold and icy conditions if mechanical escape facilities were not provided. In light of this concern, the Agency has reconsidered its position and is proposing in paragraph (i)(2) that any slope that is part of a designated escapeway and is inclined more than 9 degrees from the horizontal be provided with mechanical escape facilities. The Agency solicits comments on this proposal. Following promulgation of the standard, the Agency received comments that the final rule language should have retained the proposed rule language relative to ventilation of the primary and alternate escapeways with separate splits of intake air. As discussed in the preamble to the existing standard, this issue, along with several other issues, was referred to an advisory committee appointed by the Secretary of Labor. The advisory committee has submitted its final report to the Secretary for review and appropriate action. Section 75.380(b)(1) of the existing standard requires escapeways to be provided from each working section. A working section is defined in §75.2 as beginning at the underground loading point. The proposal would continue the practice of permitting mines which have not established a loading point to haul coal with mobile equipment. Providing escapeways during the installation and removal of mechanized mining equipment is necessary to provide safe escape for miners from hazards that may develop during these phases of the mining operations. Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this standard was done appropriately, they are being reproposed for the purposes of receiving and giving consideration to all pertinent comments. Section §75.382␣Mechanical Escape Facilities Consistent with current requirements in subpart O_Hoisting and Mantrips, three new paragraphs are proposed under §75.382. Paragraph (g) would require the designated examiner to certify by date, time, and initials that the mechanical escape facilities examination required by paragraph (c) was performed. The proposal would require that the certification appear at or near the facility examined. Certification has long been an accepted practice in the mining industry for assuring that concerned individuals can readily determine that a required examination has been completed. In the case of mechanical escape facilities, if certification is not provided, precious time could be lost as the escape facility is tested prior to use. The certification proposed will provide the operator or the person using the facility with assurance that the facility is safe to use. Paragraph (h) would require that a record be made of the examination performed in accordance with paragraph (c). The results of the examination would be included in the record, including any deficiency found along with the corrective actions taken to correct the condition. The intent is that deficiencies be documented and that both the mine foreman and superintendent, or other appropriate official be made aware of any problems, assuring that follow-up and corrective action will be taken. As with other records required by the existing rule and this proposal, the record of the examination of mechanical escape facilities provides valuable information to both the miners and the operator. The record not only indicates that the examination has been completed but also provides historical information on the nature of deficiencies found during the examination and the type of corrective action required. The examiner would be permitted to complete the record immediately following the end of the shift in which the examination was performed. The record would be countersigned by the mine foreman by the end of the mine foreman's next regularly scheduled working shift. During an absence of the mine foreman, the person acting as mine foreman would countersign. The Agency intends that the mine foreman, the person most responsible for day-to-day operation of the mine, be notified of the information contained in the reports. Allowing until the end of the mine foreman's next regularly scheduled working shift to countersign the report would assure that the mine foreman is aware of the results of the examination and would enable corrective actions to be taken. Paragraph (h) would also require that within two scheduled production days thereafter, the record of the examination be countersigned by the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other mine official to whom the mine foreman is directly accountable. The intent is to assure that a higher-level official, empowered to redirect resources, be aware of any condition requiring corrective actions. Since this second-level official may not be physically located at the mine on a full-time basis, 2 scheduled production days are proposed as a reasonable period of time for countersigning.
