Sokolova; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] Representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] met with leaders of Russian and foreign banks in the Parliamentary Center today. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the party, emphasized that the Liberal Democrats today are in favor of economic stability in Russia and the development of private entrepreneurship, and that they will put through parliament a number of laws that will help Russian banks to work normally. He also reported that the country is now entering a new stage of political construction, and if the communists are allowed to come to power Russia could plunge into ruin, that is, there would be no healthy capitalism and private banks. Yet if the rudder passes to Russia's Choice, all Russian money will rapidly go to the West. After some eulogistic speeches were made about his party, Zhirinovskiy complained about the government, which in their opinion has still not collected the taxes for 1993 and has not confirmed in the State Duma the budget for 1994.
