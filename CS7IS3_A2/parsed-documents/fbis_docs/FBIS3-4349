A founding declaration was issued which stated that this league is an organization participating in political affairs on the principle of "basing itself in Hong Kong, keeping in view the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, and concerning itself with the development in three regions." Its aim is: "To support China's peaceful reunification, promote sincere exchanges between the two sides of the straits, and safeguard prosperity and mutual benefit in the three regions." Today, the "123 Democratic League" held its first general meeting and elected its first central committee, with 20 members. Chairman of the central committee Jen Shan-ning [0117 0810 2899] said to our staff reporter: The political program of the league provides that concern for Hong Kong affairs is the league's most important task, and that besides giving top priority to Hong Kong, the league especially wishes to make great efforts to promote Hong Kong's communications and exchanges with the mainland and Taiwan. He pointed out: Many people say the 21st century is a century for the Chinese; Hong Kong is an outstanding community in Chinese society, and therefore will play a very important role in the 21st century. Yet Hong Kong is facing a major change in 1997. What direction Hong Kong will head after 1997 and how Hong Kong's relations with the mainland and Taiwan will change are very much worth studying. In this respect, the Democratic League bases itself in Hong Kong and wishes to have the opportunity to represent the interests of Hong Kong people and to communicate with both sides of the straits. Jen Shan-ning made no attempt to conceal the fact that some founding members of the Democratic League graduated from Taiwan colleges and have a good knowledge of Taiwan. However, he did not accept labeling the league as a "pro-Taiwan" or "right-wing" political group. He said: The Democratic League has quite a large capacity, and hopes that the exchanges between the two sides of the straits and among the three regions will be predominantly in the form of dialogue. It does not wish to see any confrontation, and regards as worthwhile anything that will contribute to communications, exchanges, and mutual benefit among the three regions.
