This is what Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation Council, thinks. However, as he stressed today in a conversation with the ITAR-TASS correspondent, there can be no question of strengthening the army while we are indulging in populist gestures and exempting hundreds of thousands of young people from army service. Vladimir Shumeyko visited the Taman motorized rifle division today. He acquainted himself with the problems of the guards' formation, and talked to the servicemen. In keeping with the legislation which is in effect, some 200 restrictions exist which, according to the speaker of parliament's upper chamber, do not allow the army to be manned with a sufficiently large contingent of conscripts. "Of 1.5 million young men, we need to call up at least 700,000, and not 200,000 which is the current figure. We cannot go on putting up with this situation," Vladimir Shumeyko thinks. He noted that a "military package" of laws will soon be analyzed in the Federation Council in order to introduce changes relating to conscription into military service.
