It is believed the ultranationalist November 17 guerilla group attempted to hit the 20,000-ton carrier with two 88 mm rockets as it was docked in the port of Piraeus near Athens. Home-made rocket launchers with rockets and automatic timers were found in a field 200 yards from where the ship was docked, police said. The search was launched after the guerilla group called a radio station to say it had tried to attack the ship, which left Piraeus early today after a week's maintenance. Police said they thought the rockets aimed at the Ark Royal were set to go off last week but rain had fouled the timers, thwarting the attack. The guerrillas also claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on a US insurance company and a time-bomb attack on a Dutch insurance company today. The blasts caused damage but no injuries. Ark Royal and its sister ship Invincible have been alternating on six-month tours of duty since January last year in the Adriatic as part of Nato's operations to enforce the no-fly zone over Bosnia. The operation has been directed primarily at Bosnian Serb and Serb aircraft and there has been concern in Greece about the Nato mission because of deep historical and religious links with the Serbs. Ark Royal set sail from Piraeus completely unaware of the potentially disastrous failed attack, said Royal Navy officials. A Whitehall source said: "This group of terrorists is ultranationalist and, as such, support the Serbs. The connection is not too difficult to make."
