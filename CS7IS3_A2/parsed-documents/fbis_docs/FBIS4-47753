Let's find out more about him. Popo Molefe, well known for his days as general secretary of the United Democratic Front, is now a member of the ANC's National Executive Committee. Born in Sophiatown in 1952 to a farm laborer and a domestic worker, Molefe was looked after by his aunt, but he was harassed by white children when visiting her in the white suburb where she worked. Molefe, who went to school in Soweto was convinced by his experiences of racism as a child to become involved in the Black Consciousness political movement. Active in political organizations from 1973, he was involved in planning the well-known 16 June march in 1976, for which he spent seven months in detention. Molefe noticed that many white people were sympathetic to the students cause and that it was black policemen, as well as white, who were using brutal force against the students. He realized that his views of South African conflict, simply being between black and white, did not hold. By 1981 Molefe had become involved in the community organizations like Motlana Soweto Committee of ten and was committed to the principle of nonracialism. He was later to participate in the formation of the United Democratic Front, playing a prominent role as the organization's general secretary and being instrumental in their campaign against the tricameral parliament. In 1985, Molefe, along with 22 others, was charged with treason, relating to the disturbances in the Vaal Triangle the previous year. During the three-year trial, which became known worldwide as the Delmas trial, the accused were denied bail. Molefe and four others were convicted of treason and given 10-year sentences. Molefe was to spend the rest of that decade imprisoned on Robben Island. He was there even when his fellow prisoners, like Walter Sisulu, convicted under charges similar to his in the mammoth Rivonia trial, were released. In December of 1989 the appeal court quashed all convictions and Molefe and his co-accused were released from prison. They were greeted by jubilant supporters who were welcoming back their leaders in a time when the country was on the verge of change. Molefe immediately returned to working in political organizations and was elected to the ANC's National Executive Committee at its first congress in 1991. Molefe, who was appointed to the crucial job of heading the ANC's elections department, is the 16th candidate on their election list.
