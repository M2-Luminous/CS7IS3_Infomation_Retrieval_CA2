Your Excellency, madame deputy speaker of the National Council of Development; Your Excellency, the minister [as heard]. Rwandans, our country is currently going through difficult times. We are going to set up a government which will deal with the very difficult question of war and also the question of insecurity in the country and famine, especially among those displaced by the war. The three points make up the program of the present government. The present government will therefore carry out its duties especially by providing security for people and property and by restoring understanding among the people. That is why the ministers in charge of security, that is, the ministers of defense, communal development, and justice will do everything possible to restore peace as soon as possible. Let us say within about two weeks. The minister of justice should do his utmost to convene a meeting of all heads of tribunals so that they can start investigations to identify all wrongdoers, such as those who killed and looted in many areas of the country, especially in Kigali town. The minister of defense must do everything possible to restore peace and tranquillity in the entire country, especially in Kigali town. The minister of interior and communal development is asked to convene a meeting of all prefects as soon as possible so that they may look for ways of restoring peace and pacifying the Rwandans. Second, the current government will continue talks with the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] so that transitional institutions based on the Arusha agreement may be set up in six weeks' time. The Rwandan Government believes that there is no other way of restoring peace to the country apart from continuing talks with the RPF. That is why it stresses the fact that the RPF should know that the problems with which our country finds itself following the death of the president of the republic, His Excellency Major General Juvenal Habyarimana, followed by that of the prime minister and some government members and innocent people, should not be a pretext for renewing the fighting since, as we said earlier, the government is going to do its utmost to restore peace in the country. I thank the outgoing government for everything it did towards setting up transitional government institutions despite the many hindrances to the implementation of the planned program. The Rwandan Government will do its utmost to ensure that all the hindrances to setting up the transitional government are removed so that the Arusha agreement may be implemented as agreed. This will be done with only the welfare of the people at heart and not personal or group interests. Concerning famine, which is the third objective of this government, the Ministry of Planning and Communal Government is called upon to start talks with the nongovernmental organizations which have always assisted us in our problems so that we may get enough assistance to go to the rescue of the people affected by famine almost everywhere in the country, especially those displaced by the current war which we have known for almost four years. Rwandans and friends of Rwanda, this country is in a very critical situation. The contribution of everyone is necessary so that we can solve the difficult problems. That is why we call upon international organizations and traditional friendly countries to support this government so that it can carry out its three-point program. [passage omitted]
