This statement was made in an exclusive interview with INTERFAX in Murmansk on Tuesday by Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev. That is why Moscow intends to firmly insist on removing nuclear arms from Ukraine for their further scrapping in Russia, he pointed out. According to the foreign minister, the stand taken by Russia gained "unanimous support" at the Brussels session of the North-Atlantic Council for Cooperation. At Russia's insistence the Council urged Ukraine to ratify the START I treaty, "since no one in the world recognizes the Ukrainian parliament's resolution on this score as ratification." As Kozyrev said, "Ukraine's interpretation of this issue is fundamentally wrong." "Kiev's arguments to the effect that the Ukrainian parliament ratified START I, and that this is its way of claiming the right to possess nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine, cannot be taken seriously," he stressed. Russia, Kozyrev pointed out, "did all it could to conduct a peaceful dialog with Ukraine." "However, the problem of nuclear weapons makes the situation hopeless. The same relates to the Black Sea Fleet whose division is absurd in itself," he said. According to the head of Russian diplomacy, "Sevastopol was Russia's naval base and it must remain as such." "The process of placing the fleet under Russia's jurisdiction must proceed painlessly by means of making compensation to Ukraine, notwithstanding the fact that Ukraine owes Russia enormous sums of money for oil and gas, as well as in the framework of trade," he said. Kozyrev is confident that relations between Russia and Ukraine can be normalized as soon as Ukraine begins to honor the bilateral agreements reached in Massandra. "But we have no right to go along with the absurd ideas of proliferating nuclear arms and dividing the Black Sea Fleet," Kozyrev said. When asked about Russia's attitude to the possibility of expanding the number of permanent members in the UN Security Council by means of including Germany and Japan in it, Kozyrev noted that this is not a pressing problem. With reference to the Russian Choice bloc, he is a co-founder of, Kozyrev said that in the future parliament the bloc may "in principle" enter into coalition with "any reformist movements." "However let's wait and see how many seats in the parliament Russian Choice itself will obtain," he added. Kozyrev said he fears that members of the future parliament "will spend a year or two on their accomodation and training alone." "As a result we'll lose the Duma. To prevent this from happening we'll have to elect real professionals, such as those who belong to the Russian Choice bloc, to the Yavlinskiy bloc, to the Shakhray bloc," Kozyrev said. "In the next two years we'll have to 'push through' several laws which would enable the country to live in peace. Let the new deputies who will come later improve them."
