[Chepik] First of all, I want this interview to be transmitted to our radio listeners in its full extent. I think that last night's session was nothing out of ordinary. It is a normal course of developments. I only regret that it occurred so late. In confirmation of this, I can say that the situation in the Republic of Belarus -- especially in the economic arena -- has become extremely difficult during the period we were under the leadership of Stanislav Stanislavovich [Shushkevich]; it has reached a critical point. The work of the Supreme Soviet was paralyzed. Practically, we were concerned more with demagogy than concrete legislative work. The work of the Supreme Soviet Presidium was also paralyzed. As a result -- we have all those negative phenomena within society. Therefore, I see that a normal process has begun at last. [Rudkowski] You did not answer the second question -- who is your choice to assume this post? [Chepik] I cannot specify names today. However, I see many talented candidates, including deputies as well, who are qualified to deal with this task more successfully than our former speaker did. [Rudkowski] Whom do you have in mind? [Chepik] I have in mind chairmen of the oblast executive committees, chairmen of various [Supreme Soviet] commissions, and other people's deputies. I cannot answer this question right now, because we are now conducting political consultations. [Rudkowski] I have also invited People's Deputy Viktar Alampiyew to speak. The question I asked earlier is now directed to you. [Alampiyew] I will use the words of Vladimir Ilyich [Lenin]: A Bolsheviks' dream, which was nourished by them over the last two years, has come true. At last, they decided to throw out the umbrella, under which they were staying all the time -- that is to say, Stanislav Shushkevich, a sole democrat in power. Now they took the lead in their own hands. With respect to a new Supreme Soviet chairman, I can say frankly that I do not see any candidate among the current Supreme Soviet body. It would be better to leave this choice to either a newly elected Supreme Soviet or a direct general ballot. In the latter case, none of political factions in the parliament will be able to [word indistinct] the speaker, as was done by the Belarus faction with regard to Mr. Shushkevich. [Rudkowski] I also pose the same question to People's Deputy Alyaksandr Lyadko. [Lyadko] I regret very much that the people's deputies voted against Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich last night. The Belarusian nation is one, and we all have to live and work in this nation. There must be accord between communists and Belarusian Popular Movement adherents. I would hope that this post is given to someone with Shushkevich's political views; I also wish that there were peace in Belarus, and that we were able to work for the welfare of Belarus.
