A Foreign Ministry resolution authorized the Peruvian ambassador to this organization to sign the document. According to the National Customs Superintendency, GATT membership will not adversely affect the nation's tariff collection because there are special provisions for developing nations. An expert on the issue noted that initially the application of the agreement could generate certain reductions in tariff collection, but he clarified that Peru is only obliged to comply with the first three of the seven principles set out in the agreement. Several days ago, Carmen Higaona, director of the Superintendency, expressed her support for joining GATT. GATT members met last week in Geneva, where they analyzed Peruvian trade policy and agreed to encourage the Lima government to continue its liberalization reforms, highlighting its "positive effects."
