According to a recent conference held here recently on suburban livestock farming, the total output of non-staple food remained high in 1993, and a range of non-staple food centers with high production in the city's suburban areas has taken initial shape. These suburban counties provided more than 3.76 million pigs last year, a three-percent rise over a year ago. The weight of eggs supplied to the capital's markets jumped by 6.2 percent over the figure in the previous year. Over 2.2 million pigs and 171 million kilograms of eggs were produced by large and standard farms. To bolster market sales, 62 integrated economic complexes and 670 pig-breeding farms which combine the breeding, production and processing in one place, have been built in the suburban areas. Hundreds of meat and egg sales centers have been set up across the district areas of the city to step up the delivery of the non- staple food, so that citizens are able to enjoy the food fresh the same day or even within several hours. The city has also set up quarantine stations at the municipal and county levels and trained about 1,000 quarantine specialists to ensure the residents have healthy, clean food. Some 40 quarantine stations have been built alongside the highways and roads that lead to the city center and 118 markets all have appointed hygiene staff.
