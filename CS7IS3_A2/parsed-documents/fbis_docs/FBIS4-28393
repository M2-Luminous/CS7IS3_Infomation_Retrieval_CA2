FBIS4-28393 "dreas112_m_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 Thailand Editorials Comment on Situation Editorials Comment on Situation BK0906135294 BK0906135294 BFN [Editorial Report] The Bangkok vernacular dailies NAEO NA, SIAM RAT, and MATICHON publish on 9 June editorials commenting on the political situation and the handling of activist Chalat Worachat's hunger strike by the Democrat Party of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. NAEO NA's 400-word editorial on page 3 and headlined "The Democrat Party Must Be Responsible" points out that all hopes for improving the political atmosphere were ruined when Prime Minister Chuan Likphai declared that his Democrat Party disagreed with the idea of forming any committees to redraft the Constitution. The abrupt change in the Democrat Party position has rapidly brought various pro-democracy groups together nationwide to voice their opposition to the Democrats and the coaltion government. The discontent can lead the country to a "chaotic and violent situation which can be ignited by either pro-democracy groups or other ill-intentioned and power-craving factions." The editorial says: "We respect and admire the courage and sacrifice of Chalat Worachat, but we do not support his hunger strike, peaceful as it is. We also praise the government of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai for its strong adherence to correct principles in running the country. The Democrat Party's decision to reject the establishment of the committee to compile and reword the Constitution, however, is suicidal, excessively rigid, and unrealistic." In conclusion, the editorial says: "While everything was about to be settled peacefully, the arrogant resolution adopted by the Democrat Party has worsened the situation. We, therefore, appeal to the Democrat Party to take full responsibility over whatever may happen from now on." SIAM RAT's 300-word editorial on page 5 headlined "It's Time For Political Reform" says that the hunger strike has had both positive and negative repercussions. "The positive impact is that more people have come to realize that it's time to reform our democratic form of politics. Professor Prawet Wasi earlier offered this reform proposal, which he claimed would further improve the quality of life." The editorial adds: "We agree with Professor Prawet Wasi's statement on his disagreement with the hunger strike and call for efforts to save Chalat's life through correcting or improving our political system even beyond what Chalat calls for. This is one way to solve the political crisis and maintain our cultural value that never lets anyone die without doing something to save him." "The negative aspect of the issue is that if we simply stand idle and let Chalat die with the hope that nothing will happen, general feelings in society will certainly be affected." This is also against the traditional ethical values and heritage of the nation. The editorial concludes by saying: "We hope that under the present circumstances, all political parties and politicians must act prudently and free themselves from old biases and principle in making judgements. If they cannot accept Chatlat's demands, they must come up with something superior, such as the proposal for political reform of Professor Prawet Wasi." MATICHON's 400-word editorial on page 2 headlined: "The Democrat Party...Watch Out," notes that the Democrats, as the core of the coalition government, can do lots of things to tackle the problems in dealing with Chalat's hunger strike if it is not too hardheaded and pessimistic. The editorial notes that the hunger striker has gained more and more supporters because his flexible demand was received aggressively by the government. "As a result of the government's aggressiveness and indifference in dealing with Chalat's demands, more and more democracy-loving people are supporting Chalat... The masses are agitated. All sorts of untoward incidents could happen." The paper says: "The Democrat Party, up to this point, should realize that it has to compromise with the people's call for democracy and join the movement to bring about changes for improvement. The assumption that the other side intends to topple the government has placed the Democrat Party in the position of opposing the aspirations of the masses. The continuing obstinacy of the Democrat Party can jeopardize the prime minister's chair."
