After his meeting with Federal President Thomas Klestil in Vienna Museveni said that efforts are being undertaken to bring about a cease-fire on the basis of that resolution. There will be an international trial calling the perpetrators to account, "because there can be no peace without justice," Museveni said. Commenting on the Austro-Ugandan framework agreement on development cooperation that was signed on Thursday [26 May], Museveni said that real development results from investment, not from financial assistance. Investment is based on reciprocity; with neither party "a parasite living off the other." Talks with Austrian businesspeople have been very satisfactory, Museveni said. Klestil told the press that the framework agreement will increase opportunities for cooperation. Uganda is a country full of natural beauty and has been economically and politically stable over the past few years. With these words at the Austrian Economic Chamber on Friday, Museveni tried to establish contacts with the Austrian tourist industry and potential investors and trading partners.
