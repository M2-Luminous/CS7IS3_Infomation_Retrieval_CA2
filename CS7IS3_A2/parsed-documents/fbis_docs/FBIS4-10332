Before appearing before the plenary session, General Henriquez spoke to reporters about the congressional initiative to ask the United Nations to appoint a special rapporteur for our country. [Begin recording] [Henriquez] The legislative branch has the right to make such a decision. [Reporter] Do you think it could negatively affect Guatemala? [Henriquez] If it was made by all of the deputies, I will respect the congressional decision to request a rapporteur. I believe Congress has the authority to do this. [Reporter] Do you think the presence of a rapporteur is unnecessary? [Henriquez] I believe the presence of a rapporteur is unnecessary, because we have already signed a human rights agreement, and, perhaps -- I do not know for certain -- approximately 100-150 UN representatives will come here to review the human rights situation. [Reporter] Could the congressional measure sway the peace agreement [words indistinct]? [Henriquez] I do not think so, because, as I have said, we already have expert advisers on human rights, a human rights ombudsman, a Human Rights Commission in Congress, Cofrere [expansion unknown], and Dona Monica Pinto [not further identified]. We have everything we need, and, to comply with the general human rights agreement, many more people are going to come here. Therefore, one more rapporteur does not mean a thing. [Reporter] However, the human rights ombudsman has stated that his resolutions are not being accepted by several organizations, including the government and [words indistinct]. [Henriquez] I believe the resolutions issued by the Human Rights Ombudsman's Office or the ombudsman himself are accepted and mean a great deal. I have received several resolutions or admonishments [words indistinct]. [laughs] They were resolutions to censure, for example, the recruitment of a minor. I, of course, respected the resolution. I am talking about my personal experience. It was an admonishment. The resolutions move your conscience, and they must be respected. [Reporter] Could the presence of a special human rights rapporteur in Guatemala corroborate the international petition to dissolve the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols? Would the Army be willing to dissolve the patrols if a rapporteur specifically requested this? [Henriquez] One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other. It is not the Army's responsibility to dissolve the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols. The government of the Republic has to do this. However, this issue has already been outlined in the agreement with the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity]. The agreement clearly states that voluntary civilian defense committees will remain in place until the guerrillas disappear. Furthermore, the recommendation made by the 50th Human Rights Conference in Geneva was that the government should start demobilizing the voluntary civilian defense committees in those areas where guerrillas are no longer present. We will start doing this on 30 June. [Reporter] My next question refers to the investigations into the case of Dr. Obdulio Chinchilla. He says he told you he had received death threats. What can you say about this? [Henriquez] I am going to talk about this issue in a few minutes. I can tell you right now, however, that he did not talk to me. I thank God that he is alive, and I hope there never is another attack against Deputy Chinchilla Vega. Nevertheless, he did not talk to me at the time. He talked to the head of the ministerial command staff, and I am sure he will confirm this later. [Reporter] [words indistinct] you made investigations? [Henriquez] We paid a lot of attention to these charges. For example, Father Giron [not further identified] called me yesterday to say he was being threatened. I immediately offered him security and provided security to him. Chief Justice Juan Jose Rodil Peralta also told me he had been threatened, and I sent him security personnel the same day. It seems a wave of terror has started, and we have to stop it because it is time Guatemala [words indistinct]. [Reporter] [question indistinct] [Henriquez] In general, there is security for people because it is the government's job to provide security and to assure the people. However, the most likely targets are top-ranking officials, politicians, and military officers. On an individual basis, they have to be more careful, and the government must provide these people with more security. [Reporter] Mr. Minister, the possibility that a soldier might be implicated in the attack against Deputy Duilio Chinchilla Vega was mentioned by Deputy Chinchilla Vega himself days before the attack. At the same time, he said... [Henriquez, interrupting] He spoke with that soldier. He received an anonymous note, and he spoke with that officer. That officer is with me now. [Reporter] [words indistinct] [Henriquez] That is what we are going to discuss now. Colonel Fernandez Ligorria was mentioned. He is none other than the chief of the ministerial staff. Deputy Chinchilla Vega met with him, not with me. They discussed the matter, he was offered security, and so on, and so on, and he left without a fuss. [Reporter] What do you think should be done to counter the current wave of violence? Some areas are under a state of emergency. What actions do you recommend? [Henriquez] I believe some measures should be implemented. This is precisely what will be done, following instructions from the president of the Republic, and it will be done without having to implement a state of emergency in accordance with the five cases mentioned in the Constitution. We hope that the press and all Guatemalans will take note of this. The measures will be announced soon, no later than next week. The government minister has only been in his post for 17 or 18 days, but he has been working on this in coordination with the Guatemalan Army. [Reporter] What will those measures be? [Henriquez] We prefer not to disclose them yet, because if there are 30 [words indistinct], many criminals, and terrorists. Why should we alert them? There are about 500 car thieves. We must be cautious when we talk about such things. Some degree of secrecy is necessary in certain cases to achieve our objective -- namely, guaranteeing the personal safety of civilians, peace, and harmony. I am very pleased to know that state employees have lifted their strike and that an agreement has been reached. This means the situation will soon return to normal. I wish Congress and the judicial branch could work in harmony for the benefit of all Guatemalans. I would like to see the press comply with its sacred duty of reporting objectively and truthfully. Guatemala would be a beautiful country, right? [Reporter] Mr. Minister, former President Vinicio Cerezo has said former soldiers were implicated in the current wave of violence that is creating a nationwide crisis. Although he did not mention names, there are rumors that those involved could be Colonel Menardo Perussina and others who retired from the Army. [Henriquez] I would not dare mention any names. I know all of them, and, frankly, I believe it is very unlikely that a retired officer would engage in destabilizing activities. In addition, the Army has its own means of information. It has intelligence and counterintelligence services to detect such actions. If any of these men were involved in any wrongdoing, we would likely already know about it, and certainly the defense minister would have called them in and reprimanded them. If it is confirmed that they are involved, they will be tried and punished according to the law. However, I do not think this is the case. I read about former President Cerezo Arevalo's statement. He said some civilians and retired officers could be trying to destabilize the country to promote a coup. He was probably referring to those who destabilized his government. There are many rumors and a great deal of speculation. I would like this to stop in Guatemala, because sometimes friendships are lost because of such rumors. This should not happen. [Reporter] Mr. Minister, you just said the Army has its own intelligence and counterintelligence services. Why then have the murderers of Jorge Carpio and those responsible for other attacks, as well as those individuals behind the nationwide wave of violence, not been identified yet? [Henriquez] That is why I said we have our intelligence agencies, but it is not easy to detect terrorists. I have also noted that even in the United States, the only superpower in the world at this time, terrorists managed to introduce large quantities of explosives into those tall buildings in New York -- what are they called, the twin towers in New York? -- and set off a large blast, killing people. This happened right on the noses of the FBI, the CIA, and a huge military. You see, it is not that easy. For example, we would like to find out right now who killed Epaminondas or who attacked Chinchilla Vega and announce to the press: Gentlemen, this person did it. I would like to do that, but sometimes I feel helpless. [Reporter] Are there any clues? [Second reporter] It has been reported that someone was arrested in connection with Epaminonda's murder. [Henriquez] I have no knowledge of that. What I know is that the technical investigations are ongoing and that there is a good chance of arresting the murderer. [end recording]
