Hosokawa made the request during a two-hour meeting with Li, the officials said. The subject of the ibis, though, was not originally on the agenda for the talks with the Chinese premier. Hosokawa told Li there are only a pair of ibis now in Japan and they are too old for artificial breeding, they said. He asked China to lend Japan a pair for breeding, saying he has heard that there are a number of captive ibis in China that have either artificially or naturally produced offspring, they said. Li replied that he basically supports Hosokawa's idea but he will ask experts to work out such a loan, the officials said.
