The Chinese Supreme People's Court made public Sunday [29 May] two serious cases of smuggling at Rushan City in east China's Shandong Province and at Zhuhai City in south China's Guangdong Province, respectively. Four principals in the two cigarette-smuggling cases, including one government official and three frontier police officers, were executed Sunday morning. The crimes were committed by smugglers in cahoots with officers of law enforcement bodies. They carried out their criminal activities under armed escort and protection from some local officials. "This shows that smuggling activities are rampant," the editorial said. Noting that the criminals in the two cases have all been severely punished, the newspaper said that "this demonstrates the firm determination of the central authorities in the struggle against corruption. "Anyone violating the law, no matter who, where and in which department he is, will be punished in accordance with the law." The editorial pointed out that smuggling is an illegal economic activity that can severely disrupt the domestic market, the nation's industry, international trade, the economic order and the general confidence of society. It has a specially corrosive effect on cadres. Therefore, it added, the crime of smuggling is not only an economic problem but also a political problem. The editorial said that experience has shown that smuggling is a growing problem in certain places despite the central government's repeated orders banning smuggling. It is precisely because some local officials and officers of law enforcement bodies have been involved in such criminal activities, that some local officials have taken the attitude that they can run their localities as their own fiefdoms, and that corruption has become rampant in some local government departments and law-enforcement bodies. A few localities and departments have put their own interests above the national interests, the newspaper said. The editorial also pointed out that it is a mere pretext for smuggling activities when some people argue that in the process of developing a socialist market economy a blind eye should be turned to smuggling. It stressed that in order to develop a socialist market economy it is necessary to establish a strict and complete legal system, and severely crack down on smuggling activities.
