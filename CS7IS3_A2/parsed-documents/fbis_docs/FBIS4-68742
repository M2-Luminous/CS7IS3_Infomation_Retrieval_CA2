The commission considered the procuracy's submissions on instances of violation of commodity exchange legislation and discussed the question of exchanges' participation in forming the charter capital of commercial banks. However, the significance of the event lies not in the agenda of its first meeting but in the very fact of the commencement of functioning of a body that will to a great extent set the rules of the game at the commodity and financial markets of Russia. The KTB was created in keeping with the Law "On Exchanges and Exchange Activities" adopted by the former Supreme Soviet in 1992. The two-year delay is quite explainable, considering the structure of the KTB and its powers. The list of powers with respect to organization and control of exchange activities delegated to the KTB by Russian Federation Government Decree No. 152 includes issuance and annulment of licenses for organizing exchange trading; appointment of state commissioners to commodity exchanges; control over accounting documentation; and referral of materials to law enforcement organs. In composition the KTB is a mixed state-public body. In keeping with approved quotas, it includes 10 ministerial functionaries from the Ministry of the Economy, MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations], Ministry of Fuel and Energy, Ministry of Agriculture, and State Committee on Metallurgy; five delegates each from exchange and brokerage unions; and 10 independent experts. According to KTB Deputy Chairman Andrey Kashevarov, this form creates a real opportunity for a conflict-free transition from departmental administration of markets. In his opinion, the state-public composition of control bodies will make the practice of licensing more democratic and legalize the decisionmaking mechanism. At this point, however, by Mr. Kashevarov's admission, the departmental power of agencies operating on the commodity exchanges still considerably exceeds the KTB's real abilities. According to the Russian Federation State Committee on Statistics, 177 exchanges and 35,468 brokerage offices were operating in Russia at the end of 1993. After the boom in exchange trading in 1991 and a sharp decline in 1992-1993, the situation has now stabilized. The remaining exchanges have shifted toward trading in classic exchange commodities--oil and petroleum products, metal, and agricultural commodities. Against the background of a considerable decline in total exchange turnover, specialists note a sharp rise in foreign currency futures deals. In the total turnover of 2 trillion rubles [R] in exchange trades registered in 1993, futures accounted for R13 billion. This year the ratio of deals on commodity and financial markets approached 1:4, which corresponds to world standards. In the opinion of Andrey Kovalev, head of science at the Institute for Organized Market Research, 1994 will produce a peak in activities related to foreign currency futures deals at exchanges. With the relative stabilization of the ruble exchange rate and the high risk involved in operations with securities, foreign currency futures, in Mr. Kovalev's opinion, are becoming the most attractive segment of exchange trading. Nevertheless, the KTB is ready to increase its activities in organizing futures trading in agricultural products, first and foremost grain. In June 1994 an international conference on problems of the development of grain futures trading in Russia will open in St. Petersburg under the aegis of the KTB. In order to stimulate exchange activities, the KTB, according to its chairman Yuriy Danilov, will lobby for a reduction in tax rates for enterprises selling their output through commodity exchanges.
