"That (Korean) children have been hurt is intolerable," Hata told a session of the House of Councilors Budget Committee. Hata said he will urge all ministries and agencies to think about appeals to stop such racial discrimination. In recent weeks there have been frequent reports of Korean students being subjected to abusive language by Japanese and in some cases of the ethnic uniforms of female Korean students even being ripped to shreds. Police suspect that there must be a sense of discrimination against pro-Pyongyang Koreans behind the scenes amid the international tension over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development program. National Public Safety Commission Chief Hajime Ishii and Justice Minister Hiroshi Nakai told the same committee session that the situation is "regrettable," adding that the government will intensify investigations and improve measures to protect foreigners' human rights.
