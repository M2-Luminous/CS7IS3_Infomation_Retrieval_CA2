This runs counter to what he said just a few months ago in the wake of the signing of the Oslo agreement amidst all the media clamor. Despite the fact that the Israeli prime minister has always sought to hit one track with another and fabricate contradictions among the Arab parties involved in the peace process, and despite the fact that he managed to take on the Palestinian party separately, all of the subsequent developments and the stumbling of the Oslo agreement brought to the forefront the facts of the established, just solution in the Middle East. Israel had to acknowledge Syria's central role in the peace process. The Geneva summit came to consecrate this role and to confirm the bases and facts of the desired peace in the region. Thus, when Rabin acknowledges the importance of peace with Syria, he is in fact acquiescing to the facts of the conflict. Rabin's statements should have reflected decisively on the talks currently being held in Washington on the level of heads of delegations. Despite the relatively practical atmosphere in these talks, the Israeli negotiating team has not yet given a satisfactory answer on Israel's complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights -- a withdrawal which Syria expects in return for peace in the region. Rabin returned to his tune on holding a plebiscite for the Israelis on withdrawal from the Golan Heights and on what he termed peace with Syria after reaching a draft Syrian-Israeli agreement. Rabin thinks he is authorized to sign agreements on the other tracks, but not the Syrian one, and justifies this by saying the Golan Height are strategically important and that the Israelis are suspicious of the Syrians. The fact is that the Israeli prime minister is contradicting himself. He uses a plebiscite as an excuse for extortion against Syria and to deflect it away from the demand of the just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Peace is the most important guarantee for security and there is no area of special strategic importance for any region in the world in the age of missiles and aircraft. Syria, as the world acknowledges, has always been faithful to what it says. President al-Asad expressed Syria's firm, principled stand in his well known statement "we fight in honor, and we make peace in honor." Geographic expansion did not, and will not, guarantee security for Israel. That expansion will only be a tool to ignite wars in the region in the future. Syria has offered a just and comprehensive peace, a peace with no occupation, one that will lead to stable conditions in the Middle East in return for regaining the occupied territories. If peace with Syria is a basic element, as Israel's leaders acknowledge, and the key to peace in the Middle East, then peace is now at hand. It only requires a positive Israeli response to the UN Security Council resolutions and the principles of international law by ending its occupation of the Arab territories, recognizing the rights of the Palestinians, and getting involved in the crucible of the just and comprehensive peace. We do not believe that any two people in the world will dispute the fact that returning the entire Golan Heights is a basic condition for peace with Syria. Throughout the long years of the Arab-Israeli conflict, Syria has never relinquished, and will never relinquish, an inch of land or a single right. Nor will it ever yield to the Israeli extortion. Thus, Rabin is playing the plebiscite game in the wrong place. The Golan Heights have been Syrian territory since time immemorial. This fact cannot be changed by a thousand Israeli plebiscites. Syria in the past ignored the [Israeli] annexation of the Golan Heights. Equally, Syria will not give any weight to these threats. The Israeli prime minister should instead instruct his negotiating team in Washington to address the substantial issues and approve the return of the entire Golan Heights to Syria because this is a basic condition for any progress in the talks. When Syria sets the condition of returning all the occupied territories in return for peace, it is showing respect, in letter and spirit, to the UN Security Council resolutions, the principles of international law, and the UN Charter. The Israeli occupation, which continues to date, is a flagrant infringement on these resolutions, principles, and charter and constitutes a defiance of the entire world community. Israel's submission to international law will mark the beginning of the road to the established of a lasting peace in the Middle East that will benefit every state in the region.
