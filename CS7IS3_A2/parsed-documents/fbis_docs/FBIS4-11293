This is a statement by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide who asks the Clinton government to respect the wishes of the Haitian people. What over 67 percent of the Haitian people are demanding today is a total embargo and the return of their president, stated Aristide who pointed out that this decision of the people is supported by Canada, France, and Venezuela. [Begin Aristide recording] I think Canada, France, and Venezuela have done much to support, for instance, our call for the application of a total embargo. I have not seen this on the part of the United States. I simply wish the United States would exhibit a coherent policy, consisting of listening to and respecting the voice of the Haitian people, through respect for the results of those elections. Today, over 67 percent are demanding the return of the president; and a total embargo, but not the kind of embargo that is a source of suffering. To respect the Haitian people is to agree not to impose what they have rejected. We have rejected this kind of embargo by requesting a total embargo. May the desires of the Haitian people be respected. [end recording] That was President Jean-Bertrand Aristide asking that the Haitian people's wishes, expressed through the 16 December 1990 elections, be respected.
