Announcing his resignation from the faction on Thursday, Burbulis explained his step by his intention to set up a new democratic movement. In his opinion, the new movement should include representatives from all regions of the Russian Federation who "have never been engaged in political activities, but by their views and convictions are the most active supporters and defenders of the democratic reforms in Russia." Burbulis also noted that "it would be politically wrong for him to proclaim a new democratic party or movement now." "Let it happen from inside, from regions," Burbulis said. Asked about his attitude to Yegor Gaydar's plans to create a new party called Russia's Choice, Burbulis noted that "it is already impossible to stop these plans." "Let the new party be born," Burbulis said noting that it would not fulfil its expectations, Burbulis also noted that he would like to be "kind of a bridge" between the party Russia's Choice and the new democratic movement which he envisages. [Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 1451 GMT on 7 April 1994 adds: "Commenting on this move, Russia's Choice Leader Yegor Gaydar expressed "deep regret" over it. "Although Gennadiy Burbulis's decision will have serious consequences for the faction, it should not be dramatized", he noted. Another member of the Russia's Choice faction, Stepan Sulakshin, followed suit and announced his intention to quit the faction at the same meeting."
