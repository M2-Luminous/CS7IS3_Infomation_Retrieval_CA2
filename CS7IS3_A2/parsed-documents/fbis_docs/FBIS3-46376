An official from the committee said that the province transformed more than 3,000 old enterprises last year, among which 365 were large and medium-sized ones, about one third of the province's major enterprises. Liaoning, one of China's most important industrial bases since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, has turned over to the state more than 170 billion yuan in taxes over the last four decades. But recent years have shown that Liaoning's enterprises have failed to meet the country's accelerated modernization drive, as they are plagued by problems of aging equipment and outdated technologies. Statistics show that by the 1990s only 32.5 percent of the equipment installed in the province's enterprises reached the 1980s standard, lower than the national average and about 20 percentage points lower than some of the country's prosperous provinces. Cao Guixin, director of the committee, said that Liaoning has launched a campaign to import foreign capital and technologies to help transform the aged enterprises. Last year alone more than 100 large and medium-sized enterprises were reformed with foreign funds. In Dalian, a major port city of the province, 11 machinery and chemical enterprises and 17 electronics enterprises were successfully updated, the official said. He also said that in 1993 Liaoning sponsored several large economic and trade fairs overseas, through which the province established direct relations with many foreign financial groups and large companies. According to statistics, Liaoning has invested 5.69 billion U.S. dollars in transforming old enterprises, including 2.19 billion U.S. dollars in foreign capital. Cao said that co-operation with other countries and regions in the transformation drive has eased the money shortages which have plagued these enterprises for decades as well as introduced advanced foreign management into the old enterprises. The official assured that this year Liaoning will upgrade its backbone industries, major products and key enterprises through utilizing more overseas high-technology and capital.
