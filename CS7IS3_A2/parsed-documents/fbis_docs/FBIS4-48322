Funding problems will finally achieve what several National Party governments failed to do -- silence one of the most articulate voices against apartheid. "WIP's funding base -- primarily donor agencies in Europe -- has all but disappeared as (they) have cut back on support for projects in South Africa," said editor Chris Vick in a statement. "Because several funding pledges have not materialised, or have been delayed considerably, the magazine is heavily in debt." Vick said there was no possibility of getting substantial funding for the magazine in the near future. "Although we are entering a stage when those in power will be committed to democracy, justice and reconstruction, there is still going to be a need for watchdogs when can bark and bite." Vick criticised the lack of support from potential advertisers and the commercial print media.
