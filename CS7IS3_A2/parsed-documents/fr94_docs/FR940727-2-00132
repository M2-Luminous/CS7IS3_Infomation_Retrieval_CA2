FR940727-2-00132 FR940727-2-00075 Maritime Administration [Docket P&hyph;008] Waterman Steamship Corporation Notice of Request for Secretarial Directive to the Department of Agriculture Concerning the Ocean Transportation of Title II Preference Cargoes By letter dated July 1, 1994, and accompanying brief, Waterman Steamship Corporation (Waterman) requests that the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) require the Department of Agriculture (Agriculture) to comply with the Maritime Administration's June 16, 1986, Prioritization letter; require the allocation of preference cargoes by destination; and require the elimination of bidding procedures which compel U.S.-flag dry cargo liner vessels to bid against foreign competitors and/or non-liner U.S.-flag vessels for the carriage of preference cargoes generated by the Pub. L. 480 program, 7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq., Title II of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, (Pub. L. 480). Waterman alleges that Agriculture is improperly administering its cargo preference program in three critically important respects, thereby impeding Waterman's participation in the cargo preference program. (1) Waterman alleges that Agriculture is violating the Maritime Administration's ``prioritization rule'' issued June 16, 1986, in that Agriculture is allocating preference cargo to ports where all U.S.-flag service is not available and is then fixing the cargo on mixed service, i.e. U.S.-flag vessels with foreign-flag feeder vessels. (2) Waterman alleges that Agriculture is violating the Cargo Preference Act of 1954, as amended, 46 App. U.S.C. 1241, (the 1954 Act) by failing to administer its Pub. L. 480 program in such manner as to insure fair and reasonable participation of U.S.-flag vessels by geographic destination areas. (3) Waterman alleges that Agriculture is violating the 1954 Act through bidding procedures which require U.S.-flag dry cargo liner vessels to bid against foreign-flag and/or non-liner U.S.-flag vessels for preference cargoes which should be reserved for U.S.-flag liner vessels. This request may be inspected in the Office of the Secretary, Maritime Administration. Any person, firm, or corporation having any interest in such request and desiring to submit comments concerning the application must file written comments in triplicate with the Secretary, Maritime Administration, Room 7300, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Comments must be received no later than 5:00 p.m. on August 17, 1994. This notice is published as a matter of discretion and publication should in no way be considered a favorable or unfavorable decision on the request, as filed or as may be amended. By Order of the Maritime Administrator. Dated: July 21, 1994. Joel C. Richard, Acting Secretary, Maritime Administration.
