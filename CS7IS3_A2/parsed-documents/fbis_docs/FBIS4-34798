At the White House on 24 June, the president will announce to his U.S. counterpart, Bill Clinton, that Argentina is willing to send men to the Dominican Republic to reinforce controls at the Haitian border as the Haiti Friends Club proposed in the United Nations. Haiti was the first issue U.S. State Department people included on the bilateral agenda for the meeting with Menem. The United States is waiting for a definition of the political situation of that country. Some people are speculating that if the international embargo imposed against the dictatorship of Raoul Cedras does not yield any results, the United States would be willing to invade Haiti. During the few breaks in their Canadian tour that ended in Quebec, a city privileged by nature, Menem and his foreign minister, Guido Di Tella, reviewed the stance that Argentina will take on various issues. A sentence that echoed frequently in the president's ears was: "Within the UN and OAS framework, and within this framework alone, we are ready for anything." Argentine joined the Friends Club two weeks ago, already made up of the United States, France, Canada, and Venezuela and coordinated by former UCR [Radical Civic Union] Foreign Minister Dante Caputo, representing the OAS. The Friends Club's initial measure involved canceling all commercial flights (the only air connection with foreign countries is Air France) and freezing the bank accounts the Haitians -- and their closest relatives -- who participated in the coup that overthrew Jean-Bertrand Aristide have in the United States. The Friends Club also fixed its eyes on the Haitian-Dominican border. It believes the international embargo might be evaded through this 300-km-long border. Menem actually does not have to resort to the announcement to demonstrate his siding with the U.S. stance. Our country actually is the only Latin American country that supports the maritime trade embargo with a corvette. Nevertheless, the president had to make a showy gesture, and he is aware of the fact that Haiti represents an obsession for Clinton. In addition to the presidents, U.S. Vice President Al Gore, Christopher Warren and Anthony Laker (the two Department of State heads)n [name and title as published], U.S. Ambassador to Argentina James Cheek, Guido Di Tella, and Raul Granillo Ocampo, the Argentine ambassador to the United States, will meet around the oval table in the White House. Messages to finalize the details kept coming from the United States on 22 June while Menem's entourage hurried to complete its extensive tour of Quebec (that included a golf game with Governor General Martial Asselin at the local Royal Club) on time. The president will arrive at 0930 today at the Sanford airport in Maine. There he will be met by his "close" friend George Bush (concerning Clinton, Menem on 22 June noted that he and Clinton are "from the same continent"); Bush's wife, Barbara; and Granillo Ocampo. Menem will travel with daughter Zulemita; his personal doctor, Alejandro Tfeli; and his private secretary, Ramon Hernandez, aboard a private jet loaned by an unknown U.S. businessman who is a friend of Bush. The presidential airplane Tango-01 will go on to Washington with the rest of Menem's entourage. Today's agenda already has been completed: Menem will play tennis in the morning, have lunch, have some photographs taken by journalists, and finally play golf. For dinner, before leaving, Menem will contribute a selection of Argentine wines. If everything goes the way he has planned, Menem's only disappointment might be that he will not make a stopover in Boston. Menem decided to watch the Argentina-Nigeria soccer game on television from somewhere in the United States. Otherwise, Box No. 134, which has been reserved for Menem, will be occupied by Bush and Granillo Ocampo.
