It was expected that the motion sponsored by Phalang Tham Party MPs proposing a special committee to redraft the Constitution would be taken up for discussion. Before proceeding with the items on the agenda, which were already scrutinized by the house committees, the chairman of the session informed MPs that the Chat Phatthana Party requested the withdrawal of its motion on setting up a special committee to study guidelines to formulate a master plan for political reforms. The party said it wanted to make improvements on the proposal. The meeting approved the party's request. The chairman then asked whether any MP's would like to propose any other items for discussion, or proceed with items on the agenda. The motion which the Chat Phatthana Party requested to withdraw was tabled as the 26th item, an urgent motion. The motion sponsored by Phalang Tham MP's was placed as the 28th item on the list. The fact that nobody proposed to move the motion up for discussion by the House of Representatives indicated that it would not be discussed today. And if it is debated according to the line on the agenda, the motion risks not being discussed at all during the present House session which is scheduled to recess by the end of July. The House today discussed a report prepared by the committee in charge of holding celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the King's reign in 1996. MP's discussed the plan extensively from noon until evening. Most of those who took the floor proposed that the government hold celebrations worth the honor of His Majesty the King so that all people can take part in the campaign which should include activities which will benefit the general public. The House session continued until 1800. During the session, a delegation led by the deputy speaker of the House of Representatives of Kuwait visited parliament. The group is currently on a visit to Thailand until 19 June.
