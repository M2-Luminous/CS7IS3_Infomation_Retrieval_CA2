"It's very regrettable because he has set a new current in politics," said Yoichi Morishita, president of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Many executives gave high marks to Hosokawa's political achievements since he took office eight months ago. "He set out to relax regulations in order to promote administrative reform," said Toshiomi Uragami, chairman of the Life Insurance Association of Japan. "I believe many people are disappointed because there were high expectations of fiscal and administrative reforms from now on," said Kenji Maeda, chairman of the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors. But Tadahiro Sekimoto, president of NEC Corp., criticized Hosokawa for evading responsibility for bringing the economy back to health. "It's not a responsible act to resign now that there is the need to secure economic recovery," Sekimoto said. Many business leaders voiced concern about a political vacuum that could dampen a budding economic recovery and appealed for early Diet passage of the fiscal 1994 budget and an early setup of a new cabinet. "We hope a new government will be established quickly," said Hiroshi Saito, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation. Hosokawa offered to resign earlier in the day to take responsibility for a Diet stalemate in the wake of allegations of corruption over his loan from a scandal-ridden parcel delivery company. None of the business people commenting on the resignation called for pursuing the corruption allegations.
