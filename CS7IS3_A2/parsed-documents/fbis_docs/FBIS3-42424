According to the Navy Press Center report about 20 Black Sea Fleet naval infantry, led by an officer, came to a housing area which had some days earlier been occupied by families of Ukrainian navy personnel. They presented residents with the demand that they vacate the quarters and tried to enter the building. However they were stopped with the help of four unarmed Ukrainian sailors. The article noted the irony of this occurrence on the same day on which Ukraine's Navy Commander Vice-Admiral Bezkorovaynyy was meeting with First Deputy Black Sea Fleet Commander, Vice-Admiral Larionov to discuss problems in dividing the housing. Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Ukrainian on 19 January 1994 reports on page 1 that Ukraine's Navy Commander, Vice-Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy made a trip to the Navy's Odessa and Izmayil Garrisons. While with the Izmayil Garrison he was briefed on combat training and the formation of a section of the Naval Engineering Service within the garrison. In Odessa Bezkorovaynyy met with deans and department heads at the Odessa State Maritime Academy and the Odessa Maritime Engineers' Institute, where training of specialist, future officers for the navy was discussed. Vice-Admiral Bezkorovaynyy also conversed by telephone with Acting Black Sea Fleet Commander Larionov. Agreement was reached on a procedure for resolving problems arising from unsanctioned actions of certain leaders or military collectives of either country. Vice-Admiral Bezkorovaynyy expressed the need to work out a bilateral document between the Ukraine's Navy and the Black Sea Fleet to address housing, financing, energy supplies, etc. to prevent confrontations, which would interfere with mutual understanding and trust.
