"The situation in East Timor is now different from the past. I do not think the former Fretilin president or whoever wants to visit there will ever be able to agitate the people," Major General Theo Syafei told reporters in Denpasar, Bali. Theo heads the Udayana Military Command which oversees security in Bali, East and West Nusa Tenggara and East Timor. Theo said the visit of former Fretilin leader Rogerio Lobato and former Portuguese general Galvao de Melo will prove that Indonesia has nothing to hide in East Timor. That also applies to the condition of remaining Fretilin members, he said, adding that the armed separatist movement no longer poses any serious threat to security in East Timor. Fretilin has been waging a guerrilla war since the decision of the majority of East Timorese to integrate with Indonesia in 1976. It was dealt with a severe blow when its commander, Jose Alexandre "Xanana" Gusmao was arrested in November 1991. Many Fretilin leaders have found sanctuary in Portugal, their former colonizer. Indonesia and Portugal are still negotiating, under the UN auspices, to settle the East Timor question. The world body still regards Lisbon as the administering power of East Timor. Theo said that from the visit, East Timorese opposing the integration will see for themselves that the Portuguese support the rebels have been counting on all this time is nothing but hollow dreams. On the question of East Timorese who want to go home after nearly 20 years in exile, Theo said they will have difficulties if they want to obtain Indonesian citizenship. "And if they only want to come to create disturbances in East Timor or to reincite anti-integration sentiment they will have to face the military," he warned. Theo accused East Timorese who have spread negative information about Indonesia's rule in the province of having neglected the truth for their own personal gains. Lopes da Cruz, Indonesia's special ambassador for East Timor, said earlier that Lobato and de Melo are expected to visit Indonesia beginning on January 4. The visit follows a meeting earlier this month near London, where a pro-Indonesian delegation led by da Cruz met Timorese exiles for the first time since the integration. "You could say this (visit) is part of Indonesia's confidence-building measures, but we want to emphasize these are non-political meetings," da Cruz said. Lopes da Cruz said Lobato's visit to Jakarta will be the first such trip by a Timorese in exile to Indonesia. He said de Melo will visit Dili but Lobato has yet to decide if he will. Lobato served as minister of defense during Fretilin's brief rule in 1975. De Melo is a leader of the newly-formed Portugal-Indonesia Friendship Association, whose founder, businessman Manuel Macedo visited Indonesia in a much publicized trip in August. Indonesian officials have said they hope the Friendship Association will help re-open diplomatic ties between Lisbon and Jakarta. The Portuguese daily EXPRESSO earlier this month said Lisbon has rejected a UN proposal that the two countries install diplomats in third-party embassies in each other's countries.
