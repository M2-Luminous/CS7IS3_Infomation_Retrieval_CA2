Operating losses were reduced from Fr1.218 billion in 1992 to Fr258 million. Net indebtedness was reduced by Fr3.2 billion to a total of Fr13.3 billion before posting the capital allocation of Fr2 billion from the state. Turnover was down 3 percent in 1993 to Fr50.8 billion (-4.5 percent in terms of a constant "perimeter" and at the same dollar rate). The sharp increase in the value of aircraft deliveries is explained by the fact that "sales of the A340 got up to speed, a circumstance which," according to Aerospatiale, "partially offset the sharp decline in the case of helicopters, the halting of the Hades program, and suspension of the Hermes project." The year 1994 "will probably not see significant cyclical improvement," says Aerospatiale. The group feels that it "maintained or even strengthened its market share in 1993" and that it did so despite "the very difficult situation of the airlines and the existence of overcapacity in their sector." The state-owned group also draws attention to "the intense competition in military markets, which are being subjected to budget restrictions."
