It has been decided to return to the discussion after Vice President Yevgeniy Saburov provides the Supreme Council permanent commissions a detailed structure of the Cabinet of Ministers, in which several posts have been offered to politicians and economists from Moscow. The discussion in which representatives of different parliamentary groups took part demonstrated a significant difference of opinion. To a certain degree it confirmed the president's description of the evolved situation as the "third government crisis." Yuriy Meshkov's demonstrative gesture increased the impression when he left the room when his proposal was rejected together with the Cabinet which was not approved. Nevertheless, behind the scenes there is an opinion that the deputies will be able to find a mutually acceptable way out of the evolved impasse. The session will continue tomorrow.
