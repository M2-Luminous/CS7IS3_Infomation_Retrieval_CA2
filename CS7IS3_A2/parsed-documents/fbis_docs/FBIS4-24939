The friend said by telephone that several police went to the home of Bao's parents around 11:00 pm (15.00 GMT) Friday after he had been to city hall to register his human rights organization. Bao, 31, has also written to the civil affairs ministry to officially register the group, which another friend said has 167 members in several Chinese provinces. The association is demanding free trades unions, religious freedom and compensation for the families of victims of the Japanese occupation of the 1930s and 1940s and relatives of the Tiananmen victims, the friend said. Bao has been under continual police surveillance since May and his telephone has been cut. Other Shanghai dissidents have faced the same treatment and at least five have been detained.
