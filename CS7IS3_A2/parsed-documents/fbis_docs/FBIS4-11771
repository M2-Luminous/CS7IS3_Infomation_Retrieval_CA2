He stressed that the Palestinian leadership, which is discussing the demands of its people, is fully aware that "settlement is a time bomb which will explode in its face later unless it is defused completely." And that the "U.S. Administration is responsible for obstructing the peace process." Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the negotiating Palestinian delegation in Washington, said at a seminar in the British capital during the evening of the day before yesterday that "the Middle East problem did not begin between the Arabs and Israel. It began inside Palestine. And without solving the Palestinian problem there will be no solution in the Middle East." He criticized the U.S. position on the Hebron massacre and the U.S. Administration's threat to use its influence inside the international organization to confront it if we insist on the implementation of the UN resolutions. He added that he was in Washington when the massacre occurred and that he held several round of talks, but "President Clinton and his secretary of state, Warren Christopher, failed to realize that the perpetrator of the massacre is a settler and the main cause is settlement." Dr. 'Urayqat warned that "settlement and peace will never meet," stressing that Washington alone can salvage the negotiations, which were suspended after the massacre. He criticized its international position of appeasing Israel, accusing it of offering Israel preferential and biased treatment by excluding Europe from the peace process and confronting Russia, the co-sponsor of the negotiations. The Americans and the Israelis are imposing their will on us, instead of sitting with us to negotiate." 'Urayqat denied that the Palestinians demanded a solution to the settlers issue only after the Hebron massacre. He said: "The massacre made it a strong issue." He added that the Israelis had always refused to discuss the settlements issue, stressing that none of our fears would materialize." The head of the Palestinian delegation to the Washington negotiations added that "failure to include the settlement issue on the negotiating agenda will inevitably lead to the death of the negotiations, and the Israeli Government alone is responsible for what settlers did and are doing." He went on: "Even if our leadership decides -- under the pressures to which it is exposed -- to join the negotiations once again, the negotiations will die if this issue is not resolved. And peace requires evacuating the settlers first, otherwise any measure will be merely a measure to make the peace process look prettier." 'Urayqat warned the U.S. Administration, the Europeans, and any party interested in the success of the peace process that "the failure of the peace process will not only affect the Palestinians and the Israelis, but will have a regional impact." 'Urayqat accused the Israeli offers to end the effects of the Hebron massacre of lacking seriousness. He said that "the offer to disarm the settlers is not a serious one, because they are all reservists and thus entitled to keep weapons in their homes." [passage omitted] He said that 72 settlers in Hebron are protected around the clock by 1,400 Israeli soldiers. "So what sort of negotiations do we wish to continue if the problem is not included on the agenda." Addressing the Palestinian leadership, he said sorry, but "the settlers remaining while Palestinian police forces are deployed there would lead in the event of a massacre like the Hebron massacre to one of two things: "First, inhabitants killing settlers in retaliation, resulting in Israel sending its aircraft to destroy 'Arafat's headquarters and police centers; "Second, inhabitants throwing stones at settlers, thus initiating a whirlpool of successive reactions, taking us back to square one." He added: "We asked Rabin to settle his options, so he chose settlement, domination, and the logic of force. Rabin is supported by the U.S. Administration, the U.S. Army, and senior U.S. envoy Dennis Ross." 'Urayqat admitted the Palestinians are faced with deep and unprecedented difficulties and changes, saying that the Oslo agreement is not a final peace agreement. He said: "The agreement contains 63 clauses, none of which has a mechanism for implementation and each needs an agreement of its own." Asked about the disagreement with President Yasir 'Arafat, 'Urayqat stressed that he ['Arafat] "is a source of strength for us, and we are not criticizing him. We realize he is merely a human being like all of us." He added: "We want peace more than any other people, but not at any price, because we will not accept any solution seeking to reorganize the Israeli occupation." Palestinian figures who attended the seminar noted that Dr. "Urayqat's speech reflected the view of the Palestinians inside the occupied territories, who are urging 'Arafat to grant them more powers as regards decisionmaking vis-a-vis peace and negotiations. 'Urayqat said that Rabin "has the impression that he can do anything without a deterrent in view of the U.S. solidarity and the European silence -- which causes me to say that the peace process is approaching its end. This has nothing to do with optimism or pessimism. I just do not know whether or not the process can continue." [passage omitted]
