However, the fall in the government's rating has been replaced by a rise. Since 1946 the Gallup Institute has conducted a running popularity rating of the government at regular intervals to assess electorate opinion of the cabinet sitting at that time. The latest poll in this long series has just been completed. In the period from 26 April through 2 May, Gallup conducted telephone interviews with a representative sample of voters, comprising 1,002 individuals over age 18. Gallup asked the following question: Do you think the government has done "well," "rather well," or "not well" during the period it has existed? Each response was calculated into a score, with a reply of "well" assigned the value + 2, the reply "rather well" given + 1, and "not well" a value of - 2. This latest survey, which was conducted at the end of April and the beginning of May, accordingly resulted in a score of - 10. This is a slight improvement in relation to the previous survey, which was done in December 1993. Then the government's rating was - 27. In the small table below are seen the poll results for the current four-party government. For purposes of comparison, also included are the results from the surveys Gallup conducted on the last nonsocialist government, the Conservative-Liberal coalition. The large table [not reproduced here] shows the scores since Hilmar Baunsgaard's Radical Liberal-Liberal-Conservative government at the end of the sixties. As seen from the figures, the dramatic fall in the government's rating has stopped for this time. The question is whether this result is a first indication of that reward that the government is expecting from the voters in the wake of the economic upturn or whether it is more a matter of the four-party coalition's rating having become mired in the negative part of the scale.
