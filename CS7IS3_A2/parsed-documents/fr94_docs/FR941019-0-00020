ACTION: Interim final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) is amending the existing regulations governing its Affordable Housing Disposition Program (AHDP). The amendments set forth in this interim final rule are necessary because the Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring and Improvement Act of 1991 (Refinancing Act), the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1992 (1992 Appropriations Act), the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (1992 Housing Act) and the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act of 1993 (Completion Act) changed the manner in which the RTC is to identify, market and sell certain affordable housing properties. This interim final rule also clarifies certain policies of the RTC regarding the disposition of assets in the AHDP and reflects certain comments received with respect to a previously published interim final rule. By implementing the statutory changes required by the Refinancing Act, the 1992 Appropriations Act, the 1992 Housing Act and the Completion Act, and clarifying certain provisions of the AHDP and making the other changes set forth herein, these regulations will enhance the availability and affordability of residential real property for very-low income, lower-income and moderate-income families and individuals.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulatory Procedure On August 31, 1990 (55 FR 35564), the RTC published a final rule establishing the procedures to be followed by the RTC in connection with the sale of eligible residential properties to qualifying purchasers under the AHDP. Those procedures were established in accordance with the affordable housing provisions of section 21A(c) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, as amended by section 501 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) (12 U.S.C. 1441a). On May 6, 1992 (57 FR 19500), the RTC published an interim final rule and request for comments (May 6, 1992 Interim Rule). That publication implemented some of the statutory changes made to the AHDP by the Refinancing Act and clarified the RTC's policies on a number of issues relating to the disposition of assets in the AHDP. On June 12, 1992 (57 FR 24937), the RTC published an interim statement of policy. That publication provided that when more than one multifamily property is purchased from the RTC under the AHDP, the RTC will require that not less than 15 percent of the dwelling units in each separate property purchased be made available to low or very-low income individuals. The final statement of policy was published on August 19, 1992 (57 FR 37581) and reflected no significant changes from the interim statement of policy.
