Lagin: "Sociologists Suggest the Solution: How the Chelyabinsk Administration Makes Use of Their Conclusions and Predictions"] [Text] In the course of a little over two years, a group of sociologists from the Chelyabinsk branch of the Institute of Economics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as an assignment for the Chelyabinsk administration, has been making sociological studies. The authorities are interested in everything: how the Chelyabinsk citizens feel under the new conditions and how certain specific actions should be planned. It would be a good idea to become familiar with certain aspects of this difficult job. `Pro' or `Con' Practically every staff meeting of V. Tarasov, head of the Chelyabinsk administration, begins with the latest sociological poll and the conclusions and recommendations of sociologists. Moreover, in addition to the constantly repeated questions (monitoring) -- how much have the citizens adapted to the new prices, is their standard of living on the whole rising or falling, how satisfied are they with the work of a certain specific municipal service -- the directors of the committees and the head himself ask the scientists to take a special interest in some specific subject. On the basis of the data from the polls, a conclusion is drawn as to the advisability of the actions or measures planned by the municipal authorities. For example, the question was asked: "Are the citizens planning to get vegetables and potatoes at stores or are they relying on their own stock?" It was ascertained that most of the Chelyabinsk citizens rely more on themselves and on the market than on state trade. This served as the basis for the trade committee to amend its plans and try to have a necessary, but not excessive reserve at the vegetable warehouses. Another example. There was a great deal of "pro" and "con" about holding a trade fair on Revolyutsiya Square. The sociologists said unequivocally that the city needed these trade fairs. The administration was guided by their conclusions. Before introducing compulsory registration for foreign citizens in Chelyabinsk, the sociologists were charged with determining the attitude of the citizens toward this extreme measure. Their conclusions convinced the head of the administration that it was not the right path. No registration procedure has so far been established, true, but it must be, by summertime. Also taken into consideration was the opinion of the Chelyabinsk citizens, that no daily payment should be taken from foreigners for staying in the city: a fine for violation of the registration rules is compulsory, but they do not have to pay for each day. Life Has Become.... At one time our fathers and grandfathers were convinced: "Life has become better, comrades, life has become merrier!" Today this slogan does not do it -- one must operate with scientific data and figures. To what do they attest? As sociologists affirm, over half of the Chelyabinsk inhabitants (54 percent) eat as well or better than in March 1992. Moreover, in March 1992, this was true of only 42 percent. The percentage of those who have begun to be worse fed has dropped from 57 to 34. No one, of course, is shouting "Hurrah!": after all, this is one-third of the citizens! These are primarily the pensioners and the poorly-paid categories of employees and workers. It is to their social protection that the municipal services are oriented: subsidies, compensations, benefits. The percentage of those finding it difficult to buy themselves clothing and footwear has dropped (from 86 to 58). It has been reduced by one-third -- good. What is bad is that these Chelyabinsk citizens constitute a majority. There must therefore be a group of measures to help this majority: pensioners, teachers, physicians, cultural workers and scientific workers. The conclusion of the scientists is: consumption of food products will increase somewhat, and the need for clothing and footwear will increase, but by much less. This is very important information for the committee for trade and services: clothing and footwear must be less expensive. For the majority of the citizens (56.5 percent), there is a possibility of starting to work. This is 10 percent more than in 1992. At the same time, there were only 1,038 persons, 0.61 percent, officially (registered) unemployed in Chelyabinsk in February (compare: in the small town of Nyazepetrovsk, 11 percent are unemployed!). Not counting the hidden unemployed. But this depends to a lesser extent, you will agree, on the "city's leading economic section" and its administration than on various AO [joint-stock company], AOZT and TOO [expansions not given], large combines and plants. Yesterday and today and tomorrow, it is hard to find a person who would say: "I am satisfied with my life." Nevertheless, 15.7 percent of the Chelyabinsk citizens are satisfied with their lives. This is more than last year. Some 56.6 percent feel dissatisfied, but this percentage has dropped. Compare: 73 percent of the Moscow citizens, 72 percent of the inhabitants of Chelyabinsk Oblast but "only" 55.6 percent of the Chelyabinsk citizens put down "dissatisfied" with their lives. To some extent, this is an evaluation of the work of the municipal administration, which has managed to "amortize" the difficulties --although not so much that a majority of the citizens put down a favorable evaluation. A Beloved City Chelyabinsk remains one of the major cities in Russia: it is in third place after Moscow and St. Petersburg with respect to industrial potential, and has a population of 1,161,000 people. It is both easier and harder to live in a city like this. It is easier because Chelyabinsk is a city of plants, the center of metallurgy and heavy industry. Specialists feel that tomorrow is for these precise citizens. For the same reason, it is more difficult for us to live today. "How do you evaluate the situation in the city?" -- the sociologists are constantly asking this question. In all the years of the studies, the relative proportion of those who evaluate the situation in the city as tense holds steady in the area of 28 percent (one-third). Depending on the time of the year and the month, the number of Chelyabinsk citizens who consider the situation calm fluctuates (from 32 percent in June 1993 to 14 percent in January 1994). On the basis of this, the percentage of those who evaluate the situation as on the border between calm and tense changes (from 41 to 57 percent). In the opinion of sociologists, the most unfavorable months for Chelyabinsk are March, April and the first half of May. The peak of tension falls precisely in these months, year after year. There are several reasons: economic, climatic, psychological, organizational, material -- you cannot list them all. If you turn to preceding years, it is in spring that the mass revolts of the miners occur, with the protest actions of the metallurgists as their consequence. It becomes clear to anyone: in these months, the work of all the units should be organized with particular precision, without any breaks. Specialists of the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), in drawing up predictions of a way out of the crisis in various regions and Russia as a whole, feel that the basic economic and social problems can be solved in a region or city taken individually, without waiting for them to be fully resolved throughout the country. The Chelyabinsk citizens were not acquainted with the conclusions of the foreign scholars, but nevertheless, every third one (32 percent) intuitively agreed with them -- they can be solved in our city, they can! Some 54 percent reject this idea. The IBRD asserts that the industrial regions, where the metallurgical industry predominates, will start to come out of the crisis first. This includes Chelyabinsk and Chelyabinsk Oblast. Feedback One of Russia's leading sociologists asserts: "With socialism there was complete agreement of opinion -- anyone who thought otherwise would find himself subject to the action of the repressive organs. Today, any authority, in order to hold its ground, must know the opinion of the people and amend its work in accordance with the reaction of the people." Feedback today is not a tribute to fashion, but a vital necessity for any level of authority. This feedback is working in Chelyabinsk.
