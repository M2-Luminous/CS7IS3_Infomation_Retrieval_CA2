FR941019-2-00104 FR941019-2-00070 General Management Plan; Kaloko Honokohau National Historical Park; Notice of Availability of Final Environmental Impact Statement Summary: Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91&hyph;190, the National Park Service has prepared a final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on the general management plan (GMP) for Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park, Hawaii County, Hawaii. The general management plan calls for the development of access and visitor use facilities at the park. Facilities proposed in the park are limited to those essential for the protection of resources, provision of visitor services, and perpetuation of the Hawaiian culture. They are confined to areas already disturbed, known not to contain cultural or natural resources, and located away from the coast. Developments are to be designed to blend in with the historical and open character of the park's landscape. Moreover, they are to be located so as to not interfere with the traditional Hawaiian activities taking place in the park. The draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) was released for public review in October 1992, and the public comment period closed December 11, 1992. Both the DEIS and the FEIS evaluate the same proposal and three alternatives, and information in the FEIS is essentially unchanged from the DEIS. The alternatives consist of no action, limited facility development (minimum requirements), and maximization of vehicle access with more emphasis on recreational use. The FEIS contains written responses to substantive comments made on the DEIS, as well as minor modifications and clarifications to the text as appropriate in response to those comments. Supplementary Information: The no action period on the GMP/FEIS will extend for 30 days after EPA publishes a notice of its availability in the Federal Register . Requests for information on, or copies of the final document should be directed to the Superintendent, Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park, 73&hyph;4786 Kanalani Street, # 14, Kailua-Kona, Hawaii 96740; or to the Park Planner, National Park Service Pacific Area Office, 300 Ala Moana Blvd., Box 56065, Honolulu, Hawaii 96850. Dated: September 28, 1994. Stanley T. Albright, Regional Director, Western Region. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25920 Filed 10&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;70&hyph;P
