CIA Station Chief in Moscow Declared Persona Non Grata on a `Reciprocal Basis'"] [Text] Yesterday, the Russian Foreign Ministry made a representation to the counselor envoy of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in connection with the deportation of Aleksandr Lysenko, official representative of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] in Washington. "In this situation," the note says, "we are forced to declare the CIA representative in Moscow persona non grata and to request that he leave the Russian Federation on a reciprocal basis. The Russian Foreign Ministry proceeds from the assumption that there are special channels for settling matters that may arise with regard to the intelligence and counterintelligence activity of the two sides. These channels can and should be put in operation. This will make it possible to find a mutually acceptable way out of the current situation and to avoid its politicization." When asked by your SEGODNYA correspondent to specify, Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry press and information department, said that the person in question was James L. Morris, counselor at the U.S. Embassy. Morris was given seven days to leave the country, same as Lysenko. It has transpired from other sources that some time ago the secret services of Russia and the United States were going to reveal to each other one representative working under diplomatic cover each, although, of course, without the right to publish their names. Aleksandr Lysenko assumed his job in Washington last summer and has no relation to Ames. In Moscow, his deportation has been perceived as a purely political action, and there have been attempts to conceal the fact that actions taken against Morris are a retaliatory measure. According to that same source, there have been no agreements on the mutual cessation of intelligence activity between the Russian and U.S. special services. There is, however, an agreement on forgoing "uncivilized methods" of recruitment. Nonetheless, the Russian side has evidence proving that the U.S. special services have been using just these methods. The Russian services, the source claims, are not interested in arousing passions over the Ames case and, on their part, would not like to make cases involving U.S. agents public. For the time being, CIA Director Woolsey "is carrying on considerately," an approach that Moscow interprets as showing a similar desire. Russian professionals have already made clear that they stand for continuing cooperation with their American counterparts, but they believe that the cooperation may only be based "on the common perception of national interests." At the same time, the source emphasized, there are influential forces in the United States wishing "to impose a time-out" on President Clinton so as to take a closer look at what is going on in Russia. The decision regarding Morris was made personally by the president. According to our information, the dismissal of Golushko from the post of Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] director does not have any bearing on the Ames case. At the same time, according to unconfirmed reports, arrests have been made at the FCS central staff and the Federal Agency of Government Communications and Information.
