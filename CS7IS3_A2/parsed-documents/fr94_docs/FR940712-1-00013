Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent degradation of the structural integrity of the airframe due to cracks in the rear spar, accomplish the following: (a) Perform a high frequency eddy current (HFEC) rototest inspection to detect cracks in certain bolt holes where the main landing gear (MLG) forward pick-up fitting and MLG rib 5 aft are attached to the rear spar, in accordance with Airbus Industrie Service Bulletin A300&hyph;57&hyph;6017, dated November 22, 1993.

(1) For airplanes that have accumulated 17,300 total landings or less as of the effective date of this AD: Inspect prior to the accumulation of 17,300 total landings, or within 1,500 landings after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later. (2) For airplanes that have accumulated 17,301 or more total landings, but less than 19,300 total landings as of the effective date of this AD: Inspect within 1,500 landings after the effective date of this AD.

(i) For airplanes having MSN 465 through 553 inclusive: Repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 11,800 landings. (ii) For airplanes having MSN 252 through 464 inclusive: Repeat the inspection within 10,700 landings following the initial inspection required by paragraph (a) of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 7,500 landings. (c) If any crack is found during the inspection required by paragraph (a) of this AD, prior to further flight, accomplish the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this AD, as applicable. (1) For airplanes on which Airbus Industrie Modification 07716 has not been accomplished: Accomplish the applicable repair requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this AD.

(ii) If the crack measures more than 1mm, repair in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. (2) For airplanes on which Airbus Industrie Modification 07716 has been accomplished: Repair in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. After repair, repeat the inspections as required by paragraph (b) of this AD at the applicable schedule specified in that paragraph. (d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;112.
