A great many different things are being said in Moscow today about Yerevan. That street warfare is taking place there. That people are dropping on the sidewalks in full daylight from hunger. That they have chopped down all the trees and are burning the wood in their stoves. As an eyewitness and direct participant in Yerevan life, let me testify that life is not horrible in the city. Bombs are not exploding in the streets, although entirely peaceful border regions just a few dozen kilometers away (on the border with Azerbaijan) are indeed subjected to bombardment almost daily, and one can sometimes hear cannon fire in the very suburbs of the Armenian capital. People are not dropping on the sidewalks en masse from hunger, although there are hunger-caused fainting spells--the menu of the average Yerevan resident, living statistically on 80 cents a month (!), would certainly elicit shock even from the citizen of Russia, who has seen quite a bit himself. The shooting on the streets is no more frequent than in Moscow, and "this shooting is not of the military variety, but results from business disputes, or in the most extreme cases--from 'internal political' disagreement." What is indeed strange is the fact that one can quietly get on a bus in the morning, or stop by a large department store or the marketplace, and wind up leaving it under military escort, finding oneself a couple of hours later at some military unit under full military gear, with the most "unforeseeable consequences" in store for the near future. This is the original procedure we now have for effecting the spring call-up of our green youth and "reservists." And we thought certain methods of "social work" had been relegated to the past. No way--Homo soveticus is today alive and well! Then too, our life in Yerevan has certain quite evident advantages. Consider "Herbalife," for example--an expensive deal, and not without its side effects, they say, especially judging from the intensity of the advertisements. In Yerevan, all these contrivances are unnecessary. Weight-watcher groups are operating quite effectively and have a clientele totalling just about a million people. I have tried them myself. In just over a year on one of these diets, your correspondent managed to lose almost 20 kilograms, moving out of two sizes--first "super-large," then "large." And there were no ill effects, by the way. Or consider the "Running Staircase" training apparatus. It occupies first place on the list of American home sports equipment. Incidentally, this machine costs fifteen hundred bucks. And it has never occurred to the Americans that they could save this entire amount--you just have to find a friend on the 15th or 16th floor of any city high-rise and walk up the stairs to visit him every day. Or you could move to this floor yourself and not use the elevator--not because there is no electricity, but purely for exercise. You get precisely the desired effect--this too I have tried myself. Yerevan residents have an advantage here that no amount of bucks elsewhere can provide--they often have to make this trip upstairs in pitch darkness, with a candle, sometimes carrying a bucket of water, which naturally enhances the physical training effect.... In short, we are surviving. To understand just how, read the following and judge for yourself. What Do We Smell in the Smoke of the Motherland? According to a variety of estimates, more than 300,000 people left Armenia last year alone. It is not difficult to conjecture what this means for the 3 million living in the republic. Last winter (1993), one could smell anything and everything in the "smoke of the Motherland." At that time we had virtually the first Yerevan winter since the beginning of the blockade WITHOUT ANYTHING--no light, gas, heat, fuel, regular food.... Yerevan residents were not quite ready for this, and they burned everything they managed to come across in the pot-belly stoves placed in window apertures. You cannot imagine what "went up in smoke"--issues of OGONEK carefully saved up until now along with post-perestroyka materials on the history of Russia that people were unfamiliar with. They shredded NOVYY MIR, with Solzhenitsyn and other lamenting emigrants, to feed the stove. They burned tire covers, footwear, old clothing--just to be able to warm up, boil a little water.... This winter (1994), those who remained in Yerevan waved good-bye to everything and as summer passed stocked up on their supply of decent stoves and, most importantly, of anything that could be burned in them. Not a single piece of paper, packet, or box of matches was discarded at home. And vehicles carrying kerosene and firewood came into the cities. The firewood was sometimes "locally produced," sometimes "imported." The authorities quickly assessed the situation and prohibited local chopping of wood. The price of a cubic meter of firewood then jumped to $45 as early as the end of autumn, reached $70 at the start of winter, then in the severe cold reached $80-$120 for a cubic meter of split wood. The meager ration (mainly of bread and culinary products contrived from it that are rather strange to the outsider, potatoes, and cereal) is perhaps not so bad for adults watching their weight, but is of course entirely unsuitable for children. And indeed, in no way can all Armenian families purchase even a little firewood or kerosene, since the true average wage in Armenia is no greater than 350 drams--this winter this was on the order of $1.50. As a result, as springtime approached hundreds of people found themselves on the brink of physical exhaustion and psychologically stressed. Many decided they would throw everything away and leave. Restless lines of refugees with their belongings stretched around the train stations and airports, in numbers greater than the emigration waves during the days of genocide. We sometimes hear that it is not 300,000, but rather 800,000 who left--which we would greatly like to believe is an exaggeration. The prospects are entirely real, however: One more winter like that, and the flight from Armenia of her own people--desperate, at breakneck speed--will take on truly catastrophic proportions, with entirely predictable consequences. There are precedents, unfortunately. In neighboring Turkey, just a few dozen kilometers from Yerevan, stretches a vast, woeful wasteland with the ruins and skeletons of majestic Christian temples, of Ani, capital of the ancient, powerful Armenian kingdom, whose people were forced into exile. Today no one lives here or in the fairly large territory adjoining the former capital city. From time to time Kurdish herdsmen drive their livestock here to graze. The task of halting the flight of Armenia's own people out of the country is today acquiring the scope of a task of state proportions. There are various ways of accomplishing it, the least productive of which are debates resounding from the rostrums of diverse levels of pomp and authority. The most productive consist of direct material assistance to the families who reside today in Armenia. Who in the Final Analysis Are the Greater Capitalists--the "Misters" or the "Comrades"? The political picture of Armenia is striking today in its diversity.... and in the virtual indifference of its main figures and groups to the true crisis situation that has taken shape in the republic. At the same time, entrepreneurs are emerging in the political arena. And it probably should be this way. Because it is they who are today feeding the country to a significant degree, delivering assortments of essential products and consumer goods, while the state specializes only in bread, throwing out a stick of butter or package of sugar or cereal from time to time to the starving consumer. It is the entrepreneurs who are penetrating the blockade and delivering their goods to those regions that are engulfed in flame. It is they who are the first real doves of peace negotiations--insofar as methods of people's diplomacy, tried and true, bring trade to the border regions, and do so rather successfully. So it is. In this situation you would not even wish your enemy to be positioned on today's Armenian political Mount Olympus. But he who is there is forced to tow the mark. More than a dozen parliamentary party factions and groups sit there and defend their factional interests session after session with a stubbornness that could be put to far better use. Thus, a situation fairly traditional for the CIS countries has today taken shape in Armenia, in which the standing of the main political forces is not simply poor--the very concept of "political party" elicits an unambiguous negative reaction from residents. Against this background (also characteristic of many regions of the CIS), the communists have received definite dividends, simply as a certain homogeneous group evoking nostalgic memories in many people of the Soviet way of life. But even these gourmet feelings are not strong enough to justify serious discussion of any enhanced standing of the Communist Party in Armenia. In contrast to most other regions of the CIS, there are in Armenia the so-called "traditional" parties, i.e., entirely real political forces which, during the period when the single-party system reigned in the USSR, existed, developed, and replenished their ranks and influence in the Armenian diaspora. Following certain events, they simply "moved" to local territory--to Armenia. Two main parties are worthy of note when discussing traditional Armenian parties--the "Ramkavar," or liberal democrats (in no way to be confused with the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]--two very different entities), and "Dashnaktsutyun"--a socialist-oriented Armenian party whose members address one another through conviction as "comrade," no less. A contradiction has arisen here on the question of the anticrisis programs of these parties, referred to in this section's heading. The "Ramkavar" propose introduction of a state monopoly on trade in bread and gasoline as a top-priority anticrisis measure, an extremely prudent step most likely under today's conditions. You would have to agree, however, that this is quite reminiscent of the "regular goals of the Soviet power." While the "Dashnaks" are fighting quite energetically from the rostrums of parliament and elsewhere to rule out any kind of arbitrary state rule. Although they are "comrades." You go sort it out. Nonetheless, in the "still, deep waters" in which the Armenian political Mount Olympus presently finds itself, today's social atmosphere is fraught with the danger that the prudent and kindly Armenian people will suddenly get fed up with tolerating the standard-of-living travesty that reigns today, and then we may see quite a sudden end to lawful measures and slogans. It is extremely difficult to conjecture which political doctrine will suddenly capture the multitude.... God forbid we should turn into such a multitude, even for as little as a day. If only because the multitude and war are already extremely dangerous political neighbors.... How Do You Live on R800 a Month? An interesting question, of course. But it is in no way rhetorical. It is precisely that--800 Russian rubles, converted to 176 drams--which today constitutes the minimum wage in Armenia. Here it must be taken into account that, in the judgment of independent experts, the minimum food-product consumer basket in Armenia costs 4,293 drams! In other words, a citizen who has the misfortune to be living on the minimum wage receives just 2.5 percent of the amount he himself needs (not including his family!)--and this is only for food. But the average citizen, statistically speaking, who receives 350 drams, acquires barely 5 percent of the minimum basket containing the nourishment required by the life form known as Homo sapiens. But in real life everything is not all that horrible--albeit quite severe, of course. Many urban residents have started up little gardens right in the city or have parcels of land. In the Armenian countryside, where people have full ownership of the land and have always been famous for efficient management, life is self-contained. The city-dweller is also aided by commercial structures, where the pay reaches the "unbelievable" amount of 3,000-4,000 drams (or, converted to Russian currency, on the order of R20,000 a month). In this regard, the average price index in Yerevan is 1.3-1.5 times greater than corresponding prices in Russia. In other words, everything in Armenia (and I am referring not to delicacies, but rather to the most basic products) costs approximately one-and-a-half times more. But naturally, not many people are receiving a wage of 3,000-4,000 drams--not the majority, in any case. This is VERY high pay according to local standards. Even the president receives less--his salary of 12 times the minimum wage comes to just over 2,000 drams. Thus, only 5-10 percent of the populace are able to permit themselves such basic products as butter, cheese, sausage, and eggs. The remainder must content themselves with bread and cereal. Then there is a factor of special alarm for the future. As a result of the sharp reduction in purchasing power of the populace, many entrepreneurs who are bringing commodities into the republic are taking losses and being forced to dump their products. If a person receives a monthly wage sufficient to buy 1 kilogram of sugar--please tell me, what kind of consumer can he be?! And what kind of purchasing power is there? Especially since in Armenia, according to unofficial data, there are over 80,000 unemployed, of whom only a few thousand are registered with the labor exchange with the right to unemployment compensation. So if you take into account the fact that winter supplies have now run out for many people in Armenia--supplies purchased some time ago, at the old, more acceptable prices, more than 50 percent of the republic's population is threatened with starvation. This is how we are living.

We should also not be hasty, if only because we have yet to come to terms with property relations in the Republic of Armenia," stated Vladimir Starikov, counselor and minister of the Russian Federation Embassy in the Republic of Armenia, in a conversation with this correspondent. [Vartanyan] Vladimir Stepanovich, there have been persistent rumors in Armenia recently to the effect that just about half of Armenia has already obtained Russian citizenship or stood in line at the embassy for this purpose. Is this true? [Starikov] Rumors to the effect that 300,000-400,000 people have already obtained Russian citizenship are untrue. Our technical capabilities would not permit it, for one thing (only three staff members are working at the consular section of the embassy--they simply would not be able to examine and draw up such a quantity of documents). From 80 to 100 cases at most can be handled per week. As of this moment, just over 2,000 residents of the Republic of Armenia have obtained Russian citizenship. The waiting list is such that processing will not be completed until August of 1995. [Vartanyan] How do you view the legal status of these newly emerged citizens of Russia--people who have USSR passports at present (insofar as the Law on Citizenship has not yet been adopted in the Republic of Armenia) and who reside in Armenia? [Starikov] The main problem here lies in the fact that the question of dual citizenship has not been resolved. Therefore, persons who obtain Russian citizenship and who presently reside in Armenia may find themselves in the status of foreigner in their own country--unless otherwise stipulated by Armenian law. We will explain this in detail to persons who come to us for information on the question of obtaining Russian citizenship, and we will also explain that Russian citizenship provides no advantages to people residing in the Republic of Armenia. Quite the contrary: Foreigners everywhere have a status somewhat different from citizens. Those who desire to obtain Russian citizenship all the same--will obtain it. [Vartanyan] On what legal basis? [Starikov] The registration procedure currently in effect for obtaining Russian citizenship was introduced by the Russian Federation Law on Citizenship, which entered into force 6 February 1992. This procedure is effective for a three-year period. Citizens of Armenia will mainly be interested in point "g" of Article 18 of this law. According to this article, Russian Federation citizenship is afforded to former Soviet citizens, including residents of Armenia, who possess USSR passports. [Vartanyan] A fact is a fact--the lines at the Russian Embassy in Armenia are becoming longer and more persistent.... [Starikov] We even used the opportunity of a recent interview in a republic newspaper to appeal to people desiring to acquire Russian citizenship, telling them not to resort to illegal activities, not to exert pressure on consular section employees in an attempt to speed up the application process. [Vartanyan] How do you personally see the striving of a large number of people to leave Armenia, to sever ties with the locations where they have long resided? [Starikov] I believe that everyone should think twice before applying at the consular section. We must not be ruled by the emotions of the moment. There are problems in Russia too, and they will be all the greater for people starting out there with nothing. We have to try to resolve our problems here, where we live. Russia cannot accept everybody.
