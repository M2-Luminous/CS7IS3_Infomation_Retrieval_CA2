She gave an interview following talks between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who had met while their presidents conferred elsewhere in the Kremlin. According to Sidorova, Kozyrev and Christopher had finalized four documents for signing "at ministerial level," in particular agreements on air traffic, on cooperation in health care an biomedical research, on cooperation in research in radiation impact on human health and environment and a memorandum of intent on cooperation in expert control. She noted that Kozyrev and Christopher would also make a joint statement on the Middle East. According to Sidorova, Kozyrev and Christopher also discussed the January 14 meeting of the Russian, U.S. and Ukrainian presidents. "We are confident that this meeting will culminate in signing documents on the nuclear weapons stationed in Ukraine. Kozyrev observed, however, that making sure that the documents are implemented was even more important," Sidorova said. She also told Interfax that Kozyrev and Christopher had a thorough talk on the results of the Brussels NATO summit. "The Russian foreign minister emphasized that Moscow regarded the Partnership for Peace program as an invitation for partnership and tangible cooperation with that organization rather than staying in its ante-room," Sidorova said. In her words, the most important item in that program for Russia was actual cooperation in military exercises and adjustment of military doctrines. "It would be premature to say now where this will lead to, whether Russia and other East European countries will join NATO or NATO and all of us will become a broader European security organization," the foreign minister's adviser said.
