Professor and Doctor of Engineering H. Maier says what we lack is quick pilot production. VDI-N, Aachen, 15 Oct 93. They are still lurking as likely machine elements with properties yet unknown to many engineers. This can change, however, because ceramic bearings are ideal for numerous applications where conditions are extreme. They feature a high thermal stability and an extremely high corrosion resistance, and do not always require lubrication. Owing to the special properties of the material, ceramic bearings are bound to be eventually used where heretofore conventional antifriction bearings cannot be used as, for instance, in chemical reactor vessels. "The demand for ceramic bearings will grow," Grad. Eng. Matthias Popp is convinced, "wherever not only environmental compatibility, durability, and maintenance-friendly operation but also energy consumption and availability of the material are the principal considerations." As business manager of the Wemhoener & Popp enterprise in Herzogenrath near Aachen, which designs and manufactures antifriction bearings from purchased ceramic raw material, he is since 1989 active in this new and very innovative market. Users are meanwhile still very skeptical about this new high-performance material, which has the reputation of crumbling upon the slightest touch. What is commonly called brittleness Prof. Dr. Horst Maier, director of the Institute of Ceramic Components in Machine Construction (IKKM) at the RWTH Aachen, calls "limited ductility." The vocabulary used here makes it quite clear that, up to a certain limit, the ceramic material can display all its advantages while maintaining its extremely high shape stability. "This limit is not reached under the specific load for which a machine element has been designed", explains Professor Maier and he adds: "For many years we have been making the mistake of letting only specialists in fracture mechanics deal with ceramic materials. They can tell us precisely indeed when something will break to pieces, but in modern ceramic technology we are concerned about reliability rather than about probability of fracture." Professor Maier sees an essential task for the IKKM to be seeking new applications for "his" material. For the purpose of a still more effective collaboration with the industry, there was in 1990 established the Institute of Ceramic Processing and Application Engineering (IPAK). Unlike in classical research and development, areas of applications in IKKM and in IPAK are not subdivided into those pertaining to machine construction or processing technology. The director explains the operation of his Institute as follows: "We analyze our applications for the ceramic material on the basis of its properties so as to subsequently identify those utilizing, for instance, its small specific gravity or shape stability". As a specific example, still in the development stage, he cites the possibility of using a ceramic material in a blast furnace, where materials must be extremely heat-resistant at temperatures up to 1300�C. Steel stokers, until recently used in these furnaces, require cooling. Owing to the high heat, not only the water and energy consumption is high but so is also the CO[.sup]2[/] emission. These economic and ecologic drawbacks can be overcome by use of ceramic stokers which, because of their heat resistance, require no cooling and thus eliminate the need for a coolant circulation loop and the intensive maintenance thereof. Except for a few classical applications, such as those where temperatures are high, wear is a significant factor in chemical apparatus, or in filters. For potential users, use of this ceramic material as a structural one still remains worthwhile in discovering unknown territory. "I view myself somewhat as a trail blazer intent on setting things in motion", says Professor Maier. "We bring the partners to the table for a regularly ongoing `target ceramics' research and application forum. We carry on educational activity concerning application possibilities for the ceramic material, we are laying out the theory while also showing practical examples which include finished products." Professor Maier assesses the research and production status in Germany. "In the area of structural ceramics our chances are now very good." In the area of functional ceramics as for sensors or chip carriers, he says, "We just have missed the boat. Japan is leading here by having better coordinated research and manufacture." Actually the manufacturers operate with an overcapacity, asserts Professor Maier. "What we lack is quick pilot production, considering that flexibility in production of small lots is needed for helping the user innovate." In this way it would be possible to develop new areas of advancement. These include sliding ring seals for pumps and compressors as well as unlubricated antifriction bearings for the food industry. The pace at which ceramic bearings are marketed is slow, but not so much because of manufacturing engineering problems. "Testing was discontinued not because of the intricacy of the bearing manufacturing process," Matthias Popp offers a background explanation, "but because we were not quite clear about the actual market potential." In his opinion, the mistake was focusing on replacement of steel bearings instead of seeking new applications for the ceramic material. Popp knows not only the advantages and disadvantages of ceramic material but also the problems of customers in the chemical apparatus, machine construction, and processing technology sectors. "The best applications for totally ceramic bearings are found foremost in chemical technology and biotechnology where they will operate hermetically sealed from the environment and run in aggressive media such as acids, lyes, or liquid synthetics and thus where use of conventional metal bearings is out of question." Ceramic bearings made by Wemhoener & Popp from silicon nitride and zirconium oxide as raw materials can withstand temperatures up to above 1000�C. They also remain corrosion-resistant in almost all media and are extremely wear-resistant owing to their quite appreciable 80 Rockwell C hardness. "Steel bearings require grease or oil lubrication and, therefore, cannot be placed in chemical reactor vessels where they would contaminate the reaction product." Popp does not hesitate to compare them with ceramic bearings which, on the contrary, could become lubricated by the processed medium such as fruit juice and therefore could enjoy a long life even without an added lubricant. He adds that "these ceramic bearings also run lighter than conventional antifriction bearings, owing to a 40% smaller friction coefficient." With a specific weight 60% lower than that of steel, they are also ideal for light-weight structure. Last but not least, a fully ceramic bearing is nonmagnetic and dielectric. "Ceramic bearings are today made almost exclusively of hot isostatically pressed silicon nitride (HIPSN), because of the homogeneous structure of this material," explains the bearings expert, "because hardness is very important as far as antifriction bearings are concerned." In comparison with high-alloy steels such as 100 Cr6, for example, HIPSN is with a 1,500-1,700 DPH 0.5-kg number more than twice as hard. The hardness is retained at temperatures up to 800� and decreases only very slowly at still higher temperatures. At the same time, however, making harder materials also means a more elaborate treatment. For this the Aachen producers of antifriction bearings use modern CNC grinding center wheels which most often carry diamond bits so as to ensure the necessary precision. A sensor touches the treated surface continuously throughout the grinding operation, the operation then being automatically terminated as soon as the desired finish has been attained. The result of this treatment is a high-precision product: antifriction bearings with dimensions deviating less than 4 �m from nominal, the race length deviating only 0.2 �m maximum, and the race width deviating only 1 gmm maximum. Not only in chemical technology can ceramic material be used under extreme conditions. This high-tech material is also invading everyday life. For example, ceramic antifriction bearings in the bicycle hub shown here ensure maintenance-friendly light running. Photograph by Wemhoener & Popp.
