At the 9 June hearings of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific of the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state, made the threatening remarks that the United States could impose military sanctions on our country. He expressed that the U.S. basic position, that it does not rule out military sanctions against North Korea, had not changed. He also repeatedly babbled [chwechossumnida] that if the UN Security Council failed to pass a resolution on sanctions, independent [tokchajok] sanctions outside the United Nations would be possible. He even openly stated that no DPRK-U.S. talks could take place unless we accepted the International Atomic Energy Agency's unjust demands. In the 10 June telephone conversation with South Korean puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam, U.S. President Clinton had a conspiracy discussion [mouihago] on imposing multinational sanctions outside the United Nations and disclosed a plan to strengthen the U.S. Forces in South Korea on a large scale, including the early deployment of quick reaction forces. Meanwhile, the Rimpac-94 joint military exercise, conducted off the coast of Hawaii, a comprehensive combat training, scheduled to last for approximately one week, began on 10 June. In reporting on this, Japan's SANKEI SHIMBUN notes that this exercise is conducted with the United States, Japan, and South Korea posing as a group and confronting the enemy side and that this U.S.-Japan-South Korea joint exercise, the first of its kind, is intended to step up their threat against our country. The newspaper reveals that U.S. aircraft carriers Independence and Constellation, which had been participating in the Rimpac-94 joint military exercise, would immediately be headed for the waters close to the Korean peninsula after concluding the exercise.
