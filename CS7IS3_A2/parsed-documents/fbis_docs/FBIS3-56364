Follows the full text of his toast: "Mr. President, Mrs. Clinton, dear guests, ladies and gentlemen, I think you will agree with me in saying that these last days brought a special meaning to our life and activity. The world is watching the events in Russia. Amid the stormy political developments which dominate Moscow's current life, the visit of the president of the United States of America nonetheless attracted particularly close attention. Our meeting testifies to the fact that Russia is concerned not only with its own problems, but feels itself an integral part of the world community, and shares in the world's anxieties and hopes. Time flies unbelievably fast during official visits. Literally all of the available time is scheduled, and we, Mr. President, have succeeded in making the utmost use of every minute. The key is not only in the fact that the visit was thoroughly prepared in advance. Most importantly, both the Russian and American sides had a sincere desire to reach a mutual understanding and give our partnership a new, global scope. Each of our discussions with President Clinton was direct and honest. We spoke about the most important problems and didn't shun acute issues, looking for unconventional solutions to them. This, I believe, is the way of both the Russian and American peoples. The ground-breaking results of the Russian-American summit in Moscow are not the only reason why this day is important. Russia celebrates January 14 as the first day of the New Year, according to the Russian Orthodox calendar. We have always observed this day, even in the hardest times. In line with Russian tradition, I would like to wish our American guests and all those present good health and well-being in the new year. The year that has begun is new for Russia in every sense of the word. The country has entered this year with a new constitution which meets modern, civilized standards. The Federal Assembly, elected by free and democratic vote, has begun its work. In these past elections, the citizens of Russia reaffirmed their commitment to internal peace and stability, democracy, and Russia's renewal. Along with this, it is as clear as always that all developments in Russia are of vital importance for the whole world. Now we need to be sincerely supportive of each other's success, since the resolution of Russia's problems is a key factor in achieving global stability and confirming the basic values of the modern world. It is not enough to mouth these values. It is necessary to bring one's actions into line with them in order to achieve tangible results. Only then will the recognition of these values in every country lead to the success of the entire world community. Life in a free and democratic society must be better both for the common people of every single nation, and for the whole world community. This is not only about upholding ideals, but also about providing people with everything necessary for a worthy life. This goal cannot be attained without pooling our efforts, without defining our partnership in practical terms. Together we shall overcome. To me, this famous phrase means that only together can we ensure the triumph of freedom everywhere in the world and, most importantly, in the hearts of the people who live in it. We appreciate the active role played by the present U.S. Administration in mobilising international support for Russian reforms. But of course, we would welcome the further intensification of these efforts. Economic interaction is now moving to the centre of the Russian-American partnership in all its diversity. It is necessary to speed up the implementation of the Tokyo Accords. It is very important for us to have a respite in repaying our external debt. We want fair access to the American and world markets, an expansion of trade and investments, and assistance to Russia in creating the infrastructure needed for a civilized market economy. Ever more people in our countries are now keeping an eye on the rouble exchange rate against the dollar and the dynamics of stocks and shares on exchange markets in Moscow and New York. This is an encouraging sign of our transition to a normal, civilized financial system. I can say more: For the first time, it is now becoming possible to form long-term, diversified links between our two economies. This is a reliable foundation on which to build our strategic partnership. The prospect of creating a free trade zone between the two countries deserves special attention. On the whole, a variety of bilateral ties between Russia and the United States is now being actively developed. The Russian-American dialogue is increasingly centering around relatively new problems, including the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery-vehicles, regional arms races, as well as outbursts of nationalism and other kinds of extremism. All this does not mean, of course, that there are no problems in the Russian-American relationship. But the main thing is that both we and the Americans consider the solution to these problems attainable through dialogue in which both sides are equally interested and which is based on commonality of our long-term national interests. In closing, I would like to recall the words of the far-sighted traveller and thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, who wrote more than 150 years ago that there are two great nations in the world at present, which began their movement from different starting points, but seem to be progressing towards the same objective. I mean the Russians and the Americans. Their origin is different, and their paths are dissimilar, but nevertheless both appear to be among God's chosen nations. History has offered us a unique chance to realize the full potential of partnership and friendship between our two great states. Democratic Russia is ready to make full use of this potential. Permit me to propose a toast to the health of the President of the United States and his wife and to the well-being and prosperity of the American and Russian peoples."
