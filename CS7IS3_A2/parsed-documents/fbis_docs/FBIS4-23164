He is not doctrinaire except on the issue of defence force standards. For a man labelled a hardliner he has shown a remarkable capacity for flexibility. The "reality" to which he refers constantly is about cold assessment, not the heated passion of ideology. Yet his reconciliation with the ANC, his transformation from hawk to dove, after years of full-blooded confrontation is one of the miracles of transition. A clue to how this leopard changed his spots to win the confidence of his former enemies is in the first lines of a ground- breaking paper he presented in November, setting out his vision for the future of the defence force. "It is a reality that if one does not plan one's own future that someone else may do it for you and you may not like what you eventually get," he said. The paper, emphasising legitimacy, high standards of preparedness within a non-threatening posture, acceptance of integration and commitment to national development helped settle the controversy around his appointment to succeed General Kat Liebenberg as Chief of the SADF [South Africa Defense Force]. There was never any doubt that General Meiring is ideally qualified. His 30-year experience is unusually broad, and it was accepted that he commanded the loyalty of the SADF and could be counted on to pull it through what was widely expected to be a turbulent and violent election. The distrust was understandable. The NP [National Party] had tainted the SADF's protestations of no political allegiances by keeping it in reserve, out of negotiations. It was perceived as the white minority's ace in the hole. These perceptions of partiality were underlined by General Meiring himself. In a series of unsubstantiated allegations about MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe; Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] plots and in his outright resistance to integration of MK into the SADF he stood against the ANC. Part of the miracle is the speed with which trust has developed between General Meiring and Mr Joe Modise, the new Defence Minister. Direct contact between the SADF and Umkhonto we Sizwe was forbidden until April last year. In taking the job in the face of Mr Modise's plans to establish a civilian department of defence which will be responsible for policy, personnel and finance, General Meiring has tacitly accepted that his power will be diluted. Georg Lodewyk Meiring was born in Ladybrand, in the [Orange] Free State platteland, on October 18, 1939. His five-year service contract will keep him employed past the usual defence force retirement age of 55. General Meiring's advisers refused to allow an interview for this profile, but a handful of his past and present general-staff colleagues were prepared to discuss Meiring the man on condition that they were not identified. All seized on his scientific background -- he received an MSc (physics) from the University of the Free State in 1962 -- and his military origins in signals as key factors in his development. "His only problem is that he is a signaller," said a headquarters colleague. "It is always a challenge for someone who does not come from a fighting arm, infantry, to take command. It just isn't done. "His strength is that he is a realist, a soldier who appreciates that you can only achieve limited objectives by military action. "The fact that he was given a fighting command in South West (Africa) from 1983 and stayed until 1987 is an indication that Constand Viljoen and Jannie Geldenhuys had discovered somebody special in Georg Meiring. He was being groomed from the early days." He is a challenging taskmaster. "He tends to think like a scientist, he does things systematically and he expects the same from his subordinates," said one of his advisers. "He tends to be quite far ahead of anybody speaking to him. Sometimes it's most distracting. If you are talking rubbish he knows it long before you do. "He is not one of those people who thinks he knows it all, but if he does appreciate something you have done he is a bit shy about revealing it. "He is not a relaxable kind of person. There is always some tension about him. Even when I socialise with him I am always sitting on the edge of my chair." A rare glimpse of gentleness behind the steely facade is revealed in a long letter replying to a 14-year-old student's request for personal details from his hero. "If you accept challenges, believe in yourself and in God, you will make a success of your career," General Meiring told the lad. Soothing the boy's fears, General Meiring wrote: "It is wrong to speak of the `new South Africa'. There will be changes in the political and legal terrain, but this does not mean we will find ourselves in a new land. "We in the army realised a few years ago that there would be changes in our land. We could have ignored the signals, behaved passively and hoped for the best. We felt that was not what we should do." These are the words of a pragmatist. As the defence buckles down to historic change, he will see it through, even if it was not of his choosing. General Georg Meiring will do his duty.
