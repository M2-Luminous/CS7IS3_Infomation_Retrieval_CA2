Accordingly, there is doubt whether North Korea will really use them as scrap material. North Korea had said some time ago that it was importing used submarines from Russia to use as scrap metal. The paper reported today that the Russian submarines which will be exported to North Korea (?are anchored) at (?Novik) Bay in Vladivostok, and that a North Korean high-ranking naval officer was involved in negotiations between North Korea and Russia regarding submarine transactions. The paper also reported that because of the North Korean naval officer's participation in negotiations on submarine transactions, there are doubts whether North Korea will really use them as scrap metal as it stated.
