FBIS4-20553 "jpest008___94049" JPRS-EST-94-008 JPRS Science & Technology Europe/International Economic Competitiveness 22 February 1994 WEST EUROPE EUROPE-ASIA RELATIONS UK: Honda Announces Complete Withdrawal From Rover UK: Honda Announces Complete Withdrawal From Rover 93P60168 Paris LE MONDE in French 22 Feb 94 p 20 93P60168 Paris LE MONDE French CSO [Text] In a 21 February announcement in Tokyo, Honda confirmed its intention to withdraw the 20 percent share it held in Rover's capital. This announcement has been made during the discussions begun on the same morning between BMW's CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder and his Hoda counterpart Nibuhiko Kawamoto.Since the announcement of the sale by Rover to BMW of the 80 percent previously owned by Airbus, Honda did not hide its dissatisfaction. The Japanese manufacturer, Rover's partner since 1979, considers itself visibly betrayed. Therefore, the announcement on Monday, 21 February, expressing the company's intention to withdraw from Rover's capital, did not come as a surprise. The consequences of this position industrially and commercially may be quite risky, since Honda has not been just a financial partner (to Rover) but an industrial ally as well. Thus, this collaboration has to be renegotiated also. In the future--the announcement stated--we will reexamine the diverse technical contracts with Rover. Until now, Honda's policies in Europe have been based on this collaboration with Rover. In the future, we intend to set up independent production units (solely) through our own resources. Up to the present, Rover has been producing for Honda some vehicles (the Concerto model in particular) intended for the European market, while Honda had conceived severel models of the Rover series, the Rover 200, 400, 800, and the new Rover 600. Beyond this, the Japanese manufacturer had supplied the British company with several strategic components, such as gear boxes. The cooperation extended also to commercial interests; in Japan Honda has been selling the 4x4 Land Rover Discovery model under its own trade mark.The renegociation of agreements existing between the two firms could profoundly disrupt Rover's production.
