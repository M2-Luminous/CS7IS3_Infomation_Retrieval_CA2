FR940110-1-00007 FR940110-1-00001 WQIP means the Water Quality Incentive Projects authorized under the ACP. WQIP Agreement means the program agreement including the applicable water quality resource management plan entered into between ASCS and the participant. Such agreement shall set forth the terms and conditions for participation in the WQIP pursuant to this part. §701.4 Restriction on program eligibility. The regulations in part 796 of this chapter prohibiting the making of payments to program participants who harvest or knowingly permit to be harvested for illegal use, marijuana or other such prohibited drug-producing plants on any part of the land owned or controlled by such program participants are applicable to these programs. §701.5 Practice specifications. (a) Minimum specifications that practices must satisfy to be eligible for cost-share assistance shall be set forth in the county program within the authority established by the STC and Deputy Administrator, State and County Operations (DASCO) or incorporated by specific reference to a standard publication or other written document containing such specifications. (b) Practice specifications shall represent the minimum levels of performance needed in order for the practice to be effective in meeting the program objective. Cost-share assistance shall be limited to these minimum levels. §701.6 Responsibility for referred technical phases of practices. The SCS and the FS are responsible for technical phases of practices as assigned and such assignment will be specified in State and county programs. (a) The SCS State Conservationist may use the expertise from private consultants, State, or Federal agencies in performing the assigned responsibilities if SCS certifies that assigned practices are completed properly. No responsibilities will be assigned for counties when DASCO and the Chief, SCS, determine that it would not be administratively practicable for the SCS to discharge such responsibilities. In such counties, these responsibilities shall be assumed by COC's. The SCS may utilize resources of the State forestry agencies in performing assigned responsibilities for practices involving the establishment of windbreaks or shelterbelts on farmland to prevent wind erosion. (b) The FS is responsible for the technical phases of practices or components of practices involving the planting of trees for forestry purposes and those involving the improving or protecting of a stand of forest trees as specified in State and county programs. The FS may use the assistance of private consultants, State, or Federal agencies in performing these assigned responsibilities if FS certifies that assigned practices are completed properly; however, services of State forestry agencies will be used to the extent that such services are available. §701.7 Items of cost on which rates of cost-share assistance may be based. Except as otherwise provided by ASCS, the cost of any direct and significant factor in the performance of a practice may be considered in establishing the rate of cost-share assistance for the practice. §701.8 Repair, upkeep, and maintenance of practices. Cost-share assistance shall not be authorized for repairs or for normal upkeep or maintenance of any practice. §701.9 Public benefits when installing practices. Persons responsible for any aspect of performing practices shall install the practices to promote public benefits by: (a) Improving or preserving environmental quality and ecological balance by preventing or abating pollution and other environmental degradation; (b) Benefiting the community by such means as preserving open space or enhancing the appearance of the area; (c) Benefiting wildlife and other desirable life forms; (d) Preserving historic, archeological, or scenic sites, wetlands, ecologically critical areas, and prime farmlands; (e) Avoiding the creation of hazards to persons or animals; and (f) Avoiding actions that may adversely affect an endangered or threatened species or flood plains. §701.10 Payments for uncompleted practices. Cost-share assistance approved under these programs shall not be considered earned until all components of the approved practice are completed according to applicable specifications and program provisions. Cost-share assistance for completed components of an approved practice may be paid only on the condition that the eligible participant will complete the remaining components of the practice within the time prescribed by the COC regardless of whether cost-share assistance is offered for them unless the COC subsequently determines they are prevented from doing so because of reasons beyond their control. §701.11 Practices involving the establishment or improvement of vegetative cover. (a) Costs may be shared even though an adequate stand is not established, for practices involving the establishment or improvement of vegetative cover, including trees, if the COC determines, according to standards approved by the STC, that the practice was carried out in a manner which could normally result in the establishment of an adequate stand and that failure to establish an adequate stand was due to weather or other conditions beyond the control of the participant. The COC may require, as a condition of cost-share assistance in such cases, that the area be reseeded or replanted or that other needed protective measures be performed. Cost-share assistance in such cases may also be approved for repeat applications of measures previously performed or for additional eligible measures. Cost-share assistance for such measures may be approved to the extent such measures are needed to ensure an adequate stand even though the measures may be less than that required by the applicable practice wording for initial approvals. (b) In the case of FIP, replanting of trees is required where the landowner received cost-share assistance for site preparation. §701.12 Failure to meet minimum requirements or failure to comply fully with program provisions. (a) Notwithstanding other provisions of these programs, costs may be shared for performance actually rendered even though the minimum requirements for a practice are not satisfied, if the participant establishes to the satisfaction of the COC and the county representative of any other agency having responsibility for technical phases of the practice that a reasonable effort was made to satisfy the minimum requirements and that the practice as performed adequately solves the need for the practice.
