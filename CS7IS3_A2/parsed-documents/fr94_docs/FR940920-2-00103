FR940920-2-00103 FR940920-2-00054 Staff Meetings Open to the Public; Final Policy Statement AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Final policy statement. SUMMARY: This statement presents the policy that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff will follow in opening meetings between the NRC staff and one or more outside persons to public observation. This policy statement also announces central agency services available to the public for obtaining schedules for the staff meetings that are open to public attendance. Implementing guidance will be issued to the NRC staff as a management directive. The policy statement relates only to meetings involving the NRC staff and does not affect existing regulations that apply to public attendance at meetings such as Commission meetings, advisory committee meetings, and enforcement conferences. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Management Directive 3.5 and copies of comments received on the proposed policy statement are available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L St., NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Donnie H. Grimsley, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555&hyph;0001, telephone: (301) 504&hyph;1881. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The NRC first published its policy for open staff meetings in the Federal Register on June 28, 1978 (43 FR 28058). On September 14, 1993 (58 FR 48080), the NRC published for public comment a proposed policy statement entitled ``Staff Meetings Open to the Public'' in the Federal Register that would supersede the policy statement of 1978 (58 FR 48080). The NRC requested comments on the proposed policy statement and on comments submitted previously by the American Mining Congress that were made in response to an interim NRC policy statement similar to the policy statement that was proposed. II. Summary of Public Comments on the Proposed Policy Statement and NRC Responses General Comments In late 1993, the NRC received 13 letters with comments on the proposed policy statement on ``Staff Meetings Open to the Public.'' These comments were from the following organizations: the American Mining Congress; two law firms, Winston & Strawn and Newman & Holtzinger, P.C.; and seven utilities, including Texas Electric, Yankee Atomic Electric Company, Commonwealth Edison Company, Florida Power Corporation, Georgia Power Company, Virginia Electric and Power Company, and Southern Nuclear Operating Company; the Nuclear Management and Resources Council, the State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy, and Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. (OCRE). Two of these commenters, Georgia Power Company and Virginia Electric and Power Company, endorsed the comments of the Nuclear Management and Resources Council. Two commenters endorsed the proposed policy statement. The other commenters either objected to the proposed policy statement or expressed their preference for retaining the 1978 policy statement. Several endorsed the general concept of opening staff meetings. Most offered suggestions for improving the proposed policy statement should it be adopted by the Commission. Impact on the Quality of Public Meetings The principal concern expressed was that having the public present during meetings with the NRC staff would have an adverse impact on the quality of those meetings. Several commenters indicated that the presence of the public at meetings with the NRC staff would unnecessarily complicate NRC and licensee discussions, would adversely affect the candor of those discussions (because the public would likely misunderstand and misconstrue the content of conversations), and would generally have an adverse effect on open communications between the NRC and licensees. The NRC has been conducting public meetings for nearly 15 years under the 1978 policy statement. Since September 1992, the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, the Office for Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data, and the regional offices have operated under an interim policy similar to the proposed policy statement. The NRC has not found that meetings open to the public under the 1978 policy statement or under the 1992 Interim Policy Statement have substantially interfered with the NRC staff's ability to accomplish its meeting goals or that the presence of public observers adversely affected its ability to communicate openly with licensees and other participants. Even though the NRC recognizes that having meetings open to public observation exposes the participants to the risk that information may be misunderstood or misconstrued, the NRC has not, in its many years of public meetings, found that risk to be of sufficient concern to outweigh the public confidence gained in the NRC's regulatory programs that comes from public observation of NRC staff meetings with outside persons. Policy Expansion Several commenters viewed the presumption that all staff meetings are open for public observation unless they fall into one of the exemptions detailed in the proposed policy statement as representing a significant extension of the agency policy on open staff meetings over that published in the 1978 policy statement. They also argue that the extension adds little to existing opportunities for public participation.
