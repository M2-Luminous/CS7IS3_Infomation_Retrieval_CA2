This article concerns election collateral and the obligatory collection of 3,000 signatures supporting a constituency candidate for deputy in Supreme Kenges. Candidates from the state list do not have to collect any signatures. In the opinion of Deputy Burnashov, who instituted the legal issue, these provisions contradict the constitutional norms on the equality of rights of citizens and create allowances for some categories of voters and candidates. As is known, examination of the case on 6 June was postponed in connection with the untimely appointment by parliament of their representative. This mistake has now been corrected. The necessary procedural measures have been taken in order to ensure the rights of one of the sides, namely the Supreme Kenges.
