Kovac considers the inability to analyze economic processes with sufficient precision as well as the poorly defined concept of a long-term orientation to be the reason for the slowdown in the transformation process last year. We consider the emergence of businesses that are able to develop and survive in the international market environment to be the main privatization objective, said Kovac, who is continuing his visit to the United States.
