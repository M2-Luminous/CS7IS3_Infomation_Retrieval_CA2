This sum amounts to 12 percent of the revenue of foreign currencies, part of which is used to service foreign debts. In a statement to AL-'ALAM AL-YAWM newspaper, Dr. Yusuf Butrus Ghali, minister of state for international cooperation, pointed out that the safe limit regarding the service of foreign debt must not exceed 24 percent, noting that there is a surplus of approximately 9 percent as an additional margin to the safe limit. Dr. Ghali pointed out that the volume of serving Egypt's foreign debts in 1987 reached 52 percent of the revenue of foreign currency. He expected that the service of Egypt's foreign debts in the next five years will drop to 6 percent of the revenue of foreign currency if the size of foreign debts maintains its ratio and if the current rate of borrowing remains unchanged.
