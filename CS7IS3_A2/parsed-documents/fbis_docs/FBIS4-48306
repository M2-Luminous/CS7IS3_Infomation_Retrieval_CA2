The bureau said that a good performance could be expected from the economy, both this year and next year, and that the expected upswing would be based solidly on politics. Long-term investment rates were expected to begin showing a downward trend this year, because of the anticipated low inflation and money market rates. Monetary policy was expected to remain unchanged. The bureau said it would require exceptional negotiating skills from the government of national unity, as a government of freedom, to meet the high expectations created among the masses during the elections. The bureau said it would be difficult to avert a further increase in the budget deficit in a non-inflationary way without sacrificing economic growth. Proposed expenditure and possible state loans next year would probably lead to tax increases, and to a rise in long-term interest rates.
