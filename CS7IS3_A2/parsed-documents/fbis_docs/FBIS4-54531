In his remarks for "Signals of the Day," Krzaklewski stressed, however, that the action would be suspended and not called off. It will eventually be called off when the government begins to implement agreements jointly reached with Solidarity. The Solidarity leader again accused the government of causing the strikes by not meeting earlier promises as well as of intentional dragging out the negotiations with the strikers.
