FBIS4-38139 "drnes124_n_94001" FBIS-NES-94-124 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 LEBANON Fadlallah Sees `Open War' Between Islamists, U.S. Fadlallah Sees `Open War' Between Islamists, U.S. NC2806093594 Beirut AL-'AHD in Arabic 10 Jun 94 p 5 NC2806093594 Beirut AL-'AHD Arabic BFN [Excerpts] Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has said there was no justification for "Israel" doing what it did last week. He expected "Israel" to plan more security and military blows. He expressed the fear that the self-rule accord could become a bridge across which the Israelis would infiltrate the Arab economy using the Palestinian factor. He affirmed that the PLO has cooperated in the security field with "Israel" since 1982 and then with European intelligence services against the Islamists. Fadlallah made these remarks during his weekly lesson on the interpretation of the Koran. He also fielded questions from the audience. [passage omitted] Asked about a statement by a Lebanese diplomat that the recent U.S. stance at the UN Security Council was based on the consideration that Hizballah has non-Lebanese connections, Fadlallah said: The U.S. says the Resistance is Iranian and in some cases Syrian and that it receives its instructions from abroad. Let us, for the sake of argument, accept the U.S. logic that the Resistance must be disarmed because it is not Lebanese or because it has non- Lebanese connections. The United States has not demanded the disarmament of the South Lebanese Army [SLA]. Does the SLA have Lebanese or Israeli connections? Why doesn't the United States demand its disarmament? Why does it agree that it should stay so that it will strike its people in the south and western al-Biqa' and defend "Israel?" Is the Israeli army present in the border area because it has Lebanese connections? Why doesn't the United States demand the disarmament of the Israeli army in the border area? [passage omitted] Fadlallah emphasized that the Resistance is not a card in anyone's hand, but benefits from Syrian and Iranian support, and indicated that Afghanistan, during Soviet occupation, benefited from the support of the United States, Europe, and the Gulf states. [passage omitted] Fadlallah said the reason the United States has adopted a negative stance toward Lebanon's complaint to the Security Council is not that the Islamic Resistance has non-Lebanese connections, but that the Islamic Resistance represents a problem for U.S. policy in the region. All the Islamists represent a problem for the United States, which is acting not only to protect "Israel," but also to protect U.S. policy in the region. Just as there is an open war between the Islamists and "Israel," there is also open war between the Islamists and the U.S. policy worldwide. This is the secret of the hostile U.S. stances. Asked about security cooperation between the PLO and "Israel," Fadlallah said: We do not trust the PLO. We possess documents on the PLO's relationship with Israel since 1982. We know the PLO has helped European intelligence agencies and has given them a lot of information on Islamists in Lebanon and many of the opponents of Western policy in the region. Fadlallah expressed the fear that following the Israeli-Palestinian Agreement, Palestinian officials would coordinate and cooperate with Israeli intelligence to strike at Islamists and liberation movements in the region. He also expressed the fear that the self-rule accord will become a bridge across which the Israelis will infiltrate the Arab economy using the Palestinian factor, which can be a cover for the Israeli factor. He called on the Islamists and all those who reject the PLO policy to watch this so that the Palestinians will not become a tool in "Israel's" hand to weaken the Palestinian, Arab, and Islamic stances.
