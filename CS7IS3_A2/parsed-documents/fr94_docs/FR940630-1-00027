After review of the rules submitted by Ventura County APCD against the criteria set forth above and in 40 CFR part 55, EPA is proposing to make the following rules applicable to OCS sources for which Ventura County APCD is designated as the COA. None of the existing OCS requirements were deleted. The following new rules were submitted by the District to be added: Rule 15.1␣Sampling and Testing Facilities (Adopted 10/12/93) Rule 74.24␣Marine Coating Operations (Adopted 3/8/94) The following new rules were submitted by the District, but will be incorporated into part 55 at a future date, when they become applicable in the corresponding onshore area: Rule 33␣Part 70 Permits_General (Adopted 10/12/93) Rule 33.1␣Part 70 Permits_Definitions (Adopted 10/12/93) Rule 33.2␣Part 70 Permits_Application Content (Adopted 10/12/93) Rule 33.3␣Part 70 Permits_Permit Content (Adopted 10/12/93) Rule 33.4␣Part 70 Permits_Operational Flexibility (Adopted 10/12/93) Rule 33.5␣Part 70 Permits_Timeframes for Applications, Review and Issuance (Adopted 10/12/93) Rule 33.6␣Part 70 Permits_Permit Term and Permit Reissuance (Adopted 10/12/93) Rule 33.7␣Part 70 Permits_Notification (Adopted 10/12/93) Rule 33.8␣Part 70 Permits_Reopening of Permits (Adopted 10/12/93) Rule 33.9␣Part 70 Permits_Compliance Provisions (Adopted 10/12/93) Rule 33.10␣General Part 70 Permits (Adopted 10/12/93) The following rule was submitted by the District as a revision: Rule 23␣Exemptions from Permits (Adopted 3/22/94) Rule 56␣Open Fires (Adopted 3/29/94) Rule 74.9␣Stationary Internal Combustion Engines (Adopted 12/21/93) The following rule was revised and renamed by the District, but is not proposed for inclusion in the above document because it is now an administrative or procedural rule: Rule 15 Standards for Permit Issuance (Adopted 10/12/93) The following rules were submitted by Ventura County APCD, but are not proposed for inclusion in the above document because they are administrative or procedural: Rule 8 Access to Facilities (Adopted 10/12/93) Rule 25 Action on Applications for an Authority to Construct (Adopted 10/12/93) Administrative Requirements A. Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Section 6 of Executive Order 12866. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Small entities include small businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions. As was stated in the final regulation, the OCS rule does not apply to any small entities, and the structure of the rule averts direct impacts and mitigates indirect impacts on small entities. This consistency update merely incorporates onshore requirements into the OCS rule to maintain consistency with onshore regulations as required by section 328 of the Act and does not alter the structure of the rule. The EPA certifies that this notice of proposed rulemaking will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements contained in the final OCS rulemaking dated September 4, 1992 under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq ., and has assigned OMB control number 2060&hyph;0249. This consistency update does not add any further requirements.
