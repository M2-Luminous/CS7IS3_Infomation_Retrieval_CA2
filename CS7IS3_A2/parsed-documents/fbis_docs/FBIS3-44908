He went to Brussels on 9 January to attend the NATO summit meeting, and thus began his first scheduled trip to Europe. The climax of Clinton's European trip will be his meeting with Yeltsin between 12 and 15 January. This will be Clinton's first visit to Russia after taking office and is aimed at enhancing the prestige of the Russian president. The year 1993 was the first year of the Clinton administration. With the end of the "Cold War," the military threat of the former Soviet Union against the United States also came to an end. The global strategy of confrontation with the Soviet Union pursued by all post-war U.S. administrations lost its significance. The long arms race placed the U.S. economy in a predicament. The unemployment rate has stayed at a high level for three consecutive years and social problems have piled up. From the very beginning, the Clinton administration took the reinvigoration of the U.S. economy as its overwhelming task and is determined to adjust the country's foreign policy. In recent years, changes have also occurred in Europe's strategic position. With the disappearance of a common enemy of the United States and Europe, contradictions between the United States and Europe have gradually increased. In the economic field, with the formation of a large, unified market in Europe, conflicts of interest between the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean became more prominent. At the same time, a relatively stable situation and high-speed economic growth existed in Asia. The broad market and huge potential of Asia are very attractive to the Clinton administration, which is striving to revitalize the U.S. economy. Therefore, after taking office in the White House, different from his predecessors, the destination of Clinton's first foreign visit was East Asia. However, the end of the Cold War did not mean that Europe would have no worries and would enjoy lasting peace. Nuclear forces in such former republics of the Soviet Union as Russia and Ukraine continue to plague the Western countries. In particular, Ukraine still refuses to implement the START 1 Treaty. In order to guarantee their own security, some former members of the Warsaw Pact have applied to join NATO, but the United States and other NATO countries hold different opinions on this issue. In the former Yugoslavia, civil war continues, and this has deeply upset other countries in the Balkan region.... When facing new problems on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, the United States cannot be indifferent. The Clinton administration has grounds for slowing its shift to Asia. According to some analysts, although the war machine of the former Soviet Union has collapsed, financial and political problems in Russia and the security of the newly established democracies in Eastern Europe has forced Clinton to reassess Europe's importance for the United States. Jiatehuofu [0502 3676 7202 1133], a foreign policy expert at the Hopkins Society in Washington, said: "The world's future lies in Asia, and we certainly will not give it up. However, Europe is now in trouble, and more and more people feel that NATO should be strengthened and take on new tasks." At the beginning of 1994, Clinton's first visit shows that Europe has become the focus of his attention, and this also indicates that the U.S. Government is making a new adjustment to its foreign policy. However, people still need to wait and see in order to know how much attraction Clinton will find when he turns to look at Europe again. It seems that the European countries are not pinning too much hope on the United States' "return" to Europe. Johnson, a British MP, recently said in a report to the West European Union: "Europe should embark on preparations for a future scenario where, once the United States bears no commitment to Europe, it should be able to safeguard its strategic interests independently."
