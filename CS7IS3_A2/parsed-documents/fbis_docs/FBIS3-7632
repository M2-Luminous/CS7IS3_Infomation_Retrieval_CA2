The government's current step is unprecedented. Two laws which have regulated investment in Indonesia will be immediately revised and replaced with a new law. The old investment laws are no longer considered relevant with the current developments. The laws which will be immediately revised are Law No. 1/1967 on foreign investment and Law No. 6/1968 on domestic investment. When asked by reporters, Ir. [academic title] Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, minister of state for investment affairs and chairman of the Investment Coordinating Board [BKPM], confirmed the planned revision of the two laws. "The plan is being discussed by ministers in charge of economy, finance, and development supervision," Sanyoto told reporters following an 'Id-al Fitr get-together with the BKPM employees and their families in Jakarta on Friday (18 March). According to Sanyoto, a special interdepartmental team will be set up to review the two laws. Indeed, it remains unclear who will chair the team because the matter will first be discussed during the initial meeting of the team. "A new law will be developed to replace the two laws if the team so decides," he said. The new law will combine the two old laws. Sanyoto considers such a step very appropriate and part of efforts to improve the investment climate. Sanyoto believes that Indonesia should have a single investment law without sacrificing the interests and objectives of national development. Furthermore, Sanyoto sees the review as very significant because the old laws have been in force for about 27 years. "The laws should be adjusted to the current situation," he said. Sanyoto hopes that the review will further accelerate investment in Indonesia. Sanyoto denies that the step has been taken because the two laws are hampering current investment. "This is purely intended to suit globalization," he said. According to Sanyoto, a number of neighboring countries closed themselves when the laws were made about 27 years ago. However, these countries, including India, Pakistan, and Cambodia have gradually started opening up. Some of them have even widely opened their doors to investment. Sanyoto added that differences between foreign and domestic investment will be further narrowed. For example, Article VI of the 1967 foreign investment law clearly states that such fields as ports, education, waterworks, railway, mass media, aviation, production of atomic energy, and the production and distribution of electricity for the public are closed to foreign investment. On the other hand, all fields are open to domestic investment. Sanyoto, however, was unable to confirm when the review of the two laws will be over because it is a long process. An even longer process will be needed if the team decides to change the laws. "A long process is needed to change a law, including the consent of the House of Representatives," Sanyoto said. In addition to reviewing the investment laws, the BKPM is preparing a new deregulation package. Sanyoto declined to reveal the package. However, he hinted that government decree No. 50/1993 on share ownership in foreign investment companies will be revised. "Let us wait for a decision on this change," Sanyoto said. However, several circles said that the revision will cover several articles of the decree, including Article I on approval of a foreign investment project and Article III on conditions for establishing a foreign investment project.
