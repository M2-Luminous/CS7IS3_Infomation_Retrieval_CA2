TABLE OF CONTENTS EU SPD Opposes Funding Jobs Plan With EU Debt DENMARK Minister Announces Apprenticeships FRANCE Commentary Notes Clinton Saudi Deal Announcement; Commentary on Clinton Trade Policy; Editorial on Higher U.S. Interest Rates SPAIN Impact of New Hiring Contracts Viewed; Spain Leads EU in Having Largest Number Public Employees SWEDEN ABB Sets Up Joint Venture in Russia TURKEY Commentary Scores Government Economic Policy ECONOMIC BRIEFS France, Greece, Portugal EU SPD OPPOSES FUNDING JOBS PLAN WITH EU DEBT--German Social Democratic Party (SPD) financial policy spokesperson Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier opposes the European Commission's desire to finance a European job creation program through new EU debt obligations independent of member-state budgets. Matthaeus-Maier writes in the Duesseldorf daily HANDELSBLATT that, although she supports the goals of Commission President Jacques Delors' "White Book" plan for growth, competitiveness, and employment, the plan's provision for an independent EU financing capacity is "neither necessary nor desirable." According to Matthaeus-Maier, such a capacity is not necessary because the EU budget already offers a sufficient number of financing plans, including the Cohesion Fund, the Structural Fund, and the Medium-Term Research Program. Additional funds, she argues, could be raised through the existing European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, which is to be established this year. Taken together, these financing sources could raise around 30 billion European Currency Units (ECU), an amount Matthaeus-Maier contends should be sufficient to fund the job creation program. Matthaeus-Maier also maintains that an independent EU financing authority is undesirable. First, she points out, there is good reason for the provisions in the Maastricht Treaty which require that the EU budget not be financed through debt but exclusively through the resources of the member states. An EU financing capability, she argues, would create a new source of indebtedness which would take on a life of its own. Member states would have a new loophole enabling them to escape limits on indebtedness at the national level. Second, Matthaeus-Maier asserts, new indebtedness at the EU level would undermine the convergence criteria the Maastricht Treaty requires member states to meet to join the European Monetary Union (EMU). Any financial obligations taken on by the EU ultimately would have to be divided up among the member states, making it even more difficult for them to meet EMU's limits on debt as percentage of GDP. Third, Matthaeus-Maier contends, new EU debt would make a decline in interest rates even more difficult, thus hindering investment in new jobs. The deeper the EU went into debt, the greater the eventual pressure for counterbalancing spending cuts and tax increases, steps which would be "poison for economic growth." Fourth, the interest on new indebtedness at the EU level would still have to be paid by the member-states, and any increase in member-state contributions would probably increase opposition to the EU. What the EU really needs, Matthaeus-Maier suggests, is not a new way to increase debt but rather a reduction of debt at all levels and strict adherence to Maastricht's convergence criteria. If available financial resources are insufficient, she concludes, then the Union's existing budget must be redistributed to fund the measures envisioned in the "White Book." (RoH) (Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT in German 21/22 Jan 94 p 3) DENMARK MINISTER ANNOUNCES APPRENTICESHIPS--Danish Labor Minister Jytte Andersen has announced that recently enacted legislation gives municipal authorities a new tool in the fight against youth unemployment: local government authorities can now offer poorly educated youth a two-year apprenticeship program. Authorities will have three months from the time of application to decide whether the candidate is needy enough to qualify. While there are only 3,OOO apprenticeships available for 1994, Andersen saw the new program as filling a major gap in the left-center coalition's comprehensive job stimulus effort. Andersen made the announcement in response to a study--conducted by the Counties and Municipalities Research Institute--indicating the inadequacy of existing programs in finding lasting jobs for poorly prepared youth. Under these programs, municipalities had been charged with finding jobs or vocational training slots for all unemployed between the ages of 18 and 25 within 14 days of application. This meant that, as a last resort, municipal governments had to create "artificial jobs" and training courses for some 80,000 individuals annually. The study generally lauded the results of these efforts, citing a high degree of participant satisfaction and success in eventually finding nonsubsidized jobs. The effort was deemed to have failed, however, in helping those in the youngest group (ages 18-20) without high school diplomas and/or work experience. Among these "weak" youth, only half subsequently moved into the regular job market. (RB) (Copenhagen BERLINGSKE TIDENDE in Danish 15 Feb 94 Sect. 1 p 1; Sect.

According to Senges, the fact that President Clinton did just that and organized this announcement as a "grand occasion" in the presence of McDonnell Douglas and Boeing Aircraft management and the Saudi ambassador, is testimony to the scope of the battle that preceded the Saudi purchase. It seems, Senges writes, that the Saudi Airlines purchase was clinched by the ''generous'' U.S. agreement to reschedule Saudi Arabia's debt and by repeated visits to Saudi Arabia by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. These visits were countered by those of French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, Defense Minister Francois Leotard, Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet, and finally by a visit by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. However, Balladur came back "empty handed." Senges observes that the United States had also put "all the weight of the Eximbank" behind its bid by guaranteeing the total contract. (DiI) (Paris LES ECHOS in French 17 Feb 94 p 8) COMMENTARY ON CLINTON TRADE POLICY--According to Pascal Aubert writing in LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, the Clinton administration has shown its capacity to conduct negotiations and to have its point of view heard, with "an efficiency all the more frightening since (Clinton) does not have the free market inhibitions of his Republican predecessors." The U.S. Government does not seem to care that it is contradictory to force open foreign markets with the threat to close its own and to accuse others of corrupting free trade while the United States is doing so itself, Aubert writes. This practice rests on the end justifying the means, with the only argument on its behalf being that U.S. economic security is the best guarantee of total security. This presumption has justified forcing a "vassal (Saudi) monarchy" to buy U.S. aircraft, Aubert concludes. (DiI) (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 18 Feb 94 p 4)c EDITORIAL ON HIGHER U.S. INTEREST RATES--Nicolas Beytout, editor- in-chief for the Paris financial daily LES ECHOS, writes that the first rise in U.S. interest rates in five years was dictated by purely domestic concerns and will endanger the weak recovery currently taking place in France. The increase in U.S. rates threatens to unravel the slow but progressive lowering of rates in France and Germany. The risk now is that the German Bundesbank will raise German rates. European economies, especially that of France, cannot afford continued recession, Beytout writes. He observes that while the newly raised interest rates in the United States may slow down the U.S. recovery, they may have a greater effect in Europe, reducing growth and halting recovery. The United States is raising interest rates to fight inflation at the same time as the German Bundesbank is reluctant to lower its rates because of inflation. But the inflation they fear is in their countries, argues Beytout, not in France. In raising interest rates, the United States is rendering French economic policy more difficult. (DiI) (Paris LES ECHOS in French 7 Feb 94 p 3) SPAIN IMPACT OF NEW HIRING CONTRACTS VIEWED--The news of higher unemployment in January announced by the National Employment Institute (INEM) comes at a bad time for the Spanish Government, which has been pushing for passage of a labor reform bill. The trade unions are contesting the reform on the grounds that it will not create new jobs, and opposition leader and People's Party (PP) President Jose Maria Aznar characterizes the government's policies as a "failure." During a press conference, INEM director Alberto Elordi attempted to mitigate these concerns by explaining that the high unemployment rate in January can be attributed to seasonal employment ending after the Christmas season. The Spanish Confederation of Employers' Organizations (CEOE) further downplayed the January figure by focusing on the increasing number of jobs which have been created since the first of the year. Referring to the labor reform bill approved in January, which provided for apprenticeships, part-time jobs, and training contracts, Elordi noted: "Of the 400,000 job new job placements registered from 1 January through 6 February, 80,4O7 resulted from apprenticeship, short-term, and training contracts." These contracts represent a 9- percent increase in job contracts over January of last year. According to Elordi, women have a difficult time finding jobs, yet almost 61.1 percent of the part-time contracts have been signed by women. Some 67.1 percent of the apprenticeship contracts have gone to men. These types of jobs are encountering a wider acceptance in business circles. For example, 5O0 of these contracts were signed daily in January and by February, this number had risen to between 600 and 650 contracts a day.

Diaz Herrera report that the government created 800,000 civil service jobs during the past decade, including those in government-owned companies and local governments. Earlier, the People's Party (PP) had estimated the number of government workers at 500,O00 and made these findings public, accusing former Secretary of Public Administration Juan Manuel Equiagaray of keeping information from the public and denying reports concerning increases in the number of public officials. On average and during the same time period, the number of public officials in other EU countries was 10 percent in contrast to Spain's 32 percent. The state has become the largest employer in the country, the authors claim, even overshadowing the automobile industry, which employs approximately 5OO,OOO people and represents 28 percent of Spanish exports. The Public Administration document reports that the number of public officials in Spain rose from 1,646,4OO to 2,269,562 in a decade, indicating that between 12 and 15 percent of the Spanish work force is employed in the public sector. The CEOE notes that Spanish industry has lost 340,000 jobs and more jobs will be lost in the agricultural sector as the country adheres to EU agricultural guidelines by reducing the number of farm workers. The authors note that the service industry cannot absorb this large a number of unemployed people. Economics professor Ramon Tamames describes the unemployment rate as "extremely alarming." In his book "Alternative Spain," Tamames characterizes the causes of Spain's unemployment as an example of excessive "bureaucratization and waste." He adds, it is "incomprehensible" that the birth rate in Spain should have only grown by a modest 3 percent during the past decade while the government bureaucracy increased by 32 percent in the same timeframe. The problem is more serious in the autonomous communities, according to PP deputy Manuel Nunez where "veritable colonies" have developed around the governing parties, "which goes against Title VIII of the Constitution." In Andalusia, for instance, the bloated bureaucracy has led to an increase in high level posts. Nunez writes: "Compared to Catalonia, the Basques have three times as many public officials and compared to Madrid, the Catalans have twice the number of public officials." A PP study indicates that the excessive number of high level posts is hindering government administration.

The new firm, to be based in St. Petersburg, plans not only to supply Russian power plants with ABB equipment and technology but also to sell entire prefabricated facilities as well. Percy Barnevik, the head of ABB, foresees Swedish manufacturers making components that can then be assembled in Russia. Barnevik noted that, at a time when many firms are skeptical about investing in Russia, "it means a lot to the Russians psychologically that there are some companies who are continuing to invest in the country." (WS) (Stockholm SVENSKA DAGBLADET in Swedish 28 Jan 94 p C1) TURKEY COMMENTARY SCORES GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC POLICY--According to Al tan Oymen writing in MILLIYET, Turkey's current economic situation will continue to get worse unless the Turkish Government takes "radical" steps to improve it. Such steps need to be radical enough that the public can accept them with a "sense of self-sacrifice." Despite the government's intervention in currency markets to support the value of the lire, 0ymen criticizes the government for not also addressing the problem of high interest rates, which increase the burden of the public debt the government has allowed to accumulate. Oymen points out that everyone, especially the government, knows there is a solution. However, nobody seems "to have the strength" to do anything. For example, the government, "accustomed to living above its means," is only partially reforming the tax system--a last minute, legal arrangement which does not solve the debt problem. The government also continues to tolerate large losses of the Public Economic Enterprises (KIT). Furthermore, the government is not able to control the huge growth in imports nor stimulate stagnating exports. Oymen questions how long this can continue.
