FR940817-0-00048 FR940817-0-00017 Policy Issues Sections 242.2 and 287.7_Apprehension, Custody, and Detention and Retainer Provisions One commenter stated that the proposed rule was contradictory by requiring that an immigration officer successfully complete basic immigration law enforcement training in order to be authorized to issue a detainer in §§242.2(a) and 287.7(a), yet not requiring the successful completion of basic immigration law enforcement training in order to be authorized to issue an order to show cause in §242.1(a) or a warrant of arrest in §242.2(c). A detainer is the mechanism by which the Service requests that the detaining agency notify the Service of the date, time, or place of release of an alien who has been arrested or convicted under federal, state, or local law. The Service agrees with the commenter that the standards for issuance of a detainer are no greater than those for issuance of an order to show cause and a warrant of arrest for immigration violations. The final rule deletes the requirement of successful completion of basic immigration law enforcement training for authorization to issue detainers. Training in immigration law and procedure is necessary to issue detainers, but training as a law enforcement officer is not needed to effectively conduct this portion of the immigration process. This does not eliminate the immigration officer's responsibility to ensure that detainers are issued only to aliens who are amenable to exclusion or deportation proceedings. Two commenters stated that the authority to issue a warrant of arrest in §242.2(c) should include the authority to serve the warrant of arrest in §287.5(e)(2). The Service disagrees. Issuance of a warrant of arrest entails signature by an authorized immigration officer, while service of the warrant entails a step-by-step process requiring training and proficiency in service of process procedures. The two authorities are separate and distinct processes. Section 287.1_Definitions One commenter urged the inclusion of the Other Than Permanent Full-Time (OTP) Immigration Inspector Basic Training Course in the definition of ``basic immigration law enforcement training'' in §287.1(g). The Service agrees and this section has been amended accordingly. However, an OTP immigration inspector will not be authorized to make arrests for federal offenses under section 287(a)(5) (A) and (B) of the Act until such time as he or she converts status to permanent full-time and successfully completes training applicable to that position. Four commenters urged the Service to expand the definition of ``basic immigration law enforcement training'' in §287.1(g) to include prior law enforcement experience or training with other federal, state, or local agencies as well as lengthy Service experience or other miscellaneous Service training courses apart from the basic training courses. The Service acknowledges that successful completion of one or more training courses presented by the Federal Government or a state-certified program may be substantially equivalent to basic immigration law enforcement training. The final rule provides a mechanism for considering other training by expanding the definition of ``basic immigration law enforcement training'' to include training that is substantially equivalent thereto as determined by the Commissioner with the approval of the Deputy Attorney General. The Commissioner's review is necessary to ensure that each immigration officer has all the required federal and, in particular, immigration law enforcement training. For example, an immigration officer who was employed previously in another Federal agency as a special agent, and thus had training in general Federal laws, would still need immigration law enforcement training. Sections 287.5 and 287.9_Exercise of Power by Immigration Officers and Criminal Search Warrant and Firearms Policies Ninety-eight commenters expressed concern that the proposed regulations precluded immigration officers from carrying firearms in §§287.5(f) and 287.9(b), effecting arrests for immigration violations in §§287.5(c) (1), (2), and (5), and serving process in §287.5(e) while off duty. The commenters stated that it is not uncommon for immigration officers or other federal law enforcement officers in an off-duty status to receive telephone calls at home from other federal, state, or local law enforcement officers requesting their immediate assistance. The commenters pointed out that only §§287(a)(5) (A) and (B) of the Act, regarding arrest authority for federal offenses, stipulate that an immigration officer must be ``performing duties relating to the enforcement of the immigration laws at the time of the arrest'' and that this language should not be included in those sections of the proposed rule regarding the other enforcement authorities. In drafting the proposed rule, the Service did not intend to impair an immigration officer's ability to place himself or herself on duty when necessary for the purpose of enforcing the immigration laws of the United States. To avoid misinterpretation, the Service has removed the language ``performing duties relating to the enforcement of the immigration laws at the time of the arrest'' from the enforcement authorities except where required by statute. The Service has also removed the language ``In an on duty status'' from §287.9(b). Administrative guidelines will be developed to explain when an immigration officer on his or her own initiative may place himself or herself in an on-duty status.
