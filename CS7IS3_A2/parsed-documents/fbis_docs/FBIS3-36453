He informed journalists and lawyers that the court had dismissed his client's appeal for a mistrial and for the trial to be make public. In the lawyer's words, the court questioned witness Nikishin, after which the defendant "considered it possible for him to answer questions from participants in the trial". At the same time, ITAR-TASS has learned from sources close to the Russian president that Boris Yeltsin tends to believe that the trial of the scientist is unconstitutional, and he may soon use his influence as guarantor of the Constitution to stop the Mirzayanov trial.
