Komeito [Clean Government Party] Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa said in TV programs, "The coalition parties are making efforts to establish a sense of unity over policies within the current framework of the coalition. There will be no major changes under the current situation." Watanabe has expressed his readiness to leave the LDP to challenge the premiership, but Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, head of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a core party in the seven- party coalition, is emerging as a front-runner to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Hata returned home earlier Sunday from Morocco, where he attended a ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to plunge himself into a race for prime ministership. Speaking to reporters upon arrival at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, Hata, however, was evasive in answering a question whether he will enter into a race for premiership. "I have never said whether or not I strengthened my resolution," the foreign minister tersely said. However, Ichikawa, one of the main strategists in the coalition, welcomed Watanabe's move, saying the possible secession of the head of one of the LDP's power blocs will facilitate a split of the LDP, in power for 38 years until last August when it was ousted by Hosokawa's coalition. Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], said in a TV program Sunday the SDP will not vote for Watanabe in the upcoming Diet premiership election. The official of the largest power bloc in the coalition was responding to a question about the SDP's reaction if Watanabe were to run for the premiership vote. Kubo, when asked about a coalition candidate for the next prime minister, said the SDP will respect a coalition agreement. Ichikawa showed his willingness for a would-be tie-up with an LDP splinter group headed by Michihiko Kano, a former state minister in charge of the Management and Coordination Agency. He said he has no reason to reject cooperation with Kano's group if Kano expresses his intention for a tie-up and if the coalition is able to reach an accord on major policies with his group. Kano, who seceded from the LDP on Friday, indicated during a TV program Sunday that his five-member group may support Hata for the Diet premiership election, saying, "I have promoted political reforms together with Mr. Hata and I have an understanding of his political posture." Hata, with his close associate Ichiro Ozawa, bolted the LDP last summer and inaugurated Shinseito in order to form a coalition with other non-LDP parties. Kano said they will not vote for LDP President Yohei Kono as they have withdrawn from the conservative party. Kono plans to stand as a candidate for the nation's top administrative post.
