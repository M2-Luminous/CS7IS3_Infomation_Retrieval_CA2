Kolodko? He is someone who, while writing an economic report on the postcommunist era, is capable of mentioning Balcerowicz's name just once, in a footnote, while not even once mentioning Dariusz Rosati (who, after all, was the founding father of the anti-Balcerowicz opposition). Instead, Kolodko mentions his own works, articles, and short reports more than 10 times. Sure, one can do it this way, too. Let us not ignore the fact that the above sheds some light on character-related vices and professional qualifications of the most recent deputy prime minister/finance minister. Anti-Winiecki Because we described Rosati as one of the founding fathers, Kolodko deserves the description of the grandfather of the anti-Balcerowicz opposition, or, at any rate, he deserves the description of someone older and famous for his authority in this harmonious family. Kolodko is a fundamentalist critic of the changes taking place in the postcommunist economy. Placed next to him, Rosati is indeed a real gentle lamb. ("The concept of a transformation policy carried out, in practice, has lead to a situation where a huge drop in output is accompanied by an avalanche-type increase in unemployment and an extensive crisis in public finances. It would be hard to find clearer proof of the mistaken nature of this concept," the current deputy prime minister writes.) Against this backdrop, Kolodko's position on the economic legacy of the Polish People's Republic [PRL] is quite special. While writing about some mistakes that were made, he speaks at the same time about dynamic growth and a balanced budget. This reminds me of a subtle admonition, with many elements of affirmation contained in it. There is no doubt that Kolodko's assessment of Poland after 1989 is much harsher than that of the PRL period. Naturally, he has a right to that. But it is hard to avoid the feeling that there is a very personal and emotional attitude of Kolodko on the issues he evaluates, lying at the very core of his criticism. If I were to sketch a psychological portrait of Grzegorz Kolodko, I would have to say that this very talented economist, by his decision to associate himself with a political orientation that went into opposition after the fall of PRL, had no direct influence on the direction of economic changes in Poland after 1989. A wounded ambition and complex of the rejected have been shaping the aggressive tone of many of Kolodko's public statements. Haughtiness and a lack of respect for those who have different views--and also unconcealed joy over their mistakes--can all be sensed in the statements. Every now and then, a reader of Kolodko's works comes across: "official optimism of the new elites," "nonsense plans and forecasts," "a new propaganda of success," "a lack of realism, professionalism, and insufficient imagination," "atrophy of the sense of responsibility," "manipulating the confused public opinion," "economic charlatanry," "neoliberal orthodoxy," "populism," and similar terms. It is interesting that Grzegorz Kolodko finds an alter ego in the Polish economic literature. That alter ego is Professor Jan Winiecki, a representative of constitutional liberalism, a hard-working fighter against socialism, which, in Winiecki's view, is the result of a mental aberration. It would be hard to imagine two people so different from one another and yet so similar as Kolodko and Winiecki. They are different on literally everything: the past and their views. What is common to them is the style of writing and the type of personality. In both cases, we are dealing with people who are intolerant and who cannot take criticism. It is enough to familiarize oneself with any piece written by either man. I doubt that these are the best references for someone to manage the economy of a country with 40 million people. At any rate, Kolodko tends to be an anti-Winiecki of the governing coalition rather than its anti-Balcerowicz (which Rosati was). It seems that the difference is rather significant. [Union of Labor Chairman] Ryszard Bugaj has described Kolodko as a red liberal. As far as colors are concerned, I do not feel authorized to speak out. As far as liberalism is concerned, however, in my view Bugaj is wrong. Kolodko is definitely an economist of modern social democracy's left wing. He is to the left of not only Balcerowicz but also of Rosati, even though, naturally, he is to the right of Bugaj at the same time. But, according to traditional left-wing standards of the 1970's, Kolodko is still a liberal because he has spoken out many times against the budget being burdened with social expenditures to an excessive degree (such as is happening now), against inflation, spinning the demand side, and against a permanent budget deficit. He has stressed the need to reduce the public debt, the need to legalize the economic "gray zone," and has demanded restrictive monetary policies. But, according to standards of constitutional liberalism, literally nothing that Kolodko has to say on economy, can be defended--that is, except for just one issue: his position on the balance of public finances. On an orthodox scale, Kolodko is an incomplete quarter-liberal, at the most. Never mind the colors. The Absolutely Indispensable State Kolodko negates an emergence in the postcommunist economy of an independent mechanism widely known in regular market systems, which causes growth after a period of depression. Such an argument implies that the state is ascribed an active role in setting economic growth in motion. So Kolodko draws a logical conclusion that allowing for "creative destruction" after 1989 was a major mistake. Institutional and structural changes should not have been implemented through shock, like a macroeconomic stabilization. The indispensable transformations "should have been managed by the governments with sensitivity." That is a clear suggestion that the state uphold part of the inefficient demand, which is an outlet for costly and obsolete production. Generally speaking, Kolodko's expectations vis-a-vis the state are high. The state is not only supposed to contribute to securing the proper conditions for stabilization and to deal with establishing a market infrastructure, but, in Kolodko's view, must also get involved in the process of allocating capital and must direct that capital to those places where, according to the government, it will be utilized in the best possible manner. The state should even demonstrate "direct production activity." The state/the owner should manage its own wealth well. There would be nothing wrong with this otherwise correct statement by Kolodko if it were not for another idea being promoted by the professor--namely, that "one must not privatize more or faster than is possible." Someone could draw the conclusion from this that there is too much privatization in Poland and that it is taking place too fast. But that would be a completely false conclusion. Kolodko's position on privatization is confusing. He thinks the rate of privatization is not very impressive currently and so one must increase it. So the warning mentioned earlier is understood to be of a preventative nature. But, for those who managed to "swallow" the warning while concentrating primarily on the announcement of greater privatization than up to now, Professor Kolodko has another surprise up his sleeve: He says there is a close relationship between the rate of privatization and the level of state activity. It seems like a quite trivial thing. In strictly technical terms, all it means is that the more somebody sells, the harder he has to work. But it cannot be ruled out that this argument by Kolodko should be interpreted in less trivial fashion: The faster the rate of privatization, the more government involvement in the economy. A Pentagon Out of Sync To define Kolodko's economic views, his position on the unemployment issue may also be quite helpful. Fortunately, in this regard, we are no longer condemned to trying to track down unclear traces. Grzegorz Kolodko is the author of a theoretical concept that allows one to measure the level of economic stabilization in practically every country of the world. His "stabilization pentagon" (described in a separate book) is an intellectually interesting attempt at defining the relationship among the growth of national product, unemployment, inflation, the state of the budget, and the current balance of payments. In the view of many economists, the practical utility of the pentagon theory is rather small due to many simplifications contained in it (for instance ignoring the NAIRU [expansion unknown] indicator, which means unemployment rate not resulting in increased inflation, or Kolodko's assumption that the cost of bringing inflation down, as measured by unemployment, increases in a linear fashion, which is obviously false, inasmuch as bringing inflation from 600 percent down to 60 percent is less costly than a reduction from 60 percent to 6 percent). That is why one must take a distanced position on the dogmatic views on the miserable effects of stabilization in postcommunist economies, as determined by using the pentagon theory. What is more important is that Kolodko's concept makes it possible to describe in much better terms the economic trend to which he belongs. For instance, according to Kolodko, stabilization increases along with production, and the faster unemployment falls, the greater the degree of stabilization. This is undoubtedly a result of the growth theory as viewed by social democrats, which ignores the issue of the cost of using resources. In the eyes of liberals, that omission absolutely disqualifies the pentagon theory as a credible economic instrument. Charges concerning links between stabilization and the state of the current balance of state payments are of a similar nature. Kolodko completely ignores the significance of the inflow and outflow of capital, for the state's balance of payments. But, in reality--and this is demonstrated not just by the case of Poland--even a significant deficit of current turnover going on for years does not necessarily have to drain state hard-currency reserves. It looks as if the author, while creating his pentagon, picked and chose those elements (unemployment, trade deficit) that support the theory on the miserable effects of stabilization, while rejecting (in the assumptions that simplified the model) anything that could contradict the argument of the miserable effects of stabilization. A State-Controlled Kick in the Pants Kolodko's nomination is significant for a number of reasons: First, the left wing finally has its own transition ritual. The left wing's economic team is being headed by a prestigious, talented, and very aggressive critic of Balcerowicz's policies. Second, the return to Kolodko's candidacy is, in a way, a gesture of despair on the part of the Democratic Left Alliance and the prime minister himself. I am saying that because what really happened between fall and spring to make Kolodko's comeback possible? The deputy prime minister has written somewhere that neoliberalism begets populism. Someone could make the observation now that Prof. Kolodko has finally gained power on the basis of that very populism. Third, the confusion surrounding the finance minister demonstrated that politicians of a single camp are capable of promoting people of quite differing views for the economy's chief over a relatively short period of time. A nomination of Rosati would make it likely that an easing of monetary policies will take place, which means introducing more money into the economy, but it would also mean increasing the state's fiscal discipline (for instance, a restrictive execution of tax laws and of other laws resulting in revenue for the state budget, or carrying out enterprise insolvencies). Kolodko's concept seems to be exactly the opposite of that. In a recent work, he wrote about the need to apply nondogmatic "instruments in the area of revenues, flexible, active, and proinvestment fiscal policies, and restrictive monetary policies." What Rosati, the would-be deputy prime minister, wanted to tighten, Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko, who assumed the post while being recommended by the same left wing, wants to ease up. And vice versa. What is this all about? On a cautious note, I think this demonstrates the politicians' weak knowledge concerning detailed views by economists who are proposed for the state's supreme posts, or else it demonstrates that the politicians just do not think such details are very important. What is important, they think, is that Borowski, Rosati, and Kolodko belong to the same political team and so are included in the same trend that is described as a reformist or liberal left wing. Apart from that common denominator of the most general nature, everything else does not count. The truth is that this view is obviously false. The "everything else" does count a lot, by all means. If Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko tries to implement demands that he voiced as a professor/reviewer, then it is only now that our economy will get a real state-controlled kick in the pants. I think this makes it easy to understand why, from the standpoint of liberal economists, Rosati, the founding father, who was much less unequivocal than Kolodko, may have seemed like the lesser evil.
