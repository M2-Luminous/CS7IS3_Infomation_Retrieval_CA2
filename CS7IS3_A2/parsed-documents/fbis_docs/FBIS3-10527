Everyone seems to agree on this. When Cardoso promises to reflect on the subject before deciding (even if he has already done so), he and his allies are demonstrating that they are now mainly concerned over political and electoral subjects pertaining his candidacy. The first variable is the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. Cautious PSDB leader Jose Serra has said that two thirds of the party want Cardoso to be a candidate. On 8 March, during a meeting with PSDB bloc members, Cardoso will hear claims in favor of his candidacy. But it is one thing to run as an autonomous candidate, and something else to discuss an alliance with other parties. That is what holds back the remaining third of the PSDB. If on the one hand the policy of alliances disturbs the PSDB, on the other Cardoso and the PSDB leaders know that the power of his candidacy is directly related to his ability to obtain support. The non-orthodox wing of the Workers Party [PT] has said that Lula [PT leader Luis Inacio da Silva] is desperate because he is unable to make more alliances. Cardoso rules out any alliance with the left. The field that lies before him ranges from the center to the right, and that is where the dilemmas begin. According to one PSDB leader, a possible alliance with the PFL [Liberal Front Party] should be evaluated with extreme care. If on the one hand an alliance will bring PSDB electoral advantages -- like a presence in northeastern Brazil and heavyweight allies, beside the approval of the elites -- on the other hand it will chase away Bahia politicians like Waldir Pires, who would never stand on the platform beside [Bahia Governor and PFL leader] Antonio Carlos Magalhaes. But the problem not only lies in Bahia. In Santa Catarina, PSDB candidate for governor Jaison Barreto is endorsed by the PT, his candidacy was launched by Lula, and he is running against PFL President Jorge Bornhausen. But the greatest problem is in Sao Paulo where [PSDB Senator] Mario Covas cannot be simply trampled into the dirt. PSDB leaders do not overlook the fact that Cardoso is not a purebred PSDB member, and as such he could obtain broader support than just from the PFL. It would not be very troublesome for the PP [Popular Party] of Alvaro Dias to join the PSDB (once the disagreements in Parana State between Dias and PSDB Senator Jose Richa are overcome). To further stress the center-right leaning, it would be essential to obtain the support of the PMDB [Brazilian Social Democratic Party] wing that will not support Orestes Quercia if he wins the party convention. PMDB dissidents, especially those from Rio Grande do Sul -- whose spokesman is [PMDB Senator] Pedro Simon -- dislike the idea of a possible coalition with the PFL. Their alternative, for regional considerations, is to support the PDT [Democratic Labor Party]. All this must be considered and discussed during the next three weeks.
