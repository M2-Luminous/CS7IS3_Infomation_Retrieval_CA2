FR940607-2-00146 FR940607-2-00090 The approach that the balance is to be struck against public disclosure presumably reflects a recognition on Congress' part that, in the long run, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae will be able to contribute most effectively to the nation's housing needs if they retain one of the key attributes of every viable business_the ability to protect the confidentiality of business strategies and plans. That is, in close cases, the need to protect the fundamentals of the enterprises' ability to perform is presumed to outweigh the short-term benefits of placing more information on the public record. B. What is ``Proprietary'' Information? The term ``proprietary'' is not defined in FHEFSSA and, on the face of the term, it could apply to virtually every data element of the loan registries: All were developed by Freddie Mac and are Freddie Mac's property, and nearly all are the types of information that Freddie Mac does not customarily provide to the public. However, reading the term in the context of the two competing directives described above, the legislative history of the Act and analogous case law, it may be more appropriate to interpret proprietary information to mean information that Freddie Mac does not customarily release to the public_where the release of that information could tend to cause financial or competitive injury to Freddie Mac, or could tend to impair competition between Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. That more-limited interpretation is consistent with the legislative history of FHEFSSA. For example, the issue of the scope of the term ``proprietary'' information was discussed directly in a floor debate of section 515 of the Senate bill (the precursor to the proprietary provision of FHEFSSA) involving Senators Seymore and Garn: Mr. SEYMORE. It is my understanding that section 515 of the bill prohibits the Director [the Director was to administer the housing goals under the Senate bill] from disclosing to the public information provided by the enterprises that the Director determines to be proprietary. What types of information does this legislation contemplate would be treated as proprietary? Mr. GARN. As a general matter, courts have construed various types of business information to be proprietary if it might cause competitive or financial harm to the company. While the legislation contemplates that the Director will determine what information is proprietary consistent with current legal precedents applicable to other companies, section 515 is intended to protect especially information relating to pricing and fees. If one of the enterprises learned of the other's pricing and fee strategy, it would create an extraordinary competitive disadvantage. Maintining competition between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is essential because there are only two GSE's involved in mortgage finance. Congress created the two GSE's expressly for the purpose of ensuring competition. This competition has resulted in lowering prices and enhancing efficiency to the housing finance market, which ultimately benefits homeowners and renters. Mr. SEYMORE. So, if I understand the Senator correctly, section 515 should ensure that information on pricing, fees and other key aspects of business strategy will be considered proprietary and therefore protected from disclosure to the public. Mr. GARN. That is correct. By including this provision in the legislation, it was intended that the Director protect from public disclosure a broad range of information that might impair competition between these two GSE's. 138 Cong. Rec. S8778&hyph;S8779 (daily ed. June 24, 1992). That interpretation also is consistent with case law interpreting Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA'') (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)), which is probably the case law to which the two senators had referred. The term ``proprietary information'' does not appear in FOIA, but the principles underlying that exemption are similar_but not identical_to those underlying section 1326 of FHEFSSA. FOIA Exemption 4 applies to ``trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged and confidential,'' and courts have applied that exemption to protect information that a person is required to submit to a federal agency where (1) The information was of the type ``which would customarily not be released to the public by the person from whom it was obtained,'' S.

Morton, 498 F.2d 765, 770 (DC Cir. 1974); see also OCC Interpretive Letter from Chief Counsel P. Allan Schott to James C. Goodale, 1989 WL 300373 (database FFIN&hyph;OCCIL) (April 5, 1989) (based on Exemption 4, OCC denied FOIA request for portions of documents describing commercial and financial facts surrounding loan).
