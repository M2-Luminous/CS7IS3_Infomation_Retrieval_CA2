You may have a good reason if, for example_ * * * * * 3. The authority citation for subpart E is revised to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 1102, 1601, 1602, 1611(c), and 1631(a)&hyph;(d) and (g) of the Social Security Act; 42 U.S.C. 1302, 1381, 1381a, 1382(c), and 1383(a)&hyph;(d) and (g). 4. Section 416.552 is amended by adding after the fifth sentence of the introductory text a new sentence to read as follows: §416.552 Waiver of adjustment or recovery_without fault. *␣*␣* In determining whether an individual is without fault based on a consideration of these factors, the Social Security Administration will take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) the individual may have. *␣*␣* * * * * * 5. Section 416.556 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: §416.556 Waiver of adjustment or recovery_countable resources in excess of the limits prescribed in §416.1205 by $50 or less. * * * * * (b) Failure to report the excess resources correctly and in a timely manner will be considered to be willful and knowing and the individual will be found to be at fault when the evidence clearly shows the individual (and spouse if any) was fully aware of the requirements of the law and of the excess resources and chose to conceal these resources. When an individual incurred a similar overpayment in the past and received an explanation and instructions at the time of the previous overpayment, we will generally find the individual to be at fault. However, in determining whether the individual is at fault, we will consider all aspects of the current and prior overpayment situations, and where we determine the individual is not at fault, we will waive adjustment or recovery of the subsequent overpayment. In making any determination or decision under this section concerning whether an individual is at fault, including a determination or decision of whether the failure to report the excess resources correctly and in a timely manner was willful and knowing, we will take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) of the individual (and spouse if any). 6.
