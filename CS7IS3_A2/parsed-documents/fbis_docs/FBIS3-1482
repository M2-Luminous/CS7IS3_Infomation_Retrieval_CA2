Thomson] [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- The African National Congress [ANC] and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] should stop and consider the catastrophic consequences of their violence, Democratic Party [DP] PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] leader Tony Leon said on Monday. In a statement responding to killings during a Zulu march in the city centre earlier in the day, Mr Leon said: "All parties should now consider the national interest of this country before pushing South Africa over the precipice into a Bosnian-type civil war. It is intolerable that the commercial heartland of South Africa should be paralysed by mass action of this sort. It is equally clear that not enough is being done to foster a breakthrough on the kwaZulu issue, and mob tactics of the type witnessed today take us even further away from a solution." Mr Leon said the DP understood ANC security guards had taken it upon themselves to fire live ammunition into the crowds and said this was "both illegal and grossly irresponsible". "Both the IFP and ANC should pull back and consider the catastrophic consequences of their campaign of mutual violence."
