Jafri] [Text] Pakistan and the United States have expressed their full support for global and regional efforts to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the missiles capable of delivering them. In a joint statement issued in Islamabad today at the end of the visit of U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Mr. Strobe Talbott, the two countries supported the early convening of multilateral talks on arms control, nonproliferation, and security in South Asia. The joint statement says Pakistan supported the objectives underlying the proposal, especially regional and global nonproliferation. However, the two sides agreed to continue discussions so as to develop an approach acceptable for both sides. Meanwhile, the foreign secretary, Mr. Najmuddin Sheikh, said there was no question of an agreement on nuclear nonproliferation, but discussions will continue in order to arrive at a mutually agreed approach. He said Pakistan explained its stand and position on the nuclear issue and Mr. Talbott had [word indistinct] a much clearer understanding about Pakistan's position. The most notable outcome of the talks between Mr. Talbott and Pakistani leaders in Islamabad during the last two days is that both sides appeared to be satisfied. What the U.S. official described as the cluster of issues discussed included the suspended sale of F-16 aircraft and a capping, reducing, and eventual elimination of weapons of mass destruction in South Asian subcontinent. The wide-ranging discussions were attributed by Mr. Talbott to what he called the multidimensional relationship between the United States and Pakistan. Mr. Talbott has emphasized that the United States wants the best of relations with Pakistan on the issue of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons in South Asia, which is a major concern of the United States. Mr. Tabott told to Pakistan side the United States fully realized that Pakistan was not going to accept any initiative unless it served the security interests of the country. The United States, he assured, respected this concern and its initiative will be aimed at promoting security. Knowledgeable sources in the Pakistan capital are describing the talks as positive and productive. The Government of Pakistan agrees that further consideration of the U.S. initiative should be carried on through normal diplomatic channels. Mr. Talbott has (?taken some pains) to dispel the apprehension that the United States might apply pressure on Pakistan to obtain its acceptance of the Washington line on nuclear nonproliferation in South Asia. He clearly told newsmen here that there was no question of any pressurization of any kind. Official circles in Islamabad have noted that the United States remains interested in promoting a regional approach to the security concern of the South Asian nations. Pakistan, for its part, welcomes any move which is essentially fair, even-handed, and equitable. This principle would apply to all issues, including nuclear nonproliferation, sale of defense equipment, Kashmir, and other issues which call for settlement. A regional approach to contentious issues holds better promise of success. It is now apparent that the United States understands Pakistan's stance better as a result of Mr. Talbott's talks with the leaders in Islamabad. The issues under discussion have not been finally settled or resolved. What these exchanges have contributed is a much clearer appreciation of each other's position. For instance, the United States now says it is not insisting on any rolling back of Pakistan's nuclear program. This clear statement is seen in Islamabad as acceptance of Pakistan's point of view. There is good reason to see this as progress in the right direction. Two days of talks on matters of profound complexity are not expected to produce instant results, and no instant results were either sought nor have concrete results been achieved. What he has said and (?will be) accomplished is clearing of the atmosphere of some doubt; some feeling that the United States was unable to sympathize with Pakistan's sensitivities. Mr. Talbott's exposition of the United States policies in South Asia has produced the positive conditions needed for progress in the right direction.
