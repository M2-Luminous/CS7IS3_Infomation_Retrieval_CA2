Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo, wrote inscriptions for the mosque on a tablet. The Islamic northern mosque (Qingzhen Beisi), called "No. 1 Mosque in Northern China," can hold more than 1,500 people for Moslem gatherings. First built during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) but destroyed in later wars and turmoil, the new mosque is much bigger and complex than the original one, according to an executive from the Islamic Association of China. Most of China's Muslims live in North-West China, but Tianjin also has several thousand.
