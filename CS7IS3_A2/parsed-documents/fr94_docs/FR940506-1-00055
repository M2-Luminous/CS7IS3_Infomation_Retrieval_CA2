SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that a council-prepared amendment to a fishery management plan be submitted to the Secretary for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving an amendment, immediately publish a notice that the document is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider public comment in determining approvability of the amendment. Amendment 7 proposes the following actions. (1) The eastern zone commercial quota for the Gulf migratory group of king mackerel would be divided into equal quotas for Florida east and west coast fisheries. The Florida east coast sub-zone would encompass the waters off the east coast of Florida from a line extending directly east from the Volusia/Flagler County, Florida boundary (29 ○25 ’N. lat.) to a line extending directly east from the Dade/Monroe County, Florida boundary (25 ○20.4 ’N. lat.). The east coast sub-zone would exist from November 1 through March 31, when the boundary separating the Gulf and Atlantic migratory groups of king mackerel is a line extending directly east from the Volusia/Flagler County, Florida boundary. From November 1 through March 31, the Florida west coast sub-zone would encompass the waters off the southeast, south, and west coasts of Florida from the Dade/Monroe County, Florida boundary to a line extending directly south from the Alabama/Florida boundary (87 ○31 ’06 ’ ’&hyph;W. long.). From April 1 through October 31, when the boundary separating the Gulf and Atlantic migratory groups of king mackerel is a line extending directly west from the Monroe/Collier County, Florida boundary (25 ○48 ’N. lat.), the west coast sub-zone would extend from the Monroe/Collier County, Florida boundary to the Alabama/Florida boundary. (2) The west coast sub-zone quota would be further subdivided into equal quotas for fishermen harvesting with hook-and-line and those using run-around gillnet gear. (3) Persons would be allowed to fish under the gillnet quota in the west coast sub-zone only aboard vessels that have endorsements on their Federal commercial mackerel permits to fish with gillnets in that sub-zone. All harvest of Gulf group king mackerel in the west coast sub-zone by vessels with such an endorsement would be counted against the gillnet quota. Proposed regulations to implement Amendment 7 are scheduled for publication within 15 days. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Dated: May 3, 1994. Richard H. Schaefer, Director of Office of Fisheries, Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11001 Filed 5&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P
