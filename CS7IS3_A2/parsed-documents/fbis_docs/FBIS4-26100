Zou, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, visited some parts of the telecommunications center, including a wireless and digital optic-fiber, high-frequency system and an international telephone exchange center. The center, set up in 1987, is an important link in China's national telecommunications network which transmits international telephone, telegraph and electronic data into or out of China. Zou asked about the center's operation and encouraged staff to keep China in the sector's forefront. On his tour of the base in the Science Research Institute under the Ministry of Railways, Zou boarded an in-trial para-high-speed train, which will run from Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, to Shenzhen, China's boomtown in the reform drive. The passenger train, made entirely in China, is designed to run 180 kilometers per hour and is equipped with air conditioning in every car. Zou discussed technological and management issues with engineers at the base.
