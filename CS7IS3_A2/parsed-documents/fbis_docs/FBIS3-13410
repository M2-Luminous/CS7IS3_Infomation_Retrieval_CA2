This expands the authority of the two major generals responsible for the areas where most of the Kakh and Kahana Hay members reside. Up until now, the Antiterror Act could only be enforced inside the Green Line and had no legal validity in the territories. If the IDF commanders make use of their new powers, it will be possible to take measures against those organizations that are defined as terrorist in nature, their members, and their property, with all the attendant ramifications.
