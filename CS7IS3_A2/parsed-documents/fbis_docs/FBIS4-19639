He wants to familiarize himself with projects of the Trust Agency East European Advisory Office that are being supported by the Federal Government. Waigel is coming from St. Petersburg where he attended the annual meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Developments. During his stop in Kaliningrad, he will also discuss the current state of the establishment of the free trade zone with the head of the Territorial Administration, Jantar. In the meantime, the four foreign-policy experts of the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union], Bundestag members Wilfried Boehm, Hartmut Koschyk, Friedbert Pflueger, and Christian Schmidt, have thought about Kaliningrad's future role. A "document on the current state" by the foreign affairs working group of the CDU/CSU Bundestag group states that the Kaliningrad region is a "number one all-European security problem." The area has been an "extremely isloated military colony for the past 50 years." A preservation or the expansion of the military concentration would "certainly trigger fears of Russian military predominance," it might provoke military countermeasures, disturb the peaceful development in the Baltic states and in the whole of Central Europe considerably, and "basically endanger Europe's entire security architecture after the end of the Cold War." For this reason, the future of the Russian part of eastern Prussia does not only concern Russia alone, the CDU/CSU officials stressed. The West European states should try to remind Russia of its responsibility and ensure the gradual reduction of the military presence in the Kaliningrad region. The CDU/CSU politicians pointed out that the influx of Russian soldiers and weapons that are being withdrawn from Germany and "parked" in Kaliningrad may add to the danger that Kaliningrad might become a "crisis region." Already, at this point, 200,000 men are deployed there. A regional arms race might develop. The three Baltic states in particular might feel "even more encircled than today." The measures that have so far been taken by the Russian Government to ensure a peaceful development in the region are not sufficient in the view of the CDU/CSU officials. Thus, it is the task of the West Europeans to try and exert influence. This is particularly necessary at a time when Russia is defining its security policy anew. Even if Yeltsin should succeed in implementing his reform course, one must proceed from the premise "that the military component will continue to remain a decisive factor of Russian policies." Thus, there will be no opportunity for a complete demilitarization of the Kaliningrad region in the foreseeable future. Yet the West must ensure that this territory will only become an outer defense bastion within the framework of a general defense concept to protect Russian territory. Russia's behavior in this region will be a test for the entire policy of Russia. The Russians must be asked to enter into a security-political dialogue with their neighbors. The Bundestag members suggested drafting joint solutions with the Russians within the framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, the CSCE, and the European Council.
