"It's important that we realized Vietnam has many faults in its investment laws," Cam said in a press conference with visiting South Korean reporters. "It's important that we decided to overcome these obstacles and provide the right conditions to foreign investors." Cam said Hanoi, in this connection, is prepared to simplify entry procedures for foreign visitors. The foreign minister said Vietamese-South Korean economic cooperation reflects what is happening all over the world -- the creation of one giant market in which all countries are interdependent. "Moreover, we are located in the same region and share much in common in culture and history. We have very favorable conditions for mutually beneficial cooperation," said Cam. Hanoi can learn from Seoul's experience in economic development and adapt the lessons to suit Vietnam's own style. The Vietnamese, in return, will guarantee a solid return for South Korean businesses in the process, he said. South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu concluded his visit to this Southeast Asian capital Friday, meeting Cam and President Le Duc Ahn. The two countries reaffirmed Seoul's promise to provide financial aid to Vietnam that will go into youth job training programs and many infrastructure projects. On the standoff over North Korea's nuclear program, Cam advised patience. "Our principle is that the entire world should be denuclearized," he said. "No matter how complicated the situation, one can surely find the right solution through patience and respect." Cam declared Hanoi's unflinching commitment to socialism with a market economy. "We made a grave mistake, the mistake of believing that a market economy can be applied only to capitalist societies. It was not a mistake that only we made. Other socialist nations made the same kind of error," he told South Korean reporters. Macroeconomically, the Vietnamese Government will intervene to ensure balanced growth, he said. In addition, the government will guarantee free competition, a market based on the principle of supply and demand, he said. He confirmed that Hanoi and Washington will soon exchange liaison offices, a development that is "an essential aspect in normalizing bilateral relations." "There are so many things to be done before complete normalization. Just how fast they can be completed depends on efforts by both countries," he said.
