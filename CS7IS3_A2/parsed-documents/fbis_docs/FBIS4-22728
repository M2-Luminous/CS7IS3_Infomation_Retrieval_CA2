The first stage of reconstruction envisions the building of cargo terminals (volume of investments--$70 million): Development of the infrastructure of cargo terminals--$11 million, construction of the air terminal building--$45 million, and the organization of the auxiliary complex and technical services (customs, militia, loading platform, service system, hotels, etc.)--$14 million. [End boxed item] A business plan for the reconstruction of the Novosibirsk international airport developed by a consortium of U.S. consulting firms headed by the Ernst & Young Company was approved on 4 April. Thus one of the largest projects in the reconstruction of Russian airports, in terms of the volume of capital investment, acquired a technical and financial basis. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has already repeatedly talked about the situation concerning the planned reconstruction of Novosibirsk airport (see 24 and 27 January issues). At the end of March, during the visit to the United States of a delegation of the joint-stock company Transsibavia, studies were approved of a business plan for the reconstruction of the airport by a group of American firms headed by the Ernst & Young Company, and on the evening of 4 April its final variant as well. The total cost of reconstruction is estimated by specialists of Ernst & Young at $1.2 billion. Inasmuch as the total volume of reconstruction work may continue until the year 2030, its implementation is envisioned in stages. Reconstruction in the first stage is planned to use up about $60-80 million (see boxed item). An important condition for the implementation of the project, as is noted in the business plan, is the conduct of structural changes and the resubordination of the Novosibirsk airport Tolmachevo from federal to oblast property, which will make it possible to activate work on reconstruction and control the expenditure of resources. As was reported by Aleksandr Fokin, deputy director of foreign relations of the joint-stock company Transsibavia, the consortium of firms headed by the consulting firm Ernst & Young Company conducted a study of the business plan starting in April 1993. During its preparation, consultations were conducted with 16 aviation companies of the world, the U.S. Treasury, the IMF, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Civil Aviation Organization, and also airports at Anchorage and Fairbanks. So reputable a list of consultants indicates the significance that is being given abroad to the appearance on the Transsiberian main line of a large air terminal complex that meets world standards. The fact is that practically all the large aviation companies in the world (for example, Lufthansa, JAL, and a number of others) use the Transsiberian route for flights to Japan and Alaska, which makes it possible to save almost 30 percent flight time and fuel in comparison with flights across the Polar Circle. Naturally the aviation companies (including Aeroflot) are interested in the development of the infrastructure of one of the world's most important air routes. This gives reason to suppose that general contractors and sources of financing will be established in the near future.
