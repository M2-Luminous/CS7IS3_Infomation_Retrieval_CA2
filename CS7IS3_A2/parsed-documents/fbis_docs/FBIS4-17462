The Defense ministry press service also stated that the ITAR-TASS report does not conform to reality and that some of the mass media distorted the undeniable fact that the Black Sea Fleet belongs to two states, rather than to Russia alone. As for the reference to the fact that the position of the Ukrainian side with regard to a Ukrainian Navy base in Sevastopol contravenes military theory, the Defense Ministry press service is authorized to state that Ukraine has its own military doctrine and follows its requirements aimed at ensuring state independence.
