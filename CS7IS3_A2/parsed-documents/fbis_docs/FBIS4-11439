Thus, private sector organizations have presented a package of measures, the most important of which are: - Total deregulation of trade and the creation of a one-step procedure for national exports. - Refinement of the country's economic opening with the strict implementation of mechanisms to curb unfair trade practices, because the government has only used dumping [previous word in English] to combat the entry of products from other nations. - The government must grant to national exporters the same support (covert subsidies) other governments extend to their businessmen, as is particularly true of the United States and Canada. - The next administration must finally break off its connections with mafias and end corruption in the country's customs offices. It is the only way to ensure the honest entry and departure of merchandise and to eliminate contraband to Mexico. The private sector believes over the next six years international trade policy should attempt to encourage development banks to make loans at competitive international rates, eliminate bureaucracy and excessive guarantees, and allow loans to indirect exporters. Representatives of Mexican Employers Confederation, National Association of the Processing Industry, Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce, National Association of Mexican Importers and Exporters, and Conacex [expansion unknown] have proposed certain foreign trade policies such as flexibility in commercial openness, which has been exercised in our negotiations with South American countries (Chile and the Group of Three), in order to evaluate trade agreements with other countries. These organizations have proposed broad-based negotiations by goods and services groups. They have called for honesty in the negotiations process, whereby the community will be informed beforehand of the scope of negotiations, and for the institutionalization of the work plan jointly prepared by the government and the private sector for the North American Free Trade Agreement. The business organizations are advocating gradual negotiations because it is fundamentally important to establish deadlines for the opening of the various sectors. Openings that are too broad or too rapid might undermine the sector's ability to adjust to change, and they may negatively affect its productive structure. It is necessary to have a propensity toward exports, to which the organizations have recommended the creation of a culture of exportation. Presently, there is considerable assembly plant and export activity by foreign companies. Certain Mexican consortiums have been successfully exporting; it is possible to capitalize on this through a plan to integrate firms of various sizes that conduct indirect exports. Added to the problem of exports are the promotion policies and mechanisms that have been used thus far, which require the import sector's increased involvement in organizations that promote exports. One aspect of regional development is the need to develop the private productive nature of organizations and regions concurrently with regional export activities. Unfair trade practices such as dumping [previous word in English] and contraband have harmed the productive infrastructure, making it necessary to divulge, implement, and place within the reach of medium- and small-sized businesses the legal mechanisms with which to avoid them. Furthermore, considering these mechanisms can be refined, the process should be accelerated. Customs must face the challenge of assimilating and carrying out all changes; it is a key operational factor to be able to rely on a customs system that is trained and efficient. The business groups addressed the need for a single organization responsible for promoting agricultural foreign trade; this organization would have three duties: To examine competitive national products. To identify foreign markets, and To establish an information system. The business organizations say the development of the border area requires administrative deregulation and incentives to increase the competitiveness of border trade. Also required are consistent foreign trade policies that will allow nationals as well as foreigners to conduct long-term investments or coinvestments that will foster employment, the demand for raw materials and exports.
