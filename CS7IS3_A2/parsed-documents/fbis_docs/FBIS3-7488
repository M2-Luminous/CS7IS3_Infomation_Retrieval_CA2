"It is not a numerical target, and I believe foreign nations will recognize this," Fujii told reporters at the Diet after emerging from a morning cabinet meeting. Japan unveiled earlier the package of market-opening and fiscal measures designed to seek a breakthrough in the stalled trade talks with the United States. Although it offers neither specific targets in reducing trade surplus nor measuring market access, the package spells out that an official government economic forecast indicates the ratio of current account surplus to gross domestic product (GDP) will fall from 3.4 percent in fiscal 1992 to 3.1 percent in fiscal 1993 that ends on Thursday and to 2.8 percent in coming fiscal 1994. Fujii indicated his opposition in using construction bonds to finance an increase suggested in the package for the government's public works spending plan from fiscal 1991 through 2001. Construction bonds are "debt and leave principal and interest payments to future generations," Fujii stressed. But he declined to comment on tax hikes that are apparently the only alternative. In the trade program, Japan reconfirms that it will decide by the end of June a proposed boosting of the public works spending plan on a condition that financing is secured to avoid leaving burdens to future generations. On tax cuts, Fujii said the trade package reaffirmed as he has been stressing that the ruling coalition parties are slated to decide in June on a full-fledged tax reform, including a continuation of income tax cuts that are limited to a single-year scheme for fiscal 1994. He noted that the package shows Japan's further commitment by stating that the Diet's House of Representatives attached a provision for permanent income tax cuts in the single-year bills passed last week. The bills are now under deliberation at the House of Councillors. U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and other officials have said that Japan's single-year tax cuts are insufficient to boost domestic demand and curb trade surplus, and have also called for further fiscal measures. Fujii would not make any predictions over the U.S. reaction on the trade measures Japan has vowed to compile by the end of March. With the package launched in time, Japan now awaits U.S. judgment as officials have repeated that the U.S. would assess the possibility of resuming the stalled framework talks after reviewing the March measures.
