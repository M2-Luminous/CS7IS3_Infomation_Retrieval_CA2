How can this interim period be described? [Alphandery] It is a transitional phase and therefore has highs and lows, and variable results according to the sectors. The United States experienced that in 1992 before returning to clear growth. Getting out of a recession is always characterized by up- and downward movements. In France, the economy certainly grew very modestly and at a rate which was scarcely perceptible in the second and third quarters of 1993 (up 0.2 percent in each), whereas the beginning of the fourth quarter was marked by an upsurge in activity. Positive Signs [Robin] What signs now make you feel fairly optimistic and which suggest that the lowest point has really been passed? [Alphandery] There are at least two positive signs. First, the order and export sales books are filling up considerably, which reflects both an improvement in the international environment and the high level of competitiveness which our products have. Moreover, the demand for houses is improving; in September, October, and November, there was a 10-percent increase in new homes started, and planning applications for new houses increased by 12 percent over the previous three months. Another encouraging sign is that inquiries into the economic situation among corporate managers show a return of optimism. Better prospects for economic activity are emerging, especially in the opinion poll carried out very recently by the small- and medium- sized enterprises' capital fund. [Robin] Surely the most worrying sign on this instrument panel is the psychological factor, the feeling of anxiety which is prompting a kind of consumption stop. [Alphandery] It is true that consumer spending has become irregular for some time. It had increased by 0.6 to 0.7 percent in the second and third quarters and was moving in the wrong direction at the beginning of the fall. It is increasing partly thanks to the sales. We will closely monitor the consumer figures for December and January when there are widespread promotional sales, in order to form a more accurate view of the trend. Confidence a Key Factor [Alphandery continues] The confidence felt by households and managers chiefs is obviously a key factor in the recovery. The change in climate will come as progress is made. The strong reduction in interest rates, which we recorded, has begun to produce positive effects, particularly by reducing the enterprises' financial costs. In this context of a gradual return of confidence, our economic growth forecasts of 1.4 percent in 1994 have no reason to be changed for the time being. Among other things, they are based on an expected 0.7-percent increase in household consumption, which is, after all, modest. It is modest because it would be enough, for intance, for the French to turn just 5 percent of their savings in SICAV's [Open-End Investment Company] into consumer spending to achieve this increase. [Robin] Are the French leaders right to constantly highlight international constraints, as if we really had no freedom to solve our own problems? Why stick to what is happening in Germany, is this not a resigned attitude? [Alphandery] It is important to realize that, in our economies, which are very open to the outside world, it is not possible to pursue an economic policy which runs completely counter to the international environment. The unfortunate experience of 1981 must serve as a lesson. Of course, the situation in Germany, which is our main customer, is not very buoyant. Growth there will be at best between 0 and 1 percent this year. But, fortunately, there are other parts of the world which are attracting foreign demand: The recovery in North America is considerable and it is already having beneficial effects in France and in Europe. Crediblity Restored [Alphandery continues] Moreover, there are means of action, even in the present context. And we cannot be accused of doing nothing. Despite little financial room to maneuver, we have succeeded in pursuing an imaginative policy of supporting economic activity by mobilizing short-term saving by the French people. That has been done in particular through the Balladur loan issue which served as an interim measure, pending privatizations, to finance measures to promote the housing sector and the small- and medium- sized enterprises in particular. Finally, we have taken significant measures to ensure the recovery of state and social security accounts. These provisions, which are certainly painful at the start, have not been without effect. For instance, the credibility restored to our monetary policy has made it possible to virtually wipe out our interest rate differential with Germany. In so doing, we have succeeded in creating a more favorable climate for recovery. [Robin] The French people have only recently rediscovered the market economy and its cyclical fluctuations, which are well-known facts in the United States. What are you saying to them to make them accept that such developments are normal and are better than the rigid and interventionist economic system which has prevailed in our country since 1945? [Alphandery] The previous recession in France dates back to 1975 and was the result of the first oil crisis. When the world was suffering the effects of the second oil crisis in the early eighties, France thought it could escape them by pursuing a counter-cyclical policy. It must be admitted that the recession was avoided temporarily but at what a cost! It subsequently gave us permanently slower growth. Our economy only returned to cruising speed from 1988, whereas the United States, Germany, and Japan returned to growth as early as 1983. [Robin] The recession of the nineties lasted three years, assuming it is now over. Does it not reflect more fundamental problems? What is this feeling of doom which prevails among many French people? [Alphandery] The recession appears to be so painful in our country because it is accompanied by the need to tackle some major structural problems, especially on the employment front. The two phenomena must not be confused. In 1988, amid economic euphoria, France already had a 9-percent unemployment rate, much higher than in Germany and the United States. The Japanese economy experienced a serious recession in 1993. And yet the unemployment rate is still around 2.5 percent. [Robin] The prime minister has just admitted that "the crisis is even worse than we thought when we came to power." In what respect in particular? [Alphandery] In March 1993, everybody still underestimated the scale of the recession which we had inherited. It had grown considerably worse from fall 1992. We only realized that six months later when the final figures for the fourth quarter of 1992 and the first quarter of 1993 were known. Not In Favor of Social VAT [Alphandery continues] It is clear that the employment problem will not automatically be solved with the end of the recession. The Giraud law's five-year employment plan clearly identified the three key factors on which we must take action. First, the lack of flexibility in the job market; the law contains several initial responses on this point, like the annual calculation of working hours or the services voucher. Second, the lack of professional qualification. Hence the training-in-the-job contracts [contrats d'insertion]. Finally, the efforts to reduce social security contributions on low wages: 10 billion francs [Fr] have been allocated to that in the 1994 budget. We must just take care to ensure that the remedies do not have contraindications which would be likely to cancel out their positive effects. Would not an increase in VAT to finance new reductions in social security contributions now reduce consumption, the rate of which we must, instead, sustain? That is why I am not campaigning for a social VAT. [Robin] The government's economic policy was primarily aimed at restoring a balance to the public accounts. You wanted to restore confidence in the French people worried at seeing the deficits threatening their social security system. This was the reason for increasing the CSG [general social contribution]. Does the result live up to your expectations? [Alphandery] I think so; we obviously first had to reassure the French people about the future of their social security. As for the increase in the CSG, by helping to restore credibility to our economic policy, it made it easier to reduce interest rates. This resulted in savings of Fr60 billion for the enterprises and Fr15 billion for the state. What would have happened without that? [Robin] Some economists are accusing the government of emphasizing a policy of supply to overcome the crisis, whereas it is demand which is lacking. Francois Mitterrand has taken up this idea, referring to the Fr80 billion given to the enterprises without any effects on employment. What is your answer? [Alphandery] It is true that we have made a considerable effort, especially with regard to the small- and medium-sized enterprises, through the reimbursement of VAT. In so doing we have been able to avoid additional bankruptcies, as is shown by the trend recorded in the last months of 1993 when the number of bankruptcies fell. At the same time, we took several important measures to help households; families not liable for tax received a higher grant for the beginning of the new school year, and income tax has been reduced by Fr19 billion. The balance between supporting demand and strengthening supply seems satisfactory, because we must prepare the ground for a healthy recovery. [Robin] On another front, you have been accused of pursuing a monetary policy which does not correspond to the internal requirements of the French economy which would have justified a larger cut in interest rates, or even a devaluation of the franc. Do you think the debate is finally over? [Alphandery] The interest rate cut made over the past nine months is impressive. France is now among the countries with the lowest rates in Europe. This is particularly true for long-term rates of between 2 and 10 years with which the enterprises and the state can finance themselves for a rate of less than 6 percent. With regard to shorter-term rates, the reduction in interest rates is continuing, and we are already very close to countries like Britain which devalued their currencies in the hope of securing lower interest rates. I note that those economies have short-term rates of more than 5 percent, whereas the United States and Japan have been able to reduce their interest rates to 3 percent or less. Nobody in Europe has managed to do that yet. It is a difficult fact to explain but one which affects everybody. [Robin] The deterioration in public deficits has been abrupt in France, so much so that those deficits are now relatively higher than in Germany, according to OECD estimates. How do you explain this phenomenon? Is the French economy, with its very high compulsory contributions, impossible to manage in a period of recession? [Alphandery] Our predecessors gave us a poisoned chalice with public and social security deficits much higher than expected. Such deficits are worrying and they must be eradicated, which we have started to do at the cost of temporarily increasing the compulsory contributions. But, ultimately, we must have the aim of reducing the compulsory contributions which are an obstacle to the creation of wealth and a source of unemployment. Hence the five-year plan to reduce the budget deficit which aims essentially to control public spending. We should beware of comparisons with our partners. Taking all spending into account, the public deficit in France is no higher that we are seeing in Germany, in particular.
