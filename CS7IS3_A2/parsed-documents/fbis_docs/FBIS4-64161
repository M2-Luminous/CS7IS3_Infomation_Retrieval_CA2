Will a Cease- Fire Agreement Be Signed?"] [Excerpts] As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent has learned, the second round of talks between the government delegation and Tajik opposition, scheduled to be held in Tehran, has been postponed by three days. This is due to the fact that Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati will not be able to participate in the official opening ceremony until 7 June. [passage omitted] The Tajik-Afghan border remains the most unquiet place. And although the Islamic Revival Movement has repeatedly assured that its actions are not aimed against Russian frontier guards, the peacekeeping force command is constantly reinforcing its units. In this context the INTERFAX report that peacekeeping force commander Col.-Gen. Patrikeyev had excluded Tajikistan armed forces from the "peacekeepers" contingent was rather unexpected. On one hand, Tajik Defense Ministry units are not numerous and do not have influence in the coalition forces. Their participation in the "peacekeeping" mission was all the more strange because the Dushanbe regime is in a state of civil war with the opposition. On the other hand, government troops, regularly supplied with arms and ammunition, can now conduct operations independently, without exposing the Russian 201st Division. In any event these reshuffles will hardly change the military's attitude to the political situation in Tajikistan even though in the past six months the opposition has stated on several occasions that it is not against the Russian military presence in Tajikistan. It is also possible that a new peacekeeping force commander will not be just as straightforward as Boris Pyankov who presented the opposition with an ultimatum this spring, which was apparently a deliberate action, seen by the opposition as interference in Tajikistan's affairs. This apparently conditioned the government delegation's behavior at the first round of negotiations in Moscow when it refused to sign a formal cease-fire agreement proposed by the opposition (this, incidentally, confirms the truth long understood by political scientists and experts: The war against the opposition is not being waged by the Dushanbe regime). At preparatory meetings before the second round the opposition delegation is again preparing a proposal on a cease-fire on the Tajik-Afghan border which is regarded with understanding among Russian diplomats.
