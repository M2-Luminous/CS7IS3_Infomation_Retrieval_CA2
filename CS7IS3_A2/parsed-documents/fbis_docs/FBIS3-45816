The project, in central China's Hubei Province, started last year and is scheduled to be completed in the coming 17 years; the 11th year will see the first set of generators producing electricity. A group of 26 water turbo-generators for the project are planned to have an installed capacity of 700,000 kw each. They will be among the biggest in the world when they are installed. To pave the way for international co-operation for the project's generators, a month-long symposium was held late last year, with more than 90 Chinese and foreign experts taking part. Many leading foreign companies with experience in building power- generation equipment above 600,000 kw were represented, including the Volth and Siemens companies of Germany, G.E. of Canada, Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsui of Japan, and LMZ and Electrical of Russia.
