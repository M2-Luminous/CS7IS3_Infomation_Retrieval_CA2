Vladykin; "Alarm! There's the Smell of Plague in the Air"; first paragraph is URALSKIY RABOCHIY introduction] [Text] A dramatic rise in the number of rodent-borne diseases has been noted in the oblast. According to data of the Oblast Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight Center, 148 cases of pseudotuberculosis (including 4 outbreaks in children's preschool institutions) and 56 cases of intestinal yersiniosis in the first 6 months of this year. Let us note, for the sake of comparison, that 8 and 15 cases of these diseases, respectively, had been reported for the same period last year. Fresh vegetables that stored for some time at rat-infested warehouses of trade bases and stores are increasingly often the source of infection. As we know, rodents are also involved in the spread of tick-borne encephalitis. Fortunately, there is still no tularemia, God forbid, or plague, yet these most dangerous diseases are also transmitted by rats and mice. Wherein lies the cause of the unprecedented surge in morbidity? Specialists believe that it is not a matter of natural growth of the rodent population (in this sense, the situation is quite usual this year), it is simply that people have virtually stopped controlling this long-tailed filth. Deratization, i.e., extermination of rodents, has been always the concern of disinfection and prevention stations and departments, which are paid for their work on a contractual basis. At present, many enterprises have more important things to think about than rats, and for this reason all the necessary conditions for reproduction and improved diet are provided for these animals. And the disinfection and prevention service is falling apart before our eyes, people are quitting because of the low wages, there are not enough modern poisons, transportation, needed materials and bait. Payment for rodent extermination work from the local budget is the logical solution for this situation. After all, the Moscow city council adopted a decision that provides for comprehensive, regularly scheduled deratization (rats must be exterminated everywhere, in the residential sector, developed areas, and who is to pay the expense?). The authorities in the capital have allocated considerable budgetary funds, and have made it incumbent on all enterprises, regardless of forms of ownership, to conclude contracts with disinfection-prevention stations; they have implemented a number of measures to furnish this service with everything it needs, as well as for technical-engineering protection against rodents. Moscow was the first to come to its senses. But the people of the Urals are maintaining an aloof calmness: they are not worried, so be it....
