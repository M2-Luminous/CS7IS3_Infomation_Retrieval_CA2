For example, letters from one's family. More than once, we saw how fighters guarding the Nansha Island reefs beamed with joy when they received a letter from their family and how those who did not receive any mail became dejected. However, more than any other story, we heard family-letter-related stories about the silent dedication by soldiers guarding reefs at the remotest corner of China's territory. There is a political instructor called Wu Guisong on the reefs. When he was 30, a baby boy was born to him. He named his baby Weiguo. He left home and returned to the reefs before his baby was one month old. Fighters have called him Weiguo's Father since then, and he would happily answer to this. Unfortunately, three months later he received a letter from his wife telling him that the baby had died of pneumonia four days after he left home. Although it was like a bolt out of the blue, Wu Guisong put up with the blow. He kept the bad news to himself and did not mention a word of it to others. He understood that any personal joys, anger, and sorrows would be contagious and would be shared by others in this small community far away from human habitation. He could not let his personal sorrow affect the general mood of the fighters. Whenever unknowing young fighters called him Weiguo's Father, he felt pain as if his heart had been stabbed with a knife, although he loudly responded to their calls with a smiling face. He shed his tears when he was alone. More often than not, on the reefs, whoever received a letter from his family would read it aloud in public. One day, platoon leader Qian Renping received two letters from his family. One, dated 13 February, was sent by his wife, and the other, dated 17 April, by his father. Gathering around him, fighters asked him to read aloud the letter from his Snow White as quickly as possible. He opened the letter and read aloud a paragraph: "Renping, I am in very good health. You have to go through hardships on the Nansha Islands. Take good care of yourself. I have been looking forward to receiving your letter for three full months. To date, I still have received none from you. This time, you must send me as many letters as you can write." Here, he stopped reading and folded the letter. He wanted to enjoy reading it at his ease sometime later. Then, he opened the other letter from his old father. After he had read a few lines, tears began welling in his eyes. His father told him that Qian's wife had contracted liver cancer and had passed away two months ago. His wife spent a whole afternoon writing the short letter to him on her deathbed. Qian Renping could not bear the sudden blow. However, when he received a notice to immediately return home by the next available vessel, he shook his head and said: "There are no previous arrangements. I cannot just go and leave my work unattended." Wiping tears off his face, he silently sat at his desk again. In a pillbox on the Nansha Islands, we saw the following scene on a TV screen: A few fighters stood in the waist-deep seawater; holding guns in their hands and standing close to each other, they were defending a national flag. We also listened to the story about the deeds of Fighter Zhou Jianguo, who gloriously sacrificed himself during the construction of a pillbox, and we heard about the instances of asphalt felt melting and thermometers bursting under the scorching sun of the Nansha Islands. Officers and men repeatedly told us stories about such incidents. We found the story about the arduous struggle at sea unforgettable. In October 1993, Typhoon No. 20 hit the main pillbox. High waves rolled over the rooftop of the three-story-high building. Erected structures and equipment lying on an area of 600 square meters of the construction site were swept away. Seeing the erected structures and equipment on the construction site disappearing before their eyes, the fighters wept. Swept away before their eyes were kitchen utensils, foodstuffs, materials, towels, soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste, clothes to be washed, and equipment for fighters' activities. What else could they use for food, clothing, and equipment on the construction site? The party branch decided that what had not been swept away by the typhoon must be used in a centralized way. Officers and men contributed for common use all the canned food, cigarettes, towels, and instant noodles that they had saved for themselves. Cans were used as bowls and washbasins as pans. Bamboo broomsticks which had not been used were split open and cut short for use as chopsticks. Two people took turns wearing three sets of clothes. The fighters received a cookie every other day. Despite such hardships, the fighters did not fail to perform their duties at their posts or to stand guard for 20 days in a row. Such was the dedication by sentries at the remotest corner of China's territory. The spiritual force supporting them was, there is no doubt, the four large characters inscribed on the (Yushu) Reef of the Nansha Islands -- Long live the motherland.
