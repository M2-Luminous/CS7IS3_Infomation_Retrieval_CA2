The idea was voiced by participants in an economic conference of scientific and business circles. "I am in favor of switching to taxation of natural resources and using ground rent instead of stifling taxes on profits and wages," P. Filippov said. However, some other proposals made during the conference "create a complex impression," he said. In particular, in P. Filippov's opinion, the proposal from one of the conference organizers, the economist Sergey Glazyev, for a "compulsory freeze on amortization payments" would ruin enterprises. The head of the presidential administration's analytical center is also worried by the "talk about enforced vertical integration of industry." "We had this with ministries and departments. If we want to create viable financial and industrial complexes, they must develop from the mutual interests of the participants and not according to the will of state officials," he said.
