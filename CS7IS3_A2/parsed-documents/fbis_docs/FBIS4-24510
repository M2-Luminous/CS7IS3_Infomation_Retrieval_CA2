C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- The government will take a four-pronged approach in its bid to build Taiwan into an Asia- Pacific business operations center, Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of the Council for Economic Planning and Development said late Friday [27 May]. Hsiao made the statement on the second and final day of a two-day Asia-Pacific Conference of the International Association of Financial Executives Institutes (IAFEI). The government will strive to promote economic liberalization and entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to enhance the sound development of trade ties across the Taiwan strait, to improve the economic structure, and to overhaul outdated rules and regulations, he noted. Emphasis will be placed on the exchanges of manpower, goods, capital and information, on cross-strait cooperation in labor force and resources, on infrastructure construction, and on revising laws involving transportation, telecommunications, and financing, he elaborated. Stressing that trade ties between Taiwan and other parties of the Asia-Pacific region have been cordial, he said two-way trade reached US$120 billion last year, accounting for 75 percent of Taiwan's total foreign trade volume. As of the end of 1993, he pointed out, Taiwan investors channeled about US$20 billion into this part of the world, of which US$15 billion went to Mainland China. Judging from Taiwan's geographical location, economic performance, technical knowhow, high-caliber manpower, and cultural background, the island boasts many advantages in its ambition to become an Asia-Pacific business operations hub, he said. The IAFEI's Asia-Pacific meeting was held in Taipei in coincidence with the 20th anniversary of the Financial Executives Institute of the Republic of China [ROC], which sponsored the two- day forum. Governor Samuel Shieh of the central bank of China and Indonesia's Industry Minister Tunki Ariwibowo [name as received] were invited to deliver keynote speeches at the meeting. The conference, which had as its theme "prosperity through cooperation and integration," brought together a number of financial heavyweights including IAFEI President Brian Rose, President Emilia Bien Bien Roxas [name as received] of the Asia Trust Group, and Director I. R. M. Ramsay of Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong.
