The sources said that the arrest campaign concentrated on the capital Baghdad and on the Iraqi town of al-Mawsil in the north. Earlier reports spoke of large-scale arrests, including officers on active service as well as retired officers, in Baghdad and other towns following the distribution of leaflets attacking the Iraqi regime on the occasion of the Iraqi Army's 73d anniversary on 6 January. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has obtained a copy of the first communique issued then by the "provisional national leadership," which, according to Iraqi opposition sources, consists mostly of Iraqi Army officers. According to the communique, this group operates inside Iraq within the ranks of the Army with the aim of overthrowing President Saddam Husayn's regime "and transferring the constitutional powers to the Iraqi people and their institutions" after a six-month transitional period. The communique declares that "Iraq's giant -- the army -- has now awakened...to end this tyranny," and that the birth of this leadership "marks the beginning of the march for the destruction of that germ." An official of an Iraqi opposition group which operates abroad and which has received a copy of the communique, says that it was distributed in Baghdad, al-Mawsil, and other towns and that one of the copies was smuggled out by travelers to Jordan. The communique appears to have been drafted in simpler and more realistic language than the statements issued usually by professional politicians of the Iraqi opposition abroad, and its emphasis is on a decisive role by the Iraqi Army to change Saddam Husayn's regime. The group in whose name the communique was issued is probably trying to cause a split within the security and intelligence organs and the Republican Guard, which are under the tight control of Saddam Husayn and members of his family, after the failure to secure their support in past coup attempts. The communique appealed to "our brothers and sons in the armed forces and internal security forces, including the Army, the Republican Guard, the police, the public security forces, the intelligence forces, and the special security forces, as well as the brothers in the party organizations." It reassured them that their lives and rights would be protected. This is the first time that a military group has announced itself inside Iraq with the stated aim of changing the regime. In the past such statements were issued by small groups of officers who managed to escape abroad during the years of the Iraq-Iran war, the occupation of Kuwait, and the war which led to the liberation of Kuwait. The communique said that the next regime should "steer our political and economic courses in a manner suited to our capabilities as a Gulf oil state...to build a modern Iraq and divert its economic resources to the service of its people not, as Saddam did, squander billions and billions of hard currency on the purchase and manufacture of arms of mass destruction and an arsenal which destroyed Iraq and slaughtered its people and which was used to invade Kuwait and threaten the states of the region and undermine their security." The communique also said that the aim of the group which issued it was to overthrow Saddam Husayn's regime and "transfer power to the people so that they would rule themselves through their representatives elected by free ballot and in the framework of a system of government approved by the people, with emphasis on the impartiality of the judiciary and on the rule of law...without discrimination between Iraq's nationalities, communities, religions, sects, or political or ideological trends, with emphasis on the neutrality of the armed forces and the internal security forces." It stressed that the transitional period during which the group itself would govern would not exceed six months. Directly addressing the neighboring states and the international community, the "provisional national leadership" said in its communique that it would abide by the "UN charter and resolutions, the Arab League charter, and international conventions." It affirmed that it would "open a new and bright era of relations based on mutual respect and interests. We also emphasize that we would resolve all border problems permanently so as not be preoccupied with them ever again in the future."
