Such was the characterization given the elections to the oblast Duma and the city municipal committees by V. Varukhin, representative of the president of the Russian Federation in the oblast. And in fact, of the 17 elected deputies in the oblast, six are heads of city administration, and another three are bureaucrats. However, this victory can be counted a Pyrrhic one. Only 33 percent of the oblast residents who had the right to vote participated in the elections. In most of the districts, the elections were declared invalid by the oblast electoral commission. That is to the oblast Duma. Things are not any better with the municipal committees: In two of the oblast's large cities--in Rybinsk and Rostov--elections did not take place at all, and in Yaroslavl, only partially. The main reason for this "victory" is the absolute apoliticism of the voters. And the people of Yaroslavl, in turn, reserve the right to mock the points of the candidates' election platforms and the means of their presentation. Thus, one of the directors of a Yaroslavl enterprise permitted vodka to be sold on the territory of the plant during the election campaign. The vodka was wrapped in a sheet with the director's election program on it. Another candidate, when presenting his program on local television, was asked how he planned to implement it; he replied: "I know some sly tricks that will help me out." The contender preferred not to go into the details of what these "tricks" might be. A third, in order to get the youth vote, promised to organize "sex buses," where young men and women could meet without the danger of being caught by their parents. Against the background of these "sly tricks" and "sex buses," bureaucrats and directors of major enterprises looked quite a bit more attractive: They really could do something more serious. True, most of them did not believe that this "something more serious" would make their life easier, and they "voted with their feet," virtually ignoring the elections. In the districts where all of the contenders were rejected, runoff elections will be held on 24 April. And the oblast electoral commission set a condition: All candidates, the new and the previous ones, must again collect the necessary number of signatures. So this is the second track, which is in danger of turning into an exclusive one.
