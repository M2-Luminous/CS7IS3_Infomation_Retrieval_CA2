Shipments of high quality farm produce would take care of 30 billion rubles and Moldova would have to draw on loans from international organizations to pay off the remaining part of the 126 billion ruble debt. To avert the repetition of what had happened, action must be taken to enforce, at last, the Commonwealth's economic accord. President Snegur suggested that the next Commonwealth summit remove all the barriers between the former Soviet republics.
