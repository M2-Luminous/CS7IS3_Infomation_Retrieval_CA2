The move reflected recent declines in the coupon on long-term government bonds, the officials said. Given the rate reduction, the ministry will consult with the Construction Ministry to decide on new rates on public loans extended by Housing Loan Corp. The new base rate, for example, on loans for purchasing newly built housing with floor space of up to 125 square meters, is expected to go down by 0.15 percentage point to an annual 3.90 percent, effective the same day. The base rates on public housing loans link with those on lending by Finance Ministry's Trust Fund Bureau by using funds of the fiscal investment and loan program. The current housing loan rates of 4.05 percent were set on April 22 after a round of rate hikes from an all-time low of 3.60 percent marked on Jan. 26.
