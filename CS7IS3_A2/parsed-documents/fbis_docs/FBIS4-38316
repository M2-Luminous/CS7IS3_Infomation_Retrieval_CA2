The tour aims at briefing the media on the Israeli encroachments on Jordanian territory and waters in various areas along the armistice line, from al-Yarmuk River in the north to the Gulf of Aqaba in the south. Our correspondent Jawad al-'Umari was part of the media team and will present us with the following report: [Begin recording] [Al-'Umari] The media team set out yesterday from the Information Ministry to Ghawr al-Safi area, via al-Karak. In the Jordan Valley area, the team visited a Jordanian Armed Forces unit and was briefed by the head of the Operations Branch on the duties of the units and formations of the Southern Military Region, which extends from the southern part of the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba, and the projects executed by the Armed Forces in these areas, including schools, earth dams, and population surveys. The team was also briefed by the unit commander on the duties and tasks of his unit. Throughout yesterday and last night, the media team visited a number of points opposite the occupied Jordanian lands and the waters that are being encroached upon in the Dead Sea and in water basins. They saw from a distance the position of the Jordanian borders before the repeated Israeli attacks, which started in 1952. The media team stopped at the southern part of the Dead Sea, Ghawr Sifa, and al-Salmani Police Post area, to the west of which the major Israeli encroachment on Jordanian territory starts and extends south, for various distances, to the Gulf of Aqaba. The team also stopped at 'Ayn Hasab area, where the Israeli encroachments reach their maximum, up to 8 km inside the Jordanian territory. Israel utilized that area for agriculture. It also utilized the ground water reservoir by drilling artesian wells to irrigate crops. The team also saw the Wadi al-Ghuwayb area, a tributary to the Wadi al-'Arabah resources and the 'Ayn Daha area, where the Israeli encroachment reaches between 5 to 6 km. Waters and lands in the area were also utilized for agriculture by Israel. The team also visited al-Rishah area, the point of water distribution, that is, the highest point in Wadi al-'Arabah. Waters flow from that point to the Dead Sea in the north and to the Red Sea in the south. In the Gharandal area, the media team visited a Southern Military Region unit. The unit commander gave a briefing on the area's nature and the battles that occurred there throughout history, as well as the battles fought by the Jordanian Armed Forces in defense of Palestine and Jordanian territory. The team also saw the remnants of some of the battles fought by the Armed Forces and the airfield in the area which was used by the British mandate forces during World War I. The media team then left for the Gulf of Aqaba via the Qa'at Tabah area, which was proposed by Israel as the venue for negotiations on border demarcation. The media team was briefed by the commander of al-'Aqabah Military Region on the border dispute in that area and Israeli encroachments on Jordanian lands and waters, as specified by the Mandate Document in 1928. During the tour, Brigadier General Mansur Abu-Rashid, head of the joint Jordanian truce committee, gave a detailed explanation of the Israeli encroachments inside Jordanian territory. Brig. Gen. Abu-Rashid spoke to our radio at the Gulf of Aqaba area: [Brig. Gen Abu-Rashid] The encroachments start in the area south of the Dead Sea, al-Safi, and Sifa areas. These encroachments extended to the southern area. In Gharandal area there were encroachments. Let me say that along the borders down to the Red Sea, there were encroachments. Sometimes these encroachments are deep, and, at others there are encroachments inside only a few hundreds of meters from the international borders defined by the British Mandate Document, which stipulates that the middle of Wadi al-'Arabah is the international borderline between Palestine and Jordan in the mandate era. [Al-'Umari] Dr. Mundhir Haddadin, member of the Jordanian delegation to the peace talks, head of the Jordanian team to the waters working group in the multilateral conference, and member of the tripartite economic committee, accompanied the media team on this tour. Dr. Haddadin spoke to our radio on the negotiating situation of Jordanian territory within the context of the Jordanian-Israeli track and the projects planned to be executed to develop the Jordan Valley region after reaching a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace. Dr. Haddadin said: [Haddadin] Jordanian territory occupied by Israel in the southern area is about 360 square km in area. In the fifth clause of the joint agenda, which we reached with Israel in September 1993, the two parties agreed that borders between Israel and Jordan should be delineated on the basis of the borders stipulated by the document of British mandate over Palestine and Trans-Jordan in the early 1920's.
