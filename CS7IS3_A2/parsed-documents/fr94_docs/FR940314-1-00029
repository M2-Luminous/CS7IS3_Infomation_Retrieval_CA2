FR940314-1-00029 FR940314-1-00008 Ford and Mazda first advised the agency of a possible compliance issue concerning the Mazda-designed locking system in September 1992, shortly after the requirement at issue became effective. Ford advised that if key removal were attempted while the transmission shift lever on a large proportion of 1993 Escorts and Tracers was placed at various points between the ``reverse'' and ``park'' detents, the key could be removed while the selector lever was held short of engaging the ``park'' detent, and without the transmission becoming locked in park. Ford and Mazda also demonstrated these vehicles to NHTSA personnel. These personnel found that the transmission shift lever could be moved to a position where it appeared to be in ``park,'' but where in fact the lever was not fully in the ``park'' position. After releasing the shift lever in this position, the personnel could remove the key without the transmission's becoming locked in park. As indicated above, in its November 1992 interpretation letter, NHTSA rejected Ford's suggestion that the agency interpret Standard No. 114 to prevent key removal only when the transmission shift lever is in one of the available gear positioning detents other than ``park.'' The agency stated that its interpretation was consistent with the agency's intent in promulgating S4.2.1, explaining: As discussed in several rulemaking notices, NHTSA amended Standard No. 114 to prevent vehicle rollaway caused by unattended children shifting the transmission lever in automatic transmission vehicles. If a driver were able to remove the key while the transmission or transmission shift lever were not locked in park, and if the transmission or transmission shift lever did not become locked in ``park'' as a result of removing the key, a child might later shift the transmission shift lever, thereby causing a vehicle rollaway. For this reason, we continue to believe that this amendment to Standard No. 114 meets the need for motor vehicle safety. Subsequent to issuing the November 1992 interpretation letter, the agency conducted a number of compliance tests for Standard No. 114. As a result of these tests, the agency sent letters to Mazda, Ford, Honda, GM, Suzuki, and Hyundai, advising that, for certain of their vehicles, there was an apparent noncompliance with Standard No. 114's provision requiring that key removal be prevented unless the transmission or transmission shift lever is locked in park or becomes locked in park as a direct result of removing the key. (Copies of the correspondence between NHTSA and these manufacturers, and the compliance test reports for the vehicles at issue, have been placed in the docket for this NPRM.) For all of the vehicles for which tests showed apparent noncompliances, it was possible to remove the ignition key from the key-locking system when the transmission shift lever was in a position between ``park'' and ``reverse,'' without the transmission becoming locked in ``park'' as a result of removing the key. The circumstances under which the ignition key could be removed when the transmission shift lever was between ``park'' and ``reverse'' varied. For some vehicles, the lever could simply be placed in a position between park and reverse, the hand that controlled it removed, and the key then removed. For certain of these vehicles, this happened only over a very small range of lever movement when the lever was very close to the park position and appeared to be in park, when in fact it was not fully in the park position. For other vehicles, this condition existed for about half of the range of lever movement between park and reverse. For another set of vehicles, key removal without the transmission becoming locked in park only happened if one hand was kept on the transmission lever while the key was removed with the other hand, since the transmission lever would ``spring'' into park if the hand holding it between the two positions was removed. NHTSA also notes that, while it was not a compliance issue before September 1, 1993, in some cases the transmission shift lever could be moved from the ``park'' position after the key was removed if the thumb button on the transmission shift lever was kept depressed while the shift lever was moved to the ``park'' position and the key was removed. (For a discussion of this issue, see October 21, 1992 interpretation letter to Transportation Research Center, Inc., which has been placed in the docket for this NPRM.) With respect to the problem of child-induced rollaway, the safety consequences of permitting these types of apparently noncomplying systems are dependent on the likelihood that drivers would, in fact, remove the key in a manner that the transmission would not be locked in park after such removal. If the existing requirement is complied with, removal of the ignition key gives absolute assurance that the transmission is (or will become) locked in ``park'' and that vehicle movement will not occur as a result of the shift lever being moved. If the proposed requirement is complied with, removal of the ignition key while the transmission shift lever is fully placed in any designated shift position would give the same assurance that the transmission is (or will become) locked in ``park,'' but the requirement would no longer prohibit key removal in the circumstance when the lever is between detents. NHTSA is not aware of any specific reported crashes that would be relevant to permitting these systems.
