In his speech, Chen Bangzhu called on all provincial departments and bureaus to conscientiously study, implement, and carry out the newly promulgated revenue system, study problems cropping up in the course of the new revenue system enforcement, and strive to promote a sustained and rapid provincial economic growth. Provincial Vice Governor Zhou Bohua also attended the meeting chaired by provincial Executive Vice Governor Wang Keying. The meeting pointed out: Since being officially enacted on 1 January, 1994, the new revenue system has been smoothly enforced in Hunan Province. Nonetheless, a number of problems have also been encountered in this process, including lack of adequate measures, uneven tax burdens, and lack of circulating funds among enterprises, and so on. In view of the above-mentioned situation, Chen Bangzhu stated: In order to secure efficient new revenue system enforcement and smooth convergence between the new revenue system and the old revenue system, leaders at all levels, especially leaders of revenue departments at all levels, should exert their utmost to grasp and digest the main spirit of the new revenue system, this being a crucial link in providing services to enterprises. Chen Bangzhu called on all departments and bureaus concerned to set up ad hoc groups that will conscientiously investigate and study problems cropping up in the course of the new revenue system enforcement and report their findings to the administrative departments at higher levels so as to minimize friction and collisions in the process of converging the new revenue system with the old one. Chen Bangzhu emphatically urged the provincial revenue bureau to start publicizing the PRC Revenue Law on a large scale, and take the initiative to join other provincial departments and bureaus concerned in studying and resolving problems in this regard. Chen Bangzhu finally called on all trades and professions across the province to waste no time in collecting taxes and work hard to fulfill revenue quotas upon schedule.
