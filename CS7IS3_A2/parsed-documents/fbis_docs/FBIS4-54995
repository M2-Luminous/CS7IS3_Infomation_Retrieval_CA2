They discussed the situation in Gorazde, Sarajevo, and some other locations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and in particular the respect for adopted UN documents and their implementation on the ground. After the talks they briefly met with reporters. Here is a report by Arijana Barukcija: [Begin Sergio de Mello recording, in English with superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian] We have just ended a lengthy and detailed exchange of views with President Izetbegovic. These talks came after the meeting with Prime Minister Siljadzic in Vienna yesterday morning and the meeting with Karadzic in Pale last night. As we had planned, we discussed some very difficult and urgent matters. These obviously included the problem of the passage of tanks through the 20km exclusion zone around Sarajevo, the question of Gorazde, and some other seemingly small, but, in fact, very important difficulties, which need to be resolved. I even held talks with a representative of the Bosnian Serb forces about the withdrawal from the three km zone. (We also discussed) the problem of a possible, but very difficult return of refugees in conditions where heavy weapons are still present in the 20km zone around Gorazde, something that we still cannot confirm. [sentence as heard] We also discussed the situation in Brcko. You know that we deployed a certain number of observers there yesterday and today. I informed President Izetbegovic about the agreement on this area, and also about the proposals by the Bosnian Serb army on a cease-fire in the Posavina corridor. We also discussed some other important issues, such as the freedom of movement within and out of Sarajevo as a result of the agreement signed at Sarajevo airport on 17 March, where he, himself, was present. These are the basic questions we discussed with President Izetbegovic yesterday and this morning. [end recording] President Izetbegovic also commented on the talks. [Begin Izetbegovic recording] Yes, we discussed exactly what Mr. de Mello said. As regards the mistakes made here in the Sarajevo exclusion zone, we adhere to our position. We demand that the UN control the behavior of the Serbs in the Sarajevo zone more effectively than has been the case so far. As regards Gorazde, of course, we insist on the removal of all armed individuals, whether they wear blue or green uniforms on the Serb side. They must be removed from the three km zone so that our people can return there. In that respect we still have had no reply. As I understood, Mr. de Mello is expecting an (answer) today. We will see what happens. We will, of course, continue to insist on this. This is the minimum level of justice that we expect in Gorazde. Our people have been squeezed into a very narrow, small area on the left bank of the River Drina. The Serb side will try to settle their population there. This has to be prevented by all means and to protect the parts where the Muslim population live in the Gorazde area. It would be positive if the situation in Brcko were to calm down. We do not want any war, any fighting there. They have made contact with our local commanders in the area. General Hazim Sadic [2d Corps commander] informed us about this initiative. We said they should inform us here about the initiative and we will then give them a definite answer on what else could be done in the Brcko area. [end recording]
