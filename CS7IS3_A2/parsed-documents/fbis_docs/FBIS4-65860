FBIS4-65860 "drweu101aa_94006" FBIS-WEU-94-101 Daily Report 24 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Bosnian, Serb Republic Leaders To Attend Bosnian, Serb Republic Leaders To Attend AU2405143494 Paris AFP in English 1329 GMT 24 May 94 AU2405143494 Paris AFP English BFN [Excerpts] Paris, May 24 (AFP) -- Bosnia's warring factions will meet Wednesday [25 May] in the French town of Talloires with a contact group trying to restart the Bosnian peace process, a French diplomatic source said Wednesday. The source said that the Moslem-led Bosnian government would be represented by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and the Serbs by the speaker of their self-proclaimed parliament, Momcilo Krajisnic. In Zagreb, radio reports said Kresimir Zubak, the top Bosnian Croat leader, planned to attend the talks. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe earlier announced that the contact group would meet in Talloires, in the French alps, but he did not mention that the warring factions would attend the meeting. [passage omitted] Krajisnik, the Bosnian Serb speaker, arrived in Geneva later Tuesday, according to sources close to the contact group. The Geneva sources said Silajdzic and Zubak had already arrived in the Swiss city. Diplomatic sources in Geneva said preliminary talks would be held later Tuesday in Talloires in preparation for the meeting Wednesday. Before leaving Belgrade, Krajisnik was quoted by the Belgrade news agency BETA as saying that the resumption of negotiations on Bosnia were "hitting up against some big problems." He did not specify what these were, however. Krajisnik was accompanied by his his self-proclaimed Serb republic's "foreign minister" Aleksandar Buha. The BETA agency, quoting an official communique, had said Krajisnik would outline the Bosnian Serb position to international mediators David Owen for the European Union and Thorvald Stoltenberg for the United Nations. It said the Serb side would ask for a "final" stop to fighting throughout Bosnia-Hercegovina and demand to be "treated the same" as other parties. This was taken to mean that the Bosnian Serb negotiators would link their participation in negotiations to lifting international sanctions decreed against the rump Yugoslavia in May 1992.
