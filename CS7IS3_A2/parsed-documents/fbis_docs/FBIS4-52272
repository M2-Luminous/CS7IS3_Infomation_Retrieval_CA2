An official of the administration said foreign seamen can now disembark at South Korean ports with short-term visas only. In the past, Korean-Chinese seamen were prohibited from disembarking in the country in fear that they may illegally find jobs while landing. To facilitate the new step, the government has prepared a guideline for the issuance of visas to foreign seamen for implementation retroactive to May 1. It replaces the guideline for the issuance of visas to Chinese seamen. Presently a total of 951 foreign seamen work at Korean-flag freighters and fishing boats.
