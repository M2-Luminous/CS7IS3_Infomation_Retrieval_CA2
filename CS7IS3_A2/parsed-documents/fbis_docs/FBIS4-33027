While Liberal Ernesto Samper Pizano prefers to seek increased support from his party, including its former Colombian presidents, Conservative Andres Pastrana Arango prefers social aspects such as employment and education in his government program. Mr. Samper Pizano said he will focus on the agricultural sector. He said this sector must be saved to ensure the peasants continue living on their plots. Although the directorate of the 19 April Movement Democratic Alliance will decide what political course to follow this Thursday, in view of the electoral defeat suffered last Sunday, there have already been contacts with the Samper camp to reach some agreements. The two presidential candidates will start a new and fast-paced race for the Presidency today. They will try to maintain or increase the electoral support they received on 29 May. The two of them garnered nearly 5.2 million votes. Liberal statesmen Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala and Alfonso Lopez Michelsen are expected to renew their support for candidate Samper Pizano and to urge citizens to vote. Despite the optimism of the two candidates about winning a majority of the votes in the 19 June runoff, groups such as National Exporters Association and Asoexpro [expansion unknown] predicted a lower turnout in the runoffs due to tiresome abstentionism, a lack of political culture, the poor definition [poca identidad] of the parties, and the enthusiasm displayed by Colombia for the opening of the world soccer championship in the United States.
