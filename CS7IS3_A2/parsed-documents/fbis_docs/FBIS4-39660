The candidate replied: "I have never, not even in my sleep, ever said anywhere to anyone anything about a political union with Russia. As for economic ties, ask people on the shop floor, would they reject that?" Meanwhile, Kuchma said he opposed Ukraine's accession to the ruble zone: "This would lead to loss of sovereignty." He spoke in favor of strong authority which world practice had proven to be the only force capable of implementing economic reforms. "Only one person should take the responsibility," he added. "That's why if I win I will initially act as prime minister as well as perform full presidential duties."
