On the basis of the amnesty decision adopted by the State Duma (lower house of parliament), the court ruled to drop criminal processings against former top Soviet officials who were involved in the August 19, 1991 event, which has been called an "abortive Soviet coup" by Russian authorities. The amnesty covers the organizers of the August 19 event of 1991 and the May Day demonstration of 1993, and opposition leaders arrested in the tank attack on the parliament building in Moscow last October. Among the freed were former Russian parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov and former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy.
