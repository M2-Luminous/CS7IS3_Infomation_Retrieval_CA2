The draft action program, subtitled, "Let's Win Back Power and Do Our Best To Boost the Economy so as To Protect the National Life," is scheduled to be adopted at the LDP's annual convention on Friday. According to the draft plan, the LDP, toppled from power last August after 38 years in power, describes the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa as "a weird government filled with deception and contradiction." The LDP asserts its fall from power is not attributable to its mistakes on policy matters but to its defectors' move to join hands with other parties in their lust for power, the draft says, referring to an LDP splinter, Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party). It says the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest force in the seven-party coalition, is remote from other partners on its stance on basic policies such as diplomacy, national security and the partial opening of Japan's rice market. In the plan, the LDP also slams coalition member party Komeito for its alleged violation of the Constitution which stipulates the separation of religion and politics. Komeito is backed by a Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist lay organization. The presence of the SDP and Komeito in the coalition "puts the Hosokawa cabinet in imminent danger," the draft argues. In a thinly disguised reference to Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is said to be controlling Hosokawa from behind the scenes, it says the coalition has shown the "dictatorial nature" through its management of political and other issues. On political reform, the draft action program says the now-deposed LDP will seek further modifications of a package of government-sponsored reform measures in its favor and push them through in the current extraordinary Diet session, due to end on January 29. The reform legislation, aimed at rooting out rampant political corruption, cleared the House of Representatives in mid-November and is pending in the House of Councillors. The LDP and the coalition still remain apart on the final shape of the bills, including the balance between single-seat constituencies and the proportional representation system for new lower house elections. To ensure its comeback to power, according to the draft, the LDP should repent from its lawmakers' involvement in an array of past scandals, boost its self-cleansing power and give strong discretion and power to the party president and party organizations. The draft program calls for the LDP to continue its stance against turning Japan into a military superpower in favor of amendments to the Constitution. Noting Japan should occupy a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, the LDP will raise awareness of Japanese people on the matter, the draft says.
