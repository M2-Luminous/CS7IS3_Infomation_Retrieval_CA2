Akhundov, chairman of the board of the Azerbaijan Industrial-Investment Joint-Stock Commercial Bank, by A. Gamedov, VYSHKA economic observer; place and date not given: "Life Generates Tactics, or Banks in the Transitional Stage"] [Text] Today many people are dissatisfied with the activity of the banks. Some people are inclined to think that they are almost the main parties to blame for the production slump. It has become a rule of good form to constantly berate them, but the bank workers have their reasons which are based on a deeper penetration into the economy of the transition stage. But in fact how should correct relations be arranged between the economic subjects and the banks so as to surmount difficulties through joint efforts. This was the topic of a discussion with the chairman of the board of the Azerbaijan Industrial-Investment Joint-Stock Commercial Bank, A.N. Akhundov. He was born in 1950 and in 1973 he graduated from the "Finance and Credit" department of the Institute of the National Economy, after which he was sent to work as a regular credit inspector to the republic Stroybank [Construction Bank] office. He went in sequence through all the steps of the service ladder. At the end of last year he was elected chairman of the board of the joint-stock commercial Prominvestbank, which was created on the basis of Promstroybank [Industrial Construction Bank]. [Gamedov] Abulfaz Nuruyevich, please tell us about your bank's place in the republic's finance-credit system. Why is it needed, what are its functions? [Akhundov] Azerbaijan has a two-level banking system. It is headed by the National Bank, which is under the jurisdiction of the republic National Assembly. The second level is occupied by commercial banks. They too are divided into two parts: one is made up of joint-stock commercial banks in which the government owns controlling blocks of shares. It includes Prominvestbank, Agroprombank, the International Bank, and Sberbank. The second consists of a large group of purely commercial banks. There is a total of about 160 of them. Among the aforementioned credit institutions, Prominvestbank has the largest amount of authorized capital--it amounts to 4 billion rubles [R]. [Gamedov] What brought about the transformation of your bank into a joint-stock commercial bank? [Akhundov] The demands of life, the need to reform the economy, its shift to market principles. Among the first legal normative acts adopted by the Milli Majlis in 1992 was the Law "On Banks and Banking Activity in the Azerbaijan Republic." Our bank was transferred into a joint-stock commercial one on its basis. Its position in our economy is determined by the fact that 90 percent of the industrial enterprises and construction organizations, state concerns, joint-stock companies, etc., are served by our bank. And they constitute the republic's industrial might. Its founders are Agroprombank, the State Fund for Social Security of the Population, Sberbank, the state metallurgy concerns, Azerigaz, the Ministry of Material Resources, the Azglavenergo Production Association, the household air conditioner plant, Glavbekstroy, Kaspar, the Khazar Joint-Stock Company, the Aran Corporation, and others. The volume of credit investments is R380 billion, which amounts to more than half of the credit investments in Azerbaijan. We render to our clients the entire complex of banking services--accounting-cash operations, credit, and consultation, we accept deposits from the population, etc. [Gamedov] According to information available to the editorial office, the republic has no enterprises, organizations, or institutions that are not indebted to one another. What work is the bank doing to settle mutual debts among your clients? [Akhundov] Indeed, the labor collectives have borrowed a great deal from one another for the delivery of processed materials, raw materials, finished products, work performed, and services rendered. The sum of these debts as of 1 October was more than R150 million. Throughout this year in the system of Prominvestbank the offsetting of mutual claims was carried out six times. The sum of defaulted debts that were paid came to approximately R250 million. The effectiveness of the offsetting depends on whether or not all enterprises, organizations, and institutions, and also banks, participate in them. To our great dismay, many enterprises and organizations did not participate in the offsetting of claims, except in October, and neither did all the banks. There were even cases where the leaders of a number of branches who were accustomed to complaining about everything and who had arranged in the government for conducting the offsetting remained on the sidelines as soon as the matter became a part of their practical work. Moreover, enterprises and organizations under their jurisdiction refused to participate in them. Enterprises of the production association Azenergo, of the state concern Azerkhimiya, the State Committee on Fuel and Energy, and others, behaved irresponsibly. [Gamedov] Did you share in the October offsetting of accounts? [Akhundov] Yes, I gave it a higher rating because a relatively greater effect was achieved. According to its results the sum of payments made on account reached a half trillion rubles in the republic as a whole. For this purpose the banks issued credit in the amount of R200 billion, and R300 billion was paid out of money paid by debtors to their partners. We shall conduct a similar offsetting of mutual claims in December. In this connection I am conveying through VYSHKA a request to the leaders of branches, enterprises, and organizations that during the remaining weeks they check all the debts against one another and provide for cashing in payment documents. Incidentally, the banks of Azerbaijan have created extremely favorable conditions for the clients. The offsetting will be accompanied not only by payment for all documents that are in the card catalog but also payment for documents that will be due during the period when the offsetting is conducted. That is the first thing. Second, in order to conduct it, credit will be granted with a sharp reduction of the interest rate, although this is to the detriment of the interests of the banks, since it will reduce their profit. The condition of the economy of Azerbaijan prompted us to adopt this tactic. We are doing this exclusively in the interests of the production collectives so that they will be able to cast off their heavy financial burden more quickly, rid themselves of debts, and put their working capital in order. Unfortunately, not all businessmen are understanding about our countersteps and are exerting no effort to improve the state of affairs. I must say that such extremely favorable conditions for granting credit--only 5-10 percent--do not exist in any other CIS country. Businessmen must skillfully take advantage of this situation so as to end up this year with less financial strain. [Gamedov] As I understand it a large number of labor collectives are constantly experiencing strain in finances. Because the existing constraints on funds make it impossible for them to organize production normally. [Akhundov] That is because the unbridled and insane inflation has greatly devalued the working capital of the enterprises, organizations, and institutions and it is actually worth nothing. They turn this working capital and bank credit into debit indebtedness through the prepayment of accounts and they earn foreign currency, which then lies in the bank without moving. It would be more correct to receive the debit indebtedness promptly, transfer it for prepayment when selling their products or rendering services, and put the foreign currency that is in the account into circulation either directly or by receiving rubles to cover it through the Baku Interbank Currency Exchange. There are other shortcomings as well. A number of commodity producers do not sell their final products promptly, waiting for the next price hike. I will give some examples which provide a general idea of the great unutilized potential. Thus R257 million worth of items have been stockpiled at the plant for household air conditioners, the Bytmash Plant is holding consumer goods worth 65 million, RORO [not further identified] Mebel--R530 million, Bakvinzavod No. 2--R78 million, the Baku textile combine imeni G.Z. Tagiyev--R91 million, and the Baku spinning-fabric association for children's items--R31 million. [Gamedov] In order to formulate the next question I shall give two cases described in VYSHKA. In increasing the output of products everything depends on the transfer of money to the suppliers in order to acquire materials from them, but the banking system has been spinning its wheels for a long time now, according to the chairman of the STK [council of the labor collective] of the leasing sewing association imeni Ala Bayramov, F. Kafarov. "To transfer money through one bank into another even within Baku takes many days, which impedes its circulation," states the deputy general director of the Azstankoprom Production Association, M. Ismaylov. There is no transfer of money to pay for raw and processed materials or batching items, or else this operation takes many months--the enterprises are doomed to stand idle. Therefore, the conclusion arises of its own accord: during the stage of transition to the market the banks are failing to perform one of their basic functions for prompt transfer of money on instructions from the clients. Is this not so? [Akhundov] These are serious accusations, and we must look into them right now. Let us pose this question: Do the enterprises have anything to transfer, for example, to the CIS countries? If they do, there are no obstacles to that. In order to facilitate the transfer of funds, Prominvestbank is working actively to create direct ties with commercial banks of the CIS countries. Among the measures that have been taken is the opening of correspondent accounts in Moscow, Minsk, Almaty, Tbilisi, Donetsk, Odessa, Makhachkala, Naberezhnyye Chelny, etc. Let us return to the fact that very frequently the enterprises do not have money to send to their partners in the CIS countries. Let us consider two aspects. The first is that they do not have this money because it is being accumulated in enterprises and organizations of nearby foreign countries. Thus the indebtedness on prepayment for goods and materials from our clients amounted to R9.7 billion and the debit indebtedness was R11 billion. Therefore they themselves are left without money. Either it must be returned or they must receive raw materials, processed materials, and batching items in order to load their own production more completely. The second aspect is that our labor collectives must make it a point to earn currency of the country with which they have economic ties. Then there will be no difficulties with transferring money. The problem can be approached from a different side. Let us say that our client has currency from Ukraine but does not have currency from Turkmenistan. Then the Baku Interbank Currency Exchange comes to its assistance. It is necessary to submit an application through the branch of our bank that serves him for the sale of karbovantsy and the purchase of Turkmen manats. All the other operations are conducted through the already existing structure and there is no need to submit an application for acquiring the currency of any other CIS country, even in cases when the enterprises have our manats. The same existing structure continues to operate. Unfortunately, the Baku Interbank Currency Exchange cannot operate normally because of the lack of enterprises wanting to sell the necessary currency. And I already gave the reason for this above--tardy repayment of debit indebtedness. The negative aspects must also be mentioned. There are still quite a few enterprises and organizations whose managers consciously and deliberately fail to return money for products that are delivered. At their request the money that is earned is transferred to commercial structures, not without selfish purposes, of course. How do we avoid such large losses? The government is preparing a document for monitoring exports on the basis of a form for accounting for prepayment or presentation of letters of credit. I think that the introduction of the new rules will make it possible to regulate the receipt of funds in Azerbaijan for products that are delivered. [Gamedov] And what about the transfer of money within the republic? [Akhundov] The mechanism for this was developed long ago and very precisely, and it is functioning reliably. We introduced a special program for daily processing of payment documentation on the computer. Therefore there are no grounds for the complaints from certain enterprises, including the Azstankoprom Production Association. If when running the program the computer deducts money from the account of one client, this necessarily must be reflected in the form of the deposit of this money into the account of another client. Otherwise the daily balance will not come out right, and this is the main method for performing banking activity. Let me emphasize especially that the money is transferred every day. There may be a delay, not through the bank's fault but through the fault of the workers of the enterprises and organizations themselves, who sometimes make mistakes when filling out the payment documents. Prominvestbank has 16 branches in Baku and two in Sumgait. All the information about the operation of these branches is received from them by the computers each day, and it is processed and sent back within 10-15 minutes. Our branches in Gyandzh, Mingyachevir, and other places will be hooked up to this computer network in the near future. [Gamedov] What is the purpose of transforming the former state bank into a joint-stock commercial bank? How many shares have been sold? [Akhundov] The advantages of reorganizing it are apparent. Previously the bank received money from Moscow in order to exist. We are now earning it ourselves, we attract funds from our clients, and we offer credit with interest. We have sold R200 million worth of shares to individuals. Of these shares, R150 million are unrestricted, so-called common stock and R50 million are preferred stock which is sold to workers of the founders. For now I cannot say anything about the amounts of the dividends from them. At the end of the year we will sum up the results, call a stockholders meeting, consult, and decide. Prominvestbank also has its depositors. Today there are R400 million in the accounts under extremely favorable conditions: if a deposit is left for a year it increases by 80 percent, and more than a year--it doubles. If anybody wants to obtain more interest on his money we invite them to join our depositors.
