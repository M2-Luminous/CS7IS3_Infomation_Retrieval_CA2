The area around the Bohai Sea, embracing the four provinces of Liaoning, Shandong, Hebei and Shanxi and the cities of Beijing and Tianjin, boasts many important ports whose combined handling capacity accounts for over 40 percent of the country's total. The central government has recently listed it among the regions to be developed first in the next century, because of its large import and export volume--half of the nation's total--and its trade relations with over 160 countries and regions. So far, Qingdao port has received a loan of 20 billion Japanese yen from the Japanese Government, and Dandong port, 20 million U.S. dollars in loans from the Asia Development Bank. Tianjin has also sought out cooperation with foreign investors. At present, port construction has progressed smoothly in the area. In Liaoning, the completion of the Dayaowan Project will enable Dalian port to claim an annual handling capacity of over 100 million tons at the beginning of the next century, ranking the port as one of the world's largest. Qinhuangdao in Hebei Province, the country's No. 1 port for coal exports, will show an increase of 30 million tons in annual handling capacity by 1996. Tianjin, China's largest artificial port, will handle 60 million tons of goods by the end of this century, when the ongoing projects of the Beijiang, Haihe and Nanjiang harbors are completed.
