According to experts, regional leaders and officials of the military-industrial complex "are now on the offensive". "The modest and quiet Rybkin is today's real alternative to the president," they say. "Unless, of course, the left-wingers and the patriots agree to support a common candidate, as proposed by the Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov. The largest faction in the State Duma is controlled not by the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia (50 deputies), and not by Russia's Choice (70), but by the coalition of Communists and Agrarians (100 deputies). "Sergey Shakhray's rating has not declined as expected" after his dismissal from the post of the minister of nationalities and regional policy, the newspaper says. "Shakhray is an independent figure and his time is not past," the newspaper concludes.
