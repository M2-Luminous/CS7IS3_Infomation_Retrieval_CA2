According to UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) spokesman George Bennett, at least 21 people were reported wounded in the new round of fighting. Bennett said the casualty figures could be considerable higher than those indicated by initial reports coming out of Kismaayo. "I think you could infer that there were more casualties, though we have not been able to confirm that", Bennett told a press briefing here. The reports said mortars and "technicals", the Mad-Max-style vehicles mounted with 106mm recoilless rifles or machine guns, were used in the latest battle, which centered around the villages of Yontoy and Gobweyne, a few kilometres (miles) outside Kismaayo. UN officials here speculate that the latest fighting could have been retaliation for battles fought several weeks ago between forces loyal to General Mohamed Hersi, known as Morgan, and those of Colonel Omar Jays, in which 20 people were killed, 42 wounded and more than 5,000 others displaced. During the fighting, General Morgan's forces pushed Ogadeni clan militia, mostly allied to warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid, out of Kismaayo. Observers here see the lawless streets of Kismaayo as a likely flash-point if civil war broke out again between forces loyal to self-proclaimed interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed and those of General Aidid. Kismaayo was the scene of some of the most vicious fighting during the civil war and has remained a bone of contention between Morgan and Jays. Both men were prohibited from entering the city by the United Nations after months of sporadic fighting in the city as the two warlords tried to wrest control from each other's faction. The ban was, however, lifted in late January.
