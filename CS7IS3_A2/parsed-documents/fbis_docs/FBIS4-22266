In the opinion of Ibrahim Dzikic, plenipotentiary of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Moscow, in order to treat the illness, one must have the proper diagnosis. [Akhundov] How many Bosnian refugees are there in Moscow at present? Has the Russian Government rendered assistance in providing them services and utilities? [Dzikic] There are no refugees in the legal sense of the word, because none of them are registered as such. But there are people who have fled the war or found themselves in Russia at the moment it began. I believe more than a thousand such people are in Moscow. And there are more throughout the territory of the CIS. There are about 4,000 refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina. These include Serbs, Croats, and Muslims. Most of these people are working at Bosnian enterprises in Russia, primarily in construction. They are all registered with the Visa and Registration Administration, like any other foreigners. [Akhundov] Do you not consider it the least bit strange that Russia has not to date established diplomatic relations with Bosnia? [Dzikic] Mr. Silajdzic, Prime Minister of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was recently in Moscow, where he stated candidly to Russian Federation Minister of Foreign Affairs Kozyrev and his deputy, Mr. Churkin, that Russia's policy with respect to the countries of the former Yugoslavia was unbalanced. The absence of full-scale diplomatic relations between our countries is one more confirmation of this. One gets the impression that Russia is displaying a greater understanding of Serb-related aspects of the conflict in the Balkans. [Akhundov] What are they fighting for in Bosnia? [Dzikic] In Bosnia they are not fighting for their religious beliefs. In Bosnia they are fighting for land. The SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] collapsed--the communist idea ceased to exist. Then the Government of Serbia, headed by Milosevic, put its stake in nationalism. They wanted to create a Greater Serbia over most of the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia and Herzegovina were to become a part of this Greater Serbia. And that is when the war began. To implement their plans, the Serbs conducted ethnic cleansing in captured territories. There are just 1.3 million Serbs in Bosnia, while there are about 8 million throughout the territory of the former Yugoslavia. The Islamic community of Bosnia numbers 2 million--the descendants of devoutly religious people who adopted Islam in the 11th and 12th centuries. At first a great deal was said about a third power being involved in this war. It seems to me this is not true. Were it not for Serbian nationalism, there would not be war either in Croatia or in Bosnia. The war in the territory of former Yugoslavia cannot be compared with the Karabakh conflict, or with the war in Georgia, or with the confrontation in Tajikistan--which certain commentators are attempting to do, justly pointing out that the geopolitical interests of major world powers are in confrontation in the three regions I mentioned. [Akhundov] How does one distinguish Serb from Muslim, Croat from Serb, if they all speak the same language? [Dzikic] Unless an individual declares what he is--Serb, Croat, or Muslim--it is practically impossible to distinguish among them. We have one language, Serbo-Croatian, and--if you can say it this way--one mentality. From time immemorial three religions have existed in Bosnia--Islamic, Orthodox, and Catholic--which, in turn, influenced in one way or another the formation of the ethnic groups professing them. The structure of civilization and world outlook are formed based on religion. There are no other distinctions. [Akhundov] Volunteers from which countries are fighting on the side of the Bosnian Muslims? What would you advise an individual who asks you to help him make his way to the Bosnian Army as a volunteer? [Dzikic] We do not have any problems and never have had any with people in the Army. We do not need volunteers from other countries. We need weapons. A great deal has been reported in the Russian press concerning volunteers from the Islamic states allegedly fighting on the side of the Bosnian Government, but I personally do not have such data. Other sources state that a great many Russians are fighting on the side of the Serbs. A certain Mr. Begayev approached me recently. He was involved in sending Russian volunteers to the war in Bosnia and asked my assistance in getting the bodies of two Russian mercenaries out of Bosnia. There was another curious incident, where a Muscovite came to our representation and asked me to help him....enlist in the Serbian Army. I advised him to go to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Embassy, with a comment to the effect that he had made a slight error in the address. [Akhundov] What do you think about arms shipments from Russia to the Serbs? How are these shipments effected? [Dzikic] A great deal is said and written about this, but as always, there are very few specific facts. It is difficult for me, a representative of one of the concerned parties, to comment on this. I have one piece of information in this regard. At the end of January 1994, a convoy of eight trucks was dispatched from Russia to Bosnia. The cargo was intended for the Serbian forces. It consisted of anti-aircraft systems and surface-to-air missiles. I obtained the information from Sarajevo. All arms shipments to Serbian forces in Bosnia come out of Serbia and through Serbia. We have the names of officers in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Army who died escorting military cargo from Serbia to Bosnia. We have demanded that United Nations posts be set up on the border between Serbia and Bosnia, which would be able to control cargo shipments. However, the Serbs blocked any decision that could be made in this regard. Russian society is very poorly informed as to what is going on right now on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Your newspaper correspondents in Belgrade fall under the influence of propaganda there. At first they were led to believe--and not without success--that the Slavs in Yugoslavia were exclusively Serbs. True, Russians have now come to understand that we are all Slavs. Then they put their stake on the Orthodox kinship. And now they are saying that Serbs are age-old allies of Russia--which in itself is not true. From ancient times, imperial Russia took advantage of either Bulgaria or Serbia to serve its interests in the Balkans. When it was friendly with the Bulgarians, the interests of the Serbs suffered, and vice versa. [Akhundov] The emergence of an Islamic state in the Balkans does not elicit delight in the West or in Russia. Perhaps this is one of the reasons behind the continuing bloodshed? [Dzikic] We have never desired to build an Islamic state. Our ideal is a civilized, secular country where religion is separated from the state and is the personal business of each citizen. We can cite Turkey as an example--a country that has developed for almost 100 years according to precisely such principles. We have wanted to continue to live the way we used to, together with Serbs and Croats. We were entirely unprepared for war. What is going on right now in Bosnia is aggression directed against us.
