He added: The measures we have adopted within the economic reform program are more strict than those stipulated under the GATT agreement. Speaking yesterday at a meeting of the permanent committee that is following up on the GATT talks, the minister stressed the need to improve the quality of Egyptian products to be competitive with similar imported products both in the local and external markets. He added: Liberalizing trade is inevitable, but under this liberalization we will protect our products from illegal trade. He pointed out that the agreement made during the Uruguay round of talks, which lasted for seven years, will not result in any additional burdens that the Egyptian economy cannot handle. He added that the commitments on Egypt resulting from the liberalization of international trade are much less than those burdening other developing nations. The committee will complete a study on the effects of the recent agreement on the Egyptian economy in the next few days.
