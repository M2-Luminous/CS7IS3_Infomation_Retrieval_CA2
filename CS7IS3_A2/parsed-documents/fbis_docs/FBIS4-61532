The first equal share of the credit was provided last October. The Head of the State Credits Department at Lithuania's Finance Ministry, Ruta Skyriene, has reported to INTERFAX that the money was given for 10 years with a five-year moratorium. The 5 percent annual credit rate will be corrected quarterly, however, it will remain under six percent. The loan will be returned only in hard currency, she stressed. In her words, although Lithuania's State Bank has been negotiating with republican commercial banks on how the second part of the credit should best be used, they have not come up with anything of substance. An IMF envoy to Lithuania Peter Cornelius has told INTERFAX that the second part of the credit may go "to put the Lithuanian commercial banks balance of payment in order."
