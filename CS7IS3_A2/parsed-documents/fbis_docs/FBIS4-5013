FBIS4-5013 "dreas067__a94014" FBIS-EAS-94-067-A Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Coalition Reacts to Hosokawa Resignation Remark Coalition Reacts to Hosokawa Resignation Remark OW0604125094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 6 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0604125094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Reports of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's alleged "remark on his wish to resign" circulated immediately among the ruling coalition parties on the evening of 5 April, causing serious repercussions. Since the reported remark came at a time when the schedule of the lower house Budget Committee's deliberation of the draft 1994 budget remained undecided, some ruling party members were even suspicious of the prime minister's true intention. On the other hand, rumors are rife in both the ruling and opposition parties that if deliberations on the budget remain suspended, "the cabinet may be forced to resign en masse, or the lower house may be dissolved to give way to a general election." While ruling party members are generally negative about Diet dissolution because Diet deliberations are actually being stalled over the prime minister's personal problem, this "resignation remark" may serve to encourage the opinion that the cabinet should resign to take responsibility for failing to steer Diet affairs properly. The ruling parties' reaction to the prime minister's remark was a mixture of perplexity and shock. The Prime Minister's Office was swamped with phone calls trying to confirm the reports on the evening of 5 April. Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama was summoned in haste to the Prime Minister's Official Residence at midnight, and the secretaries concerned were also rushing in and out. In the early hours of 6 April, the prime minister denied having made the "resignation remark." The government and the ruling parties then concentrated their efforts on informing all concerned that "the prime minister did not make the remark," and on restoring calm. In the first place, when senior Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] officials heard about the reports on the "resignation remark," they pointed out, "That is inconceivable. The worst thing is for such reports to go out of control." Other SDPJ officials were evidently shocked. They said, "We are in for trouble from 6 April." Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] members expressed concern over the effect, saying "This is different from an ordinary joke; it may lead to a surprise outcome." Since the prime minister is supposed to have made the remark during a dinner, most ruling party members said that "we do not think he was serious." Because the people he talked to were opposition upper house members, a senior Shinseito official said, "These are people the prime minister does not usually talk to, so we are not even sure how he talked to them." He doubted if there was actually any "resignation remark." As the prime minister's alleged remark has already been made public, "the prime minister's authority" will surely suffer the more he and his aides deny such reports. Moreover, this unwittingly revealed the prime minister's lack of confidence over his Sagawa Kyubin affair. The Liberal Democratic Party is expected to intensify its efforts to "overthrow the cabinet." The prime minister's alleged remark indeed came as a great surprise, whether or not he meant what he said. This "resignation remark" has surely become another explosive issue in his management of the political situation.
