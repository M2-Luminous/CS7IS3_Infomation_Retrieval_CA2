Gen. Ivan Bizhan held a briefing for diplomats accredited to Kiev concerning the incidents in Odessa 8-10 April. The generals cited facts and documents proving that from the very beginning Ukraine's Defense Ministry made every effort to avoid a conflict. In particular, General Lopata sent a telegram to the leaders of Russia's Defense Ministry in which he pleaded with them to keep the ship in Odessa until the situation had been clarified. Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy made a number of unsuccessful attempts to contact his Russian colleague, Pavel Grachev, by telephone. The minister then sent a telegram to Grachev, in which he explained the main points of the affair and the position of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense. The reply from Russia's minister of defense revealed that he was totally uninformed about the situation in Odessa and deliberately ignored the facts. Vitaliy Radetskyy said that the arbitrary actions taken by the leadership of the Black Sea Fleet will be stopped in the appropriate manner. He invited a competent commission to Kiev which will ascertain all the issues relating to the Black Sea Fleet. This commission has arrived in the Ukrainian capital.
