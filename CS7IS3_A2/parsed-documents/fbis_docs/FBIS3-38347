Senior officials have decided to introduce a top secret classification to cover material whose unauthorised disclosure would have "exceptionally serious consequences" for the essential interests of the European Union [EU]. They had already established the need for classifications of secret (for information whose leakage would have "serious consequences"), confidential (where disclosure would be "detrimental") and restricted (where publication would be "inappropriate or premature"). Tony Bunyan, director of Statewatch, an organisation which monitors conduct by officialdom affecting civil liberties in the EU, said yesterday: "It is fair enough for them to classify operational details, say about efforts to combat terrorism. But ministers appear to be making no distinction between operations and policy. "The confidential and restricted categories by definition cover information whose disclosure would not have serious consequences for the EU. They are questionable because they can be used to deny national parliaments and MEPs information about policy which they ought to be debating." The council documents provide a fascinating insight into security procedures in an institution which previously did not have secrets worth stealing. Article 6 says: "Where a number of items of information constitute a whole, that whole shall be classified at least as highly as its most highly classified constituent item. "Where appropriate, however, a body of information may be classified more highly than any of its constituent items." Article 7 says: "Access to and the keeping of classified information... shall be authorised only for officials and other servants granted clearance therefore who in addition require to know or receive such information for the performance of their duties... Only persons who have undergone security screening may be granted clearance." Article 8 says: "The purpose of security screening shall be to ascertain that an official or other servant provides the necessary guarantees to be allowed access to classified information... security screening shall be carried out by and under the responsibility of the member state of which the person concerned is a national. "If that person is not a national of a member state the member state within whose territory he has his domicile or normal residence shall be responsible for screening." Officials needing vetting will have to explain periods of residence of more than six weeks outside the EU during the last 10 years. The required personal data extends to information about a spouse's siblings and other people living in the official's household. The draft council decision on security classification is accompanied by a draft on how it should be implemented by the secretary-general. "A Classified Information Office shall be set up within general coordination.... It shall be reponsible for: the processing of classified information, in particular operations relating to its registration, reproduction, translation, communication, dispatch, preservation and destruction," the paper says. The rules extend to the strength of furniture in which secret documents can be stored. They conclude with a warning to officials that failure to comply shall expose them to "disciplinary measures and, if appropriate, criminal proceedings." This is puzzling, since it is not clear in which court an EU civil servant could be tried for an offence against the Union.
