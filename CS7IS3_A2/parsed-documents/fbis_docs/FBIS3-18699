Heindler expressed the conviction "that the Eximbank cannot afford in any case to make a positive decision soon without -- and I believe that the facts speak in our favor -- a lot of persuasion in Congress." Heindler does not want to predict whether the U.S. loan guarantee for the completion of the Czech nuclear power plant can be prevented in the end. However, he is certain that, after the Temelin case, there will not be any "repetition" regarding the financing of the refurbishing of old Soviet reactors.
