FBIS4-11703 "drnes062_g_94001" FBIS-NES-94-062 Daily Report 28 Mar 1994 Sudan Foreign Minister on Hala'ib Conflict, Egypt Foreign Minister on Hala'ib Conflict, Egypt PM2903110194 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Arabic 28 Mar 94 pp 1, 4 PM2903110194 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Arabic BFN [Interview with Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Abu-Salih by Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not given] [Text] [Abu-Husayn] First of all, who, in your view, is responsible for the eruption of Egyptian-Sudanese differences, especially after the start of the dialogue between the two sides? [Abu-Salih] Sudan has done nothing wrong against Egypt and it will not sacrifice its relations with Egypt, which should be special. I have come to Egypt six times to tackle the Hala'ib triangle dispute. The second round should have been held in Khartoum. It was postponed several times by the Egyptian side. More than once we appealed to [Egyptian Foreign] Minister 'Amr Musa to make the visit urgently so that we could carry out the task entrusted to us by Presidents Husni Mubarak and 'Umar al-Bashir at the time of the African summit in Cairo last summer. I believe that dialogue and meetings are essential for the settlement of the Hala'ib dispute, which, we believe, is a constant source of provocation and tension between the two countries. As far as we are concerned, postponement of the dialogue is unacceptable because it means continuation of the present situation. [Abu-Husayn] But Minister 'Amr Musa said more than once that the reason for the postponement was the fact that he was too busy at home and abroad. [Abu-Salih] I believe that Cairo and Khartoum are no more than two hours apart. Is it conceivable that visits to countries other than Sudan are more important than the current tense situation between the two countries? We insist on urgent dialogue because relations should not remain as they are for a long time. We believe that the present Egyptian Government is stronger than previous governments and more serious about establishing good relations between the Egyptian and Sudanese peoples. To us, that is a strategic objective and neither of us should lose sight of it. We will never forget Egypt's support for us on the question of Sudan's territorial integrity and against partition of Sudan, but we want to cooperate and coordinate and we want to move forward and settle any dispute which might undermine the situation in Sudan. We see the Hala'ib problem as much too small a problem to be a major obstacle in the way of special relations between the two countries. [Abu-Husayn] Has a date been set for Minister 'Amr Musa to visit Khartoum? [Abu-Salih] Regrettably, no date has been set yet. I have talked to him about everything I have said regarding ties between the two countries, their importance, the need to end this abnormal situation, and the need to move on to a better situation in the interest of both countries, particularly as there is much talk these days about Arab solidarity. The question is how is that to be achieved. There are differences between one state and its neighbor. That is unacceptable in a world which does not respect small entities. There must be cohesion and solidarity for the present and the future. [Abu-Husayn] But how is that going to apply to your relations with Egypt after the Sudanese president's appointment of a governor for the Hala'ib triangle? [Abu-Salih] If we just looked at what both the Egyptian and Sudanese sides are doing in Hala'ib, the problem would never be solved because it is disputed territory and, in the present situation, each side can do what it likes. That is why the dispute must be settled. [Abu-Husayn] Pardon me, but Egypt emphasizes that Hala'ib is Egyptian and Sudan says it would never forfeit it. So, how is the dialogue to be resumed? [Abu-Salih] Dialogue is the only way of creating a positive atmosphere. We would never forfeit the Hala'ib triangle by force or through the imposition of a fait accompli. We could possibly give it to Egypt through cordial means and provided we agree and the dialogue begins on the basis of mediation, international arbitration, or any sensible solution agreed upon by the two sides. [Abu-Husayn] It seems that Sudan's declaration that Hala'ib is Sudanese was sufficient reason for Egypt to lose interest in dialogue. [Abu-Salih] And Egypt's creation of electoral constituencies is also unacceptable to us. We had previously agreed to stop such practices. That Egyptian measure actually was sufficient proof that Hala'ib is Sudanese. Why were these constituencies not created in Hala'ib dozens of years ago? Why now? That is the question. We do not wish to discuss that in the media. We must arrive at practical solutions through dialogue. With goodwill, the dispute can be settled. [Abu-Husayn] What do you think of the Sudanese media claim that President Mubarak secretly visited Nairobi and met with John Garang? [Abu-Salih] That is ridiculous. I do not believe that President Mubarak did such a thing. No one in the Sudanese Government has accused or would ever accuse him of doing that. That was just a report which confused the Egyptian press. The Sudanese press reported that Mubarak al-Fadil, not President Mubarak, met with Garang. So, we should not pay any attention to such reports. The Sudanese media are tired of me going after them for the reports they publish because I always investigate any incident which might be harmful to our relations with any state. You now have the correction to the report carried by the Sudanese media. [Abu-Husayn] Have you requested Arab League intervention in the war in southern Sudan? [Abu-Salih] Sudan has submitted a memorandum, not seeking mediation or intervention but informing the Arab League of what is going on in southern Sudan and of the attempts to partition Sudan and undermine its territorial integrity, particularly as the Arab League has for over a year been contemplating calling for pan-Arab security integration. We consider Sudan to be part of that security. We emphasize that we will never allow the rebels and gunmen to fulfill their demands and self-determination because that constitutes an open call for the partition of Sudan, which is impossible. The Sudanese Army would never allow that. The Army is doing its duty against the rebels to promote stability and is giving them the punishment they deserve. Despite that, we have offered dialogue and negotiations to arrive at a comprehensive and just peaceful solution that would end the war, which is hurting everyone. The negotiations began on 17 March. The next round will be in May. The aim is to solve the problem on the basis of the Sudanese Government's program on the distribution of power and development but within the framework of a united Sudan, with exemption from application of the Islamic Shar'iah.
