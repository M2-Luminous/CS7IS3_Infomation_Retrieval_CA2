After the meeting Biljana Plavsic told reporters that the talks with the Italian foreign minister came at the right moment, clearly having in mind the forthcoming meetings, including the G7 summit, at which, as expected, the fate of former Bosnia-Herzegovina could be finally decided. Assessing today's talks with Martino and his aides, Buha said that his first impression was that they were "beginning to do the job with a fresh approach and without bias." The Italians wanted to hear at first hand where the Serb Republic sees the solution of the Bosnian conflict, which was interpreted in Serb Republic circles as an obvious intention by Rome to get more actively involved in the Bosnian peace process. According to Buha, the Italian minister and his aides were today informed about the general position of the Serb Republic on the Bosnian conflict. First of all, the Italians were told, the international community has gotten itself entangled in a net from which it ccan hardly get out unless it could come up with some new ideas. There are two main conditions for the resolution of the conflict, as far as the Serb Republic is concerned, Buha said. The first one is that the international community acknowledges at long last that the former Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot exist as an independent state any more, that this is a piece of fiction. The other condition is that things in the former Bosnia- Herzegovina are called by their real names. This means that there are three sovereign nations in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina who can decide their own fate. The international community should recognize two state entities - the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb Republic, Buha said.
