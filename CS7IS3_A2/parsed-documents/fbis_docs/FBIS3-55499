He is to attend a NATO summit, then fly on to Prague, Moscow, Minsk, and to Geneva for a January 16 meeting with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad before flying home. According to top officials of the U.S. Administration, the President's European tour pursues three goals. The first goal is to bring the U.S. "partnership for peace" concept up for U.S. NATO allies' endorsement. The concept envisions the establishment of the bloc's closer military cooperation with the former socialist countries of Europe. The second goal is to show U.S. support for democratic processes in former communist states, and the third one is to reduce the spread of nuclear weapons and work for a greater Europe that is more economically vibrant.
