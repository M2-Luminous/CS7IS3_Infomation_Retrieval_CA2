The visitor brought along with him three Syrian surprises to Amman: 1. The Syrians asked Jordan to exclude the PLO from coordination meetings between Arab negotiators. Despite Jordan's anger with the PLO, which has refused to coordinate with it and kept delaying a Jordanian-Palestinian economic agreement, the Jordanians had some reservations about the Syrian request. Amman thinks that isolating the PLO at this time in particular could have serious consequences on Jordan, the occupied Arab territories, and Palestinian citizens. 2. The Syrians also asked for a coordination meeting grouping the Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese foreign ministers and negotiators, with Egypt's participation, before 15 January to precede al-Asad-Clinton summit. The Syrians believe such a meeting will give the summit a chance to discuss substantive issues, including agreement on a new round of negotiations that could produce tangible progress. 3. As for the third Syrian request, it was in response to an earlier Jordanian request to resume the meetings of the joint higher committee under the two prime ministers of the two countries. Asked by AL-WASAT, a Jordanian official declined to answer a question about Jordan's reply to Syria's request to exclude the PLO from coordination. The official said, however, that coordination with Syria is basic and necessary. Before leaving Amman, the Syrian foreign minister said coordination with the PLO ended when the secret negotiations with Israel in Oslo were uncovered.
