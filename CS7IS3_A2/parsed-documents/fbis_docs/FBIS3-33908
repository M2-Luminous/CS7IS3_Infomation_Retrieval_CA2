FBIS3-33908 "drnes022_a_94001" FBIS-NES-94-022 Document Type:Daily Report 2 Feb 1994 ARAB AFRICA Algeria FIS Official Comments on Assessing President's Policies PM0102112694 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 1 Feb 94 pp 1, 4 PM0102112694 London AL-HAYAH Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Jamal Khashuqji report: "Rabih Kebir Tells AL-HAYAH: Salvation Front's Position on Zeroual Appointment Has Not Been Defined Yet"] [Text] Jeddah -- The Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] in Algeria stressed yesterday that "it has not yet taken a specific position on the appointment of Defense Minister Liamine Zeroual as president of the country." Rabeh Kebir, chairman of the FIS Executive Committee abroad, said in a statement to AL-HAYAH: "We cannot say whether what has happened (Zeroual's appointment) is positive or negative. We are not interested in individuals but in the policy to be pursued by Zeroual. We will be able to judge when the features of this policy become clear." He pointed out that the statement he issued the day before yesterday, in which he attacked the Algerian authorities, was not aimed against the new president, Zeroual. But it "expresses our fixed position rejecting all attempts by putschists to prolong the life of their regime, which has become bankrupt at all levels. We in the FIS are waiting until Zeroual's policy becomes clear so that we can pass judgment." However, he reiterated the FIS' position of refusing to recognize the regime's legitimacy. He said: "We do not forget that the present regime, like the previous one, is a military regime that lacks constitutional and popular legitimacy." Asked whether he had found in Zeroual's speech any positive indications of a desire for reconciliation, he said: "Zeroual's speech -- as we heard it -- included both the reconciliation aspect and the terrorist aspect, so I reiterate that his policy is still unclear." Kebir does not expect recent changes to affect the military activities of elements of the armed Islamic movement supporting FIS, which are now called the Islamic Salvation Army, "until after the new president's policy becomes clear." On the effect of recent contacts between the Algerian authorities and the detained FIS leaders on the other FIS leaders, especially those present abroad, he said: "We stressed in the past that the legitimate and historic FIS leadership is represented in Shayk Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, and it pleases us to see that contacts are conducted with them to extricate the country from the crisis. But these contacts should be based on good foundations that restore the Algerian people's dignity and their right to live under the Islamic state they have chosen." He said that detained FIS leaders who have been contacted stressed to representatives of the authorities that "we are part of the leadership but not all the leadership. We must be allowed to meet with the other brothers concerned. Then we will be able to take the right legitimate position." He pointed out that the contacts made were merely discussions, not a dialogue as the detained leaders were reported to have said. In a statement issued last Sunday Kebir condemned in FIS' name the assassination of Shayk Mohamed Bouslimani, describing it as "part of a campaign designed to drive a wedge between Islamists." Official Algerian reports said yesterday that the "Armed Islamic Group" (Ja'far al-Afghani's group) had claimed responsibility for the assassination of Bouslimani, who is close to Hamas [Islamic Society Movement]. And that the assassination order was issued by al-Afghani himself. However, Shayk Rabeh Kebir told AL-HAYAH: "Our information indicates that it was the authorities' organs which abducted Shayk Bouslimani and committed the crime. The so-called Free Algerian Youth Organization claimed responsibility for the operation. This organization is known to be a branch of the intelligence service."
