The security agreement was the main pillar of Japan's security policy in the Cold War era. However, considering changes following the end of the Cold War era, the panel has decided to review the significance of the security pact. The panel plans to discuss specifics at future meetings. At present, there is a strong opinion within the panel that "the pact should not be defined as mere the framework of Japan-U.S. security arrangements, but it should be characterized as a nucleus of a security system in the Asia-Pacific region." Besides conventional cooperation such as assuming burdens for maintaining the U.S. forces in Japan, the panel is expected to discuss giving more support to the U.S. forces stationed in the region. Concluding an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA), which allows Japan and the U.S. forces to mutually provide goods such as fuel, is also a topic to be discussed by the panel.
