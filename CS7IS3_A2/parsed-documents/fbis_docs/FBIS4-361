Nigeria's ambassador to the U.S., Alhaji Zubeiru Mahmud Kazaure, made the appeal in Los Angeles in a television program on Africa. Ambassador Zubeiru Kazaure said the ban by President Clinton had made the collection of visas very difficult for Nigerians traveling to that country. He said the United States should have allowed Nigerian leaders to intimate her with their programs instead of taking a hasty action. Ambassador Kazaure also expressed concern on the way and manner Nigerians were being maltreated in that country. He said the U.S. should rather commend Nigerians, who provide employment for others and those employed in American organizations, instead of harassing them unduly.
