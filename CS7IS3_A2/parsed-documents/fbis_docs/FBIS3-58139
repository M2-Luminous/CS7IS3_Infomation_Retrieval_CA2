Clinton Draws Closer to Europe"] [Text] When President Clinton comes to Europe next week to attend the NATO summit he is not going to offer much satisfaction to the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians who are knocking at the doors of NATO and demanding protection from a possible resurgence of imperialism in Russia. But, to judge by yesterday's major foreign policy speech in Milwaukee, delivered by Vice President Al Gore because of the death of Mr Clinton's mother, the President seems to have learnt a lot about the dangers and challenges facing Europe -- and the importance of facing them if America is to remain prosperous and secure. In his ideas, if not yet in his actions, Mr Clinton clearly wants his visit to Europe to mark a clean break from last summer when Warren Christopher, his Secretary of State, could dismiss the war in Bosnia as "a humanitarian crisis a long way from home in the middle of another continent." Europe's central importance for America was certainly the welcome message yesterday from Milwaukee. "Nothing is more important than our relationship with Europe," declared Mr Clinton. But what was more convincing, and potentially significant, was his ability to justify this airy statement to a domestic American audience which still shows every sign of wanting to turn its back on the outside world. Predictably Mr Clinton explained that Europe was an "invaluable trading partner" and a market for exports. It was also a possible source of security threats and global instability and therefore a potential drain on American government finances. But Mr Clinton went beyond these cliches to emphasise a more intangible, and even more important, feature of America's relationship with Europe: a feature which lies at the heart of the challenge for Europe and explains why the Atlantic will always be more important to America than the Pacific, regardless of the future flows of trade and the balance of world economic growth. What Europe now needed above all else, said Mr Clinton, was a new form of protection, built not on walls and barbed wire, but on free commerce, democracy and respect for human diversity and political dissent. After the decades of Communist uniformity and repression, Europeans had rediscovered their ethnic and religious differences. They now had to transform Europe's diversity from a source of conflict into its great strength. America's indispensable contribution was to show through its own historical experience that it was possible "to build a shared civic space large enough for all our differences." But this ideal of a civic society, embracing diversity instead of suppressing dissent, was not an American creation. It was actually an import by Jefferson from European liberal philosophy. And that philosophy not only underlies the American Constitution; it also ultimately made inevitable America's reluctant involvement in the two world wars. It is because America shares its fundamental political philosophy with West Europe that so much of 20th-century history has revolved around the Atlantic alliance. And as Mr Clinton correctly asserted, the greatest challenge facing America, as well as West Europe, in the coming years, is to ensure that the politics of Central Europe and the former Soviet Union are cast irreversibly into the same liberal mould. Mr Clinton may not yet know how to complete this historic task. But at least, as he said in Milwaukee, he is finally willing "to put America's shoulder to the wheel."
