Addressing a national conference on customs work which closed here today, Li said that the customs restructuring must be carried out simultaneously with the overall reform of China's economic structure. It is necessary to institute a modern customs system with Chinese characteristics that will meet the needs of a socialist market economic structure and opening up, and will be compatible with internationally accepted practices, the leader told directors of customs offices from all over the country. To this end, "We must introduce an inspection system, reform the declaration system and the customs managerial system..., while combining our professional restructuring with the use of modern technical means in an effort to establish modern, efficient customs offices," he said. Li Lanqing urged the directors of customs offices to tighten supervision of import and export goods and crack down on all kinds of duty evasion and fraud so as to maintain a normal economic order. "We have scored initial successes in the current anti-smuggling campaign, but by no means can we relax our efforts," he said. The leader pledged to investigate and handle major smuggling cases promptly, noting that it is imperative to combine the anti-smuggling campaign with the anti-corruption campaign in order to ensure the healthy development of the country's economic construction.
