Gen. Delic spoke about the creation and the strengthening of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, stressing that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army had gained considerable strength in a short period of time thanks to the existence of organized patriotic forces. The creation of such a military force, according to Delic, thwarted the goals of the aggression: The creation of Greater Serbia, the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the complete annihilation of the Muslim nation. The Tudjman-Milosevic and Karadzic-Boban agreements should have served the enemy in the realization of its goals. For the Serbs they only represented Phase One in the creation of Greater Serbia. Following the signing of these agreements, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army began fighting two aggressors. The front with the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] was still to be established. The HVO had blockaded roads and thwarted the dispatch of humanitarian aid. Even though the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army had lost some important positions in that period -- Grebak, Trnovo, and Zepce -- Delic stressed, HVO forces were completely eliminated on the territory of Jablanica, Kakanj, Zenica, Travnik, and Bugojno. The HVO was defeated militarily and would have completely disappeared had not Croatia sent in its huge forces, Delic said. A military balance with the forces of the Serb aggressor has been established. The enemy launched several offensives over the past few months -- against Teocak, Olovo, Bihac, and Maglaj -- but did not succeed in shifting our defense lines. Huge losses in manpower and equipment were inflicted on it. On some parts of the battlefield our forces even advanced. According to Gen. Delic, results of strategic importance achieved by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army are: The thwarting of the occupation, the survival of the people, the opening up of roads, and the strengthening of the political reputation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the world. The agreement reached with the Republic of Croatia should be regarded in this light. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army gained a lot by this agreement -- it no longer has to fight two enemies. The opening up of roads is also of great importance. Speaking about the situation in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, Delic said this was an army in which military hierarchy was respected. The Army was cleansed of crime and paramilitary formations. He particularly stressed that good cooperation with the Bosnia-Herzegovina Internal Affairs Ministry existed. According to Delic, Internal Affairs Ministry forces and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army represent a united defense factor of our country. It is necessary to continue the strengthening of the Army regarding its organization and cadres, because there will more fighting, Rasim Delic said.
