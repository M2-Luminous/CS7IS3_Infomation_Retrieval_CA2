Plyushch met with the chairman of the Russian Federation State Duma Committee for CIS Issues and Ties With Compatriots, K.F. Zatulin, and with a member of the Committee for International Issues, S.B. Stankevych. They are presently in Ukraine as official observers at the new parliamentary elections. During the friendly and open conversation, topical issues of Ukrainian-Russian relations and the development of ties between CIS countries were discussed. It was stressed that they must be based upon the principles of equal partnership and mutually advantageous economic cooperation and must promote the development of friendship between the peoples of our countries. The chairman of the Supreme Council spoke about the situation in the country and the course of the political reforms. He pointed out, in particular, that the elections of Ukraine's people's deputies had been democratic and that the citizens had played a full part. There are reasons to believe that, following the run-off elections in those electoral districts where candidates did not receive sufficient votes, there will be a new parliament in Ukraine. The guests asked about the preparation for presidential elections and elections to local government. Having explained his position on the expediency of holding the elections in accordance with the time-table specified by the Supreme Council, Plyushch pointed out that the political reforms and the democratic processes that are under way will help stabilize the situation in society and will promote the country's emergence from the crisis. If these processes are hampered, something in which some political forces are interested, it will not be for the good of the people. An exchange of opinions was also held on the further development of interparliamentary ties. Ambassador of the Russian Federation in Ukraine L.Ya. Smolyakov also took part in the conversation.
