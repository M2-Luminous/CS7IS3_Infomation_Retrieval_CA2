Before the beginning of the executive committee session of his party in Munich on Monday [13 June], CSU Chairman Theo Waigel said that Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] challenger Rudolf Scharping had made the mistake of underestimating the chancellor. "Scharping does not look so good, this is an open secret." Bavarian Minister President Edmund Stoiber said: "It was certainly a vote for Kohl. The SPD has to decide whether it was also an anti-Scharping vote." After the CSU's surprisingly good performance, Waigel called on his own party immediately to start the work for the Landtag and Bundestag elections in the fall. "We are not arrogant now." Bavaria's SPD, with its chairwoman Renate Schmidt, has been dampened. Schmidt does not have an answer to questions of the future and she is trying to divert the people's attention from it with cheap propaganda tricks, it was stated.
