His visit is aimed at discussing bilateral relations and the current Arab situation. Details are in the following report by our parliamentary affairs correspondent: A session of Jordanian-Lebanese parliamentary talks was held at the Parliament today. The Jordanian side was led by Tahir al-Masri, speaker of the House of Representatives, and included members of the permanent office, heads of committees, and rapporteurs of the parliamentary blocs. The Lebanese side was led by Nabih Birri, speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, and included a number of deputies as well as representatives of leading Lebanese newspapers. Tahir al-Masri said: We welcome Mr. Birri as a prominent national and pan-Arab figure who is playing a distinguished role in restoring Arab solidarity. Al-Masri said that we, in Jordan and Lebanon, are convinced that our democratic march and respect of citizens' rights constitute the basic cornerstone in the battle of restoring Arab rights. He added that we, in Jordan, have Arab rather than Jordanian concerns. Jordan is unionist and Arabist. It has paid a dear price as a result of its pan-Arab stands and democratic march. Nabih Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies, thanked the king and people of Jordan for not acting unilaterally and for paying the tax of war. He said that we should return to our Arab solidarity, adding that the Arab cordon states --Syria. Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine -- must be supported so that none of them are singled out.
