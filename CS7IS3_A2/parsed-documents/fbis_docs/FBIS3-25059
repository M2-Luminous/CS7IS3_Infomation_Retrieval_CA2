FBIS3-25059 "drafr025_c_94022" FBIS-AFR-94-025 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Feb 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Police Arrest Right-, Left-Wing `Terrorists' in Raids MB0702152894 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1419 GMT 7 Feb 94 MB0702152894 Johannesburg SAPA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Pretoria Feb 7 SAPA -- The SA [South African] Police on Monday [7 February] and over the weekend swooped against suspected extremist terrorists of both the far left and far right, Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel said. He said in Pretoria the arrests were made after more than six weeks of intensive invstigations into a series of far-rightwing terror attacks in the [Orange] Free State and the Western Transvaal. Police on Monday arrested five suspects linked to far-rightwing organisations. Some were detained in Orkney and others in Welkom. The SA Police over the weekend also arrested seven people, including five suspected Azanian Peoples Liberation Army members, in connection with the rifle and hand-grenade attack on a swimming pool in Richard's Bay, Northern Naal, at the weekend, Mr Kriel said. Three R5 rifles and two M26 hand-grenades were seized when the arrests were made in Stanger, Empangeni and near the scene of the crime in Richard's Bay. Five right-wing extremists were detained in the Transvaal and the Free State and explosives and firearms were seized by the police. Follow-up operations by the SA Police were still in progress and further arrests could be expected, Mr Kriel said. During the swoop in Orkney, a suspect fired with a shotgun at members of the police through a closed door. A policeman, Sergeant Johan Jonker, was hit in the chest but escaped death because he wore a bullet-proof jacket. Police returned fire, Mr Kriel said, and the suspect was wounded in the arm. He was under police guard in hospital. "These arrests, and many others before them, explode the myth cultivated by Mr Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress [ANC] that the SA Police is soft on rightwing terrorism. "Once again the SA police have demonstrated that they will act without fear or favour," said Mr Kriel. "These arrests should also serve as a serious warning to both right and left-wing extremists that the SA Police will not for a moment hesitate to act against anyone who breaks the law, regardless of political affiliation." Mr Kriel believed it was time Mr Mandela paid constructive and credible attention to his "criminal self-defence units, which are trained by MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe, [Spear of the Nation -- armed wing of the ANC]". If Mr Mandela was interested in fair play, he would apologise to State President F W de Klerk and the SA Police for his recent unfounded insults. "However, knowing Mr Mandela, this may be too much to ask, considering that objectivity is not one of his strong points," Mr Kriel said.
