FR940919-0-00146 FR940919-0-00017 On the other hand, one crustacean biologist stated that the reports of successful vernal pool creation have been ``generally poorly controlled, completely lacking in long-term monitoring, and do not appear in the peer reviewed scientific literature *␣*␣*'' (J. King, in litt ., 1992). In addition, this commenter reported that ``contrary to common misconception these organisms [vernal pool tadpole shrimp] are not easily raised outside of their natural habitat.'' This crustacean specialist stated that their efforts to maintain viable reproductive vernal pool tadpole shrimp in the laboratory have been unsuccessful. Another biologist pointed out that long-term studies of the effect of mixing genotypes in created pools likely are adversely impacting the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp (M. Simovich, in litt ., 1992). Eight biologists specializing in crustaceans or plants inhabiting vernal pools stated that these habitats are an intricate ecosystem and efforts to recreate them likely will not be successful until they are more fully understood. Furthermore, six fairy shrimp specialists concluded that protection of these animals is best assured via the preservation of extant habitat and its associated community. Service Response: In a review of 21 vernal pool creation projects dispersed throughout California, Ferren and Gervitz (1990) concluded that no conclusive data exist to substantiate the hypothesis ``that vernal pools can be restored or created to provide functional values within the range of variability of natural pools.'' Though some individuals (Sugnet and Associates et al . 1992) have claimed complete or some degree of success, these conclusions generally are based on anecdotal unscientific studies and the persistence of fairy shrimp after only a short period of time, e.g., three years or less. Moreover, the principal pool creation technique (i.e., relocation of soil from excavated pool bottoms versus inoculation of a known quantity of eggs) and lack of scientifically designed monitoring do not allow for collection of the necessary data to determine the long-term population viability of transplanted species. In a study on the preservation and management of vernal pools (Jones and Stokes Associates 1990), the researchers concluded that the ``science of vernal pool creation is still in its infancy and is primarily an experimental mitigation technique.'' Environmental requirements, not dispersal, is likely the limiting factor in the distribution of the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp (D. Belk, pers. comm., 1992). The four species in this final rule require unknown, but more restrictive environmental conditions than more widely distributed taxa (J. King, in litt ., 1992; M. Simovich, in litt ., 1992; R. Brusca, pers. comm., 1992). There are no demonstrated proven long-term populations of the fairy shrimp or the vernal pool tadpole shrimp in artificial habitats. Artifically created habitats also may increase the threat of hybridization between the four fairy shrimp and other more widespread species. For example, Lindahl's fairy shrimp is a widespread species found in western North America that inhabits a wide array of conditions, ranging from pools whose salinity is high enough to support brine shrimp ( Artemia sp.) to snow melt pools. Poorly planned, careless construction, or haphazard placement of the substrate during vernal pool creation may enhance conditions for species like Lindahl's fairy shrimp. Laboratory studies have shown that Lindahl's fairy shrimp and the vernal pool fairy shrimp readily hybridize in the laboratory and produce viable first generation hybrids (Fugate, pers. comm., 1992). There is evidence that hybridization between other fairy shrimp has occurred in the field because of human actions. Belk (1977) reported that the westward dispersal from Texas and New Mexico of a desert fairy shrimp ( Streptocephalus dorothae ) across extensive expanses of arid land into Arizona may be due to the cattle ponds and livestock watering holes that were built after the 1800's in the region. Wiman (1979) reported that viable hybrid offspring are produced by this species and Mackin's desert fairy shrimp ( Streptocephalus mackini ), a resident species in Arizona. Given these uncertainties associated with vernal pool creation, the Service maintains that transplanting target species (e.g., listed, proposed, and candidate species) into artificial pools cannot be considered adequate replacement for the loss of occupied vernal pool habitat. Even if such transplantation of the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp and creation of their habitat were documented to be a proven procedure rather than an evolving problematic venture, artificial pool creation for the species listed herein would not fulfill the mandates of section 2 of the Act, which require the Service to develop programs that conserve the ecosystems upon which listed species depend. As discussed elsewhere herein, natural habitats throughout the ranges of the four species have been damaged or eliminated. As a result, the Service concludes that the continued survival and recovery of the three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp only can be assured, at this time, by the preservation of extant vernal pools and their associated watersheds. Issue 29: Several comments were received questioning the relationship between the Endangered Species Act and the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (e.g., ``taking'' without just compensation). Service Response: The mere promulgation of a regulation, such as the enactment of a statute, is rarely sufficient to establish that private property has been taken unless the regulation on its face denies the property owner the economically viable use of his property. Listing pursuant to the Endangered Species Act does not automatically restrict all uses of one's land. A property owner cannot establish that his property has been taken as a result of a regulatory action such as the listing of a species until he has first submitted a proposal to develop the property and has received a determination as to the level of development that will be allowed. The property owner must apply for all available permits and waivers before a taking could potentially be established. With respect to listing, this means that no takings can be established until the property owner complies with section 10(a) of the Act and the Service concludes that no permit to take incidental to an otherwise lawful activity will be issued.
