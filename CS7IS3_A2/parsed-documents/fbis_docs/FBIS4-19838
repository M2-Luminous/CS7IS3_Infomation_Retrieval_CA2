Such a rate of increase is the highest since the war. This is clear from the latest unemployment figures published by the CBS [Central Statistics Office]. It is also the first time that unemployment has topped the half million mark since early 1986. In an initial reaction to the figures, Social Affairs Minister De Vries spoke of an "alarming growth." "Strictly speaking, we are now facing an increase of 200,000 a year. It is clear that although there is already some prospect of economic recovery, the process of reducing jobs is still continuing steadily and the end is not yet in sight," the minister said. De Vries believes that the new unemployment figures stress the need to lighten the costs burden on companies and for a more flexible labor market. "Also, employers and employees should exercise the greatest constraint not only in the current round of wage negotiations for this year, but also for 1995," De Vries stated.
