The UN official noted that, though the CSC had decided that demobilization should begin on 1 March, the CCF ordered that, until Renamo had produced its lists, the government should not send its lists to the Finance Ministry to have demobilization subsidies paid out. Aldo Ajello announced that greater control is to be exerted on the CCF in the future. The UN special representative also disclosed that the first UN police contingent is scheduled to arrive in Mozambique before the end of this month. The UN Security Council recently endorsed the deployment of more than 1,000 UN policemen in this country to observe the work done by the police of the Republic of Mozambique.
