The polemic over the statements made by Israel's deputy foreign minister and by European Commission President Jacques Delors was just beginning to subside when a crisis flared up again, this time in the northeast. Slovenia and Croatia have decided to join forces against "neofascist claims," and have made a point of stating this publicly through their presidents. The two republics have never been on particularly friendly terms. As a matter of fact, according to Slovene President Milan Kucan, yesterday's meeting with his Croatian counterpart Franjo Tudjman in Zagreb was "polemical and very tough." However, faced with the "danger from the West," they found it expedient to overcome their differences quickly. The more outspoken statement came from Croatian President Tudjman, who included "Italian neofascist claims on some Slovene and Croatian territories" among the reasons making it imperative for Zagreb and Ljubljana to "coordinate their policies." Kucan was more subdued, but nevertheless adamant: "The disquieting statements made by some politicians in Italy" and war in Bosnia require "a prompt solution to reciprocal problems." Kucan was obviously referring to National Alliance's [AN] presence in the majority government as well as to the request put forward by MSI [Italian Social Movement] member Mirko Tremaglia (who is now the lower house foreign committee chairman) to modify the eastern borders. The new Italian Government has always denied having any such intentions, but the MSI's statements have underscored Foreign Minister Antonio Martino's decision to ask for a conclusion to current negotiations on minority rights and the assets of the 1945 refugees before giving the go-ahead to the two countries' entry into the European Union. Tudjman tried to draw a distinction between the government's and AN's respective positions by stating that he hoped that the government would "continue to pursue previous governments' policies based on democracy and friendly relations." However, he added that "we cannot ignore certain voices in Italy that are making an open apology for fascism and its imperialist policies." In short, AN and the positions put forward by some of the latter's members are beginning to weigh heavily on the government's foreign policy and leaving its flank exposed to criticism from such characters as Tudjman who, for some time now, have been riding the wave of nationalist feeling in their own countries. As a result, living conditions for Italians in Istria--now divided between Slovenia and Croatia--may become worse in the short term. [passage omitted]
