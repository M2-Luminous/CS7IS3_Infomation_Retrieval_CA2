[Correspondent] Yevgeniy Alekseyevich, the threat of collapse hangs over the automotive plants of Russia, including also the ZIL. Why has such a thing happened? [Brakov] The breakup of the Union has led to a sharp reduction in the production of our basic product--automobiles. While in 1985 we manufactured 212,000 trucks, already in 1993 we were able to assembly only 100,000, and that with some difficulty. Production continues to decline due to lack of consumer funds. Such a thing has never happened before at the ZIL. The collective is literally in shock. After all, not that long ago we supplied the army with somewhere on the order of 55,000 "ZIL-131" vehicles. Last year this figure was only... 640. The farms bought about 30,000 vehicles annually. Last year this figure was only... 200. Ukraine used to buy 22,000 automobiles. Today, due to the non-clearance of payments in rubles, its market has in fact been lost to us. The situation is about the same with Kazakhstan, the Central Asian states, as well as all the former Union republics. It is difficult for me, the director, to explain to the workers what has happened. Up until recently, the payment for our equipment came to the Central Bank of Russia. But because there was no balance of payments between Russia and the Commonwealth countries, the money was returned. Today we may supposedly manage our products as we see fit--we may sell to whomever we want. Yet in fact this is not so. We are deprived of the opportunity of working directly with our partners. Why? Why, because the state hinders the transfer of money. Moreover, they have taxed us from all sides with all manner of taxes. [Correspondent] If I understand you correctly, the government has removed itself from any aid to state enterprises? [Brakov] I would go even farther. It has not only removed itself, but it hinders us in our normal operations. Even when there was the ruble transfer of money, its normal receipt for our products was hindered. Today we have been deprived altogether of a sales market in the former USSR republics. Both they and we have been placed in a most difficult position. The ZIL is forced to independently seek means of mutual accounting with its partners through third countries, through barter and commodity exchange. Despite the optimistic assurances of certain state leaders, the decline in production continues. How will we survive? After all, what is the ZIL conveyer? Standing "behind the back" of each person working at it, there are at least 100 people. These are metal producers, miners, manufacturers of electrical wire, glass, tires, plastic, and so forth. If the automotive plant stops, the entire series of enterprises begins to get feverish. We can imagine how many people find themselves under the threat of unemployment. Today in Russia practically all the state enterprises are debtors. We all owe each other. And the state--through taxes. The government has not settled accounts with the peasants for grain, and they have no money to buy equipment, spare parts or fuel-lubricant materials. Seventy percent of the pool of ZIL automobiles on the farms are at least 8 years old. Our equipment is expected to last 10 years. What will happen in 2 years? Or let us take another problem. It was decided that working capital would not be re-appraised with the re-appraisal of surplus finished products. We were also promised preferential credits for replentishing our working capital. The government has still not fulfilled its obligation. Our plant, like other state enterprises having a large reserve of material resources and long-standing economic ties, has found itself in a trap. If we do not get state support, the ZIL will once again grind to a halt. And for a long time. [Correspondent] And what are you yourselves doing in order to keep afloat? [Brakov] Unfortunately, little here depends on the plant. First of all, we must stop the bacchanalia with the level of wages in the sector. Judge for yourselves. Next to us is another plant, and the wages of its workers are two or three times higher. Compare them with the automobile industry abroad. The wage level at different enterprises fluctuates there by only a few dollars. The ZIL worker today earns an average of 100,000 rubles [R]. What can you buy for that? Secondly, we must immediately settle accounts with the farm, with the army and with the defense industry. Our contractors will have money, and they will begin to take the automobiles. Then we too will deduct funds to the state budget. Thirdly, it has long been time to straighten out the matter of taxes. They have simply suffocated us, the manufacturers. At the initiative of the government, there was a re-appraisal of the fixed capital. For the ZIL there was a 28.7-time increase. Up until recently, we paid tax in the amount of 1.5 percent on the fixed capital. Last year this was R400 million. Now we must pay 2 percent. It seems that this is not so much, only half a percent more. But this is already not R400 million, but rather R40 billion. Last year our profits for the entire ZIL were R60 billion. Is it conceivable that we can withstand such a tax press? We are up to our ears in credit debts. We are being granted credits at 250-300 percent, and for a period of 2 or 3 months. The banks will not risk giving money for a long term. How can we speak of any kind of development or technical progress if the plant is always working feverishly. We are living one day at a time. Not living, but surviving. A few years ago, the decision was made regarding the changeover of the ZIL to the manufacture of automobiles which operate on diesel fuel. We began building a diesel engine plant in Yartsevo of Smolensk Oblast, and at the main plant we began developing extensive press and body production. We began developing and modernizing branch plants. Now, it turns out, no one needs any of this. We might ask, who is going to untangle all this (supposedly market-related) mess?
