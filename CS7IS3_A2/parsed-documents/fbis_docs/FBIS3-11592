This idea is shared both by the anti-Menem group -- who are emotionally against the constitutional reform -- and by government supporters, who enthusiastically believe that the reform will assure Menem a new presidential term. Neither side is right. It is true that Menem could possibly run again in 1995. Yet it is also true that the hegemonic scheme of the Menem sector was left without reelection, and that thanks to the opportune and intelligent intervention of the Radical Civic Union [UCR], the dreams of the Menem sector to perpetuate arbitrariness, injustice, and corruption in power will collapse with the approval of the new Constitution. Let us see why: -- In the reform, the UCR managed to impose a strong restriction on Menem's reelection possibilities by introducing the indirect election of the president and the vice president (the electoral colleges will disappear) through the runoff system. This system, which will be established by the Constitution, may not be modified by a law. It definitively eliminates the danger of tricks to which the government might resort if it realizes it could lose an election. One of those tricks is the multiple ticket law. The runoff election system will force Menem to obtain -- in order to avoid a runoff -- more than 45 percent of the votes in the first electoral round. It should be recalled that in its best electoral moment -- on 3 October 1993 -- the Menem sector barely received 42 percent of the votes. Furthermore, the runoff system favors the creation of two major electoral blocs: a pro-government bloc and an opposition bloc. So far there has been only one electoral front, the one formed by the Menem sector. With the traditional votes of the Justicialist Party, the UCEDE [Democratic Center Union], and other rightist sectors, this bloc was an apparently invincible electoral front. From now on this situation will change, and progressive and popular sectors will have a chance to create a strongly competitive electoral group. -- The direct election of national senators, the reduction of their terms, and the designation of a third minority senator have destroyed the pro-Menem dream of controlling the Senate until the year 2003. As a matter of fact, if everything had remained unchanged, or -- and this would have been even worse -- if the Constitution advocated by the government had been approved, instead of the one negotiated with the UCR, the pro-Menem sector, even in losing the elections, would have maintained control (by approximately two-thirds) over the Senate until the beginning of the next century. This circumstance has made people wonder: How will the opposition govern, if it wins the election, when the Menem sector has control over the Senate and a majority in the Supreme Court? -- Millions of Argentines are right to wonder: How will it be possible to eradicate corruption without independent courts? Fighting corruption is not only an ethical obligation -- it is also a political duty. If the democratic system can find no efficient action to properly fight corruption, this will end up undermining the credibility of democracy. The new Constitution negotiated by the UCR leadership, which is headed by Raul Alfonsin, has an answer for this dilemma. The system for designating and dismissing judges was totally modified. From now on, judges will no longer be designated by the president of the nation with Senate approval. The Senate has so far designated who would administer justice in secret sessions, and by majority vote. With the new Constitution, judges will be nominated by the so-called Council for Magistrates (an organ made up of judges, delegates from bar associations and academic institutions, and lawmakers) which, after a qualification contest, will propose two- or three-name lists on which the Senate will have to debate in public sessions. This system is operating in Italy, and based on its results in the fight against corruption within the government and in economic sectors, the system apparently works better than the one we have been using under the current Constitution. Perhaps even more important is the modification of the system for dismissing corrupt judges. Under the current Constitution, the system for replacing judges has been highly inefficient. In 50 years of institutional life -- before the Nicosia case -- only one judge has been dismissed through the impeachment system. The Chamber of Deputies now needs a two-thirds majority to press charges against a judge, and the Senate needs a two-thirds vote to dismiss him. It is clear that with this method it is almost impossible to dismiss a judge. As an example, Dr. Servini de Cubria is still at her post. The new Constitution drawn up by the UCR provides that suspected corrupt or unfit judges will be tried by a tribunal that will be similar to the Council for Magistrates, that is, its members will be judges, bar association representatives, academic institution representatives, and lawmakers. Some people will claim that it remains to be seen whether this system will work. Yet it is obvious that the current system does not work. In addition to these rules, which the UCR introduced into the Constitution to assure a really independent judicial branch, there are other initiatives on which no consensus was reached but which were included at our request. If the UCR has the larger number of convention delegates it will be possible to approve such initiatives, which deal with the creation of the position of ombudsman and the subordination of the attorneys general to a sector outside the three branches of government. The first initiative means that constitutional status will be given to an organ that will register reports and claims by any citizen of government or economic power abuse. Under the second initiative, the attorneys general (that is, the prosecutors) will no longer be subordinated to the executive branch (that is, to the government) or, as they are now, to the attorney general of the nation. This absurd situation has hindered many investigations into the work of public officials, causing honest judges to leave. Finally, in order to improve control mechanisms -- to avoid corruption from grabbing people's money -- we have managed to make the new Constitution put the Office of the Comptroller General, which is the main control organ, in the hands of the main opposition party. This regulation will be definitively incorporated into our Constitution. Another major conquest is the direct election -- that is, by voters -- of the mayor of the federal capital. There will be no more cases of designated mayors like former Buenos Aires Mayor Carlos Grosso. Finally, UCR members will strive to make the new Constitution establish rules for a new type of relation between the nation and the provinces -- an issue that is being widely debated -- and rules to protect defenseless consumers from arbitrary actions of those who render privatized public services, or from unscrupulous people who at times even risk people's lives. These initiatives will certainly produce stronger rejection in the government, because they are against the philosophy of Menem's and Cavallo's economic concentration model. We are then, beyond all doubt, facing a constitutional reform which even though giving Menem the possibility of running again, has managed to break his aspirations -- and the aspirations of the few economic power groups -- to perpetuate a model based on injustice, marginalization, and backwardness. Despite all this, some fellow countrymen may still think that Menem should not have a chance of being reelected. We thought that Menemism is what should not be reelected. If it had not been Menem, we would have had to defeat Eduardo Duhalde or Domingo Cavallo. The difference is that the presidential term would have continued to be for six years, that there would have been a pro-Menem majority until the year 2003, that courts would not have changed, and that the people would have been unable to control the government. In light of all this we say that Menemism, as a hegemonic model, has been left without reelection. Now Menem has to be defeated in the election. The people will make the decision. As we did more than 100 years ago, we have confidence in the people.
