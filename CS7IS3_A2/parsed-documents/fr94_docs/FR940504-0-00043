FR940504-0-00043 FR940504-0-00011 3. The relative technical performance of the Kahn and C-Quam systems was addressed in the Report and Order, including specifically the issues of platform motion, coverage area and adjacent channel performance. With regard to platform motion, we concluded that recent improvements in receiver design mitigate such effects. Modern C-Quam receivers compensate for platform motion by gradually reducing stereo channel separation as signal-to-noise ratios deteriorate, creating a smooth transition to monaural operation when signals are weak. Further, as previously noted, such weak signal effects as platform motion generally occur beyond a station's protected coverage area. Claims of loss of coverage area and increased adjacent channel interference with C-Quam appear to be based on allegations that the C-Quam signal must be modulated at lower levels to avoid excessive bandwidth. As stated in the Report and Order, we find no evidence that currently authorized C-Quam equipment violates the Commission's bandwidth requirements when operated properly. The additional commenting parties present no new analysis or measurements to support their claims. We further note that the record contains no complaints of lost coverage from the hundreds of broadcasters currently using the C-Quam system. 4. With regard to suggestions that further testing and evaluation should be performed, in the Report and Order we noted that the Motorola and Kahn systems have been tested and comparatively evaluated over the years, and both systems were found to have technical advantages. As stated, we have no reason to expect that further testing would reveal any new information. Moreover, any further testing would lead to additional delays and would be inconsistent with the statutory time restrictions on this proceeding. 5. The issue of compatibility with future AM band digital audio broadcast systems was also discussed in the Report and Order. We noted that there is no reason to believe that either the C-Quam system or the Kahn system would have any advantage in compatibility with future digital systems. We further observed that, as we have no specific information on the likely design of such systems, we would not presuppose to consider fairly issues relating to their compatibility with AM stereo technologies. 6. With regard to comments that protest the potential costs associated with re-engineering the antenna arrays to accommodate C-Quam transmission, we observe that conversion of any station to any AM stereo system, either initially or from one system to another, will certainly involve re-engineering costs. Commenting parties have not provided any evidence from which to conclude that the conversion cost to the relatively few stations using the Kahn system outweigh the benefits to the public of requiring use of the C-Quam system. 7. We stated in the Report and Order that we were not persuaded that Motorola unfairly manipulated the market to deny any segment of the industry or the public a free choice. No new information in the additional comments convinces us otherwise. While vehicular receivers for any system other than C-Quam may indeed be generally unavailable, this is a result of market choices by vehicle and receiver manufacturers in anticipating the preference of their customers. We disagree that existing market penetration is inadequate to determine whether a de facto standard exists. As stated in the Report and Order, we find that there was indeed sufficient convergence in the market place toward C-Quam during the past twelve years of unrestricted competition between the systems to conclude that the public interest would be best served by adopting C-Quam as the standard. 8. With regard to the comments that the Commission should mandate multiple system receivers, allow systems other than the standard to be operated on a non-interference basis, or not adopt a standard, we find these positions to be inconsistent with the Congressional mandate in this matter. Specifically, the Authorization Act requires that we select a single standard for AM stereo. 9. In the Report and Order, we determined that stations employing power-side operation are not subject to the provisions of the stereophonic transmission standard and use of the Kahn system for such operation could continue. Thus, we believe that the decision made in the Report and Order is responsive to those parties wishing to use the Kahn system for power-side operation. 10. We remain convinced that the Motorola C-Quam system is the appropriate choice for the AM stereo standard. We find no arguments in any of the previously unconsidered comments that persuade us to modify any of the decisions previously adopted in the Report and Order. Ordering Clause 11. Accordingly, it is ordered that this Supplemental Order is adopted. List of Subjects in 47 CFR Part 73 Radio broadcasting. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary.
