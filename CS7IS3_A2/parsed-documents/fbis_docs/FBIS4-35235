In two articles published today, AL-THAWRAH and AL-QADISIYAH explain that this man [King Fahd], who frequents brothels, bars, and gambling lounges, drank too much wine before addressing the delegations' heads and members. AL-THAWRAH, the mouthpiece of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, says that Fahd not only lost his awareness and balance, but also his memory, so he no longer recalls anything but his own dilemma and his comprehensive political and financial difficulties. [passage omitted] The paper asserts that all the bribes and grants given by the rulers of Kuwait to continue the unfair blockade on Iraq will not benefit them and will not prevent the fragmentation and erosion of this blockade, at which time Fahd will only be left with disgrace, shame, and history's curse. AL-QADISIYAH says: It was not strange for the Saudi rulers to take this position on the Arab nation's issues. This is because Saudi Arabia's very existence is only a colonialist creation whose duty is to place obstacles in the way of any effort to pool the nation's resources and employ them in the service of the Arab people's objectives. [passage omitted] The paper is not surprised by the position of the agent Fahd at the end of the pilgrimage season and by his abuses against Iraq and its people. It says: It is not strange for this regime to work for the internationalization of an internal Yemeni affair and deny the legitimate Yemeni authorities their right to fight the rebellious secessionists and those who encroached upon legitimacy.
