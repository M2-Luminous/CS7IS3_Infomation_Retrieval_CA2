Schmognerova arrived in Moscow yesterday with Slovak Economy Minister Peter Magvasi [as received; according to the referent item, the Slovak delegation consists of Schmognerova and Finance Minister Filkus] for a two-day visit. At the beginning of April Magvasi had given news of the possibility of credits to the value of $450 million. Schmognerova, who has been negotiating with Russian Nuclear Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov, said Russia was proposing the creation of a joint enterprise for the completion of the first block of the power station in Mochovce and would be interested in the enterprise dealing with other blocks later. Filkus and Schmognerova have also been negotiating the method for the repayment of the Russian debt to Slovakia, which after the division of Czechoslovakia took on debts from Moscow to the value of $1.6 billion. Slovakia was considering further supplies of spare parts for the Defense Ministry as a means of repayment, and is expecting that during the completion of the first block of Mochovce part of the Russian supplies will be covered in this way, Schmognerova said. Filkus said that he had invited his Russian counterpart Sergey Dubinin to visit Slovakia, and they could then agree on a document on the repayment of the Russian debt. This could later be signed in Moscow by the Slovak president or premier. At present, he said, there are two proposals for an agreement, both of which are found unacceptable for each side respectively.
