[Jeszenszky] In harmony with the government decision, we have prepared a detailed report on our activity of four years and on the current affairs. After the second round of elections, when we know the party and officials providing the new ministers, we will personally present all the important issues, answer every question and, if necessary, make proposals regarding the tasks ahead. [Scipiades] Personally, what will you do after the elections? [Jeszenszky] I have a rather good place on the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] national list and most probably I will make it into Parliament. I think that it is my moral and political obligation to continue to deal with Hungarian foreign policy and to participate in Hungarian public life as an MDF politician. [Scipiades] Do you intend to work in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Hungarian Parliament? [Jeszenszky] Yes. I would be a parliamentary deputy first of all, and naturally I want to continue my teaching career at the university. [Scipiades] In view of the fact that you had the possibility of better comparing various foreign countries than your party's leaders, in your opinion, what is the reason for your party's defeat? [Jeszenszky] It is not yet possible to evaluate the election results before the second round. Although I do not think that we can count on miracles and a complete turn in the results, the fate of the majority of individual deputies has not yet been decided. We hoped for a better result in the MDF; I expected a few percent more and a more balanced proportion among the various parties. I knew that a lot would depend on the mood of the last days and even last minutes, and this made the results of the first round impossible to forecast. At the same time, as a party, the MDF did not fare badly, because it has a firm basis and this could show in the second round too. I also believe that we can become a well-functioning and professional party in the coming period. [Scipiades] Something that the MDF has not been so far. [Jeszenszky] No, because we could not have such experiences and we were only a few people. The party's heroic age ended with the forming of its government. However, it was difficult for the MDF to get used to the role of "government party" and it was even more difficult to fulfill the tasks of such a party. [Scipiades] Among the MDF leaders, you must have known best the extent to which the left was assisted in its victory in last year's Polish elections by the brutal anti-left propaganda carried out by the Polish right. The situation is extremely similar in Hungary. Have you drawn the attention of the MDF leadership to the dangers of such propaganda? [Jeszenszky] I analyzed the Polish elections in detail to the MDF national committee, and I drew their attention to the lessons. As a party, the MDF understood these lessons. The phenomena you have mentioned did not characterize the central or local MDF campaign. Perhaps there were elements in the campaign that seemed to refute this, but these elements were definitely not the results of a strategic decision. [Scipiades] To what lessons did you draw the attention of the MDF leaders? [Jeszenszky] I drew their attention to the fact that it is not enough to emphasize our achievements, because the former Polish Government also achieved rather good results, just like the Hungarian Government. Actually, our less-than-expected results were not caused by our occasional mistakes; they were rather caused by a trend that is characterizing every former communist country: the people's exaggerated expectations, their lack of readiness to face the burdens, and continued expectations of a miracle. Thus, there is a historic trend here which seemingly was impossible to confront. Besides, the MDF fared better than the leading force of the Polish Government coalition in September 1993, and I regard this as a considerable achievement, just like the fact that the small parties that split from the MDF put up an insignificant presence in the elections. Thus, our stable basis of supporters understood the Polish lesson. [Scipiades] Certain MDF foreign political experts are trying now to drive home the lesson that the Socialists and the Liberals will not be able to do different things either regarding Hungary's policy toward its neighbors and regarding the issue of ethnic Hungarians beyond our borders. [Jeszenszky] I regard the criticism of the Socialists and the Liberals as only a campaign trick. In my opinion, in his first interview, Imre Szekeres, Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] deputy chairman, formulated their foreign policy program as this government did on many occasions in the past four years. Yes, I believe that other parties will not be able to represent other goals either. If they thoroughly analyze the criticism addressed to the MDF, they will find out we have done what could be done and what had to be done. If other parties can come to an agreement with our neighbors, an agreement that the MDF called upon in harmony with the ethnic Hungarians beyond our borders in 1989, I will only congratulate them. We are not to be blamed for the failure to achieve such an agreement. [Scipiades] Is there anything you would do differently now with your present experience? [Jeszenszky] Regarding the main lines and concrete steps, there is hardly anything that I would do differently now. Although it is possible that it would not have led to any results, we should have made more efforts for progress until the autumn of 1991, a time when a new age began after the big changes of 1989. If, for example, the Balladur plan had emerged then, it could have led to some results. Generally, our communication with the society was our weak point and, thus, we also failed to bring our foreign policy closer to the people. [Scipiades] The interest was there on the part of the journalists. [Jeszenszky] Yes. I am not talking about the dailies. There are still analytical commentators there, although fewer people read these columns. However, there are many more foreign policy programs in the foreign television programs, including much more analysis. A lot of ministers, politicians, and ambassadors are facing very well-trained journalists on CNN!
