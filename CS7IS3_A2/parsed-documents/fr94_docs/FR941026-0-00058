FR941026-0-00058 FR941026-0-00020 Initial Escrow Account Statements The proposed rule required servicers to provide borrowers an initial escrow account statement at settlement. For escrow accounts established after settlement, the proposed rule allowed an additional 45 days for the servicer to provide an initial escrow account statement to the borrowers. Fifteen commenters wanted to eliminate this requirement. Thirteen indicated that creating the initial escrow account statement is cumbersome and costly for servicers and confusing to borrowers. Others argued that the provisions of the proposed regulation that required delivery of the initial escrow account statement at settlement contradicted Section 10(c)(1)(B) of the statute. They claimed that the statute permitted up to 45 days from settlement within which servicers could submit initial escrow account statements to borrowers. The proposed rule did not specifically address table-funded transactions. Six commenters asked who would be responsible for preparing the initial escrow account statement in table-funded transactions. They noted that loan correspondents, brokers, and closing attorneys typically do not have the software and systems to produce the statement. Three comments asked how to compute the initial escrow deposits for a post-rule account. Three others suggested that the final rule specifically state that the settlement agent may collect funds at closing for items that have a disbursement date between the settlement and the initial payment date. Five commenters pointed out that some of the information on the initial escrow account statement duplicated the HUD&hyph;1 settlement statement. They claimed that borrowers received no additional benefit or disclosure from the separate statement. Four comments stated that HUD should provide a suggested, rather than required, format for the initial escrow account statement. In response to these comments, HUD notes that the RESPA statute as amended in 1990 requires servicers to provide borrowers with initial escrow account statements. HUD is implementing that statutory requirement through this final rule. In this final rule, the Department amends its proposed rule by expanding the timing requirements. The final rule permits servicers to provide the initial escrow account statement at settlement or within 45 days of settlement for escrow accounts that are established as a condition of the loan. The statute and rule also allow servicers to incorporate the initial escrow account statement in the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A settlement statement. Thus, some servicers may avoid a purported duplication of information by including the initial escrow account statement in the HUD&hyph;1 settlement statement at closing. For escrow accounts established after settlement (and not as a condition of the loan), the final rule allows an additional 45 days from the date the account is established for the servicer to provide an initial escrow account statement to the borrowers. Because of these changes, the actual servicer of the loan, rather than a settlement agent, is more likely to prepare the initial escrow account statement. HUD expects that in many table-funded transactions, for example, the servicer that sets up the escrow account will be responsible for delivering the initial escrow account statement to the borrowers. As noted above, the Department provides examples of how to compute the initial escrow deposits for a post-rule account. The initial escrow account statement is a forward-looking projection of anticipated activity in the account's first year. HUD's changes in the final rule should assure a higher degree of accuracy in the initial escrow account statements. In addition, borrowers are likely to find less errors or discrepancies when comparing later annual escrow account statements with the initial statement. Annual Escrow Account Statements and Escrow Account Analyses HUD's December 3, 1993, proposed rule required servicers to submit annual escrow account statements to borrowers for every federally related mortgage loan for which there is an outstanding escrow account. In its proposed definitions, HUD defined an ``escrow account analysis'' as a practice of computing a trial running balance that a servicer performs to prepare the initial and annual escrow account statements. Twenty-six commenters asked HUD to clarify the difference between the annual escrow account statement and the escrow account analysis. HUD considers the annual escrow account statement to be the borrower's tool to check the past year's escrow account activities and the projections for the next year. As such, HUD believes that servicers need to perform an escrow account analysis to make the statements meaningful. An escrow account analysis, therefore, is one step in the process of preparing the escrow account statements. Twenty-two commenters stated that when preparing the escrow account analysis, servicers should exclude from the trial running balance calculations unexpected deposits to the escrow account, such as ``loss drafts'' (insurance payments), and anticipated or actual earnings, such as interest. HUD concurs and excludes these deposits from the trial running balance calculations. However, if there is a special assessment to the borrower that impacts the escrow account within the escrow account computation year (e.g., water purification, road or utility assessments or special condominium assessments), then the servicer may choose to conduct an escrow account analysis at the time of the assessment and adjust the account accordingly. Some assessments may be billed for periods longer than a year. For example, flood insurance or water purification escrow funds may be payable on a three-year cycle. HUD's final rule provides guidance on how to calculate the account limits when the account includes such payables. The proposed rule specified that the servicer deliver the annual escrow account statement to a borrower within 30 days of the conclusion of the escrow account computation year. Four commenters thought that the term escrow account computation year should be changed to escrow computation cycle. They believed that this name change would allow servicers to spread out the work load more efficiently during the year. Seventeen commenters advocated more flexibility in when to conduct the escrow analyses, especially when servicers experience delays in obtaining pertinent information ( e.g., tax bills). These commenters recommended delaying the escrow analysis to provide a more meaningful statement, rather than performing one on schedule merely to comply with a regulatory requirement. Seven commented that the escrow analysis is generally prepared after the largest disbursement is made from the escrow account. Two commenters were not sure whether the proposed rule permitted the escrow account analysis to be performed on more than an annual basis. In response to these comments, HUD maintains a requirement of at least one escrow account analysis per year. Servicers are free to do more. The servicer will need to perform the analysis in preparing the annual escrow account statements. HUD retains the definition of escrow account computation year because it corresponds to the statute's 12 month period reference. Through the use of short year statements, servicers may set the escrow account computation year to coincide with the largest payment in the account, normally taxes. Sixty-nine commenters claimed that HUD's proposed annual escrow account statement requirements were confusing to borrowers and costly for servicers to implement and prepare. (These comments came from 26 banks, 30 mortgage companies, 7 attorneys, and 6 associations.) Three commenters requested elimination of the trial running balance, since it appeared unnecessary and confusing to borrowers. They also believed that the annual escrow account statements should be more general. The comments argued that it was too costly to develop and administer programs to provide tailored explanations. One software company stated that ``several statements on the annual statement may be impossible to provide using an automated system. *␣*␣* Generally, data processing systems are not designed to provide this type of annotated explanations. This type of artificial intelligence is cost prohibitive.'' Further, the commenters stated that the final rule should provide suggested, not required, disclosures and format.
