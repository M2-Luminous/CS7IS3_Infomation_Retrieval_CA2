The amount of radioactivity released by the materials already imported has not actually been measured but both company and state officials believe the concentrations of radioactive elements are so low as to pose no danger to public health. However, for safety's sake, the materials will reportedly be transported to Bangkok today to be used by the Office of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP). Thai Tantalum Co Ltd imported the waste last year as raw material for the extraction of tantalum pentoxide and columbium pentoxide -- used to make electronic capacitors -- at its factory in the Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate. But company president Yut Eamsa-at said it was only a "free sample" and had not been used because it was low-grade. He agreed yesterday not to import any more of the substance. Officials from the Department of Industrial Works' Office of Hazardous Substances (OHS) were informed about the shipment and issued Thai Tantalum an import licence. But they were not told that it contained radioactive substances, or that it came from a hazardous waste site. "We believe Thai Tantalum was just looking for cheap raw materials and they are not interested in importing any more of the waste," OHS Director Virah Mavichak said yesterday. "The amount of radioactivity is believed to be low, but we are unhappy that it came from a waste site. So we will revoke the import licence." According to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) documents, the shipment originated from a hazardous waste site in Muskogee, Oklahoma which contains roughly 21 tonnes of thorium and nine tonnes of uranium, both highly radioactive substances. The waste site belongs to Fansteel Inc, a former producer of tantalum and columbium products which now supplies Thai Tantalum with technical expertise. Thai Tantalum officials yesterday could not say for sure how much radioactive matenal was in the waste brought into Thailand. According to Jim Hill, a former employee of Fansteel now working as Thai Tantalum's lab manager, the thorium and uranium were unevenly distributed through Fansteel's sludge ponds, which were "the size of a football field" and contained 13.4 million kg of mostly solid waste. An X-ray analysis of the imported materials carried out by Hill revealed with "90 percent certainty" that uranium and thorium made up less than 0.2 percent of the sludge, or 5.5 kg. He said some of the standards needed to carry out the analysis were lacking. However, Thai Tantalum has never actually measured the radioactivity of the imported materials, or of the estimated 60 kg of radioactive materials it puts in its state-of-the-art landfill every day, because it does not have a geiger counter. But Yut sought to assure the public that the low concentrations of radioactive material, combined with the factory's hi-tech waste treatment system, meant that the area was safe. The company's former plant in Phuket was burned to the ground in 1986 by protestors afraid of being exposed to radioactivity.
