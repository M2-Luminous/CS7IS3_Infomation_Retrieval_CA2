ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document revokes the interim tolerance for residues of the fungicide pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) in or on bananas (40 CFR 180.319). EPA is taking this action because there is no registered use for PCNB on bananas, and this use is not being supported for reregistration. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation becomes effective on April 13, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : In the Federal Register of September 22, 1993 (58 FR 49264), EPA issued a proposal to revoke the interim tolerances established under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a, for residues of the fungicide pentachloronitrobenzene in or on bananas as listed in 40 CFR 180.319. EPA established an interim tolerance for PCNB for use on bananas pending the establishment of a permanent tolerance. However, EPA cannot establish a permanent tolerance for various reasons and as a result is revoking the interim tolerance in 40 CFR 180.319 for residues of pentachloronitrobenzene in bananas. The establishment of a tolerance under section 408 of FFDCA requires a finding that the tolerance will protect the public health. EPA does not have adequate data to make such a finding, and does not expect to receive such data because the use of PCNB on bananas is not being supported for reregistration. Further, there is no registered use of PCNB on bananas, and there is no evidence that it has been registered for this use in the U.S. for many years. A tolerance is generally not necessary for a pesticide which is not registered for the particular food use. There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the revocation of the interim tolerance for bananas in 40 CFR 180.319 is appropriate and that it will protect the public health. Therefore, the revocation is established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation revoking the interim tolerance may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order, i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: April 1, 1994. Lynn R. Goldman, Assistant Administrator for Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. Therefore, 40 CFR part 180 is amended as follows: PART 180_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a and 371. ยง180.319 [Amended] 2. Section 180.319 Interim tolerances is amended in the table therein by amending the entry ``Pentachloronitrobenzene'' by removing from the list of raw agricultual commodities the entry ``Bananas,''.
