This is because these suspect attempts imply a noteworthy encouragement of the secessionist tendency as a prelude to fragmenting the Yemeni homeland and people. If the UN Security Council interferes in Yemen's internal affairs, it might decide to send international troops to Yemeni territory, which is similar to what the Security Council did in Somalia and other areas. We believe that the bitter and difficult experience in Somalia was sufficient for the Arabs to learn the necessary lesson and stop inviting foreign states and forces, whether friendly or hostile, to interfere in Arab affairs. All Arab states and parties should know that foreign military and political interference will not be in favor of Yemen, its national unity, or its territorial integrity. If the Arab League really cares for halting the destructive war in Yemen, it should activate the stipulations and articles of its charter and abide by its by-laws, all of which provide for resolving any Arab crisis inside, and not outside, the Arab house. The Arab League should also make all necessary efforts and moves in order to foil the secessionist tendency among the southern Yemeni leaders and urge them to commit themselves to legitimacy and unity. No Arab party supports the continuation of the ongoing war between the brothers in Yemen because it is a destructive war that will inflict grave damage on the Yemeni economy and its infrastructure and superstructure. All Arab states should make serious and responsible initiatives to halt this war, extinguish its fire, and stop the Yemeni bloodshed. They should also stress the protection of Yemeni unity, respect for legitimacy, and the prevention of any foreign interference in the affairs of this fraternal Arab country. A real solution to the Yemeni crisis is one that would safeguard the Yemeni people's unity and preserve Yemen's territorial integrity. Such a solution will not be provided by any form of foreign interference or internationalization of the crisis.
