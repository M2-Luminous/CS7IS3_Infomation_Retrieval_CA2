Giving absolute credit to the recent accusations made by Deputy Traian Basescu [of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front)], which it considers as the pure truth, ROMANIA LIBERA -- with a persistence worthy of a better case -- wants to involve the presidency and its representatives in the affair of the sale of the Romanian fleet [illegally sold to Greek businessman Stellos Katounis, owner of the shipping company Forum Maritime]. This time, the "cause" is served by Sorin Rosca Stanescu, who, probably out of the desire to return to ROMANIA LIBERA en-force, only proves that he has not forgotten the practices used by the old Securitate, whose reliable informer he had been. The article claims that "representatives of the executive branch" and the presidential institution have supplied secret information regarding the Petromin fleet to Greek intelligence General Nikos Grylakis. In this connection, Democratic Party Deputy Basescu named two names: Minister of Transport Paul Teodoru and Vasile Ionel, President Ion Iliescu's adviser. "Until now, the representatives of the government, as well as those of the presidential institution, have not officially denied anything," the article claims, adding that General Grylakis has "influenced President Iliescu's election," for which he "received a medal in Bucharest in 1993; Iliescu does not deny this." Romanian President Ion Iliescu has often stated his opinion on the Petromin-Forum Maritime affair, but to maintain its accusations of indifference and silence ROMANIA LIBERA chooses to deliberately ignore this thing. We recall that on 24 June 1993, when he was first time asked about the contract between the Petromin and Forum Maritime companies, President Ion Iliescu said: "This is not one of my prerogatives; I am not obliged, nor do I think it is necessary for me to deal with these problems that belong to the national economic sphere. I do not have the necessary instruments for that or the necessary qualifications. There is no presidential department in charge of these matters, which do not fall under the competence of the presidential institution. This is a matter to be dealt with by the trade companies or public corporations involved in these affairs and by the relevant government officials, ministries, and economic-financial control bodies. I do not deny that there might be suspicions in connection with the seriousness and professionalism with which the respective negotiations were conducted. All this should be examined." (From the press communique of the presidential spokesman No. 164/1993) In the meantime, the Romanian press gave details about the Petromin-Forum Maritime affair, so that on 23 July 1993, the presidential spokesman summed up President Ion Iliescu's viewpoint on this subject in two points: "1. The Petromin-Forum Maritime contract should be examined by the bodies set up for this purpose, namely the respective parliamentary and government commissions, so that a normal contract can be concluded which does not disadvantage the Romanian state. "2. The situation of all contracts previously concluded by Petromin should be clarified and the results of the enquiry should be published, with the relevant bodies being notified if needed." ROMANIA LIBERA's claim that General Grylakis "influenced President Iliescu's election" is ridiculous, to say the least, so it does not deserve any comment. Regarding the alleged medal awarded by Romania's president to General Grylakis, Sorin Rosca Stanescu should have known that the practice of awarding medals was discontinued in our country after the December 1989 revolution. As a matter of fact, the spokesman mentioned that thing on another occasion, in answer to a question about a similar allegation made by daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI. (From the spokesman's press communique N. 213/1993) Regarding the accusations made by Deputy Traian Basescu, according to which General Vasile Ionel would have supplied a file with secret data to the Greek general, we reprint here the answer given by the presidential adviser to the daily ULTIMUL CUVANT on 28 February 1994: "It is the statement of a man who does not assume responsibility for what he is saying. I will disappoint Mr. Basescu and those inclined to believe him by responsibly stating that I do not know what they are talking about." A first logical question is why would such a commercial transaction -- over the Petromin fleet -- have to involve files with secret data and the interference of an official from the presidency? Of course, it is easy to realize that there are various quarters interested in sowing as much confusion as possible in this respect and divert attention from what has to be clarified, namely the ways and means through which part of the Petromin fleet was sold abroad. Romania's president considers that the legal system is the only one capable of ascertaining the truth of these accusations; consequently, he hopes that the legal bodies will shed some light on what is called "the Petromin affair." Any rumors or "information" deliberately launched in this connection can only encumber the normal proceedings of the inquiry -- the press communique released by the spokesman of the Romanian presidency concludes.
