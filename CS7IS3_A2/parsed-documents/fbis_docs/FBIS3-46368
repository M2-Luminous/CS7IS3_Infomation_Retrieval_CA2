The 211 project, pinpointing the spirit with which the country's education must face the 21st century, spells out the build-up of 100 key higher education institutions and key specialist subject centers throughout the country in some ten years. Hence the figure 211. Authorities said the project is a strategic educational reform move for China designed to get the country's universities and colleges soundly prepared for the upcoming challenges in the next century so as to well serve the country's accelerated modernization drive. The project aims to help the 100 universities and scientific centers, to be selected in stages over the next ten or more years, train more world-class professionals faster and, meanwhile, raise their academic level to above the national average and close to that of the world. Universities and colleges nationwide have been responding to the project. They will be granted special government funds and preferential treatment once chosen to be among the 100. The 30 Tianjin-based institutions of higher learning are making all-out efforts to reform their educational structure and upgrade their academic levels in a bid to get into the group of the chosen 100. Li Guangquan, president of Tianjin University, said the 211 project is a precious development opportunity as well as a tough challenge for his university. He said his university is a strong and hopeful contender but improvements are still wanted in one way or another. Du Buying, president of the Tianjin Institute of Finance and Economics, said his institute has readjusted development strategy so as to be more competitive. All the other universities in the city have been concentrating on building up their teaching staff and improving their campus environment as well as on raising academic levels. Some universities and colleges in the city have merged to improve their competitive edge. Education officials said that though there will be only 100 chosen universities and institutions across the country, the 211 project will turn out to be a golden chance both for those selected and those not selected to push their education and management to a higher level.
