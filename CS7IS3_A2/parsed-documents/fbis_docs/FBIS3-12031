Raina Rondon reports from Congress. [Begin recording] [Rondon] In the afternoon, Governor Salas Romer already had the support of the Democratic Action [AD], Copei [Social Christian Party], and MAS [Movement Toward Socialism parliamentary wings], support he feels guarantees the draft reform will be submitted to Congress within the next few days. [Salas Romer] Based on Article 22 of the Constitution--which establishes that Congress will issue a law on the election and removal of governors--it is possible to establish the conditions within which one could go to the extreme of dismissing the governor. [Rondon] Meanwhile, Antonio Ledezma has announced Congress decided during the session to declare the health sector in a state of emergency due to the serious hospital crisis prevailing throughout the country and the doctors' conflict. Gustavo Tarre Briceno, chairman of the lower chamber Finance Commission said Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom made a mistake when he said the Executive Branch would be willing to study a draft of a special powers law which will include mechanisms for resolving national social and administrative issues inasmuch as the Constitution establishes that special powers may only include economic and financial issues. [Tarre Briceno] The government had not asked for anything up to now. AD comes and makes an offer. The executive branch, rather than accepting or rejecting that offer, now proposes, via the interior minister, more special powers to include administrative and social issues, which is evidently against the Constitution. [Rondon] To conclude, Gustavo Tarre Briceno said Congress is only waiting for the executive branch to decide what it wants regarding the Special Powers law. [end recording]
