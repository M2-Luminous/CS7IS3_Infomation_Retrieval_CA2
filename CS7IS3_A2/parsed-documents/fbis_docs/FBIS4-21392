In over 20 years of work in the Ukrainian press I have often caught myself being prejudiced against some agencies and organizations. Except for one, which I have served faithfully for a number of years. Not the office itself, of course, but its underlying idea, which, unless fully implemented, would make life in Ukraine impossible. This organization used to be called the UkSSR State Environmental Committee; now its title is the Ministry for the Protection of the Environment of Ukraine. But I would like to call it the Ministry of Survival, because unfortunately the direst forecasts are coming true. On the population growth chart of Ukraine, the curves measuring live births and deaths came together in 1990 at a very tragic point, at which our nation has begun to die out physically. I found that chart in the National Report on the State of the Environment in Ukraine, which, in accordance to the law, the ministry must submit annually to the Supreme Council. I will discuss these reports--there have already been two of them, for 1992 and 1993--below. Now, let us cite the axiom: the environmental crisis is global in character and it can be resolved only by mankind in its entirety and, on the state level, by the authorities at the highest level. In other words, our chances for survival depend on the level of authority of the country's highest environmental protection entity. What kind of organization was the UkSSR State Environmental Committee is painful to recall. Officials in oblast and rayon committees, hired for minuscule wages, had one responsibility only: to rubber-stamp decisions harmful to the environment issued by higher authorities. I have been friends with many of them and understand very well how difficult it is to oppose bureaucratic demands. One must have tremendous courage to defend from a hare-brained project a national landmark, the Khortytsya island in Zaporozhye oblast, for example, or to fight the Danube-Dniepr canal, or to oppose the construction of the Crimea nuclear power station. For articles on this issue, written with the help of my trusted assistants from the State Environment Committee, I won a number of top awards of the late USSR. Then, the empire began to crumble. Before its collapse, the command-administrative system of the Union tried making cosmetic changes when it issued the resolution "On Fundamental Restructuring of Environmental Protection in the Country," which caused a major bout of musical chairs to be played at environment protection agencies. The Committee was changed into a ministry, but the power over our land remained in the hands of monopolies. That was the full extent of the achievement. Later, at the time of the so-called perestroyka, on the wave of popular outrage over the Chernobyl disaster, a powerful environmental protection movement emerged in the country. I was one of the founders of the Green World. I left it because politics started to grow in influence there. I believe that it is a deadly sin to make a career out of a severe national ecological disaster, and that the public must concentrate all its efforts on creating a powerful state environmental protection agency that would be equal to, for example, the Prosecutor General. Unfortunately, careers are being made but the cause does not advance. Then came the sacred light of independence, and a generally progressive law "On the Protection of the Environment" which for the first time in our history established a system of ecological security for the people. Serious, calm and responsible people were placed at the head of the ministry and old painful problems began to be addressed. And what now? Nothing. An adequate environmental protection system, which barely began to be formed in the country, has been dealt a typical, and I fear mortal, blow. And it was done cleanly. Based on the presidential decree on government service, the ministry is being cut by 30 percent, apparently along definite lines. The attestation process is already underway; then there will be a reshuffle of agency personnel, wasting valuable expertise gained by experienced employees. I agree that many existing ministries can be easily cut back by as much as 50 percent. But the Ministry of Survival should have its staff tripled, and its authority considerably extended. Everyone who attentively follows current processes in Ukraine will notice that every stupid action by the authorities is extremely rational from the point of view of the private interests of its authors. Take just two of Ukraine Cabinet of Ministers resolutions, No. 18, dated 13 January 1992, and No. 373, dated 7 July 1992. They effectively destroyed the painstakingly built system of fines for polluting the environment. It turns out, then, that a powerful environmental ministry with real economic power and influence is not needed? It is a rhetorical question. The answer is obvious. For a good 10 years, I have been repeating in the press that a state environmental protection agency can only be effective if its independence from executive power is fully guaranteed. As that of the parliament, the prosecutor and the press is in all civilized states. This is one of the main conditions for the survival of the people and, hence, the country. Perhaps we should not frighten the readers with the comprehensive picture of the destruction of nature contained in the National Report on the State of the Environment in Ukraine for the last two years, which the Environment Ministry sent to the country's parliament. Our chamber of representatives, having suspended the moratorium on the construction of nuclear power stations, has, in my opinion, clearly demonstrated its true attitude on this major problem in the life of the people. The report is a major effort by a large group of specialists. Last year's document is distinguished by greater depth and a broader conception compared to the one drafted in 1992. It not only presents data on the condition of the ground, the water and the air and on the impact of pollution, including radioactive pollution, on the health of the population, but also proposes a program for what in my opinion is the most important issue: environmental protection reform in Ukraine. This reform will be comprised of three stages. The first will consist, primarily, of establishing an effective environmental protection system of ecological security and of drafting a number of legislative acts to ensure it. The second stage will be to develop and implement comprehensive programs to solve priority problems to balance the level of environmental pollution with nature's ability to regenerate itself. Finally, the third stage will be to build a system of managing environmental resources and regulating the technological impact on them at a level where the resolution of such problems would become the foundation for steady development of society. We have conquered nature. Now, thank God, we have realized that we have been stupidly fighting our own mother and will survive only if we make peace with her and subjugate the life of society to this peace. Perhaps we should not recount journalistically this enormous analytical work. But the final chapter of the National Report for 1993 contains the following recommendation for this year: "Due to the uncertainty of changes taking place in the Ukrainian economy, it is important to ensure qualitative and quantitative changes to improve the environmental situation in Ukraine." This is how we live. The environment is hostage to the economy. The latter, in turn, is fully dependent on politics. But will the future Ukrainian parliament be willing to heed the dire warnings contained in the National Report? Meanwhile, the bureaucratic feast during the environmental famine which is taking place today is certain to curb the fighting spirit of the Environment Ministry further. This is why I do not hide the aim of my article: supporters of environmental protection must make themselves heard and to try to stop cuts which so resemble a slaughter.
