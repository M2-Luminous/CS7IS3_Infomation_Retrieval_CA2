FBIS4-13239 "drnes075_m_94003" FBIS-NES-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 JORDAN Authorities Withdraw Hamas Officials' Passports Authorities Withdraw Hamas Officials' Passports JN1904074294 Amman JORDAN TIMES in English 19 Apr 94 pp 1, 10 JN1904074294 Amman JORDAN TIMES English BFN [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] [Text] Amman--Jordanian authorities have withdrawn the passports of Hamas representative in Jordan Muhammad Nazzal and Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah, pending their decision on whether to comply with Jordanian regulations. Official sources said the two men were summoned by the authorities and asked to "decide whether they are Palestinian--in which case they would be given a temporary two-year passport given to residents of the occupied territories, or they are Jordanian citizens who comply with Jordanian laws." The sources said the two were also asked to refrain from making any statements claiming responsibility for attacks in the occupied territories. A senior Jordanian official told the Jordan Times that the government had intended to curb the activities of Hamas in Jordan without much publicity but was pressured to publicise these measures after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin issued a warning to Jordan charging that it was helping Hamas. "We had already instructed the minister of interior to deal with the issue before Rabin had his press conference," the senior official said. Hamas representatives were not available for comment Monday, but the movement issued a statement charging that Mr. Rabin was "creating fictitious conflicts to cover up for his political failure." "The prime minister of the enemy Yitzhaq Rabin has issued a warning to Jordanin which he claimed that there is a leadership for Hamas on its territory and demanding that the Jordanian government take action against its activities," the statement responded. "It is a failed attempt to use the confirmation by the Hamas representatives in Amman of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's Brigades' claim of responsibility for the heroic acts in 'Afula and Hadera," the statement said. "Rabin and his government know very well that the al-Qassam's Brigades conduct, plan and execute their activities from the occupied territories," the statement said, adding that "his failure to put an end to these attacks, and the revealing of his deception in the settlement process has caused him to use these attacks to issue a warning to Jordan." Hamas said that Mr. Rabin needed to warn Jordan to achieve the following objectives: --Direct attention away from the failure of his security measures and his oppressive measures in putting an end to the heroic attacks by the al-Qassam Brigades. --Use the "American sword" to pressure Jordan towards signing a unilateral agreement with his government similar to the one signed in Oslo, and this warning falls in line with the policy of the U.S. administration which uses the naval blockade on al-'Aqabah as a way to pressure Jordan for the same purpose. Despite the strong language against Israel and Mr. Rabin's government, the Hamas statement appeared to set a precedent in opening the door for bargaining with Israel. Stressing that the attacks against Israeli civilians were in retaliation against the Hebron massacre of Palestinian worshippers, Hamas said that this was not a policy but the "exception." "Hamas is ready to reconsider this exception on the condition that the enemy's prime minister, his government and his army halt completely all killings of unarmed civilians from our people," the statement said. "We are not against peace," the statement added," but the peace offered by the government of the enemy is not peace but a consolidation of occupation and the injustice falling on our people." "While we in Hamas know well that the Oslo agreement is nothing but humiliating surrender from the PLO... we think that the right beginning would be on the following foundations," the statement added. Hamas demanded the "full Israeli withdrawal from our Palestinian land and dismantling and removal of all settlements, the holding of full and free elections in the West Bank and Gaza to select the representatives of our people and their leadership." "The chosen leadership will be the one that represents the aspirations and hopes of our people and will decide on the ensuing steps," the statement concluded in what most analysts termed as an indication that Hamas was proposing itself as an alternative leadership to the Palestine Liberation Organisation, through the results of the elections and by deduction the side to conduct negotiations with Israel.
