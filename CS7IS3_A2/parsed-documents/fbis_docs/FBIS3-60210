The money comes mainly from illegal drugs and arms dealing and is laundered via more than 200 private banks and foreign exchange bureaus, as well as foreign branches of Serbian banks. The BND says that the blackmailing of officials is a common practice both in setting up new banks and in banks' business transactions. Several political groups are said to be involved in cooperating with organized crime.
