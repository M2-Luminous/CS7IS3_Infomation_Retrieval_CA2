The only important step taken in this regard is the proposal by Deputy Foreign Minister Jalil Shams for a conference in Herat in which the representatives of every group, apart from General Dostam's representative, will participate to discuss Afghanistan's future. This proposal has reportedly been ineffective due to differences of opinion on whether General Dostam's representative should attend. This issue, along with the stances of Golboddin Hekmatyar and Borhanoddin Rabbani on the manner of the transfer of power after Rabbani's presidential term, has aggravated the existing differences. Political observers predict that if these difficulties are not resolved in the next seven days, when Rabbani's tenure of office ends, Afghanistan will witness more intense clashes and bloodshed. Remember that continuing clashes--regardless of the pretext--will not be justifiable as far as the Afghan people are concerned. The military and political leaders of Afghanistan and the people should have realized by now, after two years of war and bloodshed, that military means can achieve no positive outcome. They have no option but to resort to other means. If the rival factions in Afghanistan do not resolve their differences amicably they will answer to the Afghan people for the consequences of their actions. It appears that there is still a chance to reconcile differences. The Afghan groups should readjust their demands and should display flexibility and a regard for the rights of other groups. They should refrain from intransigence and should give priority to national interests over group interests and thus end the Afghan crisis.
