Attempts are being made to show them as an instrument of political pressure and blackmail. This was shown especially clearly on 9 November 1993, on the day of the opening of the latest session of parliament, when internal troops were deployed to maintain civil order. This was caused, the statement says, by the fact that in Minsk the day before, leaflets appeared with a call to get rid of the government and for armed protest. One of the leaflets was read at the session. In a number of cities there were gatherings of people who were antigovernment for [words indistinct] and exerting pressure on the authorities. There was information warning about possible terrorist acts from the Embassy of the Russian Federation. The Belarusian KGB was unaware of a breakthrough by aggressively inclined representatives of the (?BZV) [expansion unknown] toward the government building. In this way, the statement stresses, the Ministry of Internal Affairs had sufficient grounds for considering that on the day of the opening of the session there could arise conditions which would threaten civil peace and the security of citizens. Therefore, a plan for ensuring law and order was put into practice. The actions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs on 20 January this year were described in the same [word indistinct]. In the report on the deputies' investigation published in NARODNAYA GAZETA it was alleged that subunits of the internal troops were sent to intimidate deputies who did not support the government line, that the troops were concentrated in numbers intended to carry out military action. The Military Council of Internal Troops categorically denies this allegation. We solemnly declare that the internal troops of the Republic of Belarus will never be an instrument for the ambitions of politicians who struggle for power by illegal means, says the statement. We appeal to political parties and movements, to the mass media, and to the public asking and insisting to stop dragging the internal troops into the political arena. The troops stand on guard of the law. They acted and will act within the law.
