FR940111-2-00064 FR940111-2-00034 National Toxicology Program; Availability of Technical Report on Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Mercuric Chloride The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of Mercuric Chloride, an inorganic compound that has been used in agriculture as a fungicide, in medicine as a topical antiseptic and disinfectant, and in chemistry as an intermediate in the production of other mercury compounds. Two-year toxicology and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by administering to groups of 60 rats of each sex 0, 2.5, or 5 mg mercuric chloride/kg body weight and to groups of 60 mice of each sex 0, 5, or 10 mg/kg in deionized water by gavage 5 days per week for 2 years. Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity 1 of mercuric chloride in male F344 rats based on the increased incidence of squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach. Marginally increased incidences of thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas may have been related to mercuric chloride exposure. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of mercuric chloride in female F344 rats based on two squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of mercuric chloride in male B6C3F1 mice based on the occurrences of two renal tubule adenomas and one renal tubule adenocarcinoma. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of mercuric chloride in female B6C3F1 mice receiving 5 or 10 mg/kg. 1 The NTP uses five categories of evidence of carcinogenic activity observed in each animal study: Two categories for positive results (``clear evidence'' and ``some evidence''), one category for uncertain findings (``equivocal evidence''), one category for no observable effect (``no evidence''), and one category for studies that cannot be evaluated because of major flaws (``inadequate study'').
