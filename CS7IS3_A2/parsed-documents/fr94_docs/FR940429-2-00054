For a period of 90 days from the date of publication of this notice, all persons who wish to submit comments in connection with the proposed withdrawal continuation may present their views in writing to the State Director in the New Mexico State Office. The authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management will undertake such investigations as are necessary to determine the existing and potential demand for the land and its resources. A report will also be prepared for consideration by the Secretary of the Interior, the President, and the Congress, who will determine whether or not the withdrawal will be continued, and if so, for how long. The final determination on the continuation of the withdrawal will be published in the Federal Register. The existing withdrawal will continue until such final determination is made. Dated April 15, 1994. Patricia E. McLean, State Director. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10265 Filed 4&hyph;28&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;FB&hyph;M
