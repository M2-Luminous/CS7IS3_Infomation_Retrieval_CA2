Addressing a seminar on the provincial economy and foreign investment environment, Lu Ruihua, vice-governor of the province, said that Guangdong had used a total of 33.54 billion U.S. dollars of overseas investments by May this year. The funds helped the province achieve an annual growth of 13.8 percent in its gross domestic product over the past decade. As the province enjoys excellent conditions in both domestic and international environment, it plans to achieve the targets in China's modernization drive in 20 years. During this period, Guangdong will need at least 190 billion U.S. dollars in overseas investment. To get this, the vice-governor said, Guangdong Province is ready to open its primary industries, secondary industries and service industries to overseas investment, except for some special fields. Overseas investors are welcome to solely own or hold the larger share in stock-holding enterprises, apart from some infrastructure industries in which continued state monopoly is necessary, he said. The province is particularly interested in capital investment from multinational business giants as well as small and medium-sized businesses. Industrial investment, bank loans and low-interest loans are all welcomed, he said. Opening its market, the vice governor said, means to attract more overseas funds and introduce high technology. The higher the technology proportion, the more it will open its market. The province will also allow overseas investors to purchase shares of local firms. But, assets appraisal and property ownership must be clarified before shares are sold and before permission is given to trade the stocks in the market, he said. In attracting overseas investment, the vice-governor said, Guangdong Province will do its utmost to protect the lawful rights of foreign investors and allow them to make profits. However, he also emphasized that supervision of the overseas-funded enterprises must be intensified as well in light of the growing number of labor conflicts. Guangdong Province is ready to bring in regulations to protect the lawful rights and interests of both employers and employees. National policies and international common practice will be applied in the supervision of overseas-funded enterprises so as to make effective use of foreign investment and make Guangdong a more appealing place for overseas investors.
