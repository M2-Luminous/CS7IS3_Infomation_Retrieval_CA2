During the exercises, methods of cooperation between ground forces and the Baltic Fleet will be worked out. A large group of generals and officers of the Russian Defense Ministry have been sent to the region to prepare for the exercises. In the opinion of Konstantin Kobets, Russia's chief military inspector, it is necessary to check the combat capabilities of the troop structures that previously had powerful rear cover but which are now surrounded by states whose policy toward Russia is not always clear. In his opinion, the group of forces in the region should reliably ensure the defense of Russia's western borders.
