It involves all the fields of the contemporary social and political life and summarizes all the basic viewpoints of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Although it embraces such extensive knowledge and profound scholarship, it explains them in simple terms in close connection with reality, thus touching our hearts. Many things it mentions are what we have personally experienced, but never conscientiously summarized. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions enable us to suddenly see the light and gain much benefit. Reading through Volume 3, we have a particular feeling that, at the beginning, we often cannot not understand or can understand merely superficially the whole meaning of Comrade Xiaoping's profound ideological viewpoints and broad and long-term policy decisions; and that, as time goes by, as we are educated through practice, and, in particular, as these viewpoints and policy decisions yield tremendous achievements in the course of practice, we will be able to gain a fairly profound understanding after we review them. It is thus clear that it is not easy to acquire a true understanding, not to mention mastery, of the book after reading. The Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping is underlined by the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, which is the quintessence and soul of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The great practice of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th party Central Committee was started exactly with this reestablished ideological line. This line is a condensed summary of dialectical materialism and historical materialism and the epitome of the proletarian world outlook and methodology. Following this line to understand reality from objective viewpoints, we will find correct answers to the many theoretical and practical questions, however complicated they may be. In the following, proceeding from the ideological line, I will discuss my shallow understanding on some major theoretical and practical questions. 1. Why Should China "Take Its Own Road" for Its Development? The opening article of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping contains a very incisive theory: "Our modernization drive should proceed from China's reality. In either revolution or construction, we should pay attention to learning and drawing lessons from foreign experiences. However, success can never be achieved by mechanically copying the experiences and patterns of foreign countries. We have had many lessons in this. The basic conclusion we have reached after summarizing the long historical experiences is that we should integrate the universal truth of Marxism with the specific reality of our country, take our own road, and build socialism with Chinese characteristics." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, pp 2-3) These 100-odd characters coagulate the achievements of the party's long practice and experiences and its theoretical explorations, show the party's basic political proposition concerning the road of development, and epitomize the basic essence of the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. Socialist construction and the road of development are basic issues deciding on the future and destiny of socialism. Historical experiences told us that leaving these issues unresolved, it is impossible for us to find a universally applicable pattern or road of development. "Taking our own road and building socialism with Chinese characteristics" is a concise and comprehensive theory that pinpoints the essence of the issue on the road of development. Its meaning in theory and practice also lies in the fact that it corrects the tendency of deviation from practice concerning the issues on socialist construction and road of development and provides answers to both the doubts and censures form the "left" and the right. It opens up the only correct course for our socialist modernization. Why should China "take its own road and build socialism with Chinese characteristics?" According to my understanding, we should answer this question from three aspects. First, because we cannot find a correct road from books. "Because such a thing as building socialism in China cannot be found either in the books on Marxism or the books of Lenin." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 260) Although Marxist theory on socialism provided principled plans for socialist construction, neither Marx nor Lenin provided or could provide a ready plan for a country to build socialism after they died. Just as Comrade Xiaoping said: "We should never ask Marx to provide ready answers to the questions arising 100 years or several hundred years after he died. Likewise, neither could Lenin bear the task of providing ready answers to the questions arising 50 or 100 years after he died." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 291) "After the revolution succeeds, a country should build socialism according to its own conditions. There is no fixed pattern, and it is impossible to have one. Views sticking to conventions will only lead to backwardness and even failure." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 292) This is to say that we should integrate the basic principle of Marxism with the reality of our own country and explore "our own road" in practice. Second, it will not work to mechanically copy the pattern of other countries. Because "with a different foundation, different history, different environment, different neighbors, and many other differences, one country can learn from, but never mechanically copy the experiences of others. China suffered a lot from mechanically copying others' experiences. China can develop only Chinese socialism." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 265) The above-mentioned two answers are the summary of our successful experiences and lessons of failure gained in our explorations on building socialism. For example, in the process of socialist transformation, our party did not rigidly adhere to Marxist books, nor did it mechanically copy the methods of other countries. Instead, it adopted the principles and policies compatible with China's conditions. Therefore, the socialist transformation was completed fairly smoothly and it promoted the development of productive forces and created successful experiences. Beginning in the late 1950's, however, the "leftist" erroneous ideology gained ground in the party. Instead of applying and developing theories in a creative manner in line with our national conditions and formulating the principles and policies compatible with reality, we were divorced from reality in judging China's conditions. We either mechanically copied what books said or mechanically copied the patterns of other countries, resulting in being overanxious for quick results, pursuit of absolute perfection, and such erroneous guiding thoughts, principles, and policies as "taking class struggle as the key link." Many things hindering the development of productive forces were regarded as "socialist principles" and adhered to, and many others compatible with reality and the masses' desires and helpful to the development of productive forces were regarded as the "tails of capitalism" and the "restoration of capitalism" and were opposed and criticized. As a result, we established an ownership structure that was too unitary, adhered for a long time to a highly centralized and rigid planned economy system and a political system whereby power was too centralized, and seriously fettered the development of productive forces. Such a situation developed into the "Great Cultural Revolution," which led the national economy to the brink of collapse. We should learn from this bitter lesson. Third, because it is not realistic to follow the capitalist road in the path, and it also will not be realistic to do so in the future. China can only practice socialism. This is a major theoretical issue as well as a rigorous practical issue. Since reform and opening up, particularly during recent years, due to the rapid changes in the international situation, some major and minor events have also taken place in the country, making us more clear-headed and alert of this issue. During the time when the ideological trend of bourgeois liberalization ran rampant, one erroneous viewpoint once emerged which believed that the capitalist stage should not be overstepped and that China should "go back to its old road." Going back to the old road means practicing "total westernization. This "theoretical" influence once made many comrades, some young people, in particular, have doubts in our systems. This viewpoint still has a certain market to this day. In view of this erroneous viewpoint, Comrade Xiaoping once talked about modern Chinese history on different occasions. He pointed out: Some people have raised such a question: Is it possible for the people of China to stand up and for China to turn over if it fails to practice socialism but follows the capitalist road? After more than 20 years of efforts of the Kuomintang, China had still remained a semi-colonial and semi- feudal society. This showed that it is impossible for China to have success if it follows the capitalist road. The one that changed the image of China is not the Kuomintang or the father and son of the Chiang's but the Chinese people led by the CPC and socialism. It is socialism that makes China marches toward unification and independence and ends a long period of a chaotic, poor and backward state. Here, Comrade Xiaoping used facts to show a true theory: In China where imperialism and the feudal influence are too strong and national bourgeoisie is too weak, it is absolutely unrealistic for it to follow the capitalist road; it is an inevitable choice for China to follow the socialist road during the development of its history. In modern Chinese history, the "locally born and bred" bourgeoisie will not get anywhere and, after all, capitalism is only its dream. Then, will it be possible for the dreams of some people who have attempted to "introduce" the capitalist system of Western countries turn into reality today when socialism has experienced more than 40 years of trials and hardships? Will China's ship of socialism change its course in the fierce wind and waves of "peaceful evolution" and bourgeois liberalization? In face of these major questions of right and wrong, not all the people are clear-headed. Some people always think of using the prescription of the Western capitalist system to fundamentally cure the "disease of poverty" in China and believe that once they accept the capitalist systems, China will attain the highest level in one step and the pockets of all the people will be full. Certainly, this is a naive illusion. As Comrade Xiaoping has analyzed, China is a big country with a large population but a small county in economy. If it discards socialism in a single day, it will go back to the semi-colonial and semi-feudal society with a majority of poor people and a few rich people, and it will be impossible to attain the goal of becoming "well-off," and will have no guarantee for having enough food and clothing; if China discards socialism in a very short time, it will be unable to gain a foothold at all today when the strong capitalist countries have monopolized the international market, and it will be surely controlled by other people and become the appendage of the big Western countries, and will even be unable to maintain the current independent status. What it can do is to act in line with others' expressions and to live at the "mercy" of other people; if once China discards socialism and implements "democracy," "freedom," and "human rights" of the big Western countries, it will lose its political situation of stability and unity and even have civil wars which will not only bring harms to China but also bring disasters to the world. In short, if China practices capitalism, about one-fifth of the world population will have a major retrogression and there will be great disasters in history. This is a scene which each and every Chinese person with intuitive knowledge does not want to see as well as one which the people of foreign countries with insight do not want to see. This is absolutely not talking out of the void. The present situations of some countries have provided examples to prove this conclusion. When adhering to "our own road," we do not rule out opening to the outside world. Just as Comrade Xiaoping said: "For socialism to win the advantages comparable to capitalism, we should bravely absorb and learn from the achievements in all the civilizations created by human societies and all the advanced operating forms and managerial methods, that reflect the law of modern socialized production, of all the countries in the present-day world, including developed capitalist countries." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 373) Both history and reality show that to build the country, we should open to the outside world and never put ourselves in a closed or isolate position. A closed position will lead to nowhere. Opening to the outside world is an irreversible world trend, a prerequisite for "taking our own road," and a major characteristic of China's socialism. Without opening to the outside world, we cannot succeed in "taking our own road," and building socialism with Chinese characteristics will be out of the question. To blaze our own road of development, the only correct method is "experimenting and blazing new trails bravely." It is a basic method for social practice in new historical conditions, a basic form of practicing the ideological line, and the only correct measure to seek integration between theory and practice. "Taking our own road" means, in fact, to blaze new trails in places where there are no roads. Without experiment and blazing new trails, the road can never by found. In the 15-year practice of reform and opening up, Comrade Xiaoping always asked us to "have greater courage in reform and opening up, experiment and blaze new trails bravely, and never be like women with bound feet. When we are sure of the worth of an endeavor, we should experiment with it and have a go at it boldly." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,, p 372) Comrade Xiaoping has always encouraged, respected, and wholeheartedly protected innovations. He regards "no argument" as his own "great creation." His purpose is not only to avoid dispersion of energy and to "race against time" but also to protect the spirit of innovation. Another of his noted viewpoint is to allow people to see, but they should experiment resolutely and lift control if it proves correct and should make correction if it proves wrong. His viewpoint of "experimenting and blazing new trails bravely" is aimed at facilitating reform and opening up and promoting economic development and is based on the political advantage of the socialist system. He has always reminded people to have greater courage because there will be no large risks, and the sky will not fall down. Even if there are some risks, problems will be solved fairly easily because we have the leadership of the communist party, have public ownership as the mainstay, and have power in our hands. 2. Why is it that the basic line and basic principles and policies should "not waver" and "not change?" Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping mentions on several occasions that the basic line and basic principles and policies should "not waver" and "not change." In my understanding, this is the most important "political instruction" of Comrade Xiaoping to the comrades of the entire party and will be the most important issue in practice our party and state will face in the coming decades. We should adhere to the basic line without wavering for 100 years because, first of all, this line has been formulated according to the basic national conditions in the initial stage of socialism and is also used to guide the social practice of the entire initial stage. The basic national conditions in the initial stage can be summarized as the following. 1) China's socialism has been built on a semi-feudal and semi-colonial basis, and the contradiction between the large population, the backward productive forces, and the ever growing material and cultural needs of the people on the one side and the backward social production on the other has become the major contradiction of society. 2) The political and economic systems of socialism are not yet mature and perfect. Many things between the superstructure and the economic foundation as well as between productive relations and productive forces do not suit each other. 3) The socialist system of the people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the communist party has been established, and the class struggle will persist to a certain extent for a long time. Owing to the aforementioned reality which will remain unchanged for a fairly long historic period, our party's basic political line can only be one of "one center and two basic points," and we adhere to it without wavering for the next 100 years. Meanwhile, the series of principles and policies formulated in line with the party's basic line to conform with the country's conditions should also be unswervingly and persistently upheld and remain unchanged. Else, our undertakings will end in failure. The effort to adhere to the party's basic line without wavering for 100 years is related with our efforts to realize the three-step strategic objective. The period from the general completion of socialist transformation in the 1950's to the realization of the three-step strategic objective of having per capita GNP reach the levels of moderately developed countries and achieving socialist modernization overall in the middle of the next century, amounts to about 100 years. During the period, it is imperative to unswervingly uphold the center of economic construction and to follow Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions, like, "persist in pursuit," "remain a bit stubborn in upholding the center," and "forcing ourselves to boost the economy". To this end, we must continuously deepen reform; broaden opening up; uphold the four cardinal principles; stick to the principle of building the two civilizations simultaneously; maintain social stability; and provide a powerful guarantee for economic construction. Only by ensuring the stability of one center and two basic points will we be certain in realizing the strategic target by the set date and to win one victory after another in socialist undertakings. Not shaking our will in upholding the party's basic line in the 100 years represents the correct conclusion found out by our party from its bitter lessons and experiences. Just as Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "The line adopted at the Eighth CPC Congress was correct. However, many correct opinions in the line adopted at the congress had not been persistently carried forward in practice because the party's ideological preparations at that time for building socialism in the country as a whole were insufficient". This finally led to such a tragedy as "the Great Cultural Revolution." "The reason why we had put forward a series of policies during the period from the end of 1970's to the beginning of 1980's was that we had summarized the experience and lesson gained in the `Great Cultural Revolution'." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 172) Not shaking our will in upholding the party's basic line in the 100 years epitomizes the experience gained over the past 15 years in the practice of reform and opening up. During the earth-shaking change effected in the 15 years, the economy has achieved fastest development; practical benefits enjoyed by the people have been most; and the international position of our country has been unprecedentedly upgraded. All of these represent the outcome scored in upholding the basic line as well as the basic principles and policies. Comrade Xioaping pointed out: "The basic line will be effective in the 100 years and never be shaken. Only by upholding the basic line can our party win the people's trust and support. People will not allow the attempt to bring about a change to the line, principles, and policies formulated since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee,.... Without the achievements in reform and opening up, we would have been unable to pass the test presented by the "4 June" incident.... The reason why our country has been stable since the "4 June" incident is that we have promoted the economic development and improved the people's livelihood through the programs of conducting reform and opening up. Therefore, the armed forces and state officials should support the line, systems, and policies". He stressed continuously: "That our country has developed at such a rapid pace in as few as 10-odd years, which has delighted the country's people and attracted world attention, has fully proven the correctness of the line, principles, and policies laid down since the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, and has proven that no one can change them even though he wants to change. These remarks can be summarized as: The adherence to the basic line, principles, and policies should remain unchanged." "It will be all right even though there are no new ideas. What we stress is that we should remain unchanged and should not let the people feel about the change in policies. With these line, principles, and policies, China will have hope." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 371) Comrade Xiaoping has used simple remarks to explain the following truth, that calls for our deep thought: A political line that can promote the development of productive forces is a correct line and is compatible with reality; a correct political line is not easily changed; if the line changes, history will go backwards, the state will experience internal disorder, and thus the people will not agree to the change; and whoever attempts to change them will be overthrown. Why has Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly stressed that the basic line, principles, and policies "cannot be wavered and changed?" In my opinion, on the one hand, the basic line, principles, and policies are truly very important to the future and destiny of a party, a state, and a nation; and, on the other hand, there are actually some people who disagree to persist in them. If we fail in this aspect, and, in particular, if we cannot clearly and correctly approach certain events taken place at home and abroad, then, it is not impossible for us to witness a waver in the party's basic line. Over recent years, it is precisely the correct attitude and measures, adopted by the second generation of leading collective, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core, and by the third generation of leading collective, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, for the series of major events taken place at home and abroad, that have ensured the implementation and execution of the party's basic line. For instance, the ideological train of bourgeois liberalization taken place in 1987 was precisely a grave interference to our adherence to the basic line. The essence of this ideological train was to make China deviate from the socialist road. When we resisted this ideological train with a clear-cut stand, many people at home and abroad argued about whether China would change its set principles and policies. Comrade Xiaoping definitely pointed out: "Our set principles and policies will never change. Now that these principles and polices have been proven feasible in practice for eight years, why do we change them?" (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 207) Then, he further pointed out: "The issue of "remaining unchanged" is an issue argued about by the people. And, I believe that this issue will be argued about until the end of this century and even the next century. We should use facts to prove this issue. (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 218) For another instance, the political turbulence taken place in our country in 1989 and the sharp change in the international situation taken place right after the political turbulence posed the most rigorous trials on the party's basic line and policies regarding internal and external affairs. After reviewing this section of history, we can, through the study of Comrade Xiaoping's pertinent expositions, see that it is not our party that wants to change the basic line, principles, and policies, and our party has never changed them over the past dozen of years; and it is the "left" or "right" ideological train and the international hostile force that have forced us to give up these lines, principles, and policies. Therefore, in his speeches made during his south China tour, Comrade Xiaoping again stressed the necessity of guarding against the right and, what is more important, preventing the "left." So long as we persist in the basic line without wavering, we will be able to cope with multifarious changes by remaining unchanged and will be in an impregnable position forever. In my understanding, Comrade Xiaoping's theory that the basic line and the basic principles and policies not waver or change is not only a serious "political instruction" but also an ardent expectation and earnest admonition for the generations to come. Comrade Xiaoping firmly believes that the general historical trend for socialism to replace capitalism will not regress or change. However, he also knows deeply that the road ahead of us will be tortuous and risky. He hopes that our party will become increasingly mature theoretically, that China's socialism will gradually become the "finalized system," and that our millions of people and the party's generation upon generation of leaders will have the political awareness in adhering to the basic line. As high-ranking cadres of the party, we deeply feel the heavy responsibility on our shoulders. Comrade Xiaoping said that "the key to whether the correct political line can be implemented lies in whether the ideological line is correct." This is because when the ideological line is correct, the theories compatible with China's reality and the basic guidelines and basic principles of the line will pass on from generation to generation and create endless material achievements in the integration process with practice. In addition, the principles and policies themselves will also be developed creatively and always maintain their robust vitality. 3. How Should We Understand the Endeavor of "Seizing the Opportunity To Accelerate Development" as Both an Economic Issue and a Political Issue? In the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, development is a major topic of discussion which holds a central position. The core of the party's basic line is development, and the key to adhering to the basic line without wavering for 100 years is to persist in economic construction, the central task, without wavering. In Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, development is what is discussed most. Comrade Xiaoping's noted theses that "the basic task of socialism is developing productive forces" and that "development is the essential criterion" represent the most important theoretical innovation Marxist viewpoint of development. Also, in Comrade Xiaoping's theory on development, "seizing the opportunity to accelerate development and concentrating efforts to promote economic construction" is an important idea that can most embody China's characteristics, reflect the characteristics of this era, and represent the desires of the party and the people. For example, if we say that Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line have indicated and opened up the course of China's modernization drive, Comrade Xiaoping's brand-new theories on development, then, have hoisted the sails for the historical ship to advance more rapidly. The development viewpoint of seizing the opportunity to accelerate development is one based on the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. This brand-new development viewpoint contains Comrade Xiaoping's intense sorrow over the historical experience of "suffering from a backwardness attack," his profound reflection over mistakes and setbacks, such as "taking class struggle as the key link" and "premature transition," his thorough understanding of the basic national situation characterized by "a large population and a poor foundation," his sober judgment of the international environment and climate China faces, and also his scientific foresight about the future of China and the world. In Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and in many other of Comrade Xiaoping's works, the issue of the speed of China's development has been regarded as a serious political issue, and thus it is closely linked with the life or death of the party, the rise or decline of the country, and the future and destiny of the socialist system. Comrade Xiaoping maintained: China is faced with a rigorous challenge on this issue. We should effectively resist hegemonism, power politics, and "peaceful evolution." The key to always holding high the banner of socialism and maintaining the position of independence lies in accelerating economic development, whether we can achieve a relatively rapid growth rate, and whether we can fulfill our development strategy on schedule. After the sharp change in Eastern Europe, Comrade Xiaoping warned us in a timely manner: "Now, we should pay special attention to the landslide in the economic growth rate." He also sharply pointed out: "Whether we can avoid economic landslide and whether we can achieve the quadrupling task is a major question. This question may be one preventing us from being fast asleep for a long time, 10 years at least." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 355) Comrade Xiaoping maintained: The rapid development of neighboring countries constitutes a challenge for us. In his speeches made during his south China trip, he pointed out: "The key to seize the opportunity to develop ourselves lies in developing the economy. The economic development of some neighboring countries and regions is now faster than our's. If we refuse to develop our economy or if we develop our economy too slowly, the people will catch sight of problems through comparison." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 375) From this, we can see that "slow growth means stop growing and even means going backwards." Comrade Xiaoping's sense of anxiety and urgency manifested in the issue of development has greatly educated us. In Comrade Xiaoping's theory of development, the idea of seizing and making good use of the opportunity has been very prominent. The opportunity mentioned here means refers to a good international environment. At the moment, although various kinds of contradictions and conflicts have taken place continuously in the world and the world remains turbulent, peace and development are still the main trend of the times. The old polarization pattern has come to the end, and the world is developing toward multi-polarization. We can have a relatively long period of peaceful development. Moreover, Asia is relatively stable when compared with other areas in the world, and the economy in Asia is developing at a high speed. Relations between China and its neighboring countries have been relaxed and improved, therefore China has been provided an extremely favorable condition for opening its border areas to the outside world. Now, the worldwide new technology revolution is developing very fiercely, the international industrial structure is under reorganization, and a huge amount of surplus funds and advanced technologies need to seek new markets. All these have provided a historical opportunity for our development. With the farsightedness of a strategist, Comrade Xiaoping has repeatedly exhorted us: "There are not many such opportunities;" "the opportunity should be seized;" "on no account should this opportunity be missed;" "development should not be slowed down so long as it can be accelerated," "rapid development should not be hampered so long as it can be accelerated," and "the growth speed that can be achieved should be achieved as far as possible." In line with the experience on economic "leap" gained by China and some foreign countries in the past several years, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "It is essential for us to witness several stages during the long process of modernization in the future characterized by relatively rapid growth and relatively good efficiency." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 377) Then, Comrade Xiaoping again set forth the development idea and objective of "going all out to embark on a new stage every several years." In studying Comrade Xiaoping's expositions on accelerating development, we can feel about a force that presses us to forge ahead. This is a force produced by the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts and is a force that encourages us to work hard. While stressing the rate, Comrade Xiaoping always simultaneously emphasized such points as "paying attention to efficiency, quality and export-oriented items," and believed that as long as we have these three points, we will not be afraid of even a higher rate. On the issue concerning the relationship between "acceleration of development" and "steady development," Comrade Xiaoping has proposed a keen ideology, that is, "it is right to stress stability, however, overstressing it may make us lose the opportunity. ... Perhaps, our economic development law will advance in a wave upon wave manner and it will have a leap forward and will jump to a new stage after several years." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 368) We should not be surprised or alarmed at some disturbances in the course of economic development. This ideology has clearly explained the relations of dialectical unity between rate and efficiency, quickness and steadiness, and actually, it has also clearly explained the relationship between seeking truth from facts and emancipating the mind. This is the viewpoint of the dynamic theory of reflection which is in conformity with not only the objective law of economic development but it also stresses the factor of man's subjective dynamic role, having a practical and guiding significance in actual work. How to realize a fairly high rate and to seek the integration of rate and efficiency? Comrade Xiaoping has always maintained that the fundamental way out is to conduct reform and opening up and to establish a new socialist market economic system. In his works, reform and opening up and acceleration of development are unseparated. Only by reforming the economic system, implementing opening up and breaking the old systems that shackle the development of the productive forces; using foreign advanced knowledge and experience for reference and adopting foreign advanced technology, can we be able to see a high rate and efficiency. At present, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has issued the "decision on some issues concerning the establishment of the socialist market economic system," which makes our country's reform of the economic system more clear and specific. If we continue to follow this road, the reform pace will inevitably be greatly accelerated, and this will give rise to a tremendous motivation for economic development. We should strive to do a good job in reform. To talk about development, it is also natural for us to talk about the affairs of our Inner Mongolia. As all people know, since its establishment more than 40 years ago, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has witnessed rapid economic and social development and made tremendous achievements. Since reform and opening up, earth-shaking changes have taken place and a new situation of economic development, social stability, cultural invigoration and harmony among people of various nationalities has emerged. What is more gratifying is that we have gradually found a road to develop the economy and society. Being restricted by some conditions, we should not unrealistically emulate the rate of coastal and other developed areas or hope to catch up with the level of developed areas within a short time. However, we are determined to give play to the advantages of our region through reform, opening up and the arduous struggle of the people of various nationalities; to give full play to the advantages and favorable conditions of having "natural resources, good geographic conditions and policies," promote strong points and avoid shortcomings, strive to quicker the rate and raise efficiency, unceasingly shorten the gap with developed areas, and attain the goal of becoming well-off and prosperous. In 1987, in a speech on our country's nationalities policy and on the development of minority areas , Comrade Xiaoping particularly talked about the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. He said: "In the case of Inner Mongolia, it has vast grasslands but a small population; it may probably march toward the front rank during its development in the future." "Observing the minority areas, we should mainly see whether they can be developed." "While approaching this issue, we should pay attention to the central point and not to its form." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 247) Comrade Xiaoping's remarks have given a profound lesson to our people of various nationalities. In this connection, Comrade Xiaoping has put forward his remark by regarding development as a core issue in the work undertaken by regions with the people of multiple nationalities. The "essence" pointed out by him means the issues of achieving development and making progress. We should deeply understand the important ideology of Comrade Xiaoping and earnestly summarize the work done over the past few years by regarding his ideology as a guidance. We should also further improve the guiding ideology, principles, and policies for work; bring all contributing factors into full play; unite with or lead the people of various nationalities to accelerate the economic and social development in the region; and realize the grand target of "being the advanced" put forward by Comrade Xiaoping through unswerving and protracted efforts. Party organizations and the people of various nationalities throughout the region possess their glorious tradition of uniting as one in struggles and waging arduous struggles and have a strong desire and confidence in "being the advanced". They will certainly be able to perform the miracles of latecomers surpassing the old-timers because they are facing the opportunity and many favorable conditions for accelerating the development. 4. In Upholding the Ideological Line, What Consciousness and Morals Should Leaders Have? Emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts represent a scientific proposition full with dialectical and historical materialism and concentratedly reflect the world outlook and methodology of the proletarian class. It is uneasy for us to understand the ideological line and even uneasy for us to conduct practice on it. Whether the ideological line has been unswervingly upheld represents a practical yardstick in measuring the level and consciousness of every leading personnel. It not only can give a test to our capabilities of understanding and of handling problems and particularly to our party spirit, work style, and morals. Unswervingly upholding the line of emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts requires a scientific attitude and the spirit of dealing with matters relating to work. First of all we should honestly do things in line with the objective law of development. This requires us to frequently go deep into reality, to keep extensive contacts with the masses, to understand at all times the changes of objective conditions, to realistically and accurately know the masses' ideological trend, and to seize the turning point of the age so as to enable our policies to conform with the reality. In this connection, the bureaucracy losing contact with reality should be resolutely overcome. The attitude and method of paying lip service and considering oneself in the right should be resolutely cast away. Efforts should be made to be the honest persons often praised by Chairman Mao. In view of Chairman Mao, Marx, Lenin, and scientists are honest people who are doing things honestly according to a scientific attitude. Comrade Xiaoping is just an honest person of such a kind, always advocates the spirit of doing matters relating to work, and always sets himself an example in work. His works and speeches are in simple styles and have no empty talks losing contact with reality. His practice scored over the past several decades even represents the glorious example and vivid teaching materials of displaying the spirit of doing matters relating to work. There is a bad practice at present, in which some leading personnel have often adopted an attitude of undiscriminatingly copying and relaying the higher authorities' directives and the experience gained by outside places. After accepting the documents, they have often got through with only relaying them any old way and few of them are to earnestly study them; to conduct earnest discussion; and to take an earnest consideration about them. They never ask "whys" and "hows" relating to the documents and never put forward their opinions on implementing the documents in line with the local reality. They often perform their duties in a perfunctory manner by only relaying these documents to their subordinate units. Among those who have adopted such an irresponsible attitude, hundred percent of them will suffer a failure. Since the programs of conducting reform and opening up, many localities have brought about tremendous changes to their economic and social outlooks. Some of them have even improved their economic and social outlooks to a new level within two or three years. The witness of such a progress has inspired the people very much. However, some localities have brought about slight changes in this regard and some of them have not accurately found out their ways of developing their local economy as of now. They are only repeating some formalist slogans. Such an irresponsible attitude adopted by the leading personnel in these localities represents the manifestations of their weak party spirit and professional ambition. If we leave this attitude unchecked, these localities will have no future. In specific work, it is, of course, important to put forward the policies compatible with reality. However, it is more important to turn the correct policies into actions through everyone's earnest efforts in doing solid work. Without this, no policies, however perfect, can be turned into material achievements. Making earnest efforts to do solid work is not only a work style and the basic method to implement policies but also a test on the party spirit and sense of responsibility of every leader. Comrade Xiaoping has always advocated earnest efforts and solid work. Over the past few years, he has urged us on many occasions to "devote some time to more solid work and speak less," to "accomplish some work in a down-to-earth manner and score real achievements to win trust of the people," to "concentrate on doing some work with which the masses are satisfied and pleased," and to "work hard to make our own work successful." He has particularly emphasized: "Leaders must do more solid work. They must change the bad work styles of spending the day by giving orders and empty talks." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 121) Comrade Xiaoping's instruction and example are the force to spur us on to work in a down-to-earth manner. Another very important issue concerning the need for leaders to adopt a scientific approach of seeking truth from facts is that they should learn to analyze and address problems in a dialectical manner and not from a lopsided viewpoint or in terms of absolutes. This is not only a theoretical issue but also an issue on practice that leaders will often encounter during leadership work. To those assuming higher-level leadership work, this issue is more important. For example, the party's basic line clearly consists of "two basic points," but some leaders see only one; and the "two basic points" constitute an organic whole, but some leaders separate them and even set one against the other. The reason why there are "leftist" and rightist ideological interference within the party and why the party is "strong in one task and weak in the other" is closely related to the lopsided way of thinking in addition to some factors. Another example, Comrade Xiaoping has a very important thinking, namely to take the overall situation into account, subject to the overall situation, and consider issues from the angle of the overall situation. Here, the overall situation means the "large reality," and the partial situation is merely the "small reality." Proceeding from the overall situation means proceeding from the large reality. Concerning the issue on "fools [sha zi 0247 1311] and melons [gua zi 3900 1311]," he looked back and said: "Many people felt uneasy at that time, saying that he had earned 1 million yuan and should be criticized. I said no, because when we criticize him, people would think that policies have changed. Then, the loss will outweigh the gain. Issues like this are still many. If we fail to handle them properly, our principles will be shaken easily, and the overall situation of reform will be affected." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 371) In Comrade Xiaoping's opinion, leaving the issues on "fools and melons" unresolved does not affect the overall situation; and solving them would be harmful to the overall situation. When faced with major issues and important junctures, Comrade Xiaoping has always been so clear-headed and so profound, comprehensive, and sharp in analyzing issues; and when solving problems, he has always solved them properly in order of importance and urgency. This cannot be achieved without well versed dialectical thinking and the foresight and strategy of a strategist. We should learn from Comrade Xiaoping's thinking and practice and learn to use materialist dialectics to think over and handle issues. Many things in reality show that when leaders' way of thinking is wrong, they will be confused about the cardinal issues of right and wrong an even commit political mistakes to cause irretrievable losses to our cause. We must have the spirit of blazing new trails and the awareness of taking risks in order to unswervingly persist in the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. Modern leaders must have this kind of spirit and awareness. The theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the most creative. The ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts involves ceaselessly blazing new trails. Our country's achievements in reform and modernization made over the past 10 years or so are just the achievements made by hundreds of millions of the people who have made ceaseless efforts to blaze new trails and vigorously keep forging ahead under the guidance of the party. Nothing will be accomplished and no progress will be made without this spirit. Comrade Xiaoping has the following heartening words: "Without the spirit of blazing new trails, the spirit of `taking risks,' or vitality, we cannot pioneer a good and new way or accomplish new undertakings. Who has the daring to declare that he does not take any risks and has certainty of success in doing anything." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 372) What Comrade Xiaoping advocates here is just the spirit of blazing new trails and the awareness of taking risks. The "vitality" that he talked about is revolutionary courage, heroism, and momentum. It is from the lofty ideals and the boundless faithfulness to the people. The spirit of blazing new trails and taking risks in the course of reform and opening up is extremely precious and merits vigorous carriage forward. Those who are very lazy, accomplish nothing, and lack the sense of responsibility cannot do this, neither can those who strive to avoid contributions and only make mistakes. Those who do not keep the people and undertakings in mind but only seek benefits for themselves and their small groups can not only accomplish nothing but also not understand the spirit of blazing new trails and the awareness of taking risks. They even criticize and vilify the comrades with this kind of spirit. The ideological line of the party is a truly materialist line. So, only true materialists can completely understand and unswervingly persist in it. Because we must take risks, pay prices, and make sacrifice to persist in this line. Those without the sense of responsibility for the wealth and happiness of the people or enthusiasm for undertakings, like a raging fire, are unwilling to pay this price. For instance, many things in our practical life should be done by the leaders with the daring to persistently seek truth from facts. For instance, the masses have complaints about the unhealthy trends, the corrosive phenomena, and the indicators for political liberalism that seriously exist within the party; and it is difficult to correct them. One of the important reasons is that some leading comrades lack the daring to seek truth from facts and to persist in truth, are afraid of offending others, and are not willing to take risks by themselves. These comrades do not understand that the party must pay big prices if they are not willing to pay small prices. As long as justice prevails, evil trends will be overwhelmed. Truth and justice are, after all, not befuddled. What will we be afraid of? Another example is that some of our leaders often come across the situation of having two completely different viewpoints and assessments on the same thing, the same person, the same section of history, and the same locality. All of them think that they are seeking truth from facts. There are many factors to these problems. There may be problems in ability and level; there may be problems in the degree of understanding of circumstances and in the angle of approaching issues; and there may also be problems of having different ideas and standards for what is right and wrong. Such a situation is understandable. What is important is that leaders of various localities and units must take the position of upholding party spirit and the basic point of seeking truth from facts to speak and act impartially, to correct the prejudices of some comrades, and to encourage the cadres who persist in seeking truth from facts. The basic point of the party's ideological line is that the people's interest is higher than everything else. The source of the courage and the strength to persist in this ideological line is among the people. Over the scores of years, Comrade Xiaoping has considered himself the "son of Chinese people," always respected the masses and loved the people, always borne in mind the people's interest and aspirations, and regarded "whether the people support it," "whether the people agree to it," "whether the people are happy," and "whether the people cooperate" as the starting point and ending point to formulating all principles and policies and as the fundamental criterion to judge right from wrong. Precisely for this reason, Comrade Xiaoping has had tremendous courage in theory and practice; his correct policy decisions have naturally become the conscious actions of hundreds of millions of people; and he himself has been able to undauntedly lead the people to continuously charge forward during the great process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Xiaoping has undergone a rough life characterized by "three ups and three downs," and his revolutionary character of steadfastly persisting in truth and principles regardless of his personal honor or disgrace, his personal feelings of gratitude or resentment, and his personal gains or losses has truly manifested his lofty awareness of steadfastly seeking truth from facts. The great experience of Comrade Xiaoping has taught and inspired us a lot. Dauntless are the Communists who consider the people's interest higher as being more important than everything else, and no personal costs should waver Communists' steadfastness in persisting in the party's ideological line. In his memorial article for Comrade Liu Bocheng, Comrade Xiaoping stated: "He bent his back and was willing to risk any danger to realize his beliefs. At any time and any place, in smooth or adverse circumstance, and no matter how objective the environment changes, he has always contributed and submitted his all to the party and has merged himself with the party's cause regardless of his personal honor or disgrace, thus truly attaining the state of forgetting himself." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, pp 188-189) How much we are educated and spurred on by these remarks of Comrade Xiaoping! If all generations of our leaders can attain such a "oblivious state," all levels of the party's leading bodies will become strong headquarters of fighting, will be able to foster a very good atmosphere, and will be able to steadfastly persist in the ideological line of seeking truth from facts. So, the ship of building socialism with Chinese characteristics will never deviate from the correct course amid terrifying waves and will always sail towards glorious destinations.
