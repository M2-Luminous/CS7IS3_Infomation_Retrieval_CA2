Offering and Governing Regulations for United States Savings Bonds; Final Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 43␣/␣Friday, March 4, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Fiscal Service 31 CFR Parts 315, 316, 317, 321, 330, 332, 342, 351, 352, and 353 Offering and Governing Regulations for United States Savings Bonds, Series E, EE, and H, HH, and Savings Notes; Issuing and Paying Agents; and Payment Under Special Endorsement AGENCY: Bureau of the Public Debt, Fiscal Service, Department of the Treasury. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This Final Rule amends the offering circulars for United States savings bonds and savings notes; the regulations governing savings bonds and notes; and the regulations governing activities of financial institutions and organizations serving as savings bond issuing and paying agents, to reflect the designation of five Federal Reserve Offices as savings bond processing sites. The changes are made to improve the efficiency of the processing of savings bond transactions. The regulations are further amended to reflect the fact that EZ CLEAR has become the only means by which savings bond paying agents may transmit and receive settlement for redeemed savings bonds and notes. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Calvin Ninomiya, Chief Counsel, Bureau of the Public Debt, Washington, DC 20239&hyph;0001, (202) 219&hyph;3320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: As fiscal agents of the United States, Federal Reserve Banks and Branches perform a number of activities in support of the savings bond program, including issuing, redeeming, and reissuing savings bonds and notes. In recent years, both the Bureau of the Public Debt and Federal Reserve Offices have recognized that there would be benefits associated with consolidating certain savings bond activities. Since 1986, several activities have been consolidated, e.g., issuing savings bonds for payroll savings plans based upon a master file data base, and maintaining savings bonds for employee thrift plans in book-entry accounts. The Bureau and the Federal Reserve recognized that further consolidation would reduce operating costs, improve program management, and provide opportunities for more efficient use of technology, without any reduction in the level of service to bondowners and financial institutions serving as savings bond agents. Therefore, a Savings Bond Processing Study Team, composed of staff from both Public Debt and Reserve Offices, was formed to determine the optimum number of Reserve Office sites at which savings bond processing should be performed. The Team's recommendations formed the basis of the Bureau's decision to approve the changes in sites where consolidated savings bond processing would be performed. A listing of the consolidated processing sites is added to each of the following sections: 31 CFR 315.1, 316.12, 330.8, 332.12, 342.9, 352.13, and 353.1, the offering circulars and governing regulations for savings bonds and notes, and 31 CFR 317.9 and 321.25, the regulations governing the issue and redemption of savings bonds. Federal Reserve Offices, other than those newly listed, may continue to provide some savings bond services, but their activities will be phased out over the period prior to March 1, 1996. Also, the regulations in 31 CFR part 317, also referred to as Department of the Treasury Circular, Public Debt Series No. 4&hyph;67, are being further amended to indicate that issuing agents are subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a).
