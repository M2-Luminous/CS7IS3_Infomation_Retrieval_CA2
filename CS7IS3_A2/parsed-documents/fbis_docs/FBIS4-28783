He said his ministry forwarded the bill to the secretary general to the prime minister two weeks ago. He believes the bill will be considered by the cabinet soon. Sawai said his ministry had already reviewed the bill two or three times. He believes the bill is now in the office of Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, who will make the final scrutiny before placing it on the agenda of a cabinet meeting. Sawai said: "The establishment of the intellectual property and international trade court is just as important as the administrative court because it concerns national interest. It is also the prime minister's wish to bring it to Parliament promptly. Regarding the charge that the establishment of the court is the result of a U.S. threat of retaliation under Article 301, the Justice Ministry has given an assurance that the issues are unrelated. Thailand is a proud country; why must it succumb to U.S. demands? The ministry is considering national interests in setting up the intellectual property and international trade court. The court's structure will follow international lines. On this point, the United States may enjoy some benefits and may be pleased by the action which Thailand has taken." The Cabinet decided in May 1993 to order an establishment of the intellectual property and international trade court under the Justice Ministry. A committee was formed to study the court's structure. The committee then formed a subcommittee to draft relevant laws. The subcommittee drafted a bill containing 43 articles and presented its opinions on the advantages and weaknesses of an intellectual property and international law court. The advantages include the following: 1. The judges are required to have a background in intellectual property and international trade. The qualifications of associate judges are also set. 2. The chief judge has the power to set regulations. 3. Appeals are filed directly with the Supreme Court. The weaknesses are: 1. The accused will have only two courts to hear their cases. 2. Sentencing will be done by the provincial courts.
