About 7 billion [Finnish] markkas [FMk] a year in farm subsidies will be necessary even after the transition period. There will, however, be a bigger bill during the first year of membership: About FMk12 billion will be needed for the food industry as well as for farming and truck farming. These figures are included in the draft of the Council of State's decision in principle prepared for cabinet ministers by committees of government officials. "The farm sector won't be imposing a greater burden on taxpayers than at present after the second year of membership," they estimate in the government. According to the draft of the government's decision, FMk2.7 billion in domestic subsidies will be needed for the food industry next year. Of that figure 2.2 billion will go toward compensation for the sharp drop in value of food stocks. Without the subsidies to compensate for the drop in value of stocks, subsidies would total 1.8 billion over the five-year transition period for the industry, 600 million of which we will try to obtain from the EU. No more than FMk500 million of the aid money would be used for research, product development, the promotion of exports, and marketing. A national structural subsidy of 700 million will be required for investments and to eliminate overproduction. It is estimated that state grain reserves will account for FMk1.4 billion of the losses attributable to stocks. Valio, for example, will need 70 million for the change in the stock situation. Farmers Compensated by Strengthening of Markka According to the draft, FMk5.8 billion a year of tax revenue will be set aside for long-term national farm and truck farm subsidies. EU approval will be required for these subsidies. "A sufficient portion" of the 1.7-billion-markka EU farm and truck farm environment subsidies will be set aside "for especially sensitive areas and special measures." The EU will pay for half of these subsidies, or FMk850 million. Farmers are promised compensation in the form of possible changes in currency exchange rates at the rate of 1 ECU = 6.30 markkas. If the markka is strengthened by 10 percent, this will mean an estimated increase in value of FMk400 million. Farmers are promised that compensation for vacation substitutes and social security will remain unchanged. At the present time over a billion markkas a year goes for vacation substitutes and a couple of billion for pensions. These expenditures are not included in the 12-billion package. Farms would also receive compensation for marketable crops right from the start of membership in the EU. The lowering of costs in the livestock industry would be subsidized with a price supplement system that will, according to the decision, be "remarkably high," especially next year. If the EU does not allow it, the subsidy will be paid as a livestock subsidy. To be approved annually, the price supplements for special crops and livestock products will be paid until 1999. A supplementary allowance for reducing [cultivated] surface area would be paid for just as long a period. The truck garden industry would get a separate subsidy package. The government estimates that transition period subsidies would cost FMk3 billion the first year, 1.3 billion the second, and 800 million the third. The subsidies would be terminated by the end of the century. During the transition period we would try to use the EU early retirement system to our advantage, especially as concerns the hog-raising and poultry industries. Furthermore, an interest-rate ceiling of 4 percent would be imposed on loans granted to farmers between 1977 and 1991. Forty million markkas a year would be allocated for interest subsidies for truck garden enterprises and 20 million for abandonment [of farms] arrangements. The total cost of transition period structural subsidies would come to from FMk200 to 500 million a year until the end of the century. Top Tax Rate for Food Products A value-added tax of 22 percent would be imposed on food products in the model presented by government officials. The current sales tax is about 16 percent after the primary product deduction. Opportunities to provide for farmers will be increased, and farm property will be assessed on the basis of the value of the income it produces as concerns inheritance and gift taxes. The energy tax on greenhouses would be eliminated or credited as refunds. During the transition period farmers would be given the right to a retroactive deduction of the value-added tax on investment commodities. As concerns farmers and truck farmers' income tax, they could deduct half of what they owe, which exceeded FMk300,000 at the end of last year, over a period of five years.
