FBIS3-25697 "drafr038_c_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-038 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Feb 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 25 Feb MB2502133794 MB2502133794 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Democracy To Depend on Multiparty Political Center -- Hermann Giliomee writes in an article on page 16 of Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 25 February that "the entire transition to democracy in South Africa turns on the construction and defence of a new multiparty political centre." The attempt to lure parties of the Freedom Alliance (FA) into the constituional process "represents the first serious effort by the ANC [African National Congress] and the NP [National Party] to defend this centre. That this defence is unlikely to succeed in its immediate objective -- to get the alliance into the elections -- does not mean that a form of accommodation with the alliance over the longer term can be ruled out." Giliomee believes we have seen since December "a spirited and concentrated effort by disparate forces to broaden the centre and make the future democracy more viable." BUSINESS DAY Criticism of ANC's Concessions Timing -- Billy Paddock writes in a page-10 article in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 25 February that "there is a view among some ANC stategists that the organisation may have committed a grievous error by footdragging late last year instead of offering at that early stage the concessions placed on the table in the past week." "It is true that the recent package of concessions does not fully meet the alliance's requirements. In particular, it falls far short of Inkatha's demand for a federal dispensation. But it goes a long way towards meeting the compromise package contained in the December 19 document which was worked out between government and the alliance. Had the concessions come then -- rather than a firm rejection from the ANC -- this could have created space for constructive negotiation, further compromise and a possible settlement, the argument goes." WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN Elections Never `Absolutely Free and Fair' -- "Clearly, the ballot will never be absolutely free and fair. The question is whether the disruption can be limited enough for the Independent Electoral Commission and the international observer missions to get away with a ruling that these elections are sufficiently free and fair to pass muster," notes a page-16 editorial in Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English for 25 February-3 March. "It is becoming increasingly obvious that in significant areas of Natal/kwaZulu polling will be difficult and probably impossible. It is extraordinary that there is so little visible action to stop rightwing training of Inkatha impis [warriors] and to break the power of the kwaZulu Police to take sides." The editorial also looks at the disruption of NP electioneering in the Cape, saying it should "also be addressed urgently by African National Congress leaders." "Free and fair elections -- like fair cricket umpiring -- are not going to come easy." BEELD PAC's Commitment to Democracy `Fragile' -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 22 February says in a page-10 editorial: "The threat by the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] that it will return to the armed struggle if it does not get its way with the redistribution of land indicates that this party's commitment to democracy and the ballot is very fragile. It was a precondition for the PAC's participation in the election that it renounce violence. Now it appears that the party is setting laughable demands expecting to realize them through the use of violence. Other parties which are participating in the election and are prepared to accept the outcome unconditionally will have to decide whether they wish to compete at the polls on such an unequal basis with a party which refuses to play by the rules of the game." "The PAC's manifesto in which laughable promises are made such as that all private land transactions will be abolished when land is returned to 'the people' underlines the fact that this party does not have the faintest idea of the demands of a modern society." Alliance Leaders Incapable of Playing Role -- "Another chapter in the dynamic process in South Africa is approaching completion and still the leaders of the FA hesitate, apparently incapable of themselves playing a role in it," says a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg BEELD of 23 February. "The Negotiating Council has now made it even easier for the FA leaders to enter the process with even more concessions than the government and the ANC had been prepared to make. Virtually all of the remaining objections of the alliance have now been removed." "If the FA leaders are undecided, powerless, hesitant, or stubborn, their followers need not also be left behind by history. There is a way they can become part of the dynamic process, and that is to vote in the election for a different party which can represent their interests." Sarajevo Holds Lesson for RSA -- A second editorial on page 14 of BEELD says: "From the rubble and tears of Sarajevo, where people allowed political intolerance to degenerate into a campaign of ethnic cleansing, a dazed resident warns despairingly that no one can help them unless they help themselves. Therein lies a profound lesson for South Africa with its comlex ethnic make-up. Not even the intervention of the United Nations can end the slaughter in Bosnia." "South African politicians and others who use war talk to bedevil efforts at a settlement should realize before it is too late that in the final analysis no one will be able to help us here. We must help ourselves. One political commentator has already warned that the ethnic cleansing which we see in Bosnia has already started here in South Africa."
