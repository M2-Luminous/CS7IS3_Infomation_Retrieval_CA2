It can be used not only to calculate the orbit of a satellite in time series by entering the position and speed of the satellite, but also to display the calculated orbits on a world map. Its price is only one-tenth the price of the software packages for large general-purpose computers. As a low-cost orbit-analysis software package for personal use by engineers and scientists, it will be aimed at various institutions and companies that use satellite data, such as National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA), aerial survey companies, broadcasting corporations, and universities. The software was developed as a package for work stations based on orbit-analysis software for large general-purpose computers that Fujitsu developed for NASDA and are currently operated by NASDA. Depending on the desired accuracy of analysis, three different models are available -- Orbiter/1 (짜3 million), Orbiter/2 (짜1.5 million), and Orbiter/3 (짜0.5 million). They all work on Fujitsu's S-family work stations. The company hopes to sell 20 sets a year. Once the basic data such as position, speed, and time of a satellite obtained from the satellite operating company or organization are entered into a work station loaded with this software, it will automatically calculate the position of the satellite at a certain point in the future or the direction seen from an arbitrary point on the ground, keeping factors such as the atmosphere and the gravity in consideration. NASDA and other space-related research organizations normally use large general-purpose computers to calculate the orbits of the satellites that are currently in operation or are to be launched in the future. Since the software packages for large computers are quite expensive to develop -- more than 짜30 million -- they are not readily available for individual engineers or scientists for their own orbit calculations and studies. Companies such as aerial survey companies, broadcasting corporations, and radio service companies have had to depend on data from research institutions, etc. Since this new software enables smaller firms to do in-house orbit calculations, there are many applications; for example, aerial survey companies will be able to plan ``when and where to start next surveys.''
