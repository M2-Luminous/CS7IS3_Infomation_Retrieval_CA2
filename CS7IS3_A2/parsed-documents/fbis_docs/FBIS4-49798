A local official said that the city government had approved the establishment of 310 overseas-funded companies engaged in real estate business by the end of last year. These companies had a combined investment of 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, including contractual overseas funds totalling 2.2 billion U.S. dollars. The city has already leased out 442.3 ha [hectare] of land and approved 134 overseas-funded real estate projects. So far, construction of projects with a total floor space of 3.5 million sq m and accounting for 60.7 percent of the city's target are proceeding well and some have been completed. The official attributed the progress to the city government's policy of unified planning and transforming stretches of old districts; and leasing the land-use rights through public bidding while positively improving investment conditions. The city government has also simplified formalities and improved services for overseas business people.
