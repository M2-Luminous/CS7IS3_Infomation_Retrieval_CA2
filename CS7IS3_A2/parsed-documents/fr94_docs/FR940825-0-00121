FR940825-0-00121 FR940825-0-00020 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The fishery for coastal migratory pelagic resources (king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, cero, cobia, little tunny, dolphin, and, in the Gulf of Mexico only, bluefish) is managed under the FMP. The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils (Councils) and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 642 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). The background and rationale for the measures in Amendment 7 were included in the proposed rule (59 FR 28330, June 1, 1994) and are not repeated here. Comments and Responses Four letters were received during the comment period in response to the proposed rule. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Gulf Council) submitted a comment regarding the proposed regulations. Two letters from a commercial fishermen's organization expressed opposition to the 50/50 allocation of the eastern zone commercial quota of Gulf group king mackerel between Florida's east and west coast fisheries. The fourth comment received from the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration (SBA) indicated that the initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) prepared for Amendment 7 does not comply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) because it failed to contain an examination of other alternatives as required by the RFA. Specific comments and NMFS responses are listed below. Comment: The Gulf Council expressed concern that the regulatory language contained in the proposed rule would not effectively prevent gillnet vessels operating in the west coast sub-zone from additionally harvesting Gulf group king mackerel under the hook-and-line quota. Response: NMFS concurs with this concern and has ensured that the final rule language clearly prohibits gillnet vessels from fishing for Gulf group king mackerel in the west coast sub-zone with gear other than a gillnet. The final rule is intended to prevent gillnet vessels from landing king mackerel under both quotas and to be consistent with the provisions of Amendment 7. Under the final rule, king mackerel may be possessed or landed from a vessel that uses, or has aboard, a run-around gillnet, only when it possesses a Federal commercial mackerel permit with a gillnet endorsement. King mackerel landed from such a vessel will be counted only against the gillnet quota, while those landed by vessels not having a gillnet endorsement will be counted against the hook-and-line quota. Monitoring of mackerel landings by gear type is feasible and will be utilized during the 1994&hyph;95 winter season for this fishery. Accuracy in monitoring catches by gear type of this fishery is expected to be similar to that achieved through other quota monitoring programs. As in those programs, success in limiting catches to quotas will be highly dependent on the good faith and cooperation of the fishing industry, and the ability of NMFS to close the fishery in a timely manner. Comment: Two letters received from commercial fishermen objected to the proposed 50/50 split of the eastern zone commercial quota for Gulf group king mackerel between Florida's east and west coast fisheries. They preferred an alternative allocation, considered and rejected by the Council, that would establish a 56/44 west/east coast division of the quota, as depicted in Table 1 of Amendment 7. This allocation occurred during the period from the 1985&hyph;86 season through the 1992&hyph;93 season under quota management initiated with FMP Amendment 1. These commenters contended that actions taken by the Gulf Council in its decision to support the 50/50 west/east split of the quota were inconsistent with the Magnuson Act. Specifically, they argued that the Councils' decision was not based on the best available scientific information and that reasonable opportunity was not provided for interested parties to review and comment on the new data used by the Council as a basis for its final decision. Response: NMFS has reviewed the Councils' proposed equal allocation between Florida's east and west coast fisheries and has determined that this allocation is consistent with the national standards and other provisions of the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. NMFS believes that the Councils' decision was based on many factors as discussed in Amendment 7, and that the Councils were not obliged to be guided solely by historical landing percentages for each sub-zone. Equal (50/50) apportionment of the eastern zone commercial quota for Gulf group king mackerel between Florida's east and west coasts has historical precedence and acceptance. Continuation of the State/Federal management regime for Florida's commercial fishery for Gulf group king mackerel appears to be supported by most affected fishermen from both coasts. Amendment 7's delineation of east and west coast sub-zones and establishment of equal quotas for each area is similar to management provided by Florida regulations during the 1990&hyph;91 and 1991&hyph;92 seasons, vacated during the 1992&hyph;93 fishing year, and resumed for the 1993&hyph;94 fishing year under a Federal emergency interim rule (58 FR 51789, October 5, 1993). Withdrawal of enforcement of Florida regulations during the 1992&hyph;93 season in response to a Federal court ruling resulted in disproportionate sharing of the eastern zone commercial quota of Gulf group king mackerel among east and west coast fishermen. To remedy socioeconomic hardships resultant from record low east coast catches, an emergency supplemental allocation of 259,000 lb (117,480 kg) was granted to Florida east coast fishermen (58 FR 10990, February 23, 1993). This final rule implementing Amendment 7 is intended to address permanently the fishery conditions that required previous emergency regulatory action.
