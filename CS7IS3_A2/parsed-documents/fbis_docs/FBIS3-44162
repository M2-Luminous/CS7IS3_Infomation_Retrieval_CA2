The National Party [NP] took the bull by the horns today when its leader, F.W. de Klerk, signed a declaration committing the NP to a free and fair election without intimidation. [Begin recording] [Reporter Ronel van Zyl] Today's signing of the declaration follows complaints by the NP about ANC [African National Congress] intimidation in general and specifically during Mr. De Klerk's western Transvaal road show over the weekend. During his three-day visit he was advised not to visit black townships. Mr. De Klerk said he had taken this advise because the ANC's strategy was to disrupt NP meetings and he wanted to avoid any confrontation. He said a later assurance by ANC leader Nelson Mandela that all areas should be accessible to all political parties was not enough. [De Klerk, in progress] All parties must go further. I think parties must bind themselves to discipline their followers and to act in the case where calls are not heeded, where instructions are not followed. [Van Zyl] In terms of the declaration, disciplinary steps will be taken against NP members found guilty of intimidation. Mr. De Klerk expressed the hope that other political parties would follow suit. The declaration offers a direct challenge to the ANC by leaving space for its leaders' signatures as well. As far as ongoing talks with the Freedom Alliance were concerned, Mr. De Klerk said negotiations would continue despite the deadline. [De Klerk] Negotiations can continue and multiparty agreements can then, after an election, become part of the law of the land where all parties, or all significant parties, participate in a debate to reach an agreement and sign agreements with each other. It can be implemented and made law also after an election. [end recording]
