I have no inclination nor desire to head the Cambodian Government. 2. I respect and will continue to respect the Constitution of our Kingdom of Cambodia [KoC]. 3. I condemned Lon Nol and Siri Matak for staging the coup d'etat and abolished the Constitution of the KoC on 18 March 1970. I cannot stage a coup d'etat even through peaceful means. This is because if I did so, it would mean that I am no different from Lon Nol and Siri Matak. [Dated] Beijing, 19 June 1994 [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk
