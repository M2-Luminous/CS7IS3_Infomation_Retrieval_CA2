[Demirel] Yes, on 3 February. [Nebiogly] Could you comment on the importance of our esteemed president's official visit to Turkey? [Demirel] Azerbaijan is our soul mate. There is no one in Turkey who does not get excited when he hears the name of Azerbaijan. The occupation of Azerbaijani land by the Armenians deeply saddened us here. We have supported Azerbaijan in every manner, as the international situation permits. But if we try to do anything else we would be harming Azerbaijan's interests. We have defended Azerbaijan on every international platform and will continue to defend it every day. Esteemed Geydar Aliyev is the elected president of Azerbaijan. He will visit Turkey and be hosted as the president of an independent state. We will discuss bilateral ties and other regional problems with him. We will seek ways to overcome hitches if they exist. We will discuss how to protect Azerbaijan's rights on international platforms, at the United Nations, and in the CSCE. It will be a very beneficial visit. Esteemed Aliyev is my invited guest. [Nebiogly] Esteemed President, as you know, the Turkic summit, which was to take place in Baku from 21 to 22 January, was postponed. But the Turkish press has been publishing rumors for the past two days. I want to stress, as you yourself know, that this meeting was simply postponed. What is your view on this subject? [Demirel] We stated very openly that the decision to hold such a meeting at a more suitable time does not mean such a meeting is renounced. I will meet the presidents of the other republics in Davos. I will also meet Geydar Aliyev. We will find a date that suits everyone. I think we are engaged in politics, not in a fight. The important thing is to obtain results. It will benefit all the concerned countries if this meeting is held at a time when it can produce the best results. That is what we are going to do. [Nebiogly] Thank you. Esteemed President, what about reports that the Azerbaijani Army has now been transformed into a regular army and has been achieving success lately? What is your view on this subject? [Demirel] Naturally, this makes Turkey happy. Azerbaijan has been subjected to injustice and its land was occupied through the use of force. Land outside and inside Nagorno-Karabakh was occupied. What right do the Armenians have to be in Kelbadzhar, Agdam, or Fizuli? What right do they have to be in Lachin or Shusha? Turkey is pleased that Azerbaijan has ousted these occupiers from the land by using its own army.
