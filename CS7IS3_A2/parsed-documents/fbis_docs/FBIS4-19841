"It cannot by itself," he wrote to Gen George Marshall, "defeat a highly organised and disciplined army, even when that army is virtually without air support of its own." NATO commanders might come to a similar conclusion about the chances of bombing the Bosnian Serb fighters into desisting from attacking. The chances of NATO aircraft being able to pick out well-prepared gun positions and supply dumps are limited, judging by the record of the air strikes on Gorazde. Widening the area of attack to Gorazde, Zepa and Srebrenica is likely to lead to further bloodletting and revenge on the thousands of refugees trapped there. It will also render the task of UN troops and international aid operations impossible. "It is like being half pregnant," said the first UN commander in Bosnia, Major Gen Lewis MacKenzie. "You cannot have a UN force on the ground which is half humanitarian, half interventionist." Gen MacKenzie said he hoped the debacle of Gorazde "would pour a bucketful of cold water over the UN Security Council," encouraging its members to pass resolutions for policies which were feasible, and which its member governments were prepared to support. The notion of the Muslim safe areas was a policy always waiting to be exposed, according to some in the military. "It was a wheeze dreamed up by the Americans with the French without the slightest notion how this was to be implemented on the ground," said a British officer this week. While NATO shifts and muddles through the arguments for air attacks to protect the Muslim enclaves, the Serbs appear to have shifted the agenda and appear to be coming to one of the main items on the programme. As the butchery of civilians continued inside Gorazde, Bosnian Serb forces were reported yesterday to be renewing their offensive on the corridor in the north and east of Bosnia between Brcko and Doboj, connecting Serbia with Serb-held areas in northern Bosnia and Croatia. The Serb forces -- and now analysts make little differentiation between those in Bosnia and those based over the border in Serbia -- seem bent on fulfilling the forging of Greater Serbia. This would cover a huge arc of Bosnia; and perhaps stretches of the Dalmatian coast. The new Serb offensive threatens a war spreading to Croatia and with Muslims and Albanian nationalists in Macedonia and Kosovo -- the wider war in southern Europe. Yesterday, Mr Warren Christopher, the U.S. Secretary of State, warned of just such a scenario. Moscow's proposal for a summit to discuss stopping Serb aggression should be taken seriously -- because it is based less on self-promotion, too often the vice of the West European and American leadership, than fear. More Serb conquests would mean more Muslim refugees with nowhere to go. The Muslim cause in Bosnia, Kosovo, Albania and Macedonia, would become an emblem of the new European anarchy. The Russians fear their battle will be taken up by the Muslim peoples on their southern borders, abetted by weapons, money and terrorist training from Iran, Pakistan, and North Africa. Faced with such consequences, European soldiers and diplomats are worried about the half-hearted gestures at policy from America, a reflection of the weakness of the Clinton team. The bloodbath of Gorazde shows that the time for quick-fix policies is over. The UN cannot get out, nor can the Bosnian Muslims forces be armed -- both will take too long, and both risk further disaster. The NATO delegates deliberating today must allow themselves space to devise real policies they can deliver. They must avoid reinforcing the failure of fantasy policies such as protected Muslim safe havens.
