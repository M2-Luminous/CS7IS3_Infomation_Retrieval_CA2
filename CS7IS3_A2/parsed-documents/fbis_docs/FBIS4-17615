This was declared at Duma hearings on bilateral ties by Aleksandr Panov, a deputy Russian foreign minister. In his words, the main stress in relations between the two countries is laid on their closer commercial ties. Last year's bilateral trade totalled 7.2 billion dollars, a 23 percent rise since 1992. That put Russia third among China's trade partners. Panov argues that since Russia's barter trade is now obviously obsolete, priority should go to joint ventures and investment. On the problem of border demarcation with China, Panov noted that the agreement signed between USSR and China on May 16, 1991, took effect after its ratification by the former Supreme Soviet on February 13, 1992. He stressed that for the first time ever, a 4,300-kilometer-long eastern border between Russia and China had been determined with 3,700 kilometers of this stretch passing along the Amur, Ussuri, and Argun rivers. He explained that the issue remained open on three islands -- the Bolshoy Ussuri and Tarabarov islands near Khabarovsk and the Bolshoy Island in the upper flows of the Argun river. Negotiations continue on the latter. As for the western frontier with China (ie. west of Mongolia), stretching for 55 kilometers, the current talks with a joint delegation from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan have not revealed any differences, Panov declared.
