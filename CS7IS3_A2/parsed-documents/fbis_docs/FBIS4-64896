Sueskind; place and date not given: "In God's Name, I Will Accept the Election"] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The future president will, above all, have to be a president for the east Germans. Or do you believe that unification has now been accomplished and that it is important to treat it as something normal? [Herzog] No, unification has not yet been completed. In fact, I am convinced that the need for spiritual unification is smaller than currently portrayed in the public discussion. Some people would like to have unified Germans. The Germans have always been a people with different tribes, and these tribes have always had completely different views. The citizens in the new laender are in a very difficult situation. Everyone who has a heart must primarily take care of them. Thus, the focal point of attention will certainly be in the new laender in the next few years. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In the West, France assumes a special role at Germany's side. Will Poland one day play a similar role in the East? [Herzog] I do not know to what extent this would be possible. In any event, it would be desirable. Our relationship with Poland is as burdened as our relationship was with France in the past. A certain reconciliation has been achieved with France. If something similar were possible with Poland, and also with the Czech Republic, this would be a big accomplishment. By the way, I believe that our major problem in our policy vis-a-vis East Europe is a psychological one. On the one hand, leaders in numerous capitals have expressed the hope for a German hegemony over East Europe, but, on the other, they also voiced the fear of such hegemonial efforts. I think the decisive political-psychological task in the next few years will be to dispel such expectations and fears -- not only verbally, but they must become unfounded. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Mr. Herzog, as president of the Constitutional Court, you have probably thought and written more about the meaning of the president's office than any former federal president. You are quite familiar with the competences of the head of state. Do you believe that basic or minor changes are required? [Herzog] It is impossible for me to run for an office while at the same time saying what has to be changed. I ask for your understanding. People are usually referring to the election procedure when talking about changes. If we had a presidential system like the one in France or the United States, the president would naturally have to be elected by the people. Since we do not have this principle and the president should be suprapartisan, there can be no middle way. Otherwise Germany would have to decide in favor of a semi-presidential and semi-parliamentarian system. However, there is not the slightest reason for such a step. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You claim that there is no reason. But would you support such a move? [Herzog] I would not support it. The idea that the president's office is weak actually prevails to a certain extent among the German people. This is due to the fact that they are convinced that laws, administrative decrees, and such determine our lives. Yet this is only true to a limited extent. Apart from that, a moral instance is also needed -- somebody who admonishes, warns, encourages beyond what is stipulated in the code of law, as the British claim. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You are probably the first candidate for this office who links the acceptance of the election with a certain condition. Could you explain this condition to us? [Herzog] My condition is: The required majority must not be solely achieved with the eight votes of the Republikaner. In other words: I need 50 percent plus nine votes in the first two ballots, and nine votes more than the next-strongest candidate in the third ballot. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Theoretically, this might have the effect that you reject the election despite a narrow absolute majority? [Herzog] Theoretically, this would be possible. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Would it be possible for you to run again in another round if you rejected the election in the first ballot? Do you consider that possible politically? [Herzog] Politically, it is possible. I would even have a respectable motive. Yet, I do not consider this a likely scenario. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] However, in the event of this scenario: Would you run again? [Herzog] If my party wants that, then I will go through all three ballots. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In the unlikely event that you receive six or eight votes more than the absolute majority because of a sudden split in the Free Democratic Party of Germany, would you reject the election? [Herzog] Yes. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] And run again in the third ballot? [Herzog] Yes. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Is this not an invitation for your rivals to proceed in the same way? [Herzog] My motive is completely different. I believe that the fight against the Republikaner is a task on the right fringes of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU). Thus, the presidential candidate cannot simply say: I welcome every vote from this side. Second, I want to avoid a situation like the one in 1969, when the votes of the National Democratic Party of Germany were decisive in the vote of the candidates Gerhard Schroeder versus Gustav Heinemann -- which backfired. I believe it is always better to be open about one's dealings. The third and most important reason was: If I had not announced my plans at such an early stage, a journalist would have called me every morning for the past four months, asking whose support I want. And I would have had to give evasive answers, which is not my style. Things are clear for me in this respect. Of course, I knew that someone would ask Johannes Rau about the Party of Democratic Socialism at some point. Yet, this was not my motive, whether you believe it or not. I acted on the basis of the three motives I just mentioned. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Let me ask you one final question, which results from your commentary on the election procedure stipulated in the Basis Law. In the event that you are elected on 23 May at the Berlin Reichstag, will you accept the election immediately or will you make use of the legal 48 hours for reflection? [Herzog] In view of the uncertain situation at the Federal Postal Administration, I would say, in God's name, I accept the election.
