This bank would also issue a monetary unit common to all of them. The Armenian premier's explanation for his proposal is that, by introducing a national currency in their own country, the CIS countries cannot fail to use the Russian ruble as the sole means for interstate financial transactions, constantly asking the Central Bank of Russia for loans. All this is leading not only to the devaluation of national currencies, but also to a fall in the ruble rate. A single CIS interstate bank and a monetary unit common to the Commonwealth countries will promote the rapid restoration of economic ties within the CIS, the economic improvement of the countries of this union, and the further process of their integration, the premier believes.
