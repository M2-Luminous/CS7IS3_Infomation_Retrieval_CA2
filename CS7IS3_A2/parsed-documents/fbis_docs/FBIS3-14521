Sa'd Mujbir [an official of the Libyan parliament] said Libya had accepted the February 3 ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague in favour of Chad's territorial claims to the Aouzou Strip, which Libya has occupied for the past 20 years. "There's no question of reneging," he said. "But we want to withdraw within the rules in such a way as to avoid future conflict, preserving the dignity of all parties." He said the OAU should act fast to supervise the withdrawal, saying Libya had asked current OAU chairman Egypt to put together a team of observers to carry out the task. He rejected claims by Ndjamena that Libya was setting preconditions for a withdrawal, and denied that Libya was sending reinforcements to the territory.
