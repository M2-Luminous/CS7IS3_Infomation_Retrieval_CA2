He said such tactics might be appropriate elsewhere in war-torn Bosnia. But he insisted that following the success of the NATO air-strike threat, the immediate priority was to get the aid convoys moving again. Mr Rifkind said the outcome could be regarded as a tentative success. "It is clear that the vast majority of weapons have been handed over to the United Nations and the rest appear to have been moved from the 20 kilometre range." Nine sites still had to be visited "but there is every reason to believe that they have been vacated, too", he added. Asked on BBC Breakfast News if he was suspicious of the Bosnian Serbs' intentions, Mr Rifkind warned that the threat of air strikes remained available if there was any attempt to use artillery against Sarajevo. "This is not a threat that has disappeared," he said. "This is a very tremendous step forward, but only a step forward. We are now preventing the use of artillery shells against Sarajevo. It is only one more small step towards ending the war in Bosnia." Asked why the air strike threat could not have been introduced months ago, Mr Rifkind said: "You can only achieve things when circumstances permit it." The Serbs had realised that they could never take Sarajevo and therefore a withdrawal was not such a humiliation. The United Nations and NATO had to avoid taking sides in someone else's civil war, but still had to exercise maximum influence, diplomatic and humanitarian, to reduce the horrors of the war. Mr Rifkind said it might be appropriate to adopt the formula elsewhere. "But the immediate priority is to get aid moving again. The possibility of air strikes meant that UN convoys had to take shelter. "In the middle of winter people will starve if the aid does not get through," Mr Rifkind added.
