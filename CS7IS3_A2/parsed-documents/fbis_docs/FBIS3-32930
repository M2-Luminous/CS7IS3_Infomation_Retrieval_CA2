Congress President Oscar Vinicio Villar yesterday reported that the first action of rapprochement occurred during the inauguration of the "Fuertes Caminos" project, when he invited the Executive Branch to find solutions to national problems through a dialogue and reconciliation. Even though the action of rapprochement was fortuitous, it grants an opportunity to end the confrontation between the two branches, based on the understanding that we will respect our independence and jointly seek solutions to the most important social problems, he added. Villar said it is never too late to improve things when there is a political will, particularly now that the democratic process, and the country's own stability, are at stake. Referring to the Great National Agreement, the congress president said if everyone has faith and works hard to solve the crisis, and if there is a political will to find solutions without negatively affecting the masses, we can all overcome the problems that have provoked national instability. This project supports the congress position that all the groups which comprise our society should participate in a dialogue. We are willing to participate, as an organization, and support the appeal issued by the Executive Branch because we believe this will allow us to find a solution to our differences, Villar said. The official said the current problem is that each group that wants to participate in the dialogue has the idea it will gain something, but if we want to find a solution to our current crisis we must first make contributions without expecting benefits. "Referring to this, the groups that have remained in power in the country must realize it is important that we find solutions to prevent a grave crisis, because this would return the country to the obscurantist decades" which prevailed in the past. Given this situation, in my role as Legislative Branch president, I consider positive a rapprochement between the two state branches because we are aware that a dialogue will allow us to find solutions to the problems that worry us nowadays, he emphasized.
