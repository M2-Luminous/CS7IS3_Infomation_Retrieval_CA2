A total of 11,717 cases of cholera were reported in 12 of China's 30 provinces, the newspaper said, categorising the situation as an epidemic that began in about April and reached its high-point in September and October. Two different strains were found, it said, describing their origins as "complicated." It did not specify whether either was the aggressive new 0139 strain of cholera, which has already killed thousands in India and Bangladesh. In August, China acknowledged that the mutant strain, which attacks people who would normally have immunity after having cholera, had killed at least two people in the far northwestern province of Xinjiang. Health News said the low incidence of cholera in China for the past 10 years was partly to blame for the rapid spread of last year's epidemic because the population's immunity was low. Unhygienic food and water supplies in rural areas and inadequate grassroots health services had also contributed to the problem, the report said. The ministry of health has ordered local authorities to emphasize prevention, particularly in areas where cholera has been a problem, it said. Special clinics should be set up and new cases reported to the ministry immediately, it added.
