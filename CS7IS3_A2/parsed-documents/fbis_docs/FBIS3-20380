Turkes said that the citizens in eastern and southeastern Turkey showed in the elections that they do not want to secede. He added: The election results are a good lesson to those who try to interfere in Turkey's domestic affairs.

They resulted in a victory for democracy. The NAP leader stated that the citizens voted in favor of maintaining the coalition, adding: The election results show that the people do not want chaos, or the state business to be delayed through frequent elections. They show that the people want the present coalition to remain power. That is my conclusion.
