A week ago in Marrakesh, the member states of the GATT signed the agreement, which took seven and a half years to negotiate. The agreement stipulates a 37-percent reduction in customs duties as well as the opening up of markets to foreign products and services. The German Government intends officially to apply that Bonn be the location of the new World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO will replace GATT, which was founded in 1947, on 1 January. In a government statement, German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party) welcomed the new world trade agreement as a "milestone in trade policy." The export-oriented German economy, on which every third job depends, will profit from the agreement even if follow-up negotiations are still required in individual cases. The agreement shows that countries want free trade and are ready to take on structural changes. The walls of protectionism belong to the past, said Rexrodt. At the same time, the minister underlined that Bonn is a serious candidate for the seat of the WTO due to its position and infrastructure. His ministry is therefore preparing its bid.
