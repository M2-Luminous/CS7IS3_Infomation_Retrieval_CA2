The venue has not yet been specified. Geneva and Karadjordjevo were proposed as possible venues today. The UN mediation team was led by Yasushi Akashi. General Bertrand Delapresle, the commander of the peacekeeping forces for the former Yugoslavia, and Kai Eide, deputy cochairman of the Geneva conference on the former Yugoslavia, were also in the UN team. The RSK delegation consisted of Krajina President Milan Martic; Prime Minister Borisav Mikelic; Foreign Minister Milan Babic; Defense Minister Rade Tanjga, and Interior Minister Ilija Prijic. At a news conference, Akashi described the talks as open, useful, meaningful, and productive. He said three key questions in the peace process had been discussed--the implementation of the cease-fire agreement, the resumption of the RSK-Croatia talks on economic relations, and bilateral issues between the RSK and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. [passage omitted] At the end of the news conference, Akashi said that his impression after the talks today was that the state leadership of Krajina was "for cooperation with UNPROFOR in the process of achieving peace and establishing economic relations". "I am satisfied with the results of the talks today and am optimistic about relations in the future," Akashi said. President Martic also said the talks had been productive. He praised Akashi as a man fighting for peace and stressed the need to lift the sanctions against Krajina so that the forthcoming talks with Croatia could take place on an equal footing. Martic said he believed that the forthcoming talks between the RSK and UNPROFOR would be fruitful and useful in the resolution of their bilateral relations and obligations.
