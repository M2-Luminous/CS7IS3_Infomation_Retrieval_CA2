Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-18FEB94-JAPAN U.S. Tokyo Signals Concern Over Long-Term Impact of Failed Talks SUMMARY While Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has won fairly broad domestic support for his refusal to accept U.S. demands to establish objective criteria to measure Japan's import performance at the failed 11 February U.S.-Japan summit, comments by Japanese political and business leaders and by the Japanese media have contained a strong undercurrent of concern about the long-term impact of the failure of the framework negotiations. These concerns appear to center around the further rise of the yen, possible U.S. sanctions against Japan, and the potential danger that increased trade friction may damage the political and security relationship between the two countries. To help contain such future developments, the Japanese Government appears to be planning to draw up a variety of measures to increase imports and relax regulations governing the Japanese market in certain areas. The scope of these measures, however, is still uncertain and they may face resistance from entrenched interests in the Japanese bureaucracy. END SUMMARY Prime Minister Hosokawa's refusal to accept U.S. demands to establish objective criteria to measure Japan's trade performance won support across a broad political spectrum in Japan. Senior members of Hosokawa's increasingly fractious coalition backed the prime minister solidly on the issue in comments made over the past few days. In comments on a 13 February TV Asahi panel discussion, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who has recently reportedly clashed with the prime minister on a variety of issues, including tax reform, defended Hosokawa's stance and stated that acceptance of targets would have been "totally impossible." He added that any policy under which the government would have agreed to set targets for the private sector would have "threatened the very foundation of the nation's economic system." Minister of International Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kumagai made similar comments during a 12 February FNN Television round table discussion, and Ichiro Ozawa, Secretary General of one of the key parties in the coalition and one of the leading figures behind Hosokawa's government, endorsed the prime minister's stance in an interview in the 14 February Yomiuri Shimbun. Ozawa stated that it was "proper" for Hosokawa to reject the targets because Japan had grown more independent of the United States and must now "act with responsibility as a mature nation." Ambivalent LDP Stance The opposition Liberal Democratic Party has also supported Hosokawa's stance on targets, confining their somewhat ambivalent and muted criticism of his performance at the summit to other issues. For example: -- In a statement on the summit, LDP President Yohei Kono described Japan's rejection of U.S. demands for establishing objective criteria as "natural," according to a 12 February Kyodo report. Kono reportedly focused his criticism of Hosokawa on what he described as the government's overreliance on the bureaucracy to handle the trade negotiations. He also rebuked the prime minister for criticizing the way the LDP conducted negotiations with the United States in the past. -- Similarly, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, a senior LDP leader, reportedly stated during a lecture on 14 February that he opposed the setting of numerical targets, but warned that the United States might take "retaliatory action" against Japan because of the failure of the summit (Kyodo, 14 February). -- During a round table discussion on NHK Television on 13 February, Kabun Muto, foreign minister at the time the framework accords were drawn up in July 1993, praised Hosokawa's for rejecting objective criteria in almost unequivocal terms. Muto implied that the LDP, if still in power, would have done the same thing, stating that the party had, while in power, maintained that it would not "accept any measure that would lead to managed trade." Muto added that "it was good that the talks broke off in failure" in view of the U.S. insistence on setting objective criteria. -- During the same discussion program, another LDP member, Masajuro Shiokawa, criticized the government for not dealing with U.S. demands for the establishment of objective criteria rapidly enough, commenting that it had "known from the beginning" about the demand. He added that the government would have been in a stronger position had it been able to come up with an effective "counterproposal" to U.S. demands. Business and Media Reaction The Japanese business community and the Japanese media also generally supported Hosokawa's stance on objective criteria. Many business leaders, particularly those whose industries were involved in the framework talks, applauded Hosokawa's stand, arguing, as they have in the past, that such targets would have represented an unwarranted interference with the private sector. For example, Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), Japan's leading business organization, described the breakdown of the trade talks as "unavoidable" and praised the government for sticking to "its policy of rejecting the U.S. managed-trade approach" (Kyodo, 11 February). According to the 13 February Mainichi Shimbun, similar statements came from the leaders of major telecommunications firms and from the chairman of the Marine and Fire Insurance Association of Japan. In addition, editorials in every major Japanese daily newspaper praised the Prime Minister's stance on objective criteria. A typical comment came from Japan's leading economic newspaper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, which described rejection of objective criteria as "common sense" and stated that the targets demanded by Washington would have led to "managed trade." Despite the business community's support for Hosokawa's rejection of objective criteria, some business leaders, particularly in export-oriented industries, appear to be concerned about the potential impact of the failure of the trade talks on Japanese business. The 16 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted Ryuzaburo Kaku, the chairman of Canon, Inc., as warning that unless measures were taken to reduce the trade surplus, the continued appreciation of the yen would "deal a fatal blow to Japan's manufacturing industries." Similarly, the 13 February Mainichi Shimbun reported that the automobile industry, while pleased that the government had rejected the establishment of objective criteria, was worried that it might come under increasing pressure to work out "voluntary" plans to purchase more foreign products as the government searched for ways to break the impasse with the United States. Impact of Summit Failure The comments of various Japanese political, government, and business leaders suggest that, despite their general support for Hosokawa's rejection of numerical targets, they have at least three major concerns as a result of the failure of the summit: that the United States might attempt to drive the yen significantly higher on world money markets, weakening Japanese competitiveness and slowing Japan's recovery from its current recession; that the United States might impose sanctions on Japan in retaliation for its refusal to accept the concept of objective criteria; and that tenser relations with the United States might weaken the security relationship between the United States and Japan. Yen Rise The sharp rise of the yen in the wake of the breakdown of the framework talks appears to have aroused particular concern among political, government, and business leaders and may be pushing some of them to consider measures to address Japan's large current account surplus. Ichiro Ozawa warned during a 15 February press conference that the appreciation of the yen would cause Japan's economy to "suffer profound damage," according to the 15 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun. He added that the two countries should "hold talks as soon as possible to discuss ways to settle the framework talks." At a 15 February news conference, Akira Yamagishi, chairman of Rengo [the Japanese Trade Union Confederation], reportedly described the appreciation of the yen as a "serious" situation and a "crisis". According to the 15 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun, he said he would press the government to draw up an "action program" of measures to liberalize the Japanese market, expand domestic demand, and reduce the trade surplus in order to "reconcile Japan and the United States as soon as possible." The 16 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that a number of Japanese business leaders are also worried about the rise of the yen and believe that Japan should attempt to defuse tensions with the United States by taking unilateral measures to reduce its trade surplus. Possible Sanctions A second area of concern is that the United States might impose sanctions on Japan. While many Japanese political and government leaders have warned that Japan might lodge a complaint with GATT should this happen, their comments suggest they wish to avoid a confrontation in this area. For example, in comments on NHK Television on 13 February, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura speculated that the U.S. Congress and the American public might press the Clinton administration to impose sanctions on Japan, but added that he hoped Washington would be "prudent and reasonable" and "stay away from unilateral measures. When pressed by his interviewer, he said Japan might consider turning to GATT if the United States invoked sanctions. The 13 February Mainichi Shimbun reported that some parts of the automobile industry were concerned that the U.S. Government and Congress might push for sanctions, which in turn would result in more pressure on the auto industry to import more foreign products. Political, Security Relationship A third area of concern has been the potential impact of increased trade frictions on the political and security relationship between Japan and the United States. In an interview in the 14 February Yomiuri Shimbun, Ichiro Ozawa stated that he was most concerned not about the future of the framework talks, but about the possibility that the "relationship of trust between Japan and the United States" might disintegrate. He added that Japan was still not in a position to adequately handle a range of responsibilities in the international security arena. This point of view has also received some play in media commentary on the summit. For example, in an article in the 14 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a member of the paper's editorial staff warned that if the "relationship of trust between the two countries in security matters is undermined, this would certainly bring chaos to the Japanese financial and capital markets and unsettle the Japanese economy." Government Course of Action For the time being, the Japanese Government appears to be hoping to limit the possibility and scope of U.S. retaliation and the damage to bilateral relations by taking a variety of steps to increase imports and relax regulations governing the Japanese market in selected areas. Prime Minister Hosokawa has stated on several occasions since the end of the summit that he plans to encourage such efforts. He told a news conference at the Madison Hotel in Washington on 12 February, for example, that Japan "should work voluntarily to achieve what it can" to make procedures on its insurance and government procurement markets clearer and promote "industrial cooperation" between Japanese and U.S. auto companies (NHK Television, 12 February). He also told reporters upon his return to Tokyo that he planned to quickly begin to examine measures Japan could take to reduce its trade surplus, according to a 13 February NHK Television report. Faced with the sharp rise of the yen and the threat of U.S. sanctions, Hosokawa has followed through on these promises quickly. On 15 February, he reportedly ordered his cabinet to draw up "emergency plans" to cut Japan's trade surplus with the United States (Kyodo, 15 February). On 17 February, he reportedly met with senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), Ministry of Finance, and Foreign Ministry officials involved in the framework negotiations to discuss measures to improve foreign access to the Japanese market (Kyodo, 17 February). He also reportedly announced that he had appointed the MITI Minister, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Posts and Telecommunications Minister and Chief Cabinet Secretary to a special task force to draw up market opening measures beginning the week of 21 February. The exact nature of the measures the government will take appears to still be vague. According to the 15 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun, among proposals under consideration are steps to further relax government procurement procedures and the introduction of an insurance brokerage system and a public hearing system which would allow foreign insurance companies to voice their grievances. According to a 17 February Kyodo report, other possibilities include measures to tighten antitrust policies and relax government procurement procedures. There appears to be fairly broad support among Japanese political leaders for such steps. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, head of one of the parties in the coalition government, stated on two different television programs on 13 February that Japan must take steps on its own to reduce its trade surplus. At one of these, an NHK Television roundtable discussion of the summit, he stated that although Japan could not accept numerical targets, "it is still responsible for redressing its huge trade surplus by liberalizing and expanding its own markets." He added that Japan should take such steps because of the importance of its bilateral relations with the United States. MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai made similar statements during a FNN Television round table on 12 February and Ichiro Ozawa, in an interview in the 14 February Yomiuri Shimbun, stated Japan should take steps to deregulate its economy as part of its effort to reduce trade friction with the United States. The Japanese media also have given broad support to this approach. Post-summit editorials in all of the major newspapers- -Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Yomiuri Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun, and Mainichi Shimbun--called on the government to take steps to reduce the trade surplus, open Japanese markets, and deregulate the economy. Outlook Over the coming weeks, the Japanese Government will probably take a number of steps to try to convince Washington that Japan is attempting to reduce its trade surplus and open its markets. In view of the solid consensus within Japan against targets, these measures will probably not include the objective criteria Washington is seeking, however. Moreover, any substantial measures will probably meet with strong resistance from the Japanese bureaucracy. With Hosokawa's coalition increasingly fraught by internal divisions over a variety of policy issues, it is unclear whether the government will be able to focus sufficiently on these measures or muster the strength to force the bureaucracy to draw up more than cosmetic measures to address the trade surplus. If the yen continues to rise, however, the Japanese business community may prove increasingly willing to take steps on its own to increase imports. Many export-oriented industries may come to see such steps as preferable to a continued appreciation of the yen, which would hurt the competitiveness of their exports. (AUTHOR: BOUNDS.
