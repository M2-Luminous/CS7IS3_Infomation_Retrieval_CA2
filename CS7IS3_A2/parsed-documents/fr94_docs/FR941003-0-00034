FR941003-0-00034 FR941003-0-00011 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 672 [Docket No. 930222&hyph;4274; I.D. 091294C] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Technical amendment. SUMMARY: NMFS issues a technical amendment to clarify regulations that prohibit a vessel from participating in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) directed sablefish hook-and-line gear fishery when hook-and-line gear was deployed from that vessel within 72 hours prior to the opening of that fishery. This technical amendment clarifies this prohibition by stating that it applies only to vessels that deployed hook-and-line gear in the GOA within 72 hours prior to the start of that fishery. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 3, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ellen R. Varosi, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NMFS published a final rule (58 FR 28520, May 14, 1993) that prohibits participation in the GOA directed sablefish fishery by a vessel that has deployed hook-and-line gear within 72 hours prior to the opening of that fishery. The rule was intended to apply only to vessels that deployed gear in the GOA in advance of that fishery. As written, the rule implied that a vessel is prohibited from participating in the GOA directed sablefish fishery if the vessel deployed hook-and-line gear in any fishery within 72 hours prior to that opening. This interpretation is inconsistent with the preamble to the proposed rule, published in the Federal Register on April 1, 1993 (58 FR 17193), which explains that the prohibition applies only to vessels that deploy hook-and-gear in the GOA within 72 hours prior to the opening. Because hook-and-line vessel operators participating in fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area have expressed uncertainty as to the regulatory intent, ยง672.7(k) is clarified to specify that this prohibition applies only to vessels that fished in the GOA. Classification Because this rule clarifies the regulation to make its text consistent with the intent set forth in its preamble, it is an interpretive rule that may be published without notice and opportunity for comment and without a 30-day delay in effective date under section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553). This rule is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 672 Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: September 27, 1994.
