(c)(7)(i)(C)( 4 ) For light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, and heavy-duty vehicle evaporative and/or refueling emissions (as applicable) and for light-duty truck, and heavy-duty engine exhaust emissions, deterioration factors shall be determined in accordance with §86.098&hyph;24. (c)(7)(ii) through (c)(11)(ii)(B) introductory text [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;14. (c)(11)(ii)(B)( 1 ) Engine evaporative/refueling family names and vehicle (or engine) configurations. (c)(11)(ii)(B)( 2 ) through (c)(11)(ii)(B)( 15 ) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;14. (c)(11)(ii)(B)( 16 ) through (c)(11)(ii)(B)( 18 ) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.095&hyph;14. (c)(11)(ii)(B)( 19 ) For each light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, or heavy-duty vehicle evaporative/refueling emission family, a description of any unique procedures required to perform evaporative and/or refueling emission tests (as applicable) (including canister working capacity, canister bed volume, and fuel temperature profile for the running loss test) for all vehicles in that evaporative/refueling emission family, and a description of the method used to develop those unique procedures. ( 20 ) For each light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, or heavy-duty vehicle evaporative/refueling emission family: ( i ) Canister working capacity, according to the procedures specified in §86.132&hyph;96(h)(1)(iv); ( ii ) Canister bed volume; and ( iii ) Fuel temperature profile for the running loss test, according to the procedures specified in §86.129&hyph;94(d). (c)(11)(ii)(C) through (c)(11)(ii)(D)( 5 ) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.095&hyph;14. (c)(11)(ii)(D)( 6 ) [Reserved]. (c)(11)(ii)(D)( 7 ) through (c)(15) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;14. 21. A new §86.098&hyph;17 is added to subpart A to read as follows: §86.098&hyph;17 Emission control diagnostic system for 1998 and later light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. Section 86.098&hyph;17 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from §86.094&hyph;17. Where a paragraph in §86.094&hyph;17 is identical and applicable to §86.098&hyph;17, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;17.'' (a) introductory text through (a)(3) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;17. (a)(4) Any other deterioration or malfunction within the powertrain which occurs in actual use and which results in an exhaust emission increase of greater than 0.2 g/mi HC, 1.7 g/mi CO, or 0.5 g/mi NO X , or any vapor leak in the evaporative and/or refueling system which results in an evaporative emissions increase of greater than 30.0 g/test measured over the first 24 hours of the diurnal portion of the revised evaporative emissions test procedure, in accordance with test procedures set forth in subpart B of this part, for vehicles certified to that test procedure.
