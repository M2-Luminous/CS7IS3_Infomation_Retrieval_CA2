This allows the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia access to the regular twice monthly WEU delegates' meetings in Brussels and to send soldiers to peace keeping operations, but does not give them security guarantees or the right of veto. The Czech Republic was represented at today's ceremony by Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec and Defense Minister Antonin Baudys. At the meeting Zieleniec said he welcomed the fact that after the NATO summit (at which the Partnership for Peace project was approved) the WEU had come up with an initiative that would bring the Czech Republic closer to the process of building an European defense identity. The Czech Republic felt the same responsibility for the safety of the continent as the West did, he added. He later told journalists that from now on contacts with the WEU would stop being merely diplomatic and would take on a working character. The WEU was gradually changing into the military pillar of Europe, Zieleniec said. After the ceremony Zieleniec met his French counterpart Alain Juppe. They exchanged views on the preparation for the forthcoming meeting on the proposed stability pact in Paris, agreeing that it was vitally important that the meeting should take place and produce positive results for European security.
