This was what Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, prominently stressed during his investigation and study activities in Qihe on 23 May. Jiang Chunyun has regarded Qihe as an area that he keeps in contact with while dealing with his work. Over the past year, he has established profound ties with the local people there. On the morning of 23 May, Jiang Chunyun went to (Dayang) Village of (Xiaozhou) Township. He successively visited the homes of Villagers (Yang Ailin) and (Yang Meilin) and the vegetable growing areas in (Dayang) Village. He asked them about their vegetable planting and marketing situation as well as their income. He suggested that they should achieve not only production but also marketing. Jiang Chunyun also visited the fine wheat seed cultivating base in (Dayang) village to understand the wheat and cotton growing situation. He said: Cotton is a major advantage of the northern and western areas of Shandong Province as well as a pillar of the rural economy. So, we should exert great efforts to grasp cotton production. After that, he went to the construction site of the on-going (Huajiao) road; called on the personnel who were engaging themselves in the construction work, including the cadres of the provincial agricultural commission, the provincial personnel affairs department, the provincial radio and television department, and the provincial (?export) company who take on jobs in Qihe; and also wielded a shovel to join the labor. He earnestly said to these cadres: Promoting a coordinate development of the eastern and western parts of the province and seeking common wealth is a major task that the province should make efforts to fulfill. Helping the people in less developed areas turn poverty into wealth as soon as possible is an unshirkable duty of the party cadres and the people's public servants. So, we should firmly foster the purpose of serving the people, have a profound feeling to do more concrete deeds for the people, and make contributions to rejuvenating the economy in these areas and bringing about happiness to the people there. After hearing the reports made by the leaders of Dezhou Prefecture and Qihe County, Jiang Chunyun urged that Dezhou Prefecture and Qihe County should take the lead in narrowing the gaps with the eastern areas and turning poverty into wealth as soon as possible. Jiang Chunyun pointed out that to deepen reform, we should implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, focus on setting up the socialist market economic system, promote overall reform, and make a key breakthrough. Jiang Chunyun stressed: We should persist in the principle of taking a two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough and actually ensure to grasp both material and spiritual civilizations and to make achievements in these two aspects.
