Gaydar said the present exchange rate is being artificially maintained in the country. "In December the Central Bank of Russia intervened with its own currency resources to prevent the ruble from plummeting," Gaydar said. "The main factor which determined the favourable dynamics of the ruble exchange rate consisted in a combination of high interest rates against the low pace of the money mass growth and relatively low inflationary anticipation," he said. One component of this situation is no longer there since the inflation anticipation has skyrocketed. "If the second component -- the low pace of the money mass growth -- collapses, the dollar exchange rate will keep jumping from time to time," Gaydar said. But if the government departs from a tough credit and monetary policy, the drop in the ruble exchange rate can become a dramatic long-term factor of the Russian economy, he said. "I think one should be very prudent about attempts at maintaining the ruble exchange rate by copious currency interventions," Gaydar said. "It was very hard for us accumulate official state reserves starting from scratch in 1992 to 4.5 billion dollars. It would be too dangerous and irresponsible to squander them within a few days," Gaydar warned.
