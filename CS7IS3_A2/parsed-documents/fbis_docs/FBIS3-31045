This is how he described prior to the departure his position regarding NATO's ultimatum related to eventual air strikes against the Serbian positions around Sarajevo: [Begin Zhelev recording] Our position is clear and unchanged. One must remember that we are not involved in the decisions and in the actions. Consequently, posing the question whether Bulgaria supports or opposes the air strikes is unfair to Bulgaria. We participate very actively in the embargo. In this sphere we have a categorical commitment to the policy of the international community. However, we cannot do more than this because we are a Balkan country. If Yugoslavia was located say, in the Apennines or in the Pyrenees, rather than in the Balkans, then we could assume a more categorical position, or send Blue Helmets there. However, now we cannot do even this. We appeal to all Balkan states also to refrain from military participation in this conflict. [end recording] In an interview for Radio Bulgaria earlier today President Zhelev declared that Bulgaria cannot remain outside the Partnership for Peace initiative, which encompasses all new democracies. According to him, this initiative is an important step toward our regular membership in NATO. According to President Zhelev, sooner or later Russia will also join this initiative under the force of the natural development of affairs. Mr. Zhelev pointed out that there is no reason for any confrontation between the new democracies and Russia and especially between Bulgaria and Russia. If in Bulgaria there are certain circles -- communist, neocommunist, or postcommunist -- who view our joining NATO as a confrontation with Russia they do not understand the historical development of the process, the president said.
