At the same time, it was also proved that there was a heavy price tag attached to their staying on, especially when more issues came to light and all the Muslims in the region and world public opinion found out that Iraq had been armed by the West. The Arab countries met the heavy cost of the military expedition to the region. But it was the Westerners who got all the glory and the shaykhs who got all the disgrace. America, which was making plans for the future of the world and the region in view of the emerging signs that the Soviet Union was disintegrating, starting to create imaginary enemies for the shaykhs in a bid to gather them together in a extra-regional pact--that is, outside the Persian Gulf. Egypt was one of the staunch supporters of this plan and immediately announced its readiness to participate; and in order to legitimize this pact or gathering, the Syrian capital, Damascus, was chosen as the venue. And the pact came to be known as the six-plus-two pact. After the Persian Gulf war, these eight countries met to draw up plans for a regional security strategy. Now, after at least two years, the six-plus-two has neither put forth a plan nor does it have the guts to announce its dissolution, even though its recent session was also unsuccessful. Meanwhile, the six Persian Gulf countries insist on their past beliefs and have fear in their hearts--a fear that is based on American analyses and assessments. But Egypt and Syria are an exception to this rule. The Egyptians are dreaming of returning to the Jamal 'Abd-an- Nasir era in the Arab world. However, they neither have the economic ability nor a leader like an-Nasir to do so. Therefore, they attend sessions on America's orders and heatedly speak about the process of Islamism in the region and about the possible threat of Islamic Iran, hoping to reap something from these efforts. But this is not so with Syria. The Syrians accepted the six-plus-two pact because of their extensive differences with the Baghdad regime. However, they have nothing in common with the other members of the pact. They are aware of world diplomacy and of the need for independence, and they have adopted a completely progressive course. But the Syrian statesmen should also bear in mind that from America's point of view the six-plus-two pact is also considered as a club of friends who believe in the process of compromise in the Middle East. Egypt attends the Damascus sessions because of Camp David, and the shaykhs attend the sessions because of their military pacts and complete concordance with America. Therefore, Syria's presence in such a gathering is a blow to the political prestige of an independent and progressive country. Of course, it will be a different matter if America succeeds in binding Damascus with Tel Aviv. But if not, then Syria will have no place among the remaining seven members of the pact.
