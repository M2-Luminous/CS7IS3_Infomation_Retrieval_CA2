The committee will discuss various areas of future cooperation between Jordan and the Palestinians following the security agreement on self-rule that the PLO signed with Israel last Wednesday [9 February]. The committee, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Sa'id al-Tall and the head of the PLO's Political Department Faruq Qaddumi, is discussing cooperation in the areas of economy, security, and issues tackled by the multilateral Middle East peace talks. Mr. Qaddumi told reporters on arrival in Amman last night that the committee would debate a wide range of issues which would later be referred to specialized subcommittees which would meet regularly. He accused Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of reneging on the peace accord by repeatedly stating that dates were not sacred. Mr. Qaddumi called for closer strategy coordination between Jordan and the PLO.
