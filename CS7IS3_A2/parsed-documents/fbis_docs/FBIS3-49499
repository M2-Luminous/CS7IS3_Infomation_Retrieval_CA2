FBIS3-49499 "dreeu007__a94004" FBIS-EEU-94-007-A Document Type:Daily Report 11 January 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Gelemenov To Register National Socialist Party AU0701141694 Sofia BTA in English 1026 GMT 7 Jan 94 AU0701141694 Sofia BTA Language: English Article Type:BFN [From the BTA press review] [Text] The leader of the extraparliamentary Christian Democratic Party (Centre) and leader of the unregistered Vuzrazhdane [Rebirth] National Socialist Party, the Reverend Georgi Gelemenov, demands from the president a public apology on national television and sues him for 10,000,000 leva in compensatory damages for having been called "a medical case" by the president, says a frontpage story in STANDART NEWS. This is the first legal action brought against the head of state at the Prosecutor General's Office so far. The Rev. Gelemenov can produce a medical certificate to prove his sanity. At the end of last year, he lashed out at Bulgarian Turks and Gypsies, and Dr. Zhelev said in a televised interview on December 29 that his statements should long have been referred to the Prosecutor's Office. However, the president did not name names in his "medical case" allusion, STANDART NEWS recalls. The same daily quotes the president's spokesman Valentin Stoyanov as saying that it was the Rev. Gelemenov's own business if he identified himself with the referent of the president's statement. According to the daily EKSPRES, the National Socialists are almost ready with their registration papers, and after they hold their constituent meeting scheduled for next week, the legal machinery will be put into operation to legitimize their party. EKSPRES says that the doctrine of the Rev. Gelemenov's party was based on Hitler's economic policy. The daily found out that the most active members of the formation included servicemen and graduates of the German language schools in Sofia. In case the court denied registration to the National Socialist Party, the Rev. Gelemenov's people are threatening they will start operating underground. The 24 CHASA daily frontpages a report that in Istanbul Adem Kenan, leader of the unregistered Turkish Democratic Party, denigrated the Bulgarian Constitution and asked for help from Turkey. "Sofia is carrying on its assimilatory policy towards its citizens of Turkish origin," Mr. Kenan said yesterday, quoted by the Bulgarian National Radio and Television. 24 CHASA recalls that the prosecutor general ordered a preliminary inquiry into the activities of Mr. Kenan's party, which was conducted by investigators in Shumen (northeastern Bulgaria). The results of the inquiry are expected at the Prosecutor General's Office.
