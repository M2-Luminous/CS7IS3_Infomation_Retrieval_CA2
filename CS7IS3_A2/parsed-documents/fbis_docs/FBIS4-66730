The source was responding to accusations by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the secretary general of the YSP, made when he received the members of the National Dialogue Committee in Aden. The source said that such statements tend to arouse misgivings concerning the extent to which Yemen is committed to international agreements, and the source demanded that the YSP refute these statements. In addition to this, GPC sources also denied news items mentioned concerning elements of the forces loyal to 'Ali Nasir Muhammad in Sanaa leaving their camps and joining the forces that are serving the YSP. They described these news items as fabricated and untrue. They said that the opposite is what happened--that camps belonging to the military units located in Sanaa and al-Bayda' have received hundreds of individuals who have fled the camp of the Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar and the camp of the 3rd Brigade in 'Imran, in addition to a number of recruits who had joined the military units located in Aden and Shabwah which served the YSP. The GPC sources said that they justified their desertion by saying that they were protesting the actions of some of the YSP leaders who sought help from the sultans who were fighting against the Yemeni revolution. In addition to this, Yemeni newspapers yesterday said that a clash occurred recently between the northern and southern forces and that this resulted in five persons being killed in the Shabwah area. However, a northern source vehemently denied this, saying that what happened was a clash between two tribes, which resulted in only two persons being killed.
