The plant set up in the early 1970s was listed as the state key enterprise during the Seventh Five Year Plan period and was expanded in a large-scale. It was now equipped with installation for intensive processing of heavy oil. The plant took the lead in carrying out the processing of imported oil and refined nine kinds of domestic crude oil and 18 kinds of foreign crude oil. The capability of crude oil processing was up to 5.2 million tonnes a year, making the plant an extraordinary large enterprise in South China. After development of the plant into a refinery of a capacity of 10 million tonnes, according to the director, it would be able to exploit its potential for better production based on the original equipment and work force. It was expected that the spending on the expansion would be valued at US$1 billion, a 30 percent cut of expense needed for construction of a new refinery of the same size. [as received] Shortage of capital could be settled by means of the shareholding practice and, with an effort, better economic results could be achieved. Following the expansion, Mr. Hong said, the plant would be able to produce high-quality petrol, diesel oil and kerosene for aviation, all of which contain no lead. The products would be exported to Hong Kong, Singapore and Southeast Asia in addition to domestic sales. It would also be able to provide raw materials for further development of companies in the municipality in the future. Supplementary projects for the expansion ofthe plant include a crude oil wharf of a capacity of 150 000 tonnes in Daya Bay in Huizhou, seabed pipelines measuring a total length of 9.7 kilometres, petroleum pipelines of 180 kilometres long and storage facilities. Construction on these projects would start by the end of this month.
