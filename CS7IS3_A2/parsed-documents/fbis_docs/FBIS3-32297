Nevertheless, street demonstrations have continued. In Quito and Cuenca, the two cities where the strike was felt the most, labor and student groups held demonstrations for the fifth consecutive day today, while Indian leaders reiterated their call for a peasant uprising next week. Nevertheless, yesterday's unusual strike, smaller than previous strikes, evidently weakened the position of the labor, peasant, teacher, government worker, and student organizations that called the strike. Signs of division appeared among them today. The United Workers Front claimed sole responsibility for the "complete success" of the strike today, disregarding the existence of a "national coordinating board" with leaders from other sectors, sparking angry protests from several organizations. This week's demonstrations left an official toll of 21 injured, including 13 policemen, and 163 people arrested. Losses are estimated at approximately $200 million. Today, at the end of the strike, the government stated the increase in fuel prices, which caused the strike and several days of disturbances, is "completely irreversible" because, as Energy Minister Francisco Acosta said, "there is a fiscal deficit that must be covered and this is the way to do it." Nevertheless, today, the opposition political parties which control Congress insisted the Constitutional Court should declare the increase illegal, and they should suspend it. They also said the energy minister would be called to a political hearing, and Social Democratic leader Andres Vallejo said "we will remove him if the government does not repeal the measure." The fiscal deficit, which reportedly amounts to $600 million, was caused by the drop in international petroleum prices, which earns more than 40 percent of Ecuador's revenue.
