The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, said this when asked to comment on the report that Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten might table the second portion of the constitutional package before the Legislative Council of Hong Kong in March. "We hope that the British side withdraws its partial constitutional package that has been submitted to the Legislative Council and return to the negotiating table in view of maintaining Sino-British cooperation and the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong," the spokesman said. If the British side does not withdraw the partial constitutional package and goes on to submit the second portion of the package to the Legislative Council, he added, it will only demonstrate that the British side has set its mind on not returning to the negotiating table. "The British side should bear all the consequences arising from this," he said. China has reiterated that in a time when no agreements have been reached between the two sides, any legislation passed by the Legislative Council concerning the 1994/1995 election will not be accepted, he noted, adding that any institute or organization established according to that legislation will last only till June 30, 1997.
