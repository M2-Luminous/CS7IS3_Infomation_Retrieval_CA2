The information was provided by engineer Raul Herranz, a specialist in nuclear energy and president of Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A., CASA, of Spain, which manufactures the airplanes used in about 10 countries on the continent. [passage omitted] Herranz pointed out the high level of efficiency of Enaer, which co-produces the advanced C-101 training airplane -- known as the T- 36 Halcon -- in Chile, as well as the ability of its engineers and support personnel who work in the arsenals. He added: "This is why the Chilean company was chosen to represent us in Latin America for the maintenance or repair of all CASA products. We already have that commitment, which is unique because no authorization of this type to an industry has been given in any other part of the world." He said the exchange of aeronautics technology between Spain and Chile has been fluid, and this transfer of technology will be strengthened soon with the signing of a new contract. He added: "We are open to any type of cooperation with Enaer."
