Zhang Sai, director of the State Statistical Bureau and head of the leading group for nationwide general inspection of the enforcement of the Statistics Law, explained: The inspection will focus on the industrial output value that has created relatively serious problems and attracted comparatively adverse reaction from various social circles, particularly statistical data on village and town enterprises output value, population, grain output and reserves, peasants' per-capita income, investment in infrastructural construction projects, and commodities price indices. It is learned that with the State Council leaders' approval, the leading group for nationwide general inspection, which has been formed by relevant comrades in charge of the State Statistical Bureau, the Ministry of Supervision, and the State Council's Bureau of Legislative Affairs, has made comprehensive arrangements in this regard. Targets of the general inspection will include all investigative units which have been involved in organizing previous statistical surveys, as well as all units which have been obligated to provide statistical data and which have been surveyed previously. The general inspection mainly aims at inspecting and handling wrongdoings of recent years, particularly those which occurred since the beginning of 1993. They include the following: To attain certain political glory and economic benefits while discarding the state statistical laws and regulations, some individuals or small groups misstated, concealed, fabricated, or illegitimately changed their data when filling statistical reports; forced or instructed statistical organizations and personnel to falsify statistical data reports; retaliated against personnel who boldly upheld principles by reporting and exposing illegal statistical activities; and obstructed the investigation and handling of illegal statistical cases. The leading group for nationwide general inspection urged: While carrying out the inspection, various localities and departments should earnestly and properly conduct self-examination. All investigative units and units which have been surveyed previously should self-consciously check existing problems that may have arisen when they enforced statistical laws and regulations within their own units. They should thoroughly mobilize the masses to report and expose illegal statistical activities within their own units, and produce, after conducting self-examination, reports that aim at seeking truth from facts. Meanwhile, to prevent self-examinations from being performed as a mere formality, we should thoroughly and properly conduct major random checks. Counties and cities must organize effective investigative teams and specify units for random checks based on a ratio of one to every 10 units. The leading group for nationwide general inspection stressed: We should earnestly and properly handle various cases. We should uphold the general inspection's basic principle that we must handle all complaints; we must investigate all cases; we must penalize all violations of laws; we will be lenient in meting out penalty if violations are revealed through self-examination reports; we will mete out harsh penalty if violations are exposed by investigative teams; we will seek truth from facts; and we will investigate and handle cases according to law. We must strictly handle, according to law, major and important cases that are exposed by investigative teams during the general inspection, particularly, those units, including their personnel who are directly involved, that have engaged in illegal statistical activities which are serious and have a relatively grave impact.
