Minister Moravcik is now at the microphone. Minister, let us first go back to yesterday's Brussels summit. British Prime Minister John Major, speaking at the summit, characterized the Partnership for Peace as an evolutionary program that could lead to NATO membership--but for some countries only. What will the Slovak Republic have to do in order to, in John Major's words, find its place among those selected countries? What is it that Slovakia can and is willing to offer? [Moravcik] The summit passed a very important document, the summit statement. It should be signed by all of the countries wanting to join the project, and the government of the Slovak Republic is ready to sign it. Following a government decision, a special group, consisting of Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defense officials, will be set up in the next few days in order to prepare and realize the signing of the relevant documents. [Pospisilova] Minister, don't you think that in the past few days some well-known foreign politicians and mass media eliminated Slovakia from the process of joining NATO, even before the process could start? For example, CNN television used the argument that Slovakia's interest in joining NATO was not quite as obvious as the interest demonstrated by Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. What do you think Slovakia has done to deserve such treatment, subtle as it is? [Moravcik] I am not aware that we have been pursuing NATO membership less keenly than other Visegrad Four countries. We have used every occasion to present our position quite clearly. [passage omitted]. I would not read too much into such statements because, in all my personal dealings with foreign representatives--and some of them have failed now and then to mention Slovakia as a country keen to join NATO--I received assurances that Slovakia was counted in the same way as the rest of the Visegrad group countries. In assessing the situation objectively, we find there is no reason whatsoever to think that Slovakia is less well prepared as a partner than anyone else. We are definitely in the first group. [Pospisilova] Apart from meeting Bill Clinton, you will have bilateral talks with the members of other delegations. Are you going to discuss the demands of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia with your Hungarian counterpart? [Moravcik] The position of the Hungarian minority can be dealt with only in the context of our effort to prepare an all-European document. In all other respects, the position of the Hungarian minority in our country is our internal affair.
