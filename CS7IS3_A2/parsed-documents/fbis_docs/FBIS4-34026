FBIS4-34026 "drlat115_a_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-115 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Authorities Reinforce Surveillance at Embassies Authorities Reinforce Surveillance at Embassies PA1406210594 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1817 GMT 14 Jun 94 PA1406210594 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Havana, 14 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Cuban authorities reinforced surveillance at diplomatic missions, particularly Latin American ones, in Havana following the entry of 20 Cubans into the German Embassy. The streets surrounding the Belgium and German Embassies, where two groups of Cubans have entered in the past weeks, remain closed to vehicle traffic. The diplomatic missions of Peru, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina are heavily guarded. Diplomatic sources view this deployment of police forces as a preventive measure in light of likely incidents at other embassies while the Fourth Ibero-American Summit is being held. The recent situation triggered by the crashing of a truck carrying 21 persons -- 18 men and three women -- on Monday into the German Embassy so as to request political asylum remains the same, and seemingly, no changes have taken place. German Embassy sources consulted by EFE today refused to comment and limited themselves to referring questions to the Foreign Ministry in Bonn. Foreign Ministry spokesmen in Bonn indicated that their government is seeking a European solution for the Cubans inside their embassy and the Belgian ambassador's residence in Havana. The German Embassy and the Belgian ambassador's residence are only a few city blocks apart in the Miramar neighborhood. The same source noted that the Cuban refugees are refusing to leave the embassy if their situation is not resolved. This stand is similar to that adopted by a group of 100 Cubans who have occupied the Belgian residence for two weeks. Only seven persons have left thus far. A diplomatic source told EFE that currently, the European embassies maintain normal contacts regarding these cases, and that at any moment, the EU ambassadors could meet to discuss the situation at the German Embassy. In either case, the Cuban Government has insisted on pointing out that this is an "illegal" action that in no way can replace regular procedures for leaving the island. Yesterday, the Cuban Government referred to the incident at the German Embassy as "a carefully planned and unacceptable act." Meanwhile, the Belgian Government said the 117 refugees must leave the residence peacefully and follow legal emigration procedures. They have indicated, however, that the conflict will not be easily resolved because of the refugees' resistance.
