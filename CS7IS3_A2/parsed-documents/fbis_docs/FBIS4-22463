Shumeyko: When We Have Stability, Wealth Will Follow"] [Text] [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Vladimir Filippovich, we hear that political chaos is reigning in the country; that we cannot live like this anymore. Is it so difficult to find the way to an accord? [Shumeyko] Yes, political chaos does indeed exist. Russia is currently going through a peak in politician activism while voter activism has hit the bottom. Voter activism has dropped in both the democratic camp and among the opposition. For instance, in St. Petersburg there were 750 candidates for 50 seats in the Duma. At that point Sobchak permitted a rally to be held against these elections at the request of four parties of communist orientation. They wanted to bring out 15,000 people at the Palace Square. At the designated time, 22 persons showed up. It became clear that people are tired of this all. Politicians have completely lost touch with real life. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] You have lived through two putsches: one inside the "White House" and one outside it. What do you think? Will you survive the third? [Shumeyko] I think there will not be a third one. There are no preconditions for it today. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] On 4 April it is six months since the tragic October events. Was it possible to avoid them? [Shumeyko] At the negotiations the evening of Friday, 1 October, the White House defenders set a condition: to hold early presidential elections on 12 December. When the president was told about this condition, he said that for the sake of national accord he would be willing to run for reelection any time. Those in the White House learned about it, and the opposition's main trump card was rendered void. This is when the events began to escalate instantly. A demonstration moved from October Square to the White House and began storming the Comecon building. A convoy took off for Ostankino at the same time. We spent the whole night deciding what to do. We could not let events spill out further from Moscow across Russia. A civil war in an industrially developed state, where any power station, chemical enterprise, or defense plant may be blown up is suicide. As if we did not have enough with Chernobyl. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] But violence eventually had to be stopped by even greater violence--tanks. [Shumeyko] Our plan was predicated on the assumption that Rutskoy is a military man, not a politician. If, in the morning, a professional military man sees tanks with guns trained on him, he understands perfectly well that they will fire. It is time to surrender. But Rutskoy hoped that there would be those who would defend him. The people, however, were not jumping under these tanks, and did not rise to defend Rutskoy and Khasbulatov. And when the besieged were told "Come out with a white flag," machine-gun fire came from a White House window. The first shell from a tank went to the window from which machine-gun fire was coming. After that there was again a pause, designed for the reaction of a military man who is given time to change his mind. Because if it is war, the shelling will continue until victory. To tell the truth, nobody expected the besieged to start military action. The army did not want to start this war. I get indignant when people say that Yerin showed himself as a weak man and the troops did not shoot. Do you think it is easy to make a soldier shoot at his own people? Now I think: Rutskoy is a professional, you cannot take that away from him, but he was not in control of the situation in there. I am certain of it. Because if parliament defends the constitution, but at the same time allows fascists to defend itself (remember Barkashov people with swastikas on their sleeves), what kind of law, what constitution, what parliament are we talking about? The constitution says that even fascist propaganda is impermissible. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] But, on the other hand, the constitution does not say that you can fire at the elected parliament. [Shumeyko] I agree with you unequivocally. But neither does the constitution say that you can allow a civil war to happen. What I will say may sound cynical: An aircraft went down; 75 people died. We have lived through this tragedy--what can we do about it? There were 120 people who died around the White House. Yes, I am sorry for them. But Russia was saved at this price, since civil peace was restored. Everything we did, we did right. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] And you think that the memory of those October days subconsciously prompts all political forces to accord? [Shumeyko] Accord is inherent in today's life. Nobody wants any more of these battles. Ordinary people understand better than politicians that Russia can be turned only once in a century, Russia, like a huge ship, has just turned toward reforms. And now what; turn back? [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Can an accord be reached at the time of intensive fight for power? [Shumeyko] It is easier to seize power when everything is collapsing. To gain it in a democratic way--through elections--naturally, is difficult. But more honorable. Then let us first strengthen this authority. The institution of the presidency is the youngest in the state. There has always been a czar. After the czar, general secretary--the same czar. For the first time democratic presidential authority was born in Russia. When it gets stronger, then let us go for it in a democratic way. But there are many who do not want to strengthen it! [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Since you have become a Russian deputy, you also have been near the helm of power all the time. It was probably not easy to be Khasbulatov's deputy, was it? [Shumeyko] After I was made his deputy, our relations became difficult right away. Before the Sixth Congress he told me that we will need to speak up and defeat Gaydar's government. I told him that I have a different opinion: Gaydar's government does what is necessary and possible only in this today's situation. Shock therapy is beyond the point. We do not have it; nobody has launched any shock therapy. It would not occur to any of us with our socialist-economic thinking to suddenly free prices. And Gaydar was right in proposing to free prices for everything at the same time. But, we did not agree... The main achievement of our reforms is that the market got 76 percent saturated at prices that are higher than world prices. Now we can develop our own producer. At the time, though, the country was on the brink of complete collapse and ruin... Now some people say that Gaydar is at fault, that Yeltsin is at fault, that they have destroyed the entire economy and the state. They saved it. It was the CPSU that had been destroying it. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] And what about the money that is flowing abroad--the money for natural resources, the people's wealth? [Shumeyko] And why do foreign investors not invest money in the Russian economy? They will not invest a kopek as long as they see that our own people open accounts abroad! And they do it because they have no idea how things will develop here. They allow for the possibility that the day may come when their money will be taken away and everything will return to the way it was. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Why can the government not earn credit for such confidence that our people would keep their money here and foreign investors would not mind investing in the Russian economy? [Shumeyko] You cannot change people overnight. The West looks at us the same way: Today one thing is happening, tomorrow--a different one, and the day after tomorrow--different again. When it stabilizes we will invest the money; no stability--even the rich compatriots will leave, together with families, and will live abroad. People are people; they simply do not believe. Since there is no accord in the country, there is no peace, no stabilization; so why should one keep his money here? [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Your charm gets you out of any adversity. But even in your life there have been situations when everything was against you. You are so smart--how could you get into a jam? [Shumeyko] I have certainly been through some. Especially with the Procuracy. I asked then to relieve me temporarily of my job so I could sort it out. I have never had a harder time in my life. When they brought a document to me and asked: "Is this your signature?" I said: "Mine."--"It is not a forgery?"--"No, it is my signature. But I have never put my signature on this text." The saddest part is that there is a number of documents against, for instance, Rutskoy, or myself, which has been made in the same place, at the order of the same people. This is the most depressing part. Because Rutskoy by himself had never been the person he became. We shape ourselves, and others, too--depending on how easy they are to shape. And history shapes us all. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] You are again in the presidium, and now before you is not a congress, not the former parliament, but essentially a small group of people--the Federation Council. Can accord be reached with them? [Shumeyko] Today it is the president who offers accord. And if the chief politician believes that Russia is ready for this accord, it is already indicative. He could not offer such a thing earlier. In the Federation Council we have politicians of high rank. Sixty-seven percent of them are people who have real authority. This accord is addressed to them today. Even the communist "branch" offered its text of accord for the sake of Russia. The president understands that there cannot be two or three accords. There can only be one. Either it is there or it is not. When Chernomyrdin came for the first time to the Federation Council, he said that the Japanese, when they were pulling out of economic backwardness, worked without a single day off, 12 hours a day. And the entire Federation Council applauded. It was seen that a watershed has been reached: Everybody understood that it was time, that we had to get to work. This is precisely that element of accord that showed in the emotions. This mood gave away all politicians: We are tired of it; let us find accord and begin working. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Former U.S. President Nixon says that Zhirinovskiy, with his demagoguery and rudeness, will never become president of Russia. Chubays says that Zhirinovskiy intends to become president by this fall. In your opinion, does he have a chance? [Shumeyko] Zhirinovskiy's style is not clownery--it is the theory of populism. Its meaning is that a person must proclaim himself in as shocking a way as possible, such as in a play staged by a talented director. People forget in a week what he said, but remember who said it. Try to recall everything and repeat it. You will not be able to. Both Gaydar and Chubays say that Zhirinovskiy brought fascism. In reality, Zhirinovskiy is a populist, not a fascist. The people who participated in elections were mostly pensioners. They could not vote for fascists. We do not have any families that have not suffered during the war. We are a great nation, and Russia, beginning with Ivan Kalita, always developed by expansion. Along the way of development, by absorbing peoples, confessions, cultures, it became an empire. Communists came and made use of this imperial theory. One-sixth of dry land--"the great, powerful Soviet Union." We were proud of it. We were all called Russians in the West, whether we were Tatars or Jews. And suddenly for the first time in its entire 1000-year history Russia has lost part of its territory. Russian people who found themselves outside of it became "Russian-speaking," a "national minority," or whatever else! The nation has experienced a psychological shock. And Zhirinovskiy very skillfully used it. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] You have spoken actively on the subject of a Eurasian Union. Is this a realization of a past mistake? In your opinion, is a union possible? [Shumeyko] It is possible, but not today. We began speaking of it in order to "test" this idea in the society. Life forces us to do it. There are many Russian-speaking people left outside of Russia. We propose to CIS countries to introduce dual citizenship. But if we can count on it, why do we need to erect borders between us and impose customs duties? We need a more rigid organization of what you call the Commonwealth. Why not step straight up to world level and create out of the CIS a Eurasian Union, a civilized union of countries aimed at meeting each others' interests?!
