FR940419-0-00079 FR940419-0-00019 We disagree. The clause as written clearly requires TCRR contractors to request approval prior to performing TAT type activities, regardless of whether another Federal agency or a private party issues the contract. A TCRR contractor is required to provide cleanup services on numerous sites within its respective geographic area and this work often involves work performed in ``emergency'' situations. It is vital that TCRR contractors be free of conflicts to perform work for the Agency. Therefore, it is necessary to require TCRR contractors to request approval before performing any TAT type activities for any other party within its respective geographic area that result from a CERCLA administrative order, a CERCLA or RCRA consent decree or a court order. 11. Alternate II (TAT) paragraph (d)(2)_Expand competition restriction. One commenter requested we delete the language ``Unless an individual design for the site has been prepared by a third party''. The commenter contended that any knowledge of a site is critical and a contractor having access to a site over a long period of time would be in a better position to plan and price for unforeseen contingencies. Therefore, this would be patently unfair to other contractors. We disagree. If the clause were to be modified as suggested, it would have the opposite effect by making the clause overly restrictive for contractors performing TAT work. Although such a contractor may have gained some knowledge about a site while working there, it would not necessarily be an unfair competitive advantage when a third party has prepared the design. 12. Alternate II (TAT) paragraph (d)(2)_Inability to plan future TAT work. One commenter suggested that this paragraph not include TAT work that a contractor plans to perform because contractors have no role in determining future TAT work and TAT work dealing with emergencies cannot be planned. We disagree. In many cases, TAT work is planned and advance site information is provided to contractors by EPA. Therefore, the final clause includes the requirement that a contractor shall not perform remedial construction work on a site where it has knowledge that it will be performing TAT work for EPA, unless otherwise authorized by the EPA Contracting Officer. 13. Alternate II (TAT) paragraph (d)(3)_Site specific limitations. One commenter suggested the restriction on TAT contractors be site specific rather than a restriction covering the entire zone. The commenter further stated that alternate zone contractors should be used if conflicts arise. We disagree. TAT contracts are established to provide TAT type activities, including TCRR oversight, on potentially all sites within the geographic area. If contractors perform work for PRPs on sites within the geographic area, and if EPA were to require oversight on these sites, EPA's ability to plan and promptly commence oversight work would be significantly impaired. Geographic crossovers are possible in a few unusual circumstances. However, the administrative cost and additional time associated with this process for a number of sites pose too large a risk to the effective operation of the TAT program. 14. Alternate III (ESAT)_LOFC applicability to ESAT. One commenter recommended we delete this Alternate since an LOFC clause is not appropriate for ESAT work. We disagree. This clause contains the limitation on future performance where the contractor develops the specifications or statement of work under a Superfund contract. This limitation is common to all Superfund contracts including ESAT.
