FR940803-0-00016 FR940803-0-00006 Under the agreement, the assessment rate for a particular crop year applies to all assessable tonnage handled from the beginning of such year (i.e., July 1). An annual budget of expenses is prepared by the Committee and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and producers of peanuts. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel for program operations and, thus, are in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets are formulated and discussed at industry-wide meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to provide input in recommending the budget, assessment rate, and indemnification reserve. The handlers of peanuts who are directly affected have signed the marketing agreement authorizing the expenses that may be incurred and the imposition of assessments. The assessment rate recommended by the Committee for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected receipts and acquisitions of farmers' stock peanuts. It applies to all assessable peanuts received or acquired by handlers from July 1, 1994. Because that rate is applied to actual receipts and acquisitions, it must be established at a rate which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. The Committee met on March 16, 1994, and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 crop year administrative expenses of $1,056,000 and an administrative assessment rate of $0.60 per net ton of assessable farmers' stock peanuts received or acquired by handlers. In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 crop year budgeted administrative expenditures were $1,020,000, and the administrative assessment rate was initially recommended and fixed at $0.60 per ton. Administrative budget items for 1994&hyph;95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Executive salaries, $140,146 ($134,304), clerical salaries, $132,500 ($127,479), field representatives salaries, $290,420 ($278,778), field representatives travel, $110,000 ($107,000), insurance and bonds, $8,500 ($7,500), and furniture and equipment, $9,500 ($4,000). Items which have decreased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Payroll taxes, $43,000 ($45,000), office rent and parking, $50,000 ($52,500), postage and mailing, $12,000 ($13,000), and audit fees, $9,200 ($9,500). All other items are budgeted at last year's amounts. The administrative budget includes $14,234 for contingencies ($4,439 last year). The Committee also unanimously recommended 1994 crop indemnification claims payments of up to $9,000,000 and an indemnification assessment of $2.00 per net ton of farmers' stock peanuts received or acquired by handlers to continue its indemnification program. The 1993&hyph;94 crop year indemnification assessment was $1.00 per net ton. Because of the high number of claims being processed during the 1993&hyph;94 crop year, the Committee recommended a higher assessment rate so that sufficient reserve funds will be available. The $9,000,000 of indemnification claims coverage to be provided on 1994 crop peanuts includes $5,000,000 in excess loss insurance to be purchased by the Committee_the same as last year. The cost of the indemnification insurance premium and the costs to carry out indemnification procedures (sampling and testing of 2&hyph;AB and 3&hyph;AB Subsamples, and crushing supervision, of indemnified peanuts, pursuant to ยง998.200(c)), are additional indemnification costs which must be authorized and paid from available indemnification funds. Such costs are not expected to exceed $2,000,000. The total assessment rate is $2.60 per ton of assessable peanuts ($0.60 for administrative and $2.00 for indemnification). Assessments are due on the 15th of the month following the month in which the farmers' stock peanuts are received or acquired. Application of the recommended rates to the estimated assessable tonnage of 1,760,000 will yield $1,056,000 for program administration and $3,520,000 for indemnification. The indemnification amount, when added to expected cash carry over from 1993&hyph;94 indemnification operations of $12,609,100, will provide $16,129,100, which should be adequate for the 1994 fund, and to maintain an adequate reserve.
