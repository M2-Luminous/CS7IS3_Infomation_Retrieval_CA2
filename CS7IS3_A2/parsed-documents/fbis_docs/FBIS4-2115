FBIS4-2115 "drchi066_r_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-066 Daily Report 17 Mar 1994 North Region Work Report of Hebei Provincial Court Work Report of Hebei Provincial Court SK0304070094 Shijiazhuang HEBEI RIBAO in Chinese 17 Mar 94 p 2 SK0304070094 Shijiazhuang HEBEI RIBAO Chinese BFN [Work report of the Hebei Provincial Higher People's Court delivered by Ping Yijie, president of the provincial higher people's court, at the second session of the eighth provincial people's congress on 1 March] [Text] Fellow deputies: I will now present a report to this session on the major work carried out by the people's court in 1993. In 1993, people's courts at all levels in the province, under the leadership of party committees and the supervision of people's congresses and with the support of pertinent government departments, persistently took Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guide, conscientiously implemented the party's basic line consisting of "one central task and two basic points," faithfully enforced the Constitution and laws, carried out judicial work in an all-around manner focusing on strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, opposing corruption, and safeguarding social stability, and fulfilled the various judicial tasks fairly successfully. In the past year, they concluded 191,013 cases in first and second trials and judicial supervision cases, which showed an increase of 15.92 percent over the preceding year. Of the total, 20,201 were criminal cases, 123,605 were civil cases, 45,445 were cases on economic disputes, and 1,762 were administrative cases. The judicial work of the people's courts played a positive role in safeguarding social stability, protecting the legal rights and interests of citizens and legal persons, and promoting reform, opening up, and economic construction. 1. We sternly cracked down on serious criminal offenses to safeguard social stability. Last year, people's courts at all levels in the province continued to implement the principle of meting out strict and prompt punishment according to the law to strictly crack down on criminal elements endangering public security. They handled 17,969 criminals cases of first trial in the year, and concluded 17,204 cases, or 95.74 percent of them. Judgments on 9,561 cases came into legal effect, and 14,691 persons were sentenced. To penetratingly promote the struggle to "deal strict blows," the provincial court, beginning early last year, made overall arrangements for all the courts in the province to carry out this struggle and then sent working groups to conduct investigations and study on how work had been done. In August, it held a work conference on strictly cracking down on serious criminal offenses and production and marketing of fake and inferior goods. Focusing on the priorities of the crackdown, people's courts at all levels added impetus to resolutely and sternly punish according to law, criminals with serious offenses, such as murder, robbery, rape, hooliganism, arson, bombing, and serious theft, especially habitual and repeat offenders, offenders on the move, and chief criminals of criminals rings. Meanwhile, in view of the public security situation of their own localities, all courts closely coordinated with public security and procuratorial organs to actively wage struggles against theft and timely special struggles against bus and train marauding and waylaying, damage of power equipment, kidnapping, abduction, and trade of women and children, and production and marketing of fake and inferior products. Courts in the province concluded 6,718 cases which seriously endangered public security and punished 7,894 criminals, showing an increase of 1.58 and 3.18 percentage points, respectively, over the preceding year. Criminals guilty of the most heinous crimes were resolutely sentenced to death. In order to accelerate the rate of handling cases, timely and effective blows were dealt to serious criminal offenses. Courts at all levels continued to uphold the effective method of intervening in the cases earlier than schedule, found out the situation of major cases that were brought to court for prosecution beforehand, discovered problems, offered suggestions in a timely manner, and avoided repeating procedures in handling cases. After the cases were brought to courts for prosecution, they deployed the judicial force scientifically, assigned cases to individuals as quickly as possible, read the cases conscientiously, handled them locally, and rapidly ended the cases on the premise of clarifying the basic facts and grasping the basic evidence, and realistically guaranteeing the quality of handling cases. Last year, of the cases accepted by courts for public prosecution, excepting the small number of complicated cases whose time for trial was extended, over 97 percent were completed within the legal time limit. To expand the social effect of handling cases, courts in all localities paid attention to selecting major and typical cases, and went deeply to places where the cases occurred to conduct public trials, to promote the legal system, to frighten the criminals, and to educate the masses. Last year, courts across the province held 531 open trials to try 2,161 cases involving 3,425 criminals, with nearly 8 million people listening to the trials. Particularly, during the "4th May" and "1st October" periods and before New Year, the provincial court organized courts across the province to conduct activities on dealing blows to criminals in a concentrated manner. Courts in all localities made careful plans and arrangements, successively held large-scale public trials, extensively conducted propaganda through television, broadcast, and press media, dampened the arrogance of criminals, and showed up the strength of the people's democratic dictatorship. Criminal offenses comprehensively reflect all kinds of passive factors. To solve public security problems, we must mobilize all social forces to participate in the comprehensive management of public security. While punishing criminals and doing a good job in trying civil, economic, and administrative cases, the people's courts at all levels actively participated in comprehensive management of public security through various means. First, they conscientiously tried cases on delinquents. Courts at all levels across the province established collegiate benches for trying cases involving delinquents, and some courts also established special tribunals to try this category of cases, educated delinquents through trials, paid attention to establishing relations with families and schools, implemented all measures to help and educate delinquents, and succeeded in educating, helping, and saving misguided youths. Second, they maintained close ties with grass- roots mediation organs, promptly grasped the symptoms of disputes, caught up with the work on their own initiative, resolved the contradictions during the budding stage, and prevented contradictions from turning into crimes. Last year courts across the province resolved a total of 1,993 contradictions of this category. Meanwhile, they strengthened the professional guidance for mediators and helped them enhance the ability to settle disputes. Third, in line with the problems that emerged in the course of trials, they offered judicial suggestions for relevant units in a timely manner, urged them to stop the loopholes, improved system, strengthened management, and took preventive measures. Last year courts across the province offered a total of 4,869 judicial suggestions. Fourth, they monitored the acts of criminals under probation or control so as to help and educate them, purposefully transformed them through education, and urged them to turn over a new leaf and to start a new life. Fifth, they coordinated with the reform-through-labor departments to transform and educate criminals serving their prison term, and determined the reduction of prison terms or release on parole of criminals who showed repentance or made contributions in line with the reports of the reform-through-labor departments in an effort to promote the transformation of criminals. 2. We strictly punished and handled the serious economic criminals and promoted the thorough development of the struggle against corruption. Crimes in the economic field and particularly those committed by state functionaries embezzling public funds by taking advantage of power and position and accepting bribes seriously broke the socialist economic order and damaged the relationship between the party and the people. In order to deal blows to crimes, to punish and prevent the corrupt, and to implement the demand set by the central authorities with regard to scoring periodical achievements in this regard in the near future; the people's courts at all levels throughout the province tried and handled a large number of serious economic criminals by earnestly implementing the guideline of strictly punishing and handling criminals in line with the law and the principle of "first being resolute, second cautious, and third accurate in handling criminals." They accepted 1,921 cases in 1993, tried and wound up 1,804 cases, and sentenced 1,947 economic convicts. Of these criminals, 335 had more than 10,000 yuan of illegal gains and 30 had more than 100,000 yuan of illegal gains. Through trials these courts recovered 13.96 million yuan of economic losses for the state and collectives. In dealing blows to economic crimes, the people's courts at all levels grasped the trial of serious and appalling cases; realistically enhanced leadership over the trial; and made careful arrangements for the trial. The first leading personnel of these courts took personal charge of the trial, paid attention to grasping the progress of the administration of justice, and frequently conducted inspection and supervision. They also studied and dealt with the problems and difficulties cropping up in the administration of justice and encouraged or supported the personnel in charge of trials to uphold the principles, to eliminate the interference, and to do things strictly in line with the law. Meanwhile, the report system for serious and appalling cases was established and the responsibility system for personnel in charge of trials was improved or implemented. Based on clarifying the base number and in making backbone personnel arrangements for trials, these courts fixed the specific assignment of personnel for trials; fixed the number of cases for judges; and fixed the date for winding up cases in order to try and to wind up the cases as soon as possible. To ensure the quality of the administration of justice and to deal sure, accurate, and relentless blows at economic crimes, the people's courts at all levels successfully made strict checks on facts and evidences and accurately and adequately applied the law. They paid special attention to setting up a demarcation line between economic crimes and the general violation acts cropping up in reform, opening up, and the establishment of socialist market economic systems. They also carefully handled the cases whose crimes are not clearly covered by the regulations of the law and policies so as to truly enable their trials to play a role of dealing blows to crimes, protecting reform, and punishing or preventing the corrupt. In addition, the people's courts at all levels paid attention to reinforcing the dynamics in the propaganda work and selected the serious and appalling cases that have a typical significance to broaden the social effect by holding open trials. In October 1993, the provincial higher people's court dispatched five work teams to respectively go to various prefectures and cities to carry out investigation and study and to supervise them to handle the serious and appalling cases. The people's court of various localities concentrated their time and efforts and took unified action in holding open trials for economic crimes. Last November, the provincial higher people's court and some intermediate courts, respectively, held press briefings to disclose their handling of serious and appalling economic cases, during which they vigorously built up a momentum; revealed with their practical deeds the determination made by the central authorities and the provincial party committee in punishing and preventing the corrupt; and played an active role in promoting the through development of the struggle against corruption. Difficulties encountered in investigating and handling the economic cases were large and time spent on investigating and handling these cases was long. The number of economic cases that were prosecuted in the court showed a 21.91 percent decrease compared to 1992. Along with the through struggle against corruption, some economic crimes are successively being exposed, investigated, and handled. Cases that will be prosecuted in the court will increase. Punishing or handling economic criminals and particularly trying the serious and appalling economic cases will become an important and protracted task. 3. We comprehensively strengthened the trial of the economic cases and the fulfillment of the tasks to serve the macroeconomic regulation and control and the development of the economy. Along with the far-reaching progress of reform, opening up, and economic construction, various categories of economic dispute cases rose by a big margin. Thus, the people's courts at various levels increasingly undertake heavier tasks for trying economic cases. Last year, the courts across the province conducted first trials on 45,251 economic dispute cases, an increase of 44.09 percent compared to the previous year; and concluded 42,723 cases, an increase of 45.46 percent. Some 2.245 billion yuan were involved in the lawsuits, an increase of 20.69 percent. The people's courts at various levels ceaselessly intensified the awareness of conscious and active services; and accurately handled the relations between active service and strict enforcement of laws, between basing themselves on trials and expanding the scale of service, and between legal standards and productive force standards. By trying and handling a large number of economic disputes and offering various forms of lawsuit services, the people's courts ensured the smooth implementation of the measures for regulating the economic relations, safeguarding the economic order, and ensuring macroeconomic regulation and control. First, the people's courts persistently placed on file, prudently handled, and rapidly concluded the cases concerning the disputes over loans that took place in the course of rectifying the financial order, clearing up unreasonable loans, and violating regulations to use inter-bank loans; the cases concerning the collective economic disputes that cropped up by straightening out the problems of wantonly collecting funds and wantonly issuing enterprise bonds; and various categories of cases that were closely related to the enhancement of the macroeconomic regulation and control. In line with the situation that the financial departments' failure to withdraw larger amounts of loans affected the turnover of capital, the people's courts actively worked in cooperation with the financial departments to extensively disseminate laws and policies to enable the debtors actively return their loan, brought their trial functions into play, conscientiously examined and handled the disputes over loan contracts, and helped withdraw the overdue loans according to laws. Last year, the courts concluded 15,556 cases of this category, and 765 million yuan were involved in the lawsuits. Second, the people's courts timely and appropriately accepted and handled the cases of the disputes over purchasing and marketing, processing on a contracted basis, transfer of techniques, and management on a leasing basis so as to help enterprises promote the deepening of reform and the development of production. Last year, the courts at various levels concluded 13,792 cases of this category. The courts at various levels positively helped enterprises clear up "debt chains" so that enterprises could free themselves from the debt chains as soon as possible and enhance their development vitality. The people's courts first examined and handled the major cases involving larger amounts of money and seriously affecting the production and management of enterprises, particularly the cases relating to the state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises so as to have the enterprises be extricated from the strained circumstances and restore vitality. At the time when enterprises cooperated with one another for management, amalgamated with others, and declared bankruptcy, they timely applied legal means to help sort out property and clear up debts so as to promote the readjustment of the industrial structure and the change of the enterprise managerial mechanism. Third, they positively and steadily handled various categories of disputes over rural contracts and served the rural areas' social stability and economic development. By examining and handling 1,989 cases relating to the disputes over rural contracts, particularly the disputes over contracts for fruit gardens and mountain forests, that had the symptoms to intensify the contradictions, that would easily cause the collectives to make visits, and that would easily affect the stability of society, the courts at various levels persistently relied on the support of the local party committees, people's congress, and governments to positively persuade the persons concerned and timely and prudently examined and handled their cases according to the laws. Fourth, people's courts at all levels adopted various measures to provide legal service to economic development. Last year, they established "economic dispute mediating centers" to resolve economic disputes speedily with simple methods. Many courts established ties with enterprises and conducted investigation and study at enterprises on a regular basis to help amend and improve economic contracts and to help enterprises train law personnel through training classes and by using certain cases to explain laws. In this way, they carried out positive work to prevent and reduce economic disputes. Difficulty in executing the judgments remained a conspicuous problem in the work of the people's courts and also a "notorious problem" about which various circles of society had many complaints. To safeguard the authority of the judgments and the sanctity of laws, courts all levels established and improved the executive organs, replenished the executive personnel, and overcame numerous difficulties to greatly strengthen the execution of judgments. Courts in the province handled 52,222 cases concerning the execution of judgments, and judgments on 46,866 cases, or 89.74 percent, were executed, which involved 490 million yuan. In executing the judgments, courts at all levels firmly embraced the idea of service; paid attention to properly handling the relations between executing the judgments and supporting the survival and development of enterprises and the relations between executing the judgments according to law and stabilizing the overall situation; kept social effect in mind when executing judgments according to law and with civility; analyzed cases in a specific manner; and treated different cases with different measures. Those capable of repaying debts but refused to do so were forced to repay according to law; those who refused to repay debts and whose activities obstructed public affairs and constituted crimes had their criminal liabilities pursued according to law; and enterprises which were unable to repay debts for the time being but had development prospects were helped to increase vigor and enhance capacity instead of "having their geese that laid golden eggs killed" so that they would make profits to repay debts. In view of the practice of making no distinction between trials and execution of judgments, wanton execution of judgments, and wanton arrests of people, the provincial court held two telephone conferences to emphasize the need to check law breaches in the executive work and act strictly according to law. Following the guidelines of the conferences, courts in all localities earnestly made corrections, strengthened management, and further established and improved various rules and systems to reinforce the mechanisms for restraint and supervision. To promote the judicial cooperation with the courts of other provinces and municipalities, eliminate the interference of local protectionism, and maintain the unity of the legal system, the provincial court signed an agreement on judicial cooperation with the seven neighboring provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in 1991 and attended in September 1993 a symposium on cooperation in courts' executive work attended by Hunan and 15 other provinces, municipalities, and regions, thus strengthening judicial cooperation on a larger scale and alleviating, to a certain extent, the difficulty in executing judgments in other localities. Last year, Hebei's courts were entrusted by the courts of other provinces, municipalities, and regions or to execute or to help them execute the judgments of 854 cases involving 58.71 million yuan. Courts of other provinces, municipalities, and regions were entrusted by Hebei's courts to execute or to help them execute the judgments on 406 cases involving 43.54 million yuan. Thanks to the unremitting efforts, people's courts made substantial progress in the execution of judgments. However, they still encountered great difficulties. In particular, when executing the judgments on economic disputes that involved different administrative areas, cadres and policemen of courts were frequently attacked and beaten, and sometimes even their lives were not guaranteed. To realistically and effectively safeguard the sanctity of laws, people's courts should continue efforts to improve work and raise their judicial level, and all circles of society should also provide more understanding, support, assistance, and coordination. 4. We conscientiously tried civil and administrative cases and realistically safeguarded the legal rights and interests of citizens, legal entities, and other organizations. In 1993, courts across the province accepted 121,642 civil cases for first trial, an increase of 14.46 percent over the previous year, and concluded 116,165 cases, an increase of 15.15 percent over the previous year. The number of civil cases was big and was increasing every year. Last year civil cases accepted by courts across the province for first trial accounted for over 65 percent of the total number of cases accepted by the courts, making the judicial tasks very heavy. This kind of cases involved many families and were closely related with the production and living of the people. Particularly, it is very meaningful to handle these cases well in the situation of establishing the socialist market economic structure. Courts at all levels conscientiously implemented the "general rules of civil codes," the "law on civil administrative procedures," and all kinds of other civil laws and regulations. Through trying 57,719 cases on marriage and inheritance, they safeguarded social stability and family harmony, promoted socialist morality and practice, and promoted socialist spiritual civilization; and by trying 42,822 cases on disputes concerning debts, mountain forests, land, and water conservancy, they regulated the relations of various rural economic sectors and promoted the development of rural economy; and by trying 8,907 cases on compensation for damages, intellectual property rights, and labor disputes, meted out punishment for civil law-breaking acts and safeguarded the legal rights and interests of the persons concerned. In the course of handling cases, courts at all levels strictly filed cases for investigation, opened court sessions, confronted the accused with his accusers, conducted debates, and handled other aspects of work in line with legal procedures. They conscientiously implemented the principle of settling civil cases on a voluntary and legal basis, mediated civil disputes, and urged the persons concerned to conclude an agreement on the basis of consultation on an equal term and mutual understanding. Last year courts across the province mediated and concluded 74,531 cases, accounting for 64.16 percent of the total number of concluded civil cases. Meanwhile, they unceasingly summed up experiences in trials, reformed the form of trying cases at courts, stressed the responsibility of persons concerned to give evidence, guaranteed the quality of handling cases, and enhanced the rate of handling cases. Furthermore, the broad masses of civil judicial cadres also exerted efforts to improve work style, often toured the rural areas to handle cases, and in addition to concluding a great number of civil cases, also handled 7,969 easy cases on disputes, reduced the accumulated number of lawsuits from the masses, and stabilized social order. During trial of administrative cases, courts at all levels conscientiously implemented the "law on administrative procedures," and other administrative laws and regulations, upheld the principle of allowing persons concerned to have equal status in taking lawsuits, safeguarded the legal rights and interests of citizens, legal entities, and other organizations, and supervised and supported administrative organs to exercise their powers in line with the law. In order to implement the central directives on reducing the burdens of peasants, courts at all levels actively accepted cases on adding burdens to peasants, such as unwarranted pooling of funds and arbitrary collection of donations of fees, involving administrative organs, accelerated the trials, and paid attention to the social effect while handling cases. Last year, courts across the province accepted 1,463 administrative cases for first trial and concluded 1,384 cases. Of the concluded administrative cases, the adjudication of 399 cases made by administrative organs were maintained, accounting for 28.83 percent, that of 279 cases were canceled, accounting for 20.16 percent; and the lawsuits of 489 cases were canceled, accounting for 35.33 percent. While properly handling all sorts of administrative disputes, courts at all levels also actively helped administrative organs train administrative law enforcing cadres, visited administrative organs on their own initiative, jointly analyzed the reasons for winning or losing the lawsuits in line with the cases, studied and resolved all problems which they met in the course of enforcing administrative law, offered judicial suggestions, and enabled administrative organs to perform their work in line with the law. Some courts also established special collegiate benches to handle land and traffic cases in line with the local reality, and in addition to handling administrative cases, also went regularly to administrative organs to give all kinds of legal services. 5. We made efforts to supervise lawsuits, appeals, and trials; safeguarded, according to the law, the persons' relevant legal rights; and upgraded judicial quality. To ensure the quality of the cases to be handled, upgrade the judicial quality, and ensure fair judgments, the courts at various levels vigorously strengthened the supervision of lawsuits, appeals, and trials. Last year, the courts at various levels accepted 84,624 visitors, handled 25,426 incoming letters from the masses, and concluded 3,021 cases of various categories under judicial supervision. The intermediate and higher courts concluded 10,516 cases of various categories in second trials. First, they firmly attended to the lawsuit work; made efforts to eliminate the masses' difficulties in bringing lawsuits; timely placed, according to laws, on file the lawsuits lodged by the persons concerned and that conformed to the laws and regulations; and delivered, according to the principle of "separating the placement of files from trials," the lawsuits to the relevant judicial organs for examination and handling. As for the lawsuits without legal conditions for being placed on file and those that were not managed by the courts, they also conscientiously assumed responsibility to make explanations and positively helped the persons concerned solve their difficulties. Simultaneously, they regarded the acceptance of visitors and the handling of incoming letters from the masses as a window to establish contacts with the masses and to discover problems and made efforts to improve their work according to the masses' opinions and suggestions. Second, according to the principle of seeking truth from facts and correcting mistakes, they conscientiously examined and handled the relevant persons' appeals and applications for retrial and the procuratorial organs' protests, actively examined the judgments that became effective, and corrected the wrong judgments according to the judicial supervision procedures. Last year, the courts across the province corrected the wrong judgments on 624 cases, patiently had those who lodged unreasonable lawsuits withdraw their lawsuits, and adopted forceful measures against those who willfully made troubles and affected the social stability. The courts at various levels focused their efforts on handling the appeals lodged by the aged. The provincial court regularly sent personnel to the Supreme People's Court to understand the situation of the old visitors in the province and worked in cooperation with the lower-level courts to study and work out methods for solving their problems one after another. Last year, the number of visitors delivering appeals to the courts was reduced by 27.97 percent from the previous year. Third, as for the appeals lodged by the persons concerned who had complaints about the first trials and the protests made by the procuratorial organs, the second-trial courts comprehensively and conscientiously examined the facts, evidences, and legal means that had been applied during the first trials; and handled the appeals according to laws. Of the second-trial cases concluded by the provincial court and various intermediate courts last year, 5,022 cases maintained the original judgments, 1,786 judgments were corrected, and 1,390 cases were reexamined. 6. We achieved the self-construction, strengthened scientific management, and ensured the smooth progress of the trial work. Over the past year, the people's courts at various levels made efforts to achieve their self-construction in the spirit of reform, ceaselessly strengthened scientific management, improved the law enforcement environment, ensured the strict enforcement of laws, and laid a foundation for smoothly accomplishing various trial tasks. A. The people's courts conscientiously strengthened the ideological work and upgraded the political quality of the cadres and policemen. The courts at various levels organized cadres and policemen to conscientiously study the documents of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, the guidelines of the second plenary session of the central discipline inspection commission, and the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping;" persistently armed the heads of the cadres and policemen with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics; ideologically and practically acted in unison with the party Central Committee; and made the trial work not be divorced from the political orientation. They regularly conducted the education on the party's line and purpose, the outlook on life, the outlook on value; resolutely resisted the influence of money worship, hedonism, and out-and-out egoism; conducted the education on the party's fine traditions and work styles, including the arduous struggle and the mass line; kept close contacts with the masses; firmly fostered the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly; conducted the education on the party discipline and regulations and the state laws; ceaselessly enhanced the senses of party spirit, discipline, and legal system; and resolutely safeguarded the unity and dignity of the party discipline, the political decree, and the laws. By conducting the education of multiple categories, we enabled the broad masses of cadres and policemen to further upgrade their understanding on the position and role of the people's courts in the course of establishing the systems of socialist market economy and to enhance their sense of historic mission and political responsibility. Their quality in political affairs was continuously being upgraded. Cadres and policemen in the people's courts throughout the province have scored a large number of moving deeds over the past year by overcoming difficulties, being cautious and conscientious, and selflessly making contributions. There were 510 units and 3,156 cadres and policemen who were appraised as advanced collectives and workers or were conferred with citations and prizes. The Dingzhou city people's court and the Fengnan county people's court were gloriously commended by the Supreme People's Court with the Merit Citation Class I. B. We did a good job in grasping the professional study and conducting guidance over our subordinate courts and upgraded the professional quality of cadres and policemen. The people's courts at all levels actively encouraged and supported cadres and policemen to study various laws and policies and to particularly study the newly issued laws, regulations, and rules, as well as the relevant policies of the market economy so as to enable them to meet the demand of a new situation and to better serve the economic construction. On the one hand, they unswervingly and successfully conducted the education on the legal courses in universities and in specialized institutions; and adopted various styles, such as holding professional training classes and conducting mobile lectures for cadres and policemen, on the other hand. They also upgraded step by step the specialized professional level of cadres and policemen in the people's courts on a long-term basis and in a planned manner. In the second half of 1993, the provincial higher people's court assigned its judicial officers in charge of economic cases, who had had experience gained from judicial practice and known well the legal affairs, to hold 55 mobile lectures across the province on the practical problems cropping up in the trials of economic cases. Almost 2,000 cadres attended the lectures. To further upgrade the judicial level and to ensure the quality of handling cases, higher people's courts vigorously enhanced their professional guidance over their subordinate courts. They adopted the method of "going down to low-level units and inviting the low- level personnel" to jointly hold discussion and consultation on handling serious, appalling, and knotty cases. They also further perfected the systems of asking for instruction and making reports, exchanged their work situation in a timely manner, summarized their work experience, and formulated the standardized opinions for trials in line with the judicial reality. Based on the deep-going investigation and study, the provincial higher people's court put forward the guiding opinions in 1993 for handling the death penalty cases; for setting up demarcation lines among different economic cases; and for handling the traffic accidents cases as well as the disputes over house lighting, over the compensation of medical faults, and over real estate. It also promoted the upgrading of quality and efficiency in handling cases by having standardized the judicial activities. C. We realistically enhanced the construction of leading bodies and promoted the development of court work in various fields. Over the past year, we have grasped the construction of leading bodies of the people's courts at all levels by regarding the construction as a strategic measure. We have also urged the leading personnel of people's courts at all levels to set example in studying the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the theory of socialist market economy and in opposing to corruption and protecting the administrative honesty, to change their work style, to industriously conduct the administrative work for the people, and to be a good public servant. The leading personnel were urged to uphold the principle of democratic centralism and the staffers of leading bodies were urged to respect, support, and understand one another as well as to foster a joint force. Leading bodies were also urged to be responsible for their subordinate units, to set an example for them, and to bring along them in work. In 1993 the provincial higher people's court held a two-month training class of specialized legal knowledge for the presidents of grass-roots level courts, who were newly elected during the term-shift election. The class has laid a foundation for further and successfully conducting the court work at grass-roots levels. After the combination conducted between 12 prefectures and cities across the province in the second half of 1993, the provincial higher people's court actively helped and coordinated with local party committees to complete the work for combination. It made all-out efforts to grasp unity among new leading bodies and to promote work link after the combination as well as stressed that coordination among personnel even requires the thinking with one heart and one mind. After the combination, the leading bodies of intermediate people's courts successfully fulfilled the various tasks of trials by making concerted efforts and cooperating with one another. D. We firmly and unswervingly maintained administrative honesty, opposed corruption, and strictly enforced laws. The provincial court positively consolidated and straightened itself out in line with the opinions and suggestions raised by people's congress deputies in the activities of appraising the work of the provincial court that was organized by the provincial people's congress standing committee in 1992. Courts at all levels conscientiously implemented the "eight forbiddens" set by the Supreme People's Court and the "10 regulations" formulated by the provincial court, constantly perfected the system concerning administrative honesty, strengthened the self-restriction mechanism and the external supervision mechanism, subjected the court work to the supervision by the numerous masses, and strived to maintain administrative honesty and strictly enforce laws. In line with the arrangements of the provincial party committee and the Supreme People's Court, the provincial court waged a struggle against corruption, banned court departments from collecting 12 items of unreasonable charges and from pooling funds to do business or run enterprises, and strictly punished the cadres and policemen who violated laws and disciplines. In the fourth quarter, the provincial court conducted a general inspection on enforcement of laws and disciplines and launched the activities of "lower levels appraising higher levels." During the activities, various courts at the grass-roots level appraised the work of intermediate courts, and grass-roots courts and intermediate courts appraised the work of the provincial court. At the same time, leaders of higher-level courts led work teams to go deep into various localities to inspect their work and solicit opinions. The provincial court received a total of 36 opinions and suggestions from lower-level courts, researched these opinions and suggestions one by one, earnestly conducted rectification and correction, and answered and resolved all questions and cases. E. We paid attention to self-construction, strengthened scientific management, and improved law enforcing environment. Courts at all levels, within the scope permitted by laws and policies, carried out reform boldly, realistically, and carefully. First, we positively pressed forward the reforms in the fields of organizational setup, rules and systems, and work methods of courts, thus making organizational setup perfect, the relations between different sectors reasonable, tasks definite, and work efficiency better. The provincial court was making efforts to organize and build the second judicial tribunal, conducted the service other than legal proceedings through diverse channels in the course of fulfilling the judicial tasks, vigorously strengthened the guidance to lower levels, and further promoted the trying of economic cases among all courts. Second, we reformed and perfected the form of opening court sessions to try cases, standardized the procedures of opening court sessions to try cases, better exploited the functional role of collegiate bench, and stressed the evidence providing responsibility of the parties involved in civil and economic cases. At the same time, we conducted positive explorations and experiments for separating registration from trying of cases and for separating adjudication from execution. Third, we perfected work systems of the economic disputes mediation center, such as the system with regard to registration and mediation of cases and the system with regard to collection of fees, defined the nature and duties of the center, strictly executed the relevant regulations on civil procedures law. Fourth, we straightened out the tribunals and law execution agencies stationed at administrative organs, clarified boundaries between the judicial power and the administrative power, prevented judicial personnel from participating in administrative behaviors beyond their powers, and also prevented administrative personnel from holding judicial posts in order to ensure the independent execution of judicial powers by people's courts. In the course of building themselves well, courts at all levels strengthened scientific management by tapping their own potentials, and strived to seek better efficiency and higher level from scientific management. In the field of material construction, courts at all levels carried forward the fine tradition of arduous struggle, tried every possible means to overcome difficulties, and made new progress in building judicial courts and people's courts and in building traffic, communications, and equipment installations. In addition, courts at all levels strengthened the judgment by legal medical experts, investigation and study, and file management, thus creating conditions for improving the level of adjudication. Hebei's courts scored fairly good achievements in 1993, which, however, should be attributed to the leadership of party committees, the supervision of people's congresses, the support of pertinent government departments, and the concerted efforts of their cadres and policemen. There were also problems and deficiencies in our work. The major ones were the failure in fully suiting our thinking and concepts to the new situation in the socialist market economy system and the failure in fully performing our functions to serve reform, opening up, and economic construction; some localities' failure in strictly enforcing laws, making fair judgments, and handling cases in a timely manner; and the problems in law-enforcement conditions that need to be further improved and the funds for handling cases that need to be guaranteed with intensified measures so that a good environment can be created for law enforcement. Fellow deputies, 1994 is a crucial year for promoting the package reform of the economic structure and making breakthroughs in key areas. Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability constitute the overall interests of the work of the entire party. The new situation has set new and still higher demands on the work of people's courts, which, in summary, are to create momentum in "dealing strict blows," to achieve good results in handling major and serious cases, to make substantial progress in regulating economic relations, and to comprehensively raise the judicial level. In compliance with the requirements of the party Central Committee, the provincial party committee, and the Supreme People's Court, the basic tasks for the people's courts in 1994 are, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, to continue dealing strict blows to serious criminal offenses, to do a better job in trying major and serious cases, especially major and serious economic cases, to greatly regulating economic relations, to conscientiously safeguard the legal rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations, to strictly enforce laws, to raise judicial level, and to serve the endeavors of safeguarding social stability, promoting administrative honesty, and establishing the socialist market economy system more rapidly. To fulfill these tasks, we should achieve success particularly in the following work: First, we should strictly crack down on the criminal offenses that endanger state safety and social security to safeguard state and social stability. Courts at all levels should profoundly understand the strategic idea of "attending to two tasks simultaneously and being competent in both," further strengthen the function of dictatorship over enemies, and resolutely punish the criminals who seriously endanger state security. We should adhere to the principle of meting out stern and prompt punishments to continue the struggle of "dealing strict blows," clarify the focuses of attack, and wage special struggles at opportune times and concentrate efforts on the crackdown of certain crimes to create momentum and achieve notable social effect. Meanwhile, we should actively participate in the comprehensive management of public security. Second, we should continue cracking down on serious economic offenses to promote honesty in administration. Focusing on punishing corruption and bribery, we should sternly punish criminals with serious economic offenses to promote the in-depth development of the anticorruption struggle. We should muster efforts and organize meticulously to achieve a breakthrough in trying major and serious cases. Third, we should regulate the relations in various economic sectors in line with law and promote the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. We should fully apply the judicial means, serve the cultivation and development of the market economic structure, promote the establishment of the modern enterprise system, protect the decisionmaking rights of enterprises in line with the law, safeguard the responsibility system with the family-based output-related contract responsibility system as the mainstay, and promote comprehensive economic invigoration in the rural areas. We should pay great attention to investigating and handling new cases involving foreign countries, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan emerging in the course of deepening reform of the economic structure and strive to make new breakthroughs in economic trails. Fourth, we should give full play to the functions of courts in civil and administrative trails and realistically safeguard the legal rights and interests of citizens, legal entities, and other organizations. It is necessary to properly handle the internal contradictions among the people, promote stability, unity, and the building of socialist spiritual civilization. Fifth, we should strictly enforce the law and raise the level of judicial work. We should uphold the principle of independently exercising judicial rights, based on facts, and taking law as the criterion under the leadership of the party committee, strengthen judicial supervision, strictly enforce judicial discipline, and conscientiously implement the responsibility system in handling cases and reinvestigating wrong cases. It is necessary to actively accept supervision from the people's congresses at all levels, unceasingly improve law enforcing activities, and raise the level of judicial work. Sixth, we should unceasingly sum up experience and deepen reform in courts. With the spirit of emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, making experiments actively, and advancing steadily, we should follow the legal principles, principles that are conducive to unifying the legal system, the principle of making things convenient for the masses to make lawsuits and to bring the cases to courts for trial, and the principle of safeguarding the legal rights and interests of the people concerned, and continue to grasp reform in line with the characteristics of courts. We should actively strengthen grassroots courts, particularly the work and building of people's courts, give full play to their role of being close to the masses and making things convenient for them to make lawsuits, discover and settle disputes in a timely manner, safeguarded social stability, and accelerate the pace of serving economic development. Seventh, we should strengthen the contingents and raise the political and professional level of cadres and policemen. Further efforts should be made to strengthen the study of political theories, deepen the anticorruption struggle, and resolutely check unhealthy trends among courts. We should do a good job in improving the ideology and work style of court leading bodies at all levels, and enable them to become a strong core of leadership with high political awareness, good work, and good work style. With a strategic insight, we should continue to grasp the education and training of cadres, enhance the integrated professional quality of court cadres and policemen across the province and pay attention to cultivating a number of judicial officers specializing in the work of this field so as to meet the needs of the development of situation. Deputies, in the new situation of establishing the socialist market economic structure, people's courts have to undertake more arduous tasks and heavier responsibilities. We must further emancipate the mind under the leadership of the party committees and the supervision of the people's congresses, renew concepts, unite as one, work hard, give better play to the functional role of judicial organs, and make greater contributions to maintaining social stability in our province, guaranteeing reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and building an economically strong province.
