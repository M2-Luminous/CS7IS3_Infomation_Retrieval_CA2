On the sidelines of a Free Democratic Party conference in Hanover today, Kinkel said the German Government was grateful to Owen for his "untiring efforts." It has great regard for Owen's commitment and his unremitting endeavors. His work did not deserve the current negative criticism. Kinkel added that in this immensely difficult and complicated situation, it is much easier to criticize than to do it better.
