Three bodies were found last Saturday, and some 20 others were found on Sunday and Monday morning. The bodies, which were in an advanced state of decomposition as they had been in the water and the region's usual heat, were buried so the their exact number is difficult to determine. The first account made available on Monday morning by the private station Radio Metropole reported that at least four persons were killed but added that the number of victims could be greater because police were firing on fishing boats. [passage omitted] Numerous frightened residents of Raboteau abandoned the neighborhood and moved to other parts of the city. So far there has been no official confirmation of the incident, the most serious to take place in the provinces recently.
