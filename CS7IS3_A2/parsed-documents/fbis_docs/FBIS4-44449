It is also an impending requirement we have to meet in order to fulfill our tasks under the present circumstances. The present economic situation, on the whole, is excellent in our province. Economic development has embarked on the "expressway." Since spring this year, our industry has grown at a rate higher than the nation's average. The status of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy is being strengthened. And an excellent situation has appeared, marked by steady advances in all fields. In the course of advance, however, we are faced with some problems and difficulties. Chief among them are: a rather serious shortage of capital, the appearance of more "double suspension" enterprises [enterprises that have suspended production and wage payments to their employees], and an increased amount of losses suffered by some enterprises. Also, commodity prices have risen to an excessive extent; staff members and workers of the "double suspension" enterprises and masses in disaster-stricken areas are experiencing difficulty in livelihood. With regard to the relations of interests, contradictions of one kind or another have been intensified, and problems due to people's thinking and understanding have become more complicated. In view of this, we should keep a clear head so as to perceive the situation correctly. There are two different attitudes toward difficulty and, hence, two different results. One is to advance in the face of difficulty, struggle hard, and step up efforts for reform and opening up to achieve great development. The other is to take the usual attitude toward work or even quit in the face of difficulty, and the result is to lag behind in competition. With respect to these two results, the leadership of the provincial party committee has stressed time and again that we must enhance our sense of urgency and historical responsibility and try to achieve the former and avoid the latter. At present, however, the problems are: Some people are in low spirits, pessimistic, and disheartened. Others are full of complaints and blame this and that. Still others assume a passive and perfunctory attitude, trying to evade problems if at all possible. Given this state of affairs, it is appropriate to say that our present difficulty is caused by the mentality and work style on the part of some cadres rather than by the tasks before us. To advance in the face of difficulty, we should, first of all, look squarely at difficulty, despise it, and foster a dauntless spirit to conquer it. We should see the dual nature of difficulty: it is a motive force as well as a pressure; it not only causes us hardship but also provides something that we can take advantage of. Take the current macroeconomic environment as an example: Following two years' rapid economic growth, the "bottleneck" restriction and inflationary pressure have increased. On the one hand, our economic environment is not without strain. On the other hand, we have a new market economy marked by a high degree of vitality and compatibility, hence there are more opportunities for development. Moreover, despite the same environment, some units have remained passive and failed to go out of predicament, while others have overcome difficulties and "blazed a trail" through brambles. As a result, there have appeared in the province a number of counties, cities, and townships that have developed by leaps and bounds, "little tigers" that have excelled in developing the economy, and new enterprises that have arisen in the waves of market development. These positive and negative experiences show that the outcome of a matter depends on human efforts. Those who appear energetic and ambitious when circumstances are favorable but become discouraged and lose their bearings in the face of difficulty can never make any significant accomplishment or pioneer a great cause. To advance in the face of difficulty, we should not evade problems. Instead, we should be daring and adept in tackling the main and prominent problems that affect our reform and development and make a serious effort to solve them. For instance, enlivening big and medium-sized state enterprises is a major and hard job at present. Some enterprises have entered the market to conduct transactions on property rights, thus relieving themselves from the "specially guaranteed units" status granted them under the planned economic system. Other enterprises have been transformed into joint stock companies, accepted foreign capital, organized conglomerates, or opened new business in the field of tertiary industry. Still others have leased or auctioned themselves to the "main task forces" for competent management. To press ahead and make breakthroughs in every work, we must dare to tackle problems and overcome difficulties. If we turn away and refuse to do anything when problems arise, we will not only be overwhelmed by difficulties and cannot perceive our real backwardness, but what is more, we will aggravate the difficulties, cause more problems, and even turn solvable problems into "longstanding, big, and hard-to-resolve issues." To advance in the face of difficulty, we should also have perseverance in doing thoroughgoing work. We will not be able to overcome difficulty and achieve success if we take the usual attitude toward our work, dare not tackle the hard problems, or quit in the face of difficulty. For example, the "one-vote overruling" is a good way to remove difficulties in family planning. The "system of leaders taking responsibility for local security" is a good measure to improve public order. Using law to reduce the burden of enterprises and farmers is an effective method. To put these into practice, we should strive persistently and in a thoroughgoing way. Otherwise, we will waste our efforts or even spoil our previous achievements. Such a consequence will be hard to remedy. Whether a cadre can advance in the face of difficulty is a test of his or her thinking and work style. To break through difficulty, cadres and masses should help each other, pool their efforts, and display a daring and heroic team spirit. When difficulty arises, if our leading cadres just look on with folded arms or talk indiscreetly, if they are indulged in extravagant feasting and wining and busy entertaining guests and sightseeing, or if they are merely enthusiastic about replacing their present vehicles with high-grade luxurious cars and about seeking "ease and comfort," then the masses will not respect them, and the difficulty will remain. What is more, their behavior will invite serious complaints from the masses and make the difficult problems even more difficult to solve. To sum up, we must strive to improve our mindset and work style and foster a spirit of advancing in the face of difficulty so as to exert ourselves to fulfill the objective of "revitalizing Hubei in central China."
