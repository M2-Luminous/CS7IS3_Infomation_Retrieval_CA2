Gains, Losses Discussed Commentator Vasco Pulido Valente lists losers and winners of the December municipal elections in the 17 December Lisbon weekly O INDEPENDENTE. The most important loser was the conservative Social Democratic Center party (CDS), he writes, which failed to make an impression even among its traditional rightist electorate. The CDS's political "sickness" is incurable, according to Pulido Valente. As it has become progressively weaker it has lost the trust of the electorate, a loss which in turn increases its weakness. The Communist Party (PCP) succeeded in preserving most of its "small patrimony" of votes and municipalities. However, the PC failed to grow despite the unemployment problem and the economic recession, Pulido Valente continues. Mere survival, he concludes, proves that the party is a "tenacious relic" of the political past. According to Pulido Valente, the Socialist Party, which increased its mayoral representation, handled its success "melancholically." The PS needed to inflict a "ringing defeat" on the governing Social Democratic Party (PSD) and to win over at least a third of the PCP electorate, Pulido Valente contends. Neither goal materialized, and PS leader Antonio Guterres cannot claim to be a "giant-slayer." Guterres now faces a "terrible" problem, because the PSD's unexpected show of strength and the CDS's effective disappearance has convinced some PS officials of the need for an alliance with the PCP, Pulido Valente reports. He adds, however, that he personally rejects this option, since the PCP exists because its differences with the PS are greater and more essential than the difference between the PS and the PSD, making impossible a "common program" or a compromise. Moreover, because of the distrust that three-fourths of the electorate feel toward the communists, any PS initiative to create a leftist alliance will cost the PS a considerable share of the moderate vote. The PSD derived a number of benefits from the election, Pulido Valente writes. The party did well enough to sustain its position until the parliamentary elections in 1995. In addition, the CDS's losses eliminate any danger from the Right. The PDS will benefit in the parliamentary elections from a united vote against the Left, Pulido Valente concludes. Consequences of Elections PSD luminary and commentator Miguel Jose Judice weighs the consequences of the municipal elections in the 17 December O INDEPENDENTE. Inconclusive results, the small gap between the two major parties, and the lack of a massive electoral turn to socialism mean there will be no early dissolution of the National Assembly by President Mario Soares, Judice writes. Prime Minister Cavaco Silva strengthened his position in the PSD. A PSD victory in 1995 now appears more likely, Judice continues, since the difference in votes between the PS and the PSD is insufficient to overcome the prime minister's personal popularity--the "Cavaco effect." Unless the recession deepens and the Left unites for the next parliamentary election, the PSD might well achieve another absolute majority, Judice maintains. The PS could receive the support of leftist voters in many districts provided there is a common presidential candidate for the left or at least a promise of postelectoral cooperation by the leftist parties. Thus Judice sees the municipal elections as the beginning of a campaign to promote the candidacy of Lisbon mayor and PS luminary Jorge Sampaio for president. The CDS, in Judice's view, has become more fragile, losing the rural vote without winning over the urban electorate. Judice praises the voters for their sense of civic-mindedness in starting to punish the corrupt and the incompetent at the ballot box. Writing in the 17 December Lisbon daily PUBLICO, Miguel Sousa Tavares comments on the electoral results, noting that while the PS won "arithmetically," it did not do so "psychologically." Low voter turnout was chiefly responsible for the PS victories, rather than the party winning support of voters on its right and its left. The PS failed to smash the PCP and thus become the sole representative of the Left, and, writes Tavares, it failed to move centrist PSD voters to the left as well. The municipal elections were not a "general rehearsal" for 1995, when the Left hopes to put an end to a decade of Center-Right PSD government. The socialists kept a number of important mayoralties and won some new ones, but nothing in the municipal votes shows that the electorate is ready to abandon Prime Minister Cavaco Silva, Tavares contends.
