The Moslem formations appear to be trying, without success, to provoke a major conflict and blame it on the Serbs, the sources believe. Moslems are attacking on many fronts throughout that former Yugoslav republic, TANJUG learns from the Bosnian Serb Army. Moslems are keeping under steady small arms and mortar fire the Serb localities and positions in the area of Doboj in the north, specifically at Gradacac and on Mts. Ozren and Vlasic. Moslem assaults are continuing also in the east, in the area of Gorazde and along the Drina River which forms the boundary with Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro). Moslem artillery and infantry have intensified operations against Foca in the southeast and against Serb defence lines from the directions of Olovo, Kladanj and Kalesija in central Bosnia. Bosnian Serb Army sources say that the latest Moslem operations are an effort to link up the Moslem enclaves in Bosnia and enlarge the territory under Moslem control preparatory to linking up with Serbia's region of Raska (Sanjak), where half the population is Moslem, and then with the Serbian province of Kosovo-Metohija, where ethnic Albanians are the majority population.
