The president told parliamentarians to use parliamentary time to promote the welfare of their constituents, adding that this could only be done in an atmosphere of tolerance and appreciation of each other's point of view without resorting to violence. Stressing that true democracy can only thrive in an environment of give and take, President Moi urged the members to support each other for the prosperity of this nation. The president said he expected Kenya African National Union MPs to support motions sponsored by the opposition if they are geared towards the common good of Kenyans. He likewise told the opposition to support government-sponsored motions rather than oppose them for the sake of opposing. President Moi cited the current famine that has hit most parts of the country as one of the issues that called for a united approach by both the government and the opposition to tackle. He said because of the prolonged drought and harsh economic conditions that have made it difficult for most farmers to purchase required farm inputs, about 5 million Kenyans need food assistance. Noting that a hungry Kenyan cares little about political affiliations, President Moi expressed gratitude to those parliamentarians who had worked with the government to reach out to famine-stricken Kenyans. The president at the same time thanked Kenyans and friendly nations who have responded positively to his appeal for food assistance. President Moi further pointed out that many Kenyans were faced with economic hardship resulting from the current implementation of the structural adjustment program. He, however, assured Kenyans that the government had developed a safety program to alleviate their suffering. The president told Kenyans that they were free to offer their suggestions aimed at improving their socio-economic status. [passage omitted] Earlier, President Moi asked the MP's to stand up and observe a minute's silence in memory of the late Oginga Odinga and Dr. Josephat Karanja. [passage omitted]
