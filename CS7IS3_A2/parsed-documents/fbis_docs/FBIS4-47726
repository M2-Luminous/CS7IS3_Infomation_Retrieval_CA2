The same information was also broadcast by other radio and television stations. Here is what the prefect of Cyangugu said: Following the serious events that have shaken Rwanda since the death of the president of the Republic on 6 April, and the resumption of hostilities by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] [words indistinct] (?7) April, thousands of people of all ethnic groups and nationalities have been forced to flee their homes. These displaced people took refuge wherever they thought they would be protected from people's anger and [words indistinct] RPF combatants' weapons. In Cyangugu Prefecture, certain displaced people were taken to Cyangugu Stadium. There were (?5,126) people there on 22-23 April when Mr. (Georges) [word indistinct] of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Bukavu paid us a visit and left a certain quantity of drugs for them. All these displaced persons are still in the stadium. The shots heard on 29 April were weapons fired by members of the security forces, who were dispersing looters and robbers who were attempting to grab the few belongings which the displaced had managed to bring with them. (?A state of) confusion ensued when some of the displaced panicked, [words indistinct] the stadium [words indistinct]. Only a few of them took refuge elsewhere, and all the others who are there presently -- around 5,492 -- returned there under the vigilant protection of the gendarmerie. To the best of my knowledge, no shots were ever fired in the stadium, and no [word indistinct] has ever been used by the Army in the stadium or its surroundings. The prefect of Cyangugu Prefecture has made an appointment with Mr. (Georges) [word indistinct] for 2 May to exchange information and [words indistinct] to be made known to international public opinion [words indistinct].
