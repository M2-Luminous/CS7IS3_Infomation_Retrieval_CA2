Attempts are being made to portray it as a crushing force, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said Friday addressing cultural workers. Speaking about the developments in Moscow in October 1993, Grachev said that the military would never forget what happened then. He said that the military still feels bitterness because it was forced to help solve the problems created by political confrontation. He said that in the autumn of 1993 the army "came to Moscow on the second day of the civil war in Russia." Attitudes may be different to what happened but everyone should remember that servicemen bear a special responsibility and no-one has the right to split the army for political reasons, said Grachev. He said that the well-known thesis "the army is outside politics" should not be understood literally as some people are trying to present. The minister said that the military, like all citizens, cannot be indifferent to the political processes going on in society. The army does not serve parties or individual politicians, the army serves society, the country, said Grachev. He said that now some political forces are trying to take advantage of the tense social situation: the media are spreading all sorts of rumors aimed at discrediting the leadership of the country and the army. Grachev believes that the campaigners want to split the people and make them nervous. He said that the army and navy command is showing self-control. "I recently held a meeting of commanders of military districts and fleets and they said that no one will be able to split the army," said Grachev. He said that the army wants stability and further changes in society.
