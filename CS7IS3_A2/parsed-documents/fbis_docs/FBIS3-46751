This is the plan of the aggressor Vietnamese communists, Vietnamese puppets, and their allies to continue fomenting the war in Cambodia in opposition to peace and the king's national reconciliation. In fact, the two-heads-three-eyes government has no money to buy tanks, arms, and ammunition to continue the war. This is possible because the allies have given the money to buy Vietnam's ammunition and arms provided it by the former Soviet Union. Moreover, Vietnam wants to continue the war in Cambodia in line with its aggressive, annexationist, expansionist, and racial extermination strategy against Cambodia. Thus, (?Russia) is also the one who sells this ammunition, and the allies are the paymaster. Various observers said that it is not the two-heads-three-eyes government but the Vietnamese communists and their allies who are managing Cambodia's current state affairs. In the two-headed government, the Vietnamese puppet administration set up since 1979 is controlling the countryside by 100 percent and 99 percent of the Phnom Penh authorities who are always ready to follow their boss' order. The question is: Can the continuation of war by the Vietnamese communists solve anything? 1. The Vietnamese communists waged war for 13 years by themselves with the full support from former Eastern Europe bloc and former Soviet Union in an attempt to eliminate the Cambodian nation and people so that only the Vietnamese and Vietnamese puppets are left in Cambodia, but they were shamefully defeated by the Cambodian people. 2. After the Paris agreement was signed, the Vietnamese and their allies inside and outside UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] jointly carried on the war for the whole two dry seasons and two rainy seasons that followed. They maintained and used the old and new communist Vietnamese troops and maintained all Vietnamese puppet military and civilian authorities. UNTAC spent almost all of the 2 billion dollars in attacking Democratic Kampuchea. Both the Vietnamese communists and their allies tried very hard, particularly on the battlefield, to create an administration made up of the Vietnamese communist half-breed and Eurasians in Cambodia. At present, this half-breed government is born. That is, it has two heads and three eyes. But actually, it has a pure Vietnamese body formed by Vietnam since 1979. The people said that there has never been any government that has two heads and three eyes in the history of Cambodia and that of the world. It is very villainous and ill-fated. Only a few months after its birth, it has brought calamity to the country. The nation and society have plunged into serious disasters in all fields and all aspects. The people both in rural and urban areas, students, pupils, civil servants, and teachers are revolting against the parliament and the two-head-three-eyes government. They are opposing the Vietnamese communist administrators even more violently everywhere. The people want only a government and a national administration that come from the national reconciliation policy of King Norodom Sihanouk. In a situation in which the national trend and Cambodian people are very furious with the two-heads-three-eyes government and supporting the king's national reconciliation policy, will it be possible for the aggressor Vietnamese communists, their allies, and their puppets to carry on war and suppress the movement of the Cambodian nation and people with the weapons that they have just brought in? The history of the Cambodian nation clearly emphasizes this fact to the communist Vietnamese enemy and its the allies. In fact, the entire Cambodian nation and people oppose the two-headed government, Vietnam, and the allies. The overwhelming majority of the puppet and Para soldiers [Son Sann's group] do not want to fight any longer. Therefore, can the weapons of the Vietnamese and their allies fight by themselves when the people from all social strata, particularly the rural people, absolutely oppose them and are tightening the noose around their neck. This fact has been and is being confirmed by history. Desiring to kill a nation and people who fight for their national survival is not an illusion. Just take a look at the Cambodian countryside and at present-day Phnom Penh. Just take a look at Somalia, former Soviet Union, the Middle East, former East Europe, and present-day Africa.
