In an interview with NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG (Friday edition), SPD defense expert Walter Kolbow said that the ministry has confirmed reports that the thrift version of the Eurofighter, which Ruehe pushed through, gives rise to considerable additional costs for development because of the necessary changes. The SPD will demand clarification of the matter at a Defense Committee meeting next Wednesday [13 April]. Deutschlandfunk radio reported that the German share alone in the costs of the four-nation project will rise by at least 300 million German marks [DM]. An expert report by the Federal Audit Office even gave the additional costs as DM700 million. Kolbow stressed that the combat plane will force Ruehe "to give a political and financial oath of disclosure." The minister must be aware of the fact that the Bundestag will not approve one pfennig more than planned for the development of the Eurofighter. Even disregarding the now mentioned additional costs, Ruehe does not know how to pay for the plane's development.
