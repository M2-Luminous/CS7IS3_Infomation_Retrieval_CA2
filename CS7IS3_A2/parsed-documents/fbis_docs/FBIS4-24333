FBIS4-24333 "drafr126_e_94016" FBIS-AFR-94-126 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria Dialogue, Compromise Urged During National Conference Dialogue, Compromise Urged During National Conference AB2906092294 Kaduna Radio Nigeria in English 1700 GMT 28 Jun 94 AB2906092294 Kaduna Radio Nigeria English BFN ["Part one" of commentary by Abdulkarim Algese; from the "In Focus" program] [Text] Contrary to propaganda in certain quarters, the national conference which has now opened in Abuja was never the creation of the Abacha regime. The original champions were the so-called Campaign for Democracy group, actively supported by a vocal section of the media. In an obvious attempt to meet their demands, the regime on coming to power made it one of their agenda. As the preparations for its take-off had gone far, those who originally called for it denounced it with the same force they called for it. Their complaint is that with the government nominating 96 of the 369 conference members, the exercise will not achieve the desired purpose. They are also of the opinion that since the conference has no sovereign powers, then it will amount to a wasteful effort participating in it. The participation of nominated members in a similar conference is consistent with precedence. It was so during Obasanjo and Babangida. [sentence as heard] The complaint that the nominated members will be taking dictations from government cannot reasonably hold bearing in mind the national standing of those involved. No matter what else may be said of them, they are men and women who cannot be pushed around by anybody. Indeed, it is valid to say that they have added credibility to the conference and the sincerity of government. On the question of sovereignty, the truth is that there can never be two sovereign powers in any state. Those of us who want to copy Zaire and Togo need to be told that the attempt failed in both countries. The constitutional nature of the conference is based on the fact that its deliberations will be incorporated into the Constitution. There was a new dimension to the position of Nadeco [National Democratic Coalition] members who called for the boycott of the conference. According to reports, they were said to have written a secret letter to government pleading that their members be nominated. This is the same Nadeco that launched a campaign of boycott of the conference now wishing to participate through the back door. Some Nigerians can really be clever by half. They succeeded in dissuading some prominent and intelligent persons from certain parts of the country not to take part in the elections leading to the conference, while they were secretly pleading for nominations. It is a pity that such intelligent persons should easily be deceived. The atmosphere leading to the conference was one of zealous emotion, ethnocentricity, and beclouded objectivity. Never was excessive tribalism at its height and never was the relevance and importance of Nigerian nationhood so disgraced. A nation is the lifeline of a people. It is their dignity and symbol of pride. Think of the early explorers and colonial administrators who lost their lives for the glory of their respective nations. A people without a nation are orphans. The Palestinians could tell the story better. A country is the most priceless commodity that people could have. Those who want the disintegration of Nigeria should seriously reflect on what is currently happening in the former Soviet Union. Here was a country feared and respected and one of the most powerful in the world, strong enough to fight both Western Europe and mighty America. Alas, after its painful disintegration it has now become the errand servant of Europe and America. At the height of glory, the USSR dictated to the world. Today, it carries out American instructions. Its powers are no more, its glory gone to the winds, and its pride badly ridiculed. This is the price a disintegrated nation has to pay. A tightly united country is honey, a dismembered one tasteless. The conference delegates have no reasons whatsoever to give us a shattered nation at the end of their deliberations. If indeed they are, then they should bear in mind that the masses of the people are for a united Nigeria. [sentence as heard] Besides, a certain level of integration was taking place so as to make a breakup unviable. In their deliberations the delegates must put aside their elitist tendencies and work in the interest of the greatest number. This is what the people expect of them. As what may be called the giants of Nigeria, the masses are full of confidence that their maturity, stand in the society, and self-esteem, will see them through a purposeful deliberation. As members of the ruling class who at one time or the other presided over the affairs of the nation, they should put a lie to the popularly held view that they are part of our national problems, which is why they must conduct their deliberations in an atmosphere of maturity, understanding, and consideration. To take a rigid position on issues is unhelpful. Principled and considerate flexibility should be the strongest weapons. After all, the exercise is about dialogue and compromise.
