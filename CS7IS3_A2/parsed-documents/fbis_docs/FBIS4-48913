We want to extend holiday greetings to working people all over the world. In China, workers are building a socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics. And the growth of the national economy is the result of their hard work. Every step of the economic reforms has been boosted by their selfless support. They have proved their worth as the leading class of the People's Republic and have earned the respect of the nation. Although reform is now being targeted at central planning, the government continues to strive for workers' welfare. For instance, it is seeking effective ways of implementing the constitutional principle of "to each according to one's work." The government is making great efforts to strike a balance between efficiency and fairness. With the contract employment system, workers' rights and interests are safeguarded and their freedom in choosing jobs ensured. While making a series of laws on labour safety and minimum pay, the government is constructing a uniform welfare umbrella for all workers regardless of the ownership of the enterprises which employ them. With rapid economic growth, the nation is also experiencing higher inflation and rising unemployment. Current difficulties in the State-owned sector are affecting the living standards of the employees. Infringements upon labour rights are on the rise in foreign- funded and private firms. And their labour safety standards are often found to be substandard. As a result, trade union federations and relevant departments are raising their voice for speedy and substantial improvement on these issues. While encouraging the private sector to create more jobs, the government is also helping to re-train surplus workers for reemployment. The recent government decision to reduce State employees' working hours from 48 to 44 per week allowed working people to share the benefits of economic prosperity. The authorities are also laying down labour rights in the new market economy. The long-waited Labour Law will soon be adopted. And drafting laws on labour protection has been given priority. With the deepening of reforms, Chinese workers will enjoy better protection and fuller rights.
