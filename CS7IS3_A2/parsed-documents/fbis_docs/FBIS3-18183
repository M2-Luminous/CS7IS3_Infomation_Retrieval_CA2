But while Liparityan was in Ankara, Armenian forces have bombed the Azeri city of Terter, 300 kilometers from the capital Baku, ANATOLIA NEWS AGENCY reported from the region. Liparityan, after holding talks in the morning with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and Deputy Undersecretary Bigin Unan, told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS that "the first thing to do was to establish a cease-fire" before efforts are made on a political settlement. He told Cetin during his talks that Yerevan "would like to see what can be done to push the peace process" but added, "there are steps ahead." The unexpected visit was spurred by a phone call from Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan who called Cetin over the weekend. Diplomatic sources said Papazyan, apparently worried by the Azeri offensive to gain back their territories occupied by Armenian forces, told Cetin that fighting had intensified and asked Ankara to "assist" in establishing a cease-fire. Azeri and Armenian officials are presently in Moscow, with the hope of signing a protocol on March 1. A tentative accord, signed between the parties when Armenians and Azeris, [as published] was signed on Feb. 17, when Armenians promised to withdraw from the Azeri territory they occupied. But the stumbling block has proved to be the Armenian efforts to buy time for the withdrawal and the mediating Russia's attempts to place observers in Azeri territory. The Azeri Defense Minister has returned from Moscow but the talks are continuing through diplomatic efforts and by phone, a spokesman for the Azeri government said. In Ankara, Liparityan told reporters, before he engaged in a new round of talks with Candan Azer, the Foreign Ministry's deputy director responsible for Caucasus Affairs: "There are a number of peace efforts on the table. We have to see whether they can be combined." Asked whether this would be done within the Minsk process, he replied: "We obviously want to do it in an international forum. On the other hand, it should be something that works." Diplomatic sources in Ankara have spoken about "giving the Minsk process a kick start" through multilateral efforts of "certain interested countries." The same demand was made by Geydar Aliyev, the Azeri president, during his visit to Ankara last week. Aliyev said his country believed the Minsk forum of nine countries, under the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), was the adequate forum for a political settlement. But he added that Baku would also welcome the initiative of "major countries" for the settlement of the problem. Aliyev's words were interpreted in Ankara as a reference to a tripartite peace plan of Russia, Turkey and the United States which was launched last year but was integrated into the Minsk process. Ankara, however, believes that there are gaps in the Minsk calendar which endorses a plan for a gradual Armenian withdrawal. The point was made clear to Jan Eliasson, the new chairman of the Minsk Group who visited Ankara last weekend. The Minsk Group aims to find a political settlement for the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh, where Azeris and Armenians have been fighting an undeclared war. Another initiative which is on the table, but has so far been met with hesitation by Azeris, is a plan prepared by Russian President Boris Yeltsin's advisor Aram Abramyan [Andranik Migranyan]. Ways to establish a cease-fire and combine the plans will also be discussed when Foreign Ministry Deputy Undersecretary Bilgin Unan travels to Moscow on March 1 for political consultations.
