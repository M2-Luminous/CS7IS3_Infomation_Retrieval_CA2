April is when the Uruguay Round agreements are due to be signed formally in Morocco. Thai Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said he told visiting US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen that the new offer to be submitted in April would include allowing foreign brokerages to own up to 49 percent of Thai securities companies once these have been separated from finance companies. The new foreign ownership rule has already been agreed by the Cabinet. Its importance in the Uruguay Round deal would be the commitment under a new General Agreement on Trade in Services not to backtrack. Thailand's previous offer, which also covers banking, insurance and other services, did not make the 49 percent ownership commitment for securities companies. Other revisions could also be included in the new offer, such as permission for US banks to set up automatic teller machines around the country. But Mr Tharin told reporters yesterday that this would have to be considered before a commitment is made. Mr Tharin stressed yesterday that the discussions with Mr Bentsen were under the multilateral umbrella of the Uruguay Round and were not bilateral. The question of financial services liberalisation was one of four major topics discussed when Mr Bentsen met Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, Mr Tharin and Bank of Thailand Governor Wichit Suphinit yesterday. The other three were a request from Mr Bentsen for ideas on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group's finance ministers meeting in Hawaii in March, bilateral negotiations on a double taxation treaty, and a US request for Thailand to enact a law against money laundering -- the latter a less controversial issue according to Thai ministers. In the morning he visited the Stock Exchange of Thailand, but SET president Seri Chintanaseri said the question of access to the Thai market for foreign stock brokers was not raised.
