Here are the details of its innovation. The French may not have oil, but they have ideas. This fashionable 1970s slogan fits Eyquem to a tee. The company--better known among the general public for its automobile spark plugs--also has an aeronautics division, which supplies complete systems (ignition devices and spark plugs) to all of France's engine manufacturers. As the first company to devise and patent a wholly electronic ignition system for turbines, Eyquem might have hoped that its technological breakthrough would earn it a toehold in the American engine manufacturer market. But that would be underestimating the conservatism (and sometimes implicit protectionism as well) of a profession that stands on its traditions. Especially as the massive arrival of new standards such as the ETOPS norms works in favor of already installed equipment. Indeed, ETOPS standards, which seek to authorize the operation from any alternate airport of passenger twinjets for 120 to 180 flight minutes over the ocean, force manufacturers to prove the reliability of their engines and components. This is always easier to do on the basis of flight sheets than the promises of new technologies, even if the innovations have been designed to be more robust. At the heart of Eyquem's patent is the notion of replacing traditional discharger tubes with one or more thyristors. Such a solution is likely to become the only possible one as discharger tubes gradually disappear from component catalogs for lack of applications. As a consequence, the French patent interests many people, starting with Lucas Aerospace, whose "Switchgear and Ignition" division decided to purchase a North American license from Eyquem a few weeks ago. The acquisition gives Eyquem's technology a real chance to penetrate Pratt & Whitney-Canada and Allison engines, which Lucas supplies. Strictly speaking, the French patent's claim does not concern the use of thyristors as a switch component, but rather a particular way of using them in ignition systems subjected to the harsh environment of engines. Engines commonly reach temperatures of 100�C, making it impossible to cool thyristors using classic radiators. And in the first experiments conducted in Eyquem's laboratories in the mid-1980s, thyristors lasted no more than one or two hours. After countless laboratory experiments and simulations, Eyquem engineers made the paradoxical discovery that it was not so much during the first few microseconds of the discharge (and thus the spark in the plug) that the thyristor suffered. Rather, damage was more apt to occur during the off phase, when the condensor that stores the energy needed for the spark charges itself. In fact, during the condensor's charge period, voltage at the thyristor's terminals gradually climbs to 2 or 3 kV, generating a roughly proportional leakage current. The whole process results in an escalation of heat in the component, which released early. Since thyristors seemed well suited to very short discharges but not slow charges, Eyquem engineers came up with the idea of electronically controlling the condensor's charge cycle to keep it as short as possible. The solution has since been laboratory tested at 125�C for 7,000 hours without any observable thyristor failure, and patented. The reliability edge has shifted to the thyristor camp, since, unlike discharger tubes, thyristors are not subject to electrode erosion and the accumulation of dirt. In addition, doing away with discharger tubes makes it possible to consider cheaper industrial processes, such as automatic component insertion, wave welding, or surface assembly of components. Some of these methods have already been used to make the ignition cases for Turbomeca's Arriel 2 and Arrius 2 engines. But the most interesting possibility raised has to do with the control flexibility thyristors can bring to ignition systems. The condensor's charge cycle can be modulated to create frequency flexibility, and timing the triggering of the thyristor can make for flexibility in energy levels and spark voltage. Thyristors can thus be used to modulate the spark's energy and frequency, to conserve the spark plug's potential. Though spark plugs may seem fairly long-lasting now, this is because relatively few demands are being placed on them. That could change shortly, as the operational environments of spark plugs become harsher and harsher with the introduction of ever hotter and more compressed engines. In addition, for obvious safety reasons, users increasingly tend to keep ignition going during takeoff, landing, and even stable flight phases, to prevent the engine from dying. Thyristors could reconcile two criteria--safety and operating costs--that are often at odds. Boxed Material: How a Turboengine Ignition System Works Unlike inductive-discharge-based automobile ignition, the so-called "high energy" ignition of turbines is produced by a condensor discharge. In turbine sparking circuits, a string of impulses generated by a converter charges the condensor. The converter itself is supplied by the aircraft's 28 d.c. volt main supply. To reclose the discharge circuit that will trigger the spark in the plug, engineers have traditionally used a discharger tube. The tube is made of two electrodes inserted into an airtight glass bulb in a manner similar to lightning rods. When a certain charge voltage -- which depends on the shape of the discharger -- is exceeded, an electric arc forms between the two electrodes, and the discharger acts as a short circuit. Approximately one joule of energy is released in the spark plug at that instant, for a current of several thousand ampheres lasting 30-40 microseconds. In the Eyquem patent, one (or more thyristors in a row) replace(s) the discharger. To limit the joule effect in the thryistor, the condensor's charge impulses are modulated to reduce its charge time. The thyristor is maintained in a relaxed state for over 90 percent of its operating time. Its voltage rise can be calculated in milliseconds.
