Many farmers who left their land to seek jobs in urban areas came back in the first few months of the year to take a contract for farmland again. They were also buying more chemical fertilizers and collecting farmyard manure. "I am accustomed to cultivating land, but in the past several years, a whole year's income from farming was nothing compared with what you gained by working several months in town," complained Zhou Huiyao, a 52-year-old farmer in Shigangzi Village in Yangshipu Township in Liaozhong County. In the past, the farmer had contracted some 3.3 ha of fields at the most. However, the acreage decreased year by year to less than 1.3 ha last year. This year, he contracted four ha of land. "I regret that I did not plant enough grain last year. I did not expect the price of grain to go up that much," Zhou said. "So I have increased my grain planting acreage this year and asked my sons to help me at home rather than let them go to seek jobs in town." The experienced farmer calculated that he would make about 3,000 yuan net profits per ha in the autumn, despite the rise in price of chemical fertilizer and other expenses. Liang Jihua, deputy director of the Liaozhong County Agricultural Bureau, said that this year the county was seeing the greatest farming enthusiasm since 1984. Land totalling some 6,700 ha, including some sandy land, has been leased out to farmers this year, four times as much as last year. Farmers across the province are pouring more investments into farming. Some two million tons of chemical fertilizer, similar to the amount sold last year, have already been sold, but experts said they expect farmers will buy more. Farmyard and other manure, once deserted by farmers, is again become popular with local farmers. Liu Laifu, a farmer in Chengguan Village in Changtu County, for instance, spent 500 yuan to build a public latrine in the county town to collect manure. More than a dozen farmers have followed suit. Provincial officials were happy with the farming enthusiasm. The whole province will have three million ha planted with grain and soy beans. A leading official of the provincial agricultural bureau, said that he expects the province's total grain output will top the record of 12.5 million tons, if no major natural disaster occurs.
