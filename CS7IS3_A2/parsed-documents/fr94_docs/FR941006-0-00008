FR941006-0-00008 FR941006-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Food and Nutrition Service 7 CFR Part 246 Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC); Food Funding Formula Rule AGENCY: Food and Nutrition Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule amends regulations governing funding and funds allocation procedures for the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) in order to simplify and update the funding process in anticipation of a fully funded program. The amendments provide a greater share of funds to State agencies receiving comparatively less than their fair share of funds based on their WIC income eligible population, provide all State agencies with stability funding, adjusted for inflation, to the extent funds are available, and simplify the food funding allocation process by eliminating obsolete features. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective on October 1, 1994.
