At the time of their withdrawal in December, the finger was pointed at ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] for the looting of the main UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] base in Lofa. The agencies had been looking after tens of thousands of Sierra Leonean refugees as well as displaced Liberians, and although they finally went back last week, it looks as if they are going to have their work cut out, dealing with the problem of malnutrition. Our correspondent, Nii Anartey Allison, is in the Lofa town of Koilahun. He telexed us this report. Scores of children are said to be dying every week in this town. The Koilahun Hospital, the only health center, is without medical supplies and doctors serving there left when the aid agencies withdrew last December. Joseph Sipo, the administrator of the Koilahun Hospital, told me yesterday that kwashiorkor was widespread among children, and he had seen about 20 cases of measles in the last week. The most painful incidents, he said, were the deaths two weeks ago of three pregnant women, who would have been saved if they had been operated on. During my stay in Koilahun with the UNHCR chief of mission, residents in Koilahun said they are barely surviving on roots. Old man Maridorba told me: If the relief people do not help us, we will all die. In another development, the ULIMO battalion commander accused of masterminding the assault of the UNHCR base camp in Vahun last December, said yesterday that officers at ULIMO headquarters in Tubmanburg ordered the raid on the base camp without his knowledge. Ousmane Kone, better known as Colonel Pepper and Salt, said: They are putting the blame on me for what they did. He explained that at the time the UNHCR base camp was raided, he was busy commanding the boys in the war against the Lorma Defense Force in Upper Lofa. Pepper and Salt is seen in ULIMO circles as the most feared of the commanders, often accused of killing people at will, but he hit back yesterday, accusing the ULIMO headquarters in Tubmanburg of harboring murderous commanders.
