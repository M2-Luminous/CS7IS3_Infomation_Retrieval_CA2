[Kozyrev] It is, in general, quite a typical situation. In many areas of conflict, we encounter provocations -- either the actions of people who cannot cope with their hatred, or simply madmen, etc. In other words, the situation is, in general, familiar enough from other areas. A person fires and kills dozens of people. That immediately highlights a problem. The main problem is the safety of the population in the occupied territories and, of course, potentially, in those territories that are now, by agreement, to be handed over to the Palestinian side. Safety has to be ensured there too, and, of course, it is a very sensitive moment when, on the one hand, peace is already attainable, but, on the other, forces are at work -- perhaps it's an individual in the present case, but behind him, objectively, stand forces, anyway -- that wish to frustrate the peace. That is the essence of the tragedy. What conclusion can be drawn from this? Some may conclude that nothing will come of it. So let us fight, kill, and return to what is essentially a war in these territories. The second conclusion, which we draw, is that it is necessary to help the sides, to help them more actively. That is what, in our view, this occurrence has highlighted -- apart from the human tragedy. So, acting on the president's instructions, I immediately made contact with 'Arafat and with Shim'on Peres this morning. He and I had a further talk later. The Israelis assured us that they would be adopting their own measures to ensure security. In fact, Peres told me today that the government has adopted a whole package of measures -- five or six of them -- including the disarming of the most dangerous elements who are there among the Israelis themselves. That is, I think, a strong and, to be honest, a bold step on the part of the Israeli Government, and they had voiced their indignation, and so on and so forth. In other words, something is being done. We also discussed the possibility of further measures of that type. 'Arafat asked me to go back to the idea of international participation, international assistance. Indeed, our experience in other areas too also shows that, generally speaking, either Russian or UN observers provide assistance, if only psychological. In other words, the sides see that someone is helping, that they are not cast to the mercy of fate. There is a very high level of suspicion on both sides, and the presence of international representatives does somehow give them a feeling of -- how should I put it? -- neutrality or greater confidence. I asked the Israeli Government to weigh up the possibility of such an international presence. At first, the reaction was not very, let us say, it was without enthusiasm. Why? Because they don't want a UN presence. We then suggested that some thought could be given to the idea that they did not need to be UN observers. Maybe it would, in the end, be necessary to look for some other uniforms. Shim'on Peres, Israel's foreign minister, told me on the telephone today that they are really prepared to discuss different options. They are still somewhat wary of the United Nations but he did not rule out other options. So we have agreed that Igor Sergeyevich Ivanov, the special envoy of the president and the first deputy foreign minister, who is a very experienced diplomat -- he has today flown to Tunisia to have a meeting with 'Arafat and the PLO leaders and to discuss with them ways out of this situation and how Russia can help -- we are ready to consider some material, and not merely political forms of assistance to the Palestinians, so that they might start feeling more confident, but immediately after this, in accordance with the understanding I have just reached, he will fly to Israel where he is to have a meeting with Israeli leaders in order to discuss different solutions with them as well. Thus, the important thing is to provide for both sides a maximum political, and if necessary, material assistance, if you like, so that they can not only rescue the peace process but could also move onwards after this shock, this tragedy. This is because we want peace to prevail in the Middle East, and we cannot allow a bandit, or even a group of bandits, to disrupt this process. However, it is one thing to reach an agreement in principle and to start implementing it -- talks on the implementation of the agreement are under way -- but then immediately we are confronted with reality. And here other forces emerge, which try to disrupt this process, if you see what I mean. And it turns out that the whole thing requires much greater efforts that we probably thought at the beginning. Therefore, we have rushed to fill this breach, in order to save this peace process once again and even to impart a new impetus to it. I think it will take our special envoy several days to establish various other contacts. I spoke to U.S. Secretary of State Christopher about this yesterday. Russia and the United States are the cosponsors of the peace process in the Middle East, and we are not saying no to cooperation in this sphere, but it is clear that without an active Russian participation -- both 'Arafat and the Israeli leaders have asked for that -- this process cannot be saved. But we are not saying that this is something different from the efforts of everyone else. On the contrary, we think that everyone should be working to achieve the same goal.
