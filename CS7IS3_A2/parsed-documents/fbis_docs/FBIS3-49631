An international news conference, at which Peter Boross and Arpad Goncz talked about their meeting with the American President and the Visegrad Group, ended a short while ago. Peter Nyaradi reports: [Nyaradi] The American partner has unexpectedly extended its previous position. First of all, the new element is that they are willing to give more significant economic support to us, Prime Minister Peter Boross pointed out at the beginning of his summary of the day. Besides this, during the regional and bilateral meetings in Prague, Peter Boross said, the Partnership for Peace was seen as a good plan; that Hungary expected more is another issue,, but this is reality. However, it is a good thing that as regards NATO, thoughts can already be given to the concrete tasks of the plan provided by the Partnership for Peace. In connection with this plan Peter Boross said the following: [Boross] "This is the program of a newly elected president who is to be the president of the United States for another four years. Obviously, he wants to fulfill his first foreign political program of great significance. This is encouraging. We would be less optimistic if the president had proclaimed such a program when he only had, let us say, six months to go. We see a chance and we see that it is not possible to adopt a position in these questions with unrealistic ambitions. We also see that extremes and extreme wishes which are impossible to fulfill do not create a good impression." [Nyaradi] Regarding the bilateral meetings with leaders of the other Visegrad countries, the head of government said that during his talks with Vaclav Klaus, first of all the problems of the free trade zone was discussed. Peter Boross also added that it creates bad feelings if a country pushes itself to the forefront too much. It is no sin that all politicians protect the interests of their own country, but to overemphasize them may result in the danger of the action missing its target. Many questions were discussed with Slovak Head of Government Meciar. Although there are topics on which there is no harmony, this cannot be an obstacle in, for example, the development of economic cooperation between the two countries. On the matter of Bos [Gabcikovo power station] and the minority question, both countries stuck to their own opinion. The Hungarian party also said that the system of individual rights in Slovakia is was good, however, many individuals already represent collective interests [as heard]. The Polish-Hungarian meeting took place without any conflict and difference of opinion, Peter Boross evaluated. President Arpad Goncz said the following about this extraordinary day today and about the negotiations: [Goncz] "I start by saying that these negotiations consisted of bilateral and regional meetings. This was an indication of the fact that the United States is not non-committal and does not seclude itself; its commitment towards our region is unchanged. Its presence is a key issue from the viewpoints of the continent's stability and of the positive U.S. influence. The conditions for European stability are the U.S. presence, NATO's ability to act, NATO's extension, and a stable central Europe -- since security, the security of Europe is indivisible, and central Europe should not be a gray zone, a security vacuum. Russia and Ukraine, which are in the process of democratization, also represent conditions of stability, as do good relations between the United States, NATO, and central Europe and Russia."
