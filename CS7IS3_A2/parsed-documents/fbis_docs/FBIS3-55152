General Assembly circulated as its official document a statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry in connection with the adoption by the Latvian Parliament of a law on elections to the bodies of local self-government. The statement said that despite the inside and outside criticism, the Latvian Parliament has adopted the second reading of the draft law on the elections to the bodies of local self-government. The draft deprives non-residents of Latvia of not only their passive but also active franchise, introduces language restrictions for non-ethnic Latvians (the right to run public elections will be granted only to the candidates who pass examinations in the Latvian language) and creates barriers (by nationality) for the nomination of candidates in Riga and other big cities with a large percentage of non-ethnic residents. The statement also pointed out that Latvian lawmakers continue to ignore recommendations by experts of the Council of Europe and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), including CSCE Supreme Commissioner for Ethnic Minorities Max van der Stoel who consider as inadmissible the removal of non-residents who account for a considerable part of the country's population (several hundred thousand people) from participation in local self- government. Because Russia's position at the bilateral talks has received no response from its partners, the Russian Foreign Ministry has to draw the attention of the world community and human rights organisations to the growing discriminatory policy in Latvia aimed against non-ethnic residents, primarily Russians. Before it is too late, it is necessary to do everything possible to prevent aggressive nationalism from thriving in the Baltics. This will pose a threat to Europe of which Russia has repeatedly warned, the statement said.
