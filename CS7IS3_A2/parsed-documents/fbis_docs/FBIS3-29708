Soldiers are regarded as government officials who must comply with government policy, but it is good that they openly express their opinion about certain policies that they find impractical instead of keeping quiet and refusing to implement such policies, as some civil servants have been doing. The three armed forces commanders, however, believe that this government harbors hatred against the armed forces and looks for any opportunity to bully them. They claim it is improper for the government to impose the same policy on the procurement of military hardware and materials as on the construction of public facilities such as the elevated electric train system. Things have now changed. We believe that the elevated electric train project is a higher priority than the weapons needed for the country's defense. There is currently not much of an external threat to national security, but the traffic problem has become a national issue. It does not make sense to say that if we do not decide now the price of the planes will increase. It will not be difficult if the armed forces clearly understand the arms barter policy from the very beginning. They can agencies to help arrange purchases using this method. It is true that the armed forces have no expertise in this area, but the Commerce Ministry and several international firms can offer assistance. They know which countries produce what kinds of weapons and military hardware and what agricultural products they want. If the armed forces had only been a little more patient and had not revealed their position so hastily, the people would not have the feeling that there is a rift between the government and the military. We support the government's endeavors to tackle the problem of low crop prices through the practice of barter trade. Although it might not work out perfectly, at least we will be able to sell our crops in cases of production surplus or falling prices. The armed forces should realize how this scheme can benefit our poor farmers. If they really cannot implement the policy, though, they should talk to the government and explain the possible adverse consequences. The government's intentions are good, but it has not spelled them out clearly to the agencies concerned. It was not a surprise when the three armed forces convened a meeting and declared their disagreement with the government's arms barter policy, because they lack a clear understanding of it. It is necessary for the armed forces to study this policy thoroughly before they can implement it successfully. We appeal to the government and the armed forces to try to reach an agreement on which level this policy should be applied at, and the fact that this is one method to help solve the problem of low crop prices. We must make sure that deals are carried out in a transparent manner and that nobody pockets commission fees, as repeatedly has happened in various agencies.
