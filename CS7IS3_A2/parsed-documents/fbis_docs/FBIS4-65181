European Parliament Speaker Egon Klepsch on Friday announced that part of a sentence, referring to "the horrors of Nazism and of Fascism," mistakenly was not removed from the Italian language version of a motion approved by the assembly urging Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to make it clear that the new government under Silvio Berlusconi must "remain faithful to the fundamental values underlying the creation of the European Community." The motion was evidently directed at the prospect that the neofascist National Alliance would be given cabinet posts in the new government and caused indignant and offended reactions from members of the party. The Socialist Party whip in the European Parliament, Jean Pierre Cot of France, today stated that removal of the contested phrase from the motion, a phrase which did not appear in the other language versions, does not change the substance of the message. "The Parliament has expressed its concern over the Italian political situation," Cot stressed, adding that "the form of the translation does not change the substance." (National Alliance officials in Rome today continued to issue statements lambasting the European Parliament, claiming they are not fascists and calling "unsatisfactory" the explanations given by Klepsch. Party leader Gianfranco Fini also asserted he had "several Jewish friends," was not anti-Semitic, and "loved democracy and freedom.")
