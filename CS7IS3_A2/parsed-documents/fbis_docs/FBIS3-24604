Analysis of the plasmid profiles indicated an absence of plasmids 45-54 TPN in size in several mutants. From studying these mutants, the authors were able to identify the plasmids containing the genes for lactose, sucrose, and fructose fermentation in these microorganisms. Two strains, L. lactis lactis 90 and L. lactis cremoris ROM, were identified in which the mutants, deficient in lactose utilization, experienced phage resistance spectrum changes; in both cases, the changes consisted of the appearance of phage sensitivity with respect to various phages. In L. lactis lactis 90, the genes corresponding to lactose utilization and the genes participating in phage resistance control were apparently located on the 53.7 TPN plasmid. This work was completed, in part, with resources supplied by the Russian State Scientific and Technical Program ``Priority Directions in Genetics.'' Figures 1; references 10: 4 Russian, 6 Western.
