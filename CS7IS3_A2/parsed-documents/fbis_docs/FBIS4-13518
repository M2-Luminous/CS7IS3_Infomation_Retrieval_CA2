The meetings between the two ambassadors were held parallel to the official rounds of talks between the two states in Washington and in between rounds. The meetings were attended by senior officials from the U.S. State Department dealing with the peace process. Some of the meetings were held at the home of Edward Djerejian when he was assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. Dennis Ross, head of the American peace team, participated in some of the meetings. When Rabinovich took up his post as ambassador in Washington in early 1993, Jerusalem hoped he would maintain a secret track with his counterpart, Ambassador Mu'allim, who was seen as more flexible and possessing more contacts with the Syrian top echelon than Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, head of the Syrian delegation to the bilateral peace talks. Political sources in Jerusalem said yesterday that they believe that the Rabinovich-Mu'allim talks did not make much progress since neither received sufficient room to maneuver from their masters -- Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. Nevertheless, the secret track is used to transmit messages between Jerusalem and Damascus and to assist in clarifying matters in the formal talks. [passage omitted]
