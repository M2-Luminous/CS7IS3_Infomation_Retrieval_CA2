The state was not interested in schools being administrated by the community, especially those in areas with a large Hungarian minority, he said. Executive Secretary of Egyutteles Alzbeta Dolnikova added that minorities were not sufficiently represented in school management. Egyutteles Deputy Edita Bauerova pointed to the words of an unnamed Education Ministry representative who said, in the last electoral term, that "the decentralization of basic education in Slovakia had not yet been carried out because a large Hungarian minority lives there." One solution, Bauerova said, was a proposal which the government had already looked at -- that the revenues which the Education Ministry created itself would not then have to be put into the state budget. Another possibility was to amend the tax law to allow physical persons to claim tax exemption for the cost of educating their children. Bauerova also expressed dissatisfaction at parliament not having granted the CTV company a license for television broadcasting. She said she supported CTV because the company intended to develop regional broadcasting. The competition would help ensure that Slovaks were better informed, especially given that public corporation television was having financial problems. Egyutteles representatives said they were waiting for the law on the media to be put forward, and intended to initiate a change in the positions of the Slovak Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting, the Slovak Television Council, and the Slovak Radio Council. At its 27th session, parliament failed to approve the granting of a license to the CTV company for television broadcasting in the second circuit of Slovak Television. However, parliament charged the Radio and Television Broadcasting Council with putting forward a proposal for a new candidate for the license by the end of April.
