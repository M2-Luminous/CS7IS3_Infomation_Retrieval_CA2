The move will free mainland investors to buy and sell both foreign and local-invested unit trusts and mutual funds for the first time and allow domestic companies to offer their own funds to mainland buyers. As a result of market liberalisation, Chinese fund management companies will also be permitted to list on the country's two stock markets, in Shanghai and Shenzhen, according to Chinese sources. The People's Bank of China has approved the listing of six newly established fund-management companies and endorsed more to be traded over the counter throughout the country. "As a reform package was recently approved by the central authorities, China is set to introduce an institutional investment system," a Chinese economist said on Saturday. "And through the introduction of Western-style instruments, along with the existing reforms in banking, fiscal and securities regulations, China is expected to fully embrace a capitalist-style financial market in the next few years." The companies so far approved to list in Shanghai and Shenzhen are Shanghai Jianye Fund Management, Baoding Fund Management, Jinlong Fund Management, Shenzhen Lantian Fund Management, Tianji Fund Management and Yangguang Fund Management. However, Beijing was not in haste to lure foreign funds until it had initiated related regulations, the source said. He said regulations on Administration of Investment Funds were now under deliberation by the central bank, a cabinet-level State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, and the Finance Ministry. The regulations will then be submitted to the State Council for final endorsement. Chinese sources said Executive Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji was an enthusiastic supporter of the reforms. Zhu, China's financial troubleshooter, was quoted as saying that it was healthier to introduce an institutional investment system than to encourage individual investors. Paul Pong Po-lam, managing director of Pegasus Fund Management, said approval for investment funds to list on the mainland's stock exchange will encourage the industry's development in the country. He said that China was now in need of cash for its huge infrastructural developments throughout the country. "Raising money by funds is the most convenient form of financing," Pong said. As a result of 14 years of economic reforms, disposable incomes have increased and people are now looking for alternative investment opportunities. Tim Greaton of Credit Lyonnais said the present environment in China was qualified for investment funds as economic reforms had pushed the country towards a more Western-style market economy. However, he doubted if the listing of investment funds in China would really be noticed overseas. "I don't think that foreign funds are really conscious of the development of China local funds or the recent approval for their listing," he said.
