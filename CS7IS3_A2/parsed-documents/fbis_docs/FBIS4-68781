Savluk, doctor of economic sciences: "Inflation in Ukraine: Its Sources and Its Current Status"] [Text] The most important negative phenomenon in Ukraine's economy in its market-reform stage is inflation. From a barely perceptible devaluation of money during the eighties, inflation has very rapidly (in close to three years) reached the level of hyperinflation. The odd thing is that this upsurge of inflation has occurred in one of the most economically developed and prosperous republics of the former USSR. This phenomenon has not been properly analyzed and objectively assessed and remains poorly understood by the general public. This makes it possible to exploit the threat of inflation as justification for opposing Ukraine's leaving the single ruble zone and for opposing the building up of an independent Ukrainian state per se. Consequently, an analysis of inflation in present-day Ukraine assumes exceptional importance. Was There Inflation in Ukraine Before Ukraine Proclaimed Her Independence? In order to objectively assess the inflationary processes currently under way, one must first determine whether there was inflation in Ukraine during the Soviet period. It is, however, very difficult to find a simple nswer to this question today. During the Soviet period, Ukraine was a component part of another state and did not have an independent monetary system. We are thus left with data on inflation in the USSR as a whole on which to base our investigation. This approach is methodologically justified inasmuch as the state of monetary circulation in Ukraine was then determined by the Union center and differed very little from the state of the monetary sphere of the Union as a whole. With rigid state controls and containment of prices as their policy, the official Soviet authorities [as published] denied the very possibility of inflation in a planned economy, and government statistics simply kept silent about the problem of inflation until 1989. If one were to judge inflation by the dynamics of the state-set retail prices at which the majority of goods and services were sold in the Soviet Union, one could conclude that until the beginning of the restructuring of the Soviet economy, there really was no inflation or that it was insignificant (see Table 1). Table 1.

The data in Table 1 indicates that a perceptible rise in prices began concurrently throughout the whole Soviet Union and in Ukraine particularly in the eighties. The greatest increases occurred in the prices of food products. Inflation began to assume an open form. This forced the USSR Ministry of Finance in 1989 to acknowledge officially that inflation had begun in the country and that it was running at an annual rate of 2-4%.[.sup]1[/] Approximately the same data on inflation in the former USSR were cited by official IMF sources and some Western economists. In particular, R. Dorybush (Massachussetts Institute of Technology), citing IMF sources in a work entitled The Lessons of High Inflation, provided the following figures for inflation in the USSR: 1986 -- 2%, 1987 -- 1.3%, 1988 -- 0.6%, 1989 -- 2%, 1990 --4.8%.[.sup]2[/] But these data do not take into account hidden constituent inflation. In reality, the monetary sphere of the former USSR (including Ukraine's) was in much greater disequilibrium than indicated by the index of state retail prices. Through the mechanism of preferential bank credits, a surplus money supply was constantly being injected into circulation. Goods shortages and unmet effective demand were growing steadily, creating a significant hidden inflationary potential (see Table 2). Table 2. The Dynamics of Some Macroeconomic Indicators of the Development of the USSR (in % compared with 1965)* Indicators Years 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 Gross Social 143.0 192.0 240.0 307.0 395.1 Product (in real prices) Retail Goods 148.0 201.0 258.0 309.0 446.2 Turnover (in real prices) Financial Means 168.0 212.0 280.0 356.0 1,926.0 (profit, tax on turnover, depreciation) Short-term Bank 164.0 230.0 341.0 591.0 355.5 Credits (remaining indebtedness at the end of the year) Personal Savings 249.0 490.0 837.0 1,182.0 2,039.8 Deposited in the Savings Bank (remaining at the end of the year) * See: The National Economy of the USSR in 1980, Moscow, Statistika, 1981, pp 39, 40, 380, 503, 511, 521; The National Economy of the USSR in 1985, pp 39, 448, 548, 561, 586; The National Economy of the USSR in 1990, pp 5, 6, 15, 20, 29, 48. The first two indicators reveal changes in the material sphere of the economy, and the other three indicate changes in the monetary sphere. From the very beginning of the period under investigation, the indicators of change in the monetary sphere were rising faster than the indicators of change in the material sphere, and this gap grew steadily wider, indicating the growth of a chronic disequilibrium between the supplies of goods and money in the economy and a hidden inflationary potential. Although indebtedness on short-term bank loans fell markedly after 1985, this did not alter the overall situation. At the same time, there was a sharp rise in such indicators as financial means (5.5-fold), the state budget deficit (approximately 3-fold),[.sup]3[/] and the national debt.[.sup]4[/] The conclusion concerning a chronic buildup of inflationary potential (particularly in the consumer sector of the USSR economy) is also confirmed by a growing discrepancy between prices in the state trade network and at collective farm markets. In the USSR as a whole, the average prices of goods sold at collective farm markets at unregulated prices exceeded state prices: in 1960 -- 1.35-fold, in 1970 --1.55-fold, in 1980 -- 2.09-fold.[.sup]5[/] In Ukraine, these unregulated prices were 2.27-fold higher in 1980, 2.38-fold higher in 1985, and 2.87-fold higher in 1990.[.sup]6[/] The data cited to reflect the disequilibrium in the economy between the supply of goods and money reveal that the surplus money supply in circulation in the consumer sector constituted 70-75% of the total volume of money held by the population on the eve of the collapse of the former USSR. At the end of 1990, this amounted to approximately 350-400 billion rubles. According to our estimates, Ukraine accounted for 75-90 billion rubles of this sum. This money reflected unmet demand and put constant pressure on prices, causing them to rise. We estimate that a sudden liberalization of prices alone would have caused the general level of prices to at least triple. Calculations of the real rate of inflation made in 1991 at the state level revealed that in 1989 inflation measured 7.5% and in 1990, 19%.[.sup]7[/] Thus, Ukraine approached her declaration of independence with a moderate level of open inflation and with a large hidden inflationary potential, which was capable of causing significant inflation with the first attempt to liberalize prices. The Condition of Ukraine's Monetary Sphere During the Period Between Ukraine's Proclamation of Independence and Her Leaving the Union The Declaration of Independence of Ukraine proclaimed in July 1990 could not suddenly change the course of economic processes, including those taking place in the monetary sphere. These continued under their own momentum, which had been created by the totality of the development that had come before: the "cost-is-no-object" nature of the economy, the falling volumes and effectiveness of production, decreased labor productivity, the irrational, militarized structure of production, etc. Moreover, for nearly another one and a half years, Ukraine remained part of the Union and part of the common economic and monetary space. Therefore, the Union center continued to decide all key issues relating to Ukraine's economic development: it set policies on wages, prices, emission, credit, etc. Not only did Ukraine's proclamation of independence in July 1990 not change the internal negative economic processes, but it provoked a response from the Union center and some of the other Union republics that spurred inflation. There began increased external pressure on the economy of the Ukrainian state, manifested in the issuance of harsher directives in response to Ukraine's desire for independence. The 1990 forecast for the Union as a whole anticipated a significant increase in emission, while "freezing" emission for Ukraine at the 1989 level, i.e., at 1.2 billion rubles. In reality, emission in 1990 for the Union as a whole significantly exceeded the predicted level and reached an unprecedented amount -- 24 billion rubles. At the same time, Ukraine removed 446 million rubles out of circulation -- an action that Ukraine's government hailed as a notable accomplishment in carrying out the center's directive regarding emission.[.sup]8[/] The result of this "accomplishment" for the economy and people of Ukraine was slower growth of personal income than in other republics, accelerated growth of unmet demand while large quantities of goods flowed out of Ukraine, and a redistribution of credit resources to the benefit of other republics. Since 1991, the Union center's negative influence on Ukraine's monetary sphere was gradually compounded by the destructive effects of the centrifugal actions in the monetary and credit policy of the government of the Russian Federation. Against the background of the active struggle for independence that unfolded in many republics of the Union, the government of Russia also proclaimed war on the Union center and began to pursue an openly independent economic policy. To bring over large segments of the population to its side in this struggle, the Russian government decided to promote a rapid increase in personal incomes, grant credit and tax preferences to enterprises that recognized the jurisdiction of Russia, immediately meet all the demands of striking collectives for expanded economic independence, etc. The result of this policy was an unprecedented increase in emission by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). During 1991, it put 32% more cash into circulation than during all the preceding 30 years (1961-1990). At the same time, Ukraine put 40% less money into circulation than during the entire preceding 30 years. As a result, the total supply of money in circulation in Russia in 1991 increased 2.26-fold, while in Ukraine this amount increased only 1.44-fold.[.sup]9[/] The huge money supplies issued by the CBR circulated freely in the single ruble zone, "flooding" the markets of all the Union republics, and especially Ukraine's. The CBR pursued an identical policy through its mechanism of credit emissions, which provided Russia's enterprises with maximally favorable terms on which to gain access to credit resources. Although Russia, like all the other republics, was still part of the Union and therefore bound by the terms of a single credit policy set by the State Bank of the USSR, in 1991 the CBR began openly ignoring these terms. In particular, the USSR State Bank recommended a minimum reserve requirement averaging 14% for the central banks of the Union republics and an interest rate on credits for refinancing commercial banks averaging 12%. By the beginning of 1991, the CBR had set these same standards for Russia's banks at a much lower level -- 2% and 8%, respectively. It also exceeded the centralized quota for credit emission by almost 200 percent. Throughout 1991, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and the central banks of other republics continued to maintain the centrally established standards and quotas. The result was a 2.3-fold increase in credit extensions by Russia's banks, and only a 1.7-fold increase by Ukraine's banks.[.sup]10[/] Thus, the importing of inflation into Ukraine began even before she left the Union, and its effect was so perceptible that the government of Ukraine was forced to apply organizational measures to protect the Ukrainian consumer market from the inflow of money from outside. It introduced single-use coupons in retail trade, as well as export controls. At the same time, the effects of internal inflationary factors were becoming more perceptible -- in particular, the growth of crisis phenomena in Ukraine's own economy. Production volumes were falling at an accelerated rate: in 1991 the gross social product decreased (as against 1990) by 11.3% and national income by 11.2%. Meanwhile, the state budget deficit amounted to 21.1 billion rubles, or 27.4% of total revenues, as compared to 1990, when budget revenues had exceeded budget expenditures by 1.4 billion rubles. The situation in the monetary sphere grew radically worse after controls over spending on wages were abolished in July 1991. In August 1991 alone, the amount of money issued by banks for this purpose increased 2.1-fold and reached 7.5 billion rubles. Personal income in 1991 increased (as against 1990) by 87% and once again significantly exceeded personal spending and savings -- by 11.3 billion rubles.[.sup]11[/] Unmet demand and goods shortages mounted and constituted hidden components of inflation. At the same time, the rate of open inflation rose unremittingly throughout 1991. In January-February, wholesale and purchase prices were raised by a significant amount. In April, fundamental changes were made in price formation -- agreed-to (free) prices were permitted for a large assortment of consumer goods, and state retail prices were also raised. This was the first obvious step in the direction of price liberalization, which helped to transform hidden inflation into open inflation. The index of state retail prices for the whole of 1991 (as compared with 1990) measured 187%. Prices in the collective and "black" markets were wholly unregulated and were two and three times higher than in state and cooperative trade. Wholesale prices in industry more than doubled.[.sup]12[/] There are therefore grounds to believe that open inflation in 1991 across the whole spectrum of prices and tariffs in Ukraine exceeded 200% and began to pose a serious threat to the country's economy. The government was forced to take steps to provide a social safety net for the population. In particular, it carried out the indexation of Savings Bank deposits, indexation of incomes, etc. However, in a very short time income indexation was replaced by the complete lifting of state wage controls in the production sphere and by periodic increases in the incomes of employees of budget-financed institutions. As a result of these measures, personal income growth began to catch up with price increases. Over 1991 as a whole, the rate of growth of personal income even exceeded the rate of growth of prices, which, in turn, helped to fuel inflation. The Rise in Inflation Following Ukraine's Exit from the USSR The USSR finally collapsed in December 1991, and Ukraine won independence at last. This gave rise to a new inflationary phase, in which all the inflationary factors were rendered significantly more active and the manifestations and processes of inflation changed. First and foremost, the nature of inflation imported from other CIS countries changed significantly and its spectrum expanded. Having won independence from the Union center and having taken over its emission system, the Russian Federation fundamentally changed its policies on prices, emission, and credit. In January 1992, set on liberalizing prices, the government of Russia unilaterally raised retail prices on an average to triple and quadruple their previous levels. The government of Ukraine was forced to raise the prices of most goods by the same factors.[.sup]13[/] After Russia left the Union, the CBR began to implement a harsh policy of "expensive money" -- it significantly increased the reserve requirements for commercial banks (from 2% in 1991 to 10% in January, 15% in February, and 20% in March of 1992) and raised the discount rate (from 8% in 1991 to 20% at the beginning of 1992).[.sup]14[/] Insofar as the NBU maintained the earlier standards that had been recommended by the former USSR State Bank, these actions by the CBR upset the balance in settling accounts between Ukraine's and Russia's enterprises. Russian enterprises were finding it increasingly difficult to pay for deliveries of goods from Ukraine, and in the middle of 1992, their total indebtedness was twice as high as that of Ukraine's enterprises. This situation further disrupted economic ties, produced a drop in production, and resulted in there being fewer goods in Ukraine's markets. Secondly, to prevent the bankrupting of Ukrainian enterprises, which were not receiving payment from Russia, the NBU was forced to increase the volume of preferential credits it extended to them and increase the emission of credit. However, Ukraine's total dependence on Russia for energy supplies proved to be the principal channel through which inflation was imported in 1992. Exploiting this dependence, Russia's government began to raise the prices of the oil, oil products, and gas that Russia sold to Ukraine. This caused the price of oil products in Ukraine to rise nearly 300-fold in 1992 as a whole.[.sup]15[/] Such a jump in prices would have destabilized the economy and monetary sphere of even a highly developed country, let alone Ukraine. Ukraine's exit from the Union significantly activated the internal inflationary factors as well. Responding to social pressure, Ukraine's government in January 1992 sharply increased the wholesale prices of goods manufactured by the basic branches of industry. The average level of wholesale prices in the coal industry in February 1992 was 51 times higher than the corresponding indicators in 1991. In January 1992, the general level of wholesale prices in industry as a whole increased (as gainst December 1991) 8.4-fold, and in February by an additional factor of 2.3.[.sup]16[/] Serving to push retail prices up even further, this government measure produced an even stronger impact than Russia's unilateral price increases. It made state regulation of retail prices extremely difficult, and the prices of most goods and services were completely "freed." There began a spontaneous process of a chronic rise of "free" prices and a saltatory rise of regulated prices (see Table 3). Table 3. The Dynamics of Prices Throughout 1992* (times greater than previous level) Indicators Months January March June September December Wholesale 13.9 18.6 25.0 26.0 42.0 Prices in Industry (compared with the correponding month in 1991) Retail Prices 4.0 5.2 6.4** 8.4** 13.0 and Rates (compared with December 1991) * See URYADOVYY KURYER, No 21, 1992, p 4; URYADOVYY KURYER, No 9-10, 1993, p 5. ** Not including rates for services. The large jump in prices after their "liberalization" at the beginning of 1992 produced the necessary equilibrium and, in effect, destroyed the entire surplus supply of money in circulation that had accumulated over preceding years. But because at the beginning of 1992 current income growth lagged behind price growth, the scarcity of demand for goods was felt very quickly, trade slowed, and the first quarter already showed signs of a crisis in sales. It even became necessary to lower the prices of some goods. However, this process soon came to a halt. The monopolistic position and state status of most enterprises made it possible for them to avoid lowering prices, succeed in obtaining preferential credits and direct financial assistance (in particular, in the form of indexation of working capital), and quickly raise their employees' wages. Thus, by the first half year of 1992, the average monthly wage in industry increased 11.4-fold, despite the fact that the volume of production decreased (as against the relevant period in 1991) by 12.3%, and retail prices in state and cooperative trade rose on an average by a factor of 6.4.[.sup]17[/] In light of the forced growth of incomes in the production sphere, the government had to substantially increase the incomes of employees in the budget-financed sphere, of pensioners, military personnel, etc. The rate of income growth began to surpass the rate of spending (in September -- 1.22-fold), and unmet demand and goods shortages increased. The government's policy of liberalizing prices and incomes was fully supported by the National Bank of Ukraine, whose excessive emission created favorable conditions for the realization and intensification of all the inflationary factors operating in the Ukrainian economy. The NBU was implementing a policy of "cheap money" and maintaining the discount rate at a level well below the rate of inflation in Ukraine and the discount rates in other CIS countries. Thus, in the fourth quarter of 1992, when inflation measured 30% per month, the NBU's discount rate averaged 22-25% per year. At the time, Russia's discount rate was already more than 80%. This had extremely negative consequences for Ukraine's economy. Personal savings on deposit at the Savings Bank began to shrink, the demand for convertible currency on the "black" market rose, the exchange rate of the karbovanets began to fall at an accelerated rate, and the outflow of capital from the country intensified (including to Russia). The NBU's low discount rate and the commercial banks' unregulated interest rates on loans caused the "flight" of capital from the state sector to the private sector of the economy, which meant, in effect, a so-called "shadow privatization" and intensified the payments crisis in the state sector. Thus over the first 11 months of 1992, overdue payments in the national economy of Ukraine increased 125-fold and on 1 December amounted to 406 billion karbovantsi.[.sup]18[/] All these processes increased demand for credit and compelled the NBU to release new credit flows. The total amount extended in credit by Ukrainian banks in 1992 was 27 times greater than in 1991.[.sup]19[/] As a consequence of this policy on the part of the NBU, economic reforms were curbed, a free-ride mentality was reinforced, and nonpayments mounted causing a new demand for credits. The negative effects of the NBU's policy of "cheap money" became especially apparent in the second half of 1992 when Russia halted the flow of excess rubles from Ukraine. By setting up clearing operations with Ukraine through centralized correspondent accounts in central banks, Russia in effect pushed Ukraine out of the ruble zone as punishment for an inadequately thought-out monetary policy. This confined the entire supply of issued payment means to the territory of Ukraine, and the Ukrainian ruble (karbovanets since November) began to lose value even more rapidly. At the end of 1992, the rate of inflation exceeded 30% per month, reaching an annual rate of 2,100%.[.sup]20[/] Moreover, the price rises could not keep up with the growth of the money supply, because the prices of some essential goods were still being set by the state. Demand for these goods could not be met despite rising prices. The critical situation that developed in the monetary sphere at the end of 1992 exacerbated the political situation in the republic and was probably the main reason for the change in the leadership of the Cabinet of Ministers and the National Bank of Ukraine. The new government, headed by L. Kuchma, was granted special powers to conduct a stabilization policy. However, the inflationary potential that had accumulated under the preceding government was so huge that the first thing the new government was forced to do when it took office was to raise fixed prices 1.8-fold at the beginning of 1993. Having promised to halt inflation, the government of L. Kuchma confined its anti-inflation policy to restricting consumption funds at enterprises and "freezing" monetary incomes in the budget-financed sphere. Even these measures -- albeit not sufficiently resolute and consistent --produced some positive results: between the end of January and the end of March 1993, prices on the consumer market and the exchange rate of the karbovanets were relatively stable. But the stabilization proved short-lived, because it was not backed by cardinal reforms of Ukraine's economic system per se and a suitable monetary policy on the part of the NBU. The old economic system, with its "cost-is-no-object" nature, was itself transformed into a powerful inflationary factor when economic ties were broken and state controls weakened, and the NBU's policies helped to keep this system alive. Ukraine's agroindustrial complex is an especially telling illustration of this. In the first quarter of 1993 alone, the agroindustrial complex received nearly one trillion karbovantsi in preferential credits (at an annual rate of 30%) and close to three trillion karbovantsi of state financial assistance for its needs.[.sup]21[/] Other sectors of the national economy also needed huge credits -- in March they were granted 606 billion karbovantsi in credits to settle accounts amongst themselves.[.sup]22[/] The total sum of cash issued in the period between January and April 1993 amounted to 598.3 billion karbovantsi, which exceeded emission during the corresponding period of 1992 tenfold.[.sup]23[/] With production volumes continuing to fall and the costs of imported energy supplies continuing to rise, it was inevitable that such huge injections of money would disturb the delicate market balance that had formed after the January price increase. Indeed, starting in March, it became apparent that goods were again becoming scarce, demand was not being met, production outlays that were not covered by the enterprises' own revenues were growing, the amount of nonpayments among enterprises was mounting to its previous level, etc. Although the NBU seemed to come to its senses and in April-May applied a series of monetary measures designed to fight inflation (raised the annual discount rate to 240%, established stronger controls over the operations of commerical banks, began to finance the government within the limits of the budget deficit approved by the Supreme Council, etc.), these steps were not able to alter the situation in the monetary sphere as a whole. By the end of the first half year of 1993, the hidden inflationary potential had been restored and now exceeded the level that had existed at the end of 1992. Nonpayments and losses reappeared in the national economy and amounted to trillions. The government was forced to raise once again (1.5-fold) fixed retail and wholesale prices, as well as all forms of personal income. The Supreme Council passed a decision to grant enterprises financial and credit assistance in the amount of nearly seven trillion karbovantsi to be used to cover losses, pay off debts, and for other expenditures. Thus a new steep spiral of hyperinflation began, which made the economic and the social situation in Ukraine even worse. The data contained in Table 4 confirm the steep climb of all the components of inflation in 1993. The most rapid rises are occurring in wholesale prices and the exchange rate of the karbovanets. During the first nine-month period, industrial wholesale prices increased 57.3-fold (as against 11.1-fold for the whole of 1992), and the exchange rate of the karbovanets against the U.S. dollar increased 22.8-fold. At the same time, the retail prices of goods and services increased more than 16-fold, that is, almost by the same factor as for all of 1992. Table 4.

Throughout the entire third quarter, the money supply increased each month by more than 50%. The duration of each wave of inflation became markedly shorter. The first inflationary peak in 1993 occurred in January and the second in June, that is, four months later. The next upsurge took place only two months later -- in September. Inasmuch as the money supply grew at a faster rate than prices during the last cycle, there is every reason to expect another sharp rise in prices. A very clear link between the market exchange rate of the karbovanets and the money supply appeared during the first seven months. The exchange rate changed every month (except February) in the same direction and at approximately the same rate as the money supply. Not until August, when on the initiative of the Cabinet of Ministers the National Bank of Ukraine made it mandatory to sell 50% of all foreign exchange earnings to the state at a fixed rate, did the exchange rate of karbovanets increase 2.2-fold without a clear link to the change in the money supply. The rise in inflation in 1993 was also caused by faster monetary circulation. Thus, the rate at which money circulated in the first nine months of 1993 (as compared with 1992) more than doubled. This can be explained by a continually growing negative discount rate and an increased level of anticipated inflation. Given the conditions that developed in the second half of 1993, the Cabinet of Ministers and the National Bank of Ukraine took a number of purely administrative steps to influence the monetary and credit sphere (such as, fixing the foreign exchange rate, instituting the mandatory sale to the state of 50% of foreign exchange earnings, setting a five-percent credit limit and high quotas for mandatory reserves for liabilities for banks, etc.) Inasmuch as they are purely monetary, these measures can result in the build-up of a new inflationary potential in Ukraine, because they leave in place the deep-rooted structural problems in the economy, which are the principal causes of inflation.
