FR940921-0-00156 FR940921-0-00016 124. Section 600.113&hyph;93 of subpart B is amended by revising the introductory text and paragraphs (a), (b)(1), (b)(2) and (d), and adding new paragraph (c)(3) and (h), to read as follows: §600.113&hyph;93 Fuel economy calculations. The Administrator will use the calculation procedure set forth in this paragraph for all official EPA testing of vehicles fueled with gasoline, diesel, methanol or natural gas fuel. The calculations of the weighted fuel economy values require input of the weighted grams/mile values for total hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ); and, additionally for methanol-fueled automobiles, methanol (CH 3 OH) and formaldehyde (HCHO); and additionally for natural gas-fueled vehicles non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) and methane (CH 4 ) for both the city fuel economy test and the highway fuel economy test. Additionally, the specific gravity, carbon weight fraction and net heating value of the test fuel must be determined. The city and highway fuel economy values shall be calculated as specified in this section. A sample appears in Appendix II to this part. (a) Calculate the weighted grams/mile values for the city fuel economy test for HC, CO and CO 2 ; and, additionally for methanol-fueled automobiles, CH 3 OH and HCHO; and additionally for natural gas-fueled automobiles NMHC and CH 4 as specified in §86.144 of this chapter. Measure and record the test fuel's properties as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. (b)(1) Calculate the mass values for the highway fuel economy test for HC, CO and CO 2 , and where applicable CH 3 OH, HCHO, NMHC and CH 4 as specified in §86.144(b) of this chapter. Measure and record the test fuel's properties as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. (2) Calculate the grams/mile values for the highway fuel economy test for HC, CO and CO 2 , and where applicable CH 3 OH, HCHO, NMHC and CH 4 by dividing the mass values obtained in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, by the actual distance traveled, measured in miles, as specified in §86.135(h) of this chapter. (c) *␣*␣* (3) Natural gas test fuel shall be analyzed to determine the following fuel properties: (i) Fuel composition per ASTM D 1945&hyph;91, Standard Test Method for Analysis of Natural Gas By Gas Chromatography. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103. Copies may be inspected at U.S. EPA, OAR, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. (ii) Specific gravity (based on fuel composition per ASTM D 1945). (iii) Carbon weight fraction based on the carbon contained only in the HC constituents of the fuel=weight of carbon in HC constituents divided by the total weight of fuel. (iv) Carbon weight fraction of fuel=total weight of carbon in the fuel (i.e., includes carbon contained in HC and in CO 2 ) divided by total weight of fuel. (d) Calculate the city fuel economy and highway fuel economy from the grams/mile values for total HC, CO, CO 2 and, where applicable, CH 3 OH, HCHO, NMHC and CH 4 and, the test fuel's specific gravity, carbon weight fraction, net heating value, and additionally for natural gas, the test fuel's composition. The emission values (obtained per paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, as applicable) used in each calculation of this section shall be rounded in accordance with §86.084&hyph;26(a)(6)(iii) of this chapter. The CO 2 values (obtained per paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, as applicable) used in each calculation of this section shall be rounded to the nearest gram/mile. The specific gravity and the carbon weight fraction (obtained per paragraph (c) of this section) shall be recorded using three places to the right of the decimal point. The net heating value (obtained per paragraph (c) of this section) shall be recorded to the nearest whole Btu/lb. These numbers shall be rounded in accordance with the ``Rounding Off Method'' specified in ASTM E 29&hyph;67. * * * * * (h) For automobiles fueled with natural gas, the fuel economy in miles per gallon of natural gas is to be calculated using the following equation: E:GRAPHICSER21SE94.006 Where: mpg e =miles per equivalent gallon of natural gas. CWF HC/NG =carbon weight fraction based on the hydrocarbon constituents in the natural gas fuel as obtained in paragraph (d) of this section. D NG =density of the natural gas fuel [grams/ft 3 at 68 ○F (20 ○C) and 760 mm Hg (101.3 kPa)] pressure as obtained in paragraph (d) of this section. CH 4 , NMHC, CO, and CO 2 =weighted mass exhaust emissions [grams/mile] for methane, non-methane HC, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide as calculated in §600.113. CWF NMHC =carbon weight fraction of the non-methane HC constituents in the fuel as determined from the speciated fuel composition per paragraph (c)(2) of this section. CO 2NG =grams of carbon dioxide in the natural gas fuel consumed per mile of travel. CO 2NG =FC NG D NG WF CO2 where: E:GRAPHICSER21SE94.007 where: CWF NG =the carbon weight fraction of the natural gas fuel as calculated in paragraph (d) of this section. WF CO2 =weight fraction carbon dioxide of the natural gas fuel calculated using the mole fractions and molecular weights of the natural gas fuel constituents per ASTM D 1945.
