Some, including the opposition camp, are anxious and tense over the decision's impact on negotiations on the North Korean nuclear problem and the threat of an attack. Government officials said Seoul has long asked the Pentagon to send the defensive antimissile batteries and that the decision is unrelated to North Korea's suspected nuclear program, but voiced worries over possible tension on the Korean peninsula because of the move. Chongwadae [presidential offices] confirmed Wednesday's foreign press reports on the plan, saying it was long worked out and is just being materialized now and has no connection to the current situation on the Korean peninsula or the nuclear negotiations. Washington is looking into the delivery now in time with its withdrawal of the missiles in Europe, a presidential aide said, adding that linking the matter with the North Korean nuclear issue was seriously wrong. The Patriot system, which emerged as a hero in the Gulf war, is designed to protect airfields by knocking incoming missiles off course or destroying them in the air. Another presidential aide said deployment of the Patriot missiles is just a defense for South Korean air and sea ports, adding that he is worried that Pyongyang might "abuse" Seoul's decision. Without openly opposing the move to improve national security, the Foreign Ministry cautiously expressed worries at a possible negative effect on ongoing negotations on nuclear inspections between Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). A Foreign Ministry official said he had heard the Pentagon's idea met little opposition from the State Department, but that Washington is looking at it positively because it cannot deny a request from the senior U.S. commander in Korea. Foreign press reports say that Gen. Gary luck, chief commander of American forces in Korea, made the suggestion, which is likely to be approved by President Bill Clinton. "How can we (Seoul) oppose it when the U.S. Government has approved the plan?" asked the official. A second Foreign Ministry official said that there was a small possibility that U.S. arms dealers had some say on the issue, it will cause a controversy if Washington asks Seoul to buy Patriot missiles later. In recommending the move, Luck said that Patriot anti-missile batteries were necessary for the safety and security of the South Korean population. But there are arguments that the Patriot system, which takes quite a time to launch its anti-missile missiles, is ineffective on the Korean peninsula because of the many mountains and short distances involved. Some observers say they suspect Washington's motivation in selling the anti-missile batteries to Korea when they proved poor at shielding large populated areas from attack in the Gulf war. [sentence as received] Lawmakers are keeping a wary eye on the reported U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missile batteries in South Korea in view of the cost requirements, though they expect that the advanced system, once deployed, to counter-balance North Korea's nuclear weapons development program. Chong Chae-mun, chairman of the assembly foreign affairs and national unification committee, is for deployment of the system but says that the Patriot batteries should be removed when North Korea is cleared of nuclear suspicion. Rep. So Su-chong, DLP [Democratic Liberal Party] defense committee manager, says the effect on North Korea's nuclear development program is important and the anti-missile missiles will have the effect of pressing North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons development program. Rep. Kwak Yong-tal (DLP) calls for a cautious approach to the issue, saying the government should take into full consideration the economic burden of deployment and maintenance of the Patriot batteries. Rep. Kang Chang-song (DP) [Democratic Party] agrees to short-term deployment but wants an in-depth study of the political and strategic aspects of the presence of these anti-missile systems in the country and of the cost. His party's position is more cautious, with the DP saying the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea may provoke North Korea. Rep. Cho Sun-sung, chairman of the DP national unification and international relations committee, is worried that the presence of the missiles in South Korea may provoke Pyongyang to downgrade its relations with Seoul from bad to worse. It is desirable to make a decision on this issue after the International Atomic Energy Agency takes action on the North Korean nuclear issue in its Board of Governors meeting slated for Feb. 21, because the Patriot missile deployment issue is closely related to the North Korean nuclear issue, he says. The Patriot missile deployment plan may be considered an expression of Washington's firm stance on the North Korean nuclear issue, he adds. Rep. Yim Pok-chin (DP) says the government should approach the issue guardedly because deployment of Patriot missile batteries in relation to North Korea's nuclear development program may upset Pyongyang. Rep. Chong Tae-chol (DP) says he is worried about the proposed Patriot missile deployment in the country because it is based on North Korea's development of nuclear warheads. He also doubts the Patriot's effectiveness, quoting a report of the South Korean joint chiefs of staff as saying Patriots are not effective in intercepting North Korea's Scud missiles.
