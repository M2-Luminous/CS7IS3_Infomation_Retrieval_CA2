At present, approval is granted to those who receive irrevocable licenses of credit (L/Cs) less than the same amount from foreign buyers. The new step will reduce the financial burden on small and medium business by encouraging small-value shipments. This step was featured in a wide range of measures which the Ministry of Trade, Energy and Trade announced yesterday to ease regulations on trade, factory sites and distribution within the year. To expedite trade,the minimum amount for exports or imports which is free of government control after approval is given will be increased from the current $5,000 to $10,000 from the second half of the year as well. The permit system in the issuance of trade licenses without any restriction will be changed into a report system, thereby freeing small traders from paying commissions. In the meantime, those who export industrial facilities will be allowed to secure necessary equipment in the countries concerned. The collection of levies on exporters of industrial plants will be abolished in order to enhance their international competitiveness. Some research equipment whose imports from Japan are banned under the pretext of diversifying import sources will be lifted to expedite corporate investment in the development of high tech and high value-added products. Imports of raw materials for export will be allowed to purchase the amount which they apply to the government for. With regards to easing restrictions on the distribution industry, the minimum size of a retail or wholesale outlet subject to city or provincial approval will be increased from the current 1,000 square meters to 3,000 square meters. A negative system will be introduced only to designate business sectors whose operation in retail and wholesales shops are prohibited. Currently, the size in retail and wholesale outlets which are permitted for the service sector such as food and financing is limited to 50 percent of their total floor space. To remove obstacles to the opening of new wholesale centers, the ratio of wholesale against their turnover will be decreased from the 100 percent to 70 percent. Those, who enter the wholesale business using rented buildings, will be free from the obligation that they should use more than 10 percent of their floor space. The minimum floor space of department stores subject to government approval for their opening will be raised from the 1,000 square meters at present to 3,000 square meters. Their owners will be allowed to run 70 percent of the whole size compared with the current 100 percent.
