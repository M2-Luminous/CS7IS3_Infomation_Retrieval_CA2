The EU commissioner added that he has assured both President Glavkos Kliridhis and Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis that in case the confidence-building measures are implemented, the European Union is ready to offer any help and the EU commission will proceed in that direction with the presentation of proposals to the EU Council of Ministers.

He added that Cyprus' foreign policy will also begin to be in line with that of the European Union. Referring to the talks he had with EU Commissioner Van Den Broek, the Cypriot foreign minister described them as constructive and comprehensive.
