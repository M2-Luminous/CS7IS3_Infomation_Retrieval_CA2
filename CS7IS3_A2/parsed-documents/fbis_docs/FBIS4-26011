The document was distributed at the United Nations Security Council by the United States on Wednesday [15 June]. Kozyrev told reporters that he was confused by the fact that "American diplomats had distributed in New York a draft resolution containing a concrete list of sanctions" against DPRK. The U.S. move was made contrary to the "absolutely clear" agreement reached in a telephone conversation between Yeltsin and Clinton, as well as between their foreign ministers "to act jointly, to work on the draft resolution together and not to make unilateral initiative," Kozyrev pointed out. He stressed that "in any case we shall not support the set of sanctions proposed without a preliminary agreement with us."
