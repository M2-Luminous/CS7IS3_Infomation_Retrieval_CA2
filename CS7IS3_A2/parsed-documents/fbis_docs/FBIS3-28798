Tsutsumi, chosen by Trade Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, will be appointed to the post on approval at a cabinet meeting Tuesday, the officials said. Masahisa Naito resigned from the post in December following charges of favoritism in promoting a junior while he served as director general at the MITI minister's secretariat. In December 1992, Naito promoted Yasufumi Tanahashi, son of a former vice trade minister, to the hurriedly created post of planning officer shortly before Tanahashi quit the ministry to run in the House of Representatives election in July 1993. MITI Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano has been concurrently serving as the Industrial Policy Bureau chief since Naito resigned.
