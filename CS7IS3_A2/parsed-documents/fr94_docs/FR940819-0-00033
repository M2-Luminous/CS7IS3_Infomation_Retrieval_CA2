FR940819-0-00033 FR940819-0-00014 50 CFR Part 672 [Docket No. 931199&hyph;4042; I.D. 081594B] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for species that comprise the shallow-water species fishery by vessels using trawl gear in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), except directed fishing for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those portions of the GOA that remain open to directed fishing for pollock. This action is necessary because the third seasonal bycatch allowance of Pacific halibut apportioned to the shallow-water species fishery in the GOA has been caught. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), August 15, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., September 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael L. Sloan, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. An emergency interim rule (59 FR 6222, February 10, 1994) and subsequent extension of effective date (59 FR 24965, May 13, 1994) apportioned the Pacific halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limit for trawl gear into bycatch allowances and seasonal apportionments thereof among fishery categories. In accordance with ยง672.20(f)(3)(iii), the shallow-water species fishery that is defined at ยง672.20(f)(3)(ii)(A) was apportioned 200 metric tons of Pacific halibut PSC for the third season, the period June 30, 1994, through September 30, 1994. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with ยง672.20(f)(3)(iv), that vessels participating in the trawl shallow-water species fishery in the GOA have caught the third seasonal bycatch allowance of Pacific halibut PSC apportioned to that fishery. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for each species and species group that comprise the shallow-water species fishery by vessels using trawl gear in the GOA, except directed fishing for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those portions of the GOA open to directed fishing for pollock. The species and species groups that comprise the shallow-water species fishery are: Pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, Atka mackerel, and ``other species.'' This closure is effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., August 15, 1994, through 12 noon, A.l.t., September 30, 1994. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: August 15, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
