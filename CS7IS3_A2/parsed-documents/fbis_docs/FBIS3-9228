The agreement was signed by Moravcik (Democratic Union of Slovakia, DUS), Peter Weiss (Democratic Left Party, SDL), Jan Carnogurksy (Christian Democratic Movement, KDH), Milan Knazko (Alliance of Democrats) and Ludovit Cernak (New Alternative). The agreement is to help preserve harmony within the rather heterogeneous coalition comprising post-communists (SDL), the right-orientated KDH and the centrist bloc formed by "dissidents" from Meciar's part of Slovakia's political scene. Coalition talks are also to be attended by the Hungarian parliamentary parties, the Egyutteles movement and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Party (MKDH), which have not signed the agreement and which are not represented on the new government, but which have pledged support for it under certain conditions. MKDH Deputy Chairman Pavol Farkas said the Hungarian parties would cooperate with the new government if it fulfilled recommendations from the Council of Europe concerning the use of bilingual road sign-posts and the use of names and surnames for ethnic Hungarians, and if it carried out "certain personnel changes" at ministries and acceded to the European charter of minority languages and the charter of regional self-rule. Moravcik said he hoped the agreement would allow his government to submit to the citizens an alternative of further progress towards Slovakia's development and political stability. Under the agreement, concrete decisions will be considered by a special council consisting of the chairmen of the coalition parties and the chairmen of the party deputies' groups who will coordinate cooperation in the Parliament. Carnogursky said "the principle of consensus, that is the right of each subject to veto, will be applied in the coalition on the most important questions." He stressed the agreement contained no secret supplement like that concluded by Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS). The programme statement, which the government is to submit to the parliament within 30 days of its appointment on March 16, is expected to be a much more difficult test of its ability to reach compromise. The government will be in power until early elections are held on September 30-October 1. Cernak said the statement would be submitted to the parliament on April 12. Knazko said "today put an end to the myth that agreement could not be reached in Slovakia's political life." Cernak said the effort to reach a broader political consensus was proved by the fact that the new coalition had offered to the opposition posts in the presidium and supervisory council of the National Property Fund at which personnel changes would be carried out. The HZDS as well the SNS have already proposed their candidates, Cernak added. The new coalition commands a total of 83 votes in the 150-seat parliament if the 14 Hungarian and two independent deputies are included. Observers do not rule out that the quality of the functioning of Moravcik's government, whose initiators were united mainly by opposition to Meciar, will indicate chances of a similar coalition being formed after the early elections.
