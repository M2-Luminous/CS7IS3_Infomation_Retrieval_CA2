FR940203-0-00068 FR940203-0-00017 Response: As required by CEQ regulations, NMFS considered ``the degree to which the effects (of the proposed action) on the quality of the human environment are likely to be highly controversial'' as a factor in determining whether the intensity of the proposed action would make it ``significant.'' Because NMFS' review of the best available scientific information led to the conclusion in the EA that the proposed detonations will have a negligible impact on marine mammals and other marine resources, the fact that the commenters did not provide any new or contradictory scientific information regarding such impacts reaffirms NMFS' conclusion that there is no real scientifically-based controversy about the effects of the proposed action sufficient to change NMFS' conclusion that the proposed action would not have a significant impact on the human environment such that preparation of a DEIS would be warranted. While the Navy's ship shock testing may be opposed by many members of the public, much of that objection is due to philosophical differences of opinion rather than objective scientifically- or factually-based controversy over what will be the effects of such testing on the environment. NMFS believes that the rulemaking shows that the issuance of a small take authorization to the Navy would not have effects (intensity) that are ``highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks'' significant enough to require a DEIS. In the EA and in the Navy's small take application, the level of scientific uncertainty has been substantially lessened by incorporating scientifically acceptable environmental prediction methods as necessary. In addition, mitigation and monitoring measures incorporated into the LOA and regulations substantially moderate potential impacts from ship shock testing. The commenter states that ``among those who are criticizing the proposed detonations are knowledgeable scientists with years of experience studying affected species.'' However, other than those scientists submitting comments that have been addressed in this section, because independent scientists neither submitted significant comments addressing the science upon which the small take authorization is based when information was requested during the June 1993 comment period, nor as a result of the EA and proposed rule, NMFS is unaware of either the reasons for their purported criticism or contrary scientific evidence to support their position. Comment : The same commenter, noted that by granting the Navy's permit application, NMFS will establish a (dangerous) precedent for future action with significant effects. The commenter was concerned that future applications would require no more than was done for this application even though mitigation efforts are highly questionable as to effectiveness and that there would be no incentive for the Navy to develop more accurate detection methods (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(6)). Response : NMFS disagrees with this assessment. The mitigation measures (survey for low animal abundance areas, aerial surveys, go/no-go determination, post-detonation surveys etc.) required under these regulations are considered adequate to detect marine mammals and other marine life and limit incidental takings to the lowest possible number. In addition, the ship shock test small take authorization will be reviewed at least annually to make a determination that the taking continues to comply with section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA. While the mitigation measures in these regulations may seem ``questionable'' to some commenters, practical alternative methods for detecting marine mammals have not been recommended (see response under ``Mitigation''). Moreover, future Navy applications for a small take authorization under the MMPA will be judged on the adequacy of the documentation submitted, not on previous actions, such as this one.
