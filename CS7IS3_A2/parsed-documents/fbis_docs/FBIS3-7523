The moderate CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Diplomatic Authorities Should Watch Their Words." While positively recognizing the significance of China's new proposal, the editorial says it is "strategically and technically" inappropriate for ROK diplomats to say "yes" so promptly. The editorial questions if Minister Han had sufficient discussion with security-related ministers regarding this issue, and even if he had, the editorial says before conveying acceptance, the ROK should have persistently asked China what it will do when sanctions on North Korea become inevitable even after a UN Security Council president's statement. The editorial also mentions the possibility of having China accept more of ROK's position on economic cooperation since the ROK accepted China's opinion on the nuclear issue. The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Even Though A Cooperation System on the North Korean Nuclear Issue Is Established." The editorial criticizes that "China is using the North Korean nuclear issue to obtain better conditions in its negotiations on human rights and most-favored- nation status with the United States, and economic cooperation with the ROK." Noting that the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Russia have exerted their own efforts to resolve the nuclear issue, the editorial defines Minister Han's support without consultation with allies as a "hasty" decision. The editorial further stresses that if a statement is to be adopted, it should strongly urge North Korea to accept additional inspection, resume North-South dialogue, and provide a fixed deadline. HANGUK ILBO also publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article dispatched from UN headquarters by correspondent Kim Su-chong. The article observes that 15 member states of the UN Security Council are inclined to agree to China's proposal and that the United States would have no reason to insist on a resolution when the ROK supports the new proposal. The article then details the points to which China disagreed from the draft resolution and its proposal of "a positive, objective, and moderate expression." The article reports that interests will be focused on China's role after the statement is adopted. Recalling that China said it was not in a position to exercise influence on North Korea last year, the article analyzes that China has changed its attitude by telling the ROK permanent representative to the United Nations that "China is exerting its efforts needed in the situation" .
