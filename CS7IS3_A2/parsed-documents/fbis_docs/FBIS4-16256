In his words, the Law on Presidential Elections provides for accelerated procedures when the presidential seat becomes vacant before the scheduled time. It says nothing about electing the first president. This is why the commission adopted a resolution setting specific dates for the beginning and end of the various stages of the election campaign. The campaign will begin on 15 April, with the registration stage for initiating groups -- which will end on 24 April -- to put forward their presidential candidates. Within this period of time, the commission has to complete registration of those groups, distribute lists of the established form for collecting signatures of citizens or parliamentary deputies, and provide identification cards to members of initiating groups. A. Abramovich emphasized that only initiating group members can collect signatures, which should be done exclusively with lists of the established form. "This is necessary to prevent certain people from beginning to collect signatures ahead of time," the commission chairman said. "We have unconfirmed evidence that some of the candidates have already gathered the required number of signatures, which will not count. This is nothing more than practice." Citizens' signatures will be collected between 25 April and 14 May. According to the law, every citizen has the right to support several candidates, but can only sign once for each of them. As the commission members noted, in addition to personal signatures, the lists must include the following information: full name, home address, number of passport or other identification document. The lists should then be passed on to polling electoral commissions no later than 15 May. "The experience we acquired during the referendum shows that signatures should be verified at the polling station level," A. Abramovich said. Presidential candidates will be registered from 27 May to 2 June. In the words of A. Abramovich, the collection of signatures from parliamentary deputies may drag on until the beginning of the registration drive. After the registration, all candidates will receive 20 million rubles [R] for campaigning and an additional R10 million for aides' salaries. The commission representatives stressed that according to the Electoral Law, the state is responsible for financing the election; the use of any additional funds is prohibited. In the words of A. Abramovich, the registered parties and movements can propose their candidates for electoral commissions. However, those commissions will be set up by the executive committees at their discretion. The presidential elections will be held on 23 June.
