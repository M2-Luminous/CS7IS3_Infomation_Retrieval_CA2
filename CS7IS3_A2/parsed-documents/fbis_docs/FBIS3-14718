The Iranian embassy was reacting to the news that the Cesty publishing house intends to publish a Czech translation of "The Satanic Verses." In an interview for NOVA television, a transcript of which the Iranian embassy gave CTK, Djoneidi said that the publication of Rushdie's controversial book in the Czech Republic was not yet definite. He also said he did not believe the Czech Government inclined towards damaging good relations with Islamic countries. Relations between the Czech Republic and Iran were good, he said, and were expanding in all directions. Asked about Iran's response to the possible publication of the book in the Czech Republic, Djoneidi pointed to the official stance of the Iranian Government, according to which the work is politically motivated blasphemy against Islam and Muslims. "The publication of such an insultive book is not acceptable, but the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran will not take any measure to cause violation of international law, practice and any other internationally recognized norms," Djoneidi said. The translation and publication of "The Satanic Verses" is "the most outrageous act against Islam and Muslims all over the world, he said, adding that the book had been banned in many non-Islamic countries as well as Islamic ones, because it had been "recognized to be contrary to well known freedom principles." When the book was regarded as blasphemous by more than a billion Muslims throughout the world, it was an "obvious act of violation against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well." Another publication of the book, Djoneidi said, could only help "flame up the wickedness of the author and policies oriented against Islamic countries." "Such an assault on Islamic values could certainly endanger world peace and security, and, of course, the responsibility for any possible backfire would lie with the assaulters," the Iranian spokesman said. Asked by NOVA whether the death penalty was the only punishment with which the writer and any publishers were faced, or whether it could be substituted by other penalties, such as a financial one, Djoneidi also stressed that the religious decree (fatwa) which had been issued by the highest Iranian religious authorities was out of the reach of the government.
