FR941007-1-00002 FR941007-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy 10 CFR Part 430 [Docket No. CE&hyph;RM&hyph;93&hyph;801] RIN 1904&hyph;AA47 Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Supplemental Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Regarding Energy Conservation Standards for Three Types of Consumer Products AGENCY: Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Department of Energy. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: On September 8, 1993, the Department of Energy published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (58 FR 47326) regarding energy conservation standards for three types of consumer products. In that Advance Notice, the Department stated that it intended to consider more explicitly environmental and energy security externalities associated with alternative energy efficiency standards. Specifically, the Department expressed the intention to monetize the values of any externalized benefits (or costs) if a sound analytic basis could be found. The purpose of this notice is to solicit public comments on whether and how the Department should evaluate and consider environmental and energy security externalities that may be associated with alternative, candidate energy efficiency standards. It has three specific aims: First, it requests focused public input on specific questions related to the development and use of environmental and energy security externality values. Second, it outlines the Department's preliminary thinking in several of these issue areas in order to provide stakeholders with maximum available information. Finally, it solicits public identification of other issues relevant to the application of externality values in the context of appliance standards, so that these may be considered in appliance standards rulemakings. DATES: Written comments in response to this Supplemental Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking must be received by DOE by December 6, 1994. Oral views, data, and arguments may be presented at the public hearing on the issues raised herein to be held in Washington, DC, on November 17, 1994. Requests to speak at the hearing must be received by the Department no later than 4 p.m., November 4, 1994. Copies of statements to be given at the public hearing must be received by the Department no later than 4 p.m., November 10, 1994. The length of each presentation is limited to 20 minutes. ADDRESSES: Written comments, oral statements, requests to speak at the hearing, and requests for speaker lists are to be submitted to: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EE&hyph;431, Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products, Docket No. CE&hyph;RM&hyph;93&hyph;801, Room 5E&hyph;066, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;9127.
