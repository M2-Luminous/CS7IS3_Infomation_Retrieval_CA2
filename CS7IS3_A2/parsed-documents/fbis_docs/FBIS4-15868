The list was drawn up by the presidential administration's commission led by former People's Deputy Aleksey Surkov. According to Filatov, the listed deputies are not covered by some of the social guarantees granted in the presidential decree of 23 September 1993. The list includes those former deputies who had not stopped attending the sessions of the former Supreme Soviet before 3 October and participated in mass disturbances on 3-4 October or who incited those disturbances. The head of the presidential administration recalled that the presidential decree of 6 October 1993 instructed him personally to "establish which persons are not to be covered by the present decree..., to make decisions single-handedly in the event of any disputes." Filatov said that the persons on the list would not receive the lump-sum allowance amounting to a yearly salary, calculated on the basis of the monthly salary at the moment when the deputies' powers were terminated. In his words, it is a question of 3 to 4 million rubles to be allocated to each deputy out of the state budget, out of the people's money. As for transferring accommodations in Moscow to the ownership of former deputies, this issue will be dealt with on an individual basis, the head of the presidential administration said. He also stressed that "Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov is not a man to give away municipal apartments for free", each worth between 60,000 and 70,000 dollars at market rates. "Otherwise, it will be difficult to explain to Muscovites why we are allowing those who incited a civil war to retain their accommodations," Filatov said.
