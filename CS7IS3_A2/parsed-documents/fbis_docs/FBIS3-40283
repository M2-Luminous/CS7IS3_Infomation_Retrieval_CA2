How is Macedonia ending this year, in the area of foreign policy? [Crvenkovski] During 1993, there have been basic changes in the international position of Macedonia. At the beginning of the year, we did not belong to international organizations and very few states recognized Macedonia. We had diplomatic relations with only a few states. At the present time, the Republic of Macedonia is a member of more than 30 international organizations , including some of the largest organizations such as the United Nations, and, in particular, agencies which are of special importance such as the organization for telecommunications, UNESCO, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the IMF. Problems with the World Bank are expected to be resolved. As of now, we have diplomatic relations with 21 states and this number is increasing each day. I do not know what the number will be when this interview is published in the newspaper. I think that it can be said that this has been a successful year for Macedonia in the area of foreign policy. [Shaqiri] Despite the progress which Macedonia has achieved so far, the problem with Greece continues to be a great, and, one might say, unsolvable, problem. Is this true? [Crvenkovski] During past years, a number of problems have been created in relations between the two countries. Most of these problems seem irrational to a normal world. However, I believe that it is becoming more and more clear that obligatory mutual relations between Greece and Macedonia are necessary. I believe that the Greeks are increasingly coming to the conclusion that there is a need for good relations between the two countries. However, it is a very complex and emotional problem and it is hard to find a quick solution. Nevertheless, I believe that, because of its irrational roots, the problem can be resolved. [Shaqiri] A large number of states have recognized Macedonia. However, there is a problem with the name. Will it win or lose the battle about the name? [Crvenkovski] I believe that there are misinterpretations in regard to this problem as a result of lack of knowledge of the matter. The name is what it is and we never gave up on this name or accepted any document with any other name. [Shaqiri] There is the impression that neither one of the parties in the conflict is making any concessions. In the meantime, it is said that the two parties are ready for compromise. If this is true, what kind of compromise are they talking about? [Crvenkovski] If we dwell on this aspect of the problem, it is difficult to find any solution, so, for all practical purposes, it is impossible to resolve this problem. It must be understood that the problems are not symbolic in nature but are problems of relations between two countries. If things are seen in this light, a solution can be found. The dialog on real problems can result in a solution. [Shaqiri] However, recently, hasn't Greece been basing its entire strategy on the problem with the name? [Crvenkovski] This was characteristic of the past period but now I think that it has understood that the essence of the problem is relations between the two countries. [Shaqiri] During your visit to Washington, you met with [Secretary of State] Warren Christopher. There are indications that the Americans are insisting on a compromise with Greece. Did you discuss any such thing with Christopher? [Crvenkovski] I think that we should not give much credence to interpretations in the foreign press, in this case, the Greek press. The attitude of the United States from the beginning up to acceptance has been constant. During this time, we have had its support for the territorial integrity and stability of Macedonia. In regard to the dispute with Greece, the U.S. attitude is clear and it says that no one has the right to interfere in a country's internal affairs. At the same time, the Americans stress that this problem should be solved by dialog. [Shaqiri] How do you explain the fact that the Americans have not recognized Macedonia yet? [Crvenkovski] The recognition of a country and the establishment of diplomatic relations is a process which takes time, sometimes more and sometimes less. [Shaqiri] Why has this process taken a long time for the Americans? [Crvenkovski] It has taken a long time for rational reasons and we will see how long it will take. At this time, I cannot give any analysis of this delay. I think that the causes are well-known to our people. The support which we have from the Americans is also known. [Shaqiri] Speaking of the Americans, a while back it was said that they have set up military bases in Krivolak but, recently, according to the Greek press, they have set up military bases in Kriva Pallanke, with several thousand soldiers. What is the truth in regard to these statements? [Crvenkovski] The truth is that the Americans are participating in a United Nations operation in the framework of the mission sent by the UN. It is true that this is the first time that the Americans have participated in such a mission. It is also the first time that the UN has taken part in a mission of a preventive nature. This action has been evaluated by all the international forums as one of the most successful actions. It is clear that anyone who is thwarted by the operation would weave various tales to deny the sucess of such an action. [Shaqiri] Let us try to characterize relations with neighboring states. Let us begin with the East: Bulgaria accepts Macedonia as a state but does not accept the Macedonian nation. What does this mean, in your opinion? [Crvenkovski] Macedonia has established diplomatic relations with Bulgaria at the ambassadorial level. The idea of the nonacceptance of a nation is ridiculous to many well-informed people. The acceptance of a nation is something which does not depend on the political acts of any state. I think that this is an idea in which no basis for discussions can be found. The existence of a Macedonian nation and language is a fact which is accepted by world opinion. [Shaqiri] In your opinion, Mr. Minister, what is the northern neighbor of Macedonia? [Crvenkovski] At this time, there is an undefined situation in the international sphere and we, as UN members, respect the positions of this organization. Thus, we will go along with the development of events and the positions of the UN. [Shaqiri] I have the impression that Macedonia does not have a clear position in regard to the issue of Kosovo. Are you satisfied with this statement? [Crvenkovski] I would not be satisfied with this statement because Macedonia has a clear position in regard to all the neighboring states. This means that the foreign policy of the Republic of Macedonia is based on noninterference in the internal affairs of every state. No position could be any clearer than this. [Shaqiri] In the recent elections in Serbia, the socialists won again. Is this good or bad for Macedonia and the Balkans? [Crvenkovski] For Macedonia, it does not matter who wins the election in any state. We took this position during the Greek elections. The most important thing for us is for citizens of a state to elect the government they want. [Shaqiri] It is said that Macedonia still has close ties with Serbia. Serbia is under an embargo, but various products, such as newspapers, come into Macedonia from this state. Can these be considered to be goods? [Crvenkovski] We do not have any sort of ties with Serbia. We do not have any official relations. But, naturally, this is not good because it is in our interest to have good relations with all our neighbors. As for the press and literature, I think that a democratic state such as Macedonia is and must always be open to all the information media and to all ideas. [Shaqiri] How would you define relations with Albania? [Crvenkovski] I think that relations with Albania are following a positive course and this is illustrated by the early establishment of diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level. This would mean that relations between the two countries are normal. Of course, here, just as everywhere in the Balkans, there is a collection of inherited problems and I think that there is no lack of willingness on the part of both sides to solve existing problems. [Shaqiri] Albania has shown its willingness to eliminate visas but Macedonia has not agreed to this. Why? [Crvenkovski] The visa issue is being resolved by the two countries. A number of problems have been raised, some of them in the form of recommendations which have been given to the Albanian side for signing. I think that many issues in the area of relations between the two countries will be resolved and settled. [Shaqiri] In addition to the problems which Macedonia has in the area of foreign affairs, it has not completely resolved domestic ethnic problems. In your opinion. what would be the proper status of Albanians in Macedonia? [Crvenkovski] I cannot respond to this question in my capacity as foreign minister, but I can give you my personal opinion. In my opinion, the only solution for problems in Macedonia is the strict observance of the foundation laid by the Constitution of Macedonia. This means that Macedonia, first of all, is a citizens' state and, in a citizens' state, the rights of all citizens are equal. [Shaqiri] But what happens when it is a matter of ethnic groups, like the Albanians in Macedonia, who consider themselves to be a nation and insist on equal rights with the Macedonians? [Crvenkovski] I am a member of a liberal party and I was a liberal even before the formation of parties in Macedonia. The philosophy of every liberal party in the world is based on the fact that the individual is more important than any sort of grouping and that the rights of the individual are essential to the profile of a state. [Shaqiri] Can it be said that Macedonia has been spared, once and for all, from war? [Crvenkovski] It would be hard to say this is we consider the wars which have developed in the region. The danger of the expansion of the war is always present. I would say that Macedonia has not yet escaped this danger but, at the same time, it has done a lot to lessen this danger. [Shaqiri] What do you have to say about Zhirinovskiy's recent statement in Sofia that Macedonia should be united with Bulgaria? [Crvenkovski] Zhirinovskiy has recentlyn made a number of such statements. He is still excited after the recent elections in Russia and one might say that he has not yet begun to think like a real politician. [Shaqiri] Does his victory present any real danger for Macedonia and the Balkans? [Crvenkovski] I do not think that it presents any danger for Macedonia but, nevertheless, it brings up some topics for examination.
