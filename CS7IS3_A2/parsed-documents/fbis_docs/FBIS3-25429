Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi has "wasted little time in rejecting" the ANC concessions. "Buthelezi's stance, which contrasts with the more judicious and open-ended reaction of FA chairman Rowan Cronje, raises an important question: what concessions has the IFP made in the interests of reaching an inclusive settlement?" BUSINESS DAY Buthelezi Urged To Show Good Faith -- Whatever Buthelezi says, the ANC's latest compromise offer "is a major advance on its previous position in one crucial respect: the acceptance that regional powers and functions embodied in the interim constituion may not be `substantially diminished' by the constitutional assembly when it conducts its work after April 28," declares a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 18 February. "Less clear" is what the ANC's proposal means in respect of "the powers of regions, both exclusive and concurrent, including their powers or rights regarding taxation. The ANC is vague on what, if any, further concessions it is willing to make on the detail of these provisions, beyond that which is already on the table. In this respect, Buthelezi is entitled to complain that ANC talk of concessions may be a mirage. But it would demonstrate some good faith if he were to sit down--either personally or through his senior lieutenants and advisers--and begin negotiating that detail." SOWETAN ANC Constitutional Proposals--Referring to the constitutional proposals of the ANC, Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 18 February in a page-8 editorial says: "We have doubts whether the various component parts of the Freedom Alliance are willing to subject themselves to the will of the electorate. It seems it will be easier to negotiate a deal with the white rightwingers than homeland leaders who fear their total demise." If the latest initiatives fail it is important that leaders and the government "spell out to the country precisely what to expect and what contingency measures are to counter rightwing violence and the `resistance politics' of the IFP." WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN Warnings Signals on Irish Takeover of Argus Newspapers -- "There has been great joy in the media about the purchase of Argus Newspapers by the Irish-American soup, bean and newspaper man, Tony O'Reilly," notes a page-16 editorial in Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English for 18-24 February. "It's not all that surprising, since most of those commentators are now employed by the man." "There are some warning signals that should, nevertheless, be sounded by those who don't work for him. The first is that press reports have repeatedly cited his reputation for non-interference in editorial decisions -- except where it involves the IRA. We have heard that before, haven't we?" Secondly, "based on the experience of Tiny Rowland and Robert Maxwell, we should be wary of newspaper tycoons who befriend political. The test will come if O'Reilly's newspapers embarrass his powerful friends and endanger his business interests. We can't wait for the test!" BEELD Intimidation Must Be Stopped -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 15 February says in a page-8 editorial: "Intimidation fever is rising. At first it was only words and incitement. Now the emotional statements are becoming deeds. It is especially prevalent where politcal groups become frustrated in fear of change, and where there are no attainable alternatives to change." As examples, BEELD refers to the Afrikaner National Front's threat to put pressure on the election. This could include "`a little bit of violence' in self-defense against the ANC. They will not allow the constitution to come into operation. Then the ANC's Mr. Tokyo Sexwale warned the Freedom Alliance to be careful of their next step, adding that `in the past, we died for freedom and the liberation of our country. We will not hesitate to do so again.' And Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi openly threatened that those who ignore the demands of Inkatha must bear the consequences." "But the most despicable form of intimidation is the cowardly, anonymous right-wing threats to kidnap President F. W. de Klerk's 4-year-old grandson in protest over the manner in which the National party is leading the country towards a new dispensation." This "goes beyond the bounds of election fun. Every leader has a great responsibility to encourage his followers to exercise calm and tolerance. Offenders must be thoroughly disciplined." Zulu Demands -- "Logic and the government dictate that King Goodwill Zwelithini's demands can be dealt with inside a federal system and the interim constitution; but emotions point to a force which is increasingly threatening the unity of South Africa," says an editorial on page-8 of the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 16 February. "It is difficult to imagine how an independent, sovereigh Zulu kingdom will be accomdated without drastic changes to the present constitutional system. One gets the impression that the Zulus, under their king and Chief Minister Buthelezi (or is it the other way around?) will not be satisfied with any formula which will make them subjects. Their statements smack of cessation, even though they have not yet used the word."
