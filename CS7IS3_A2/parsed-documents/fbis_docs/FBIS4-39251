Some months ago pieces were published first im KOSTROMSKOY KRAY and then in KOSTROMSKIYE VEDOMOSTI which Yuriy Litvinov regards as spurious. In particular, his former assistant Valeriy Deryugin, in an interview with a KOSTROMSKOY KRAY correspondent, claimed that Yuriy Litvinov had violated the president's edict on the fight against corruption by enabling commercial structures to make extensive use of equipment and communications facilities in the representation's offices. Both papers also said that the president's representative in Kostroma Oblast had allegedly used military equipment in the shape of an infantry fighting vehicle to go hunting in Buyskiy Rayon. The president's representative strongly denies these and other charges.
