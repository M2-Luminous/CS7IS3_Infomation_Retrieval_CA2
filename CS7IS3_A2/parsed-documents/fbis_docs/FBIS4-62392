The total budget expenditure, revenues, and deficit were approved. The deficit stands at 36 percent of the budget. The Ministry of Defense request (backed by the Russian Federation president) that 18 trillion rubles be added to the defense budget failed to gain the requisite number of votes. Nor was any attention paid to the desperate attempts by the Duma Committee for Defense (chairman -- Sergey Yushenkov) to convince deputies that the point at issue concerned not some kind of excessive requirements but the elementary "subsistence minimum" needed by the Armed Forces to maintain the country's defense capability at the requisite level. Acting Finance Minister Mr. Dubinin used essentially the same argument to parry all arguments in the Army's favor: Any appropriation of additional sums for defense would increase the budget deficit which, in turn, would lead to a new spiral of inflation and higher prices, which would mean that everyone -- including the Army -- would end up as losers. As a matter of fact, the selfsame way to curb inflation was also chosen by the "Russia's Choice" faction and the Yabloko bloc. Recognizing the critical danger of unleashing inflationary processes with a budget deficit in excess of 40 percent, representatives of several other factions suggested different measures. For example, Sergey Glazyev (Democratic Party of Russia faction), chairman of the State Duma Committee for Economic Policy, questioned the need to spend such impressive amounts on the maintenance of the state apparatus. Furthermore, he assumes that the planned revenues from the privatization of state property have been inexplicably reduced. According to specialists, there are other ways making it possible to painlessly increase the financial support for defense, science, culture, and education. But the State Duma and the government now perceive the Army as the main "defendant" when it comes to anti-inflation security. I would imagine that there is no need to explain to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA readers -- whose knowledge of today's realities in the Armed Forces is not based on speculative surveys -- the meaning of the defense budget's reduction by a factor of 1.5 from the original estimates. Essentially this means further decrepitude of the Army's military-technical potential and curtailment of the structural changes envisaged by the military reform (the loudest shouts of "Where are the Army reforms?" come from those who refuse to allocate money for these reforms). It has to be bluntly said that the shorn defense budget will deal a crushing blow on enterprises working on military orders. We all know that there are quite a few such enterprises in the country. Workers and engineers from the defense sector have only just ended their protest actions outside Government House. They were promised real assistance. But it appears that hundreds of thousands of people are again being told to switch to a "self-survival regime." Subsidies have also been cut for the long-suffering conversion which actually degenerates into convulsion at times, while scientific and technical work in the military sphere is being frozen with consequences which are easy to calculate. But is anyone today worried about tomorrow? As a matter of fact, no specific evidence was adduced during the debate to prove that the Army was asking for excessive funding. On the other hand, there was no shortage of significant dark hints. Those who object to the 18 trillion speak of the military department's inability to properly manage the funds appropriated for defense, but it all boils down to accusations of "inflated corps of generals." There are no counterarguments at the level of professional and comprehensive analysis. Just emotions. Meanwhile, the situation among the troops is verging on the critical in many instances. Here is just one "sore spot." Much has been said about the nuclear missile-carrying Northern Fleet. Way back in August last year, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA wrote about the lamentable situation in the fleet, which is bearing the full brunt of the principle of "surplus financing." One can imagine the impact of the "shorn" budget on the combat ranks of a fleet which used to be one of the world's mightiest. I will not even attempt to explain the stubbornness with which some deputies and ministers are trying to literally finish off both the country's defense industry and the Armed Forces themselves. In the course of private conversations they display absolute understanding of the problems currently facing the Army and the military-industrial complex but, when it comes to decisionmaking time, certain corporate considerations of "big-time politics" seem to gain the upper hand. Then everything becomes simple -- blame all the failures of economic reform on the insatiable appetite of the "military monster." After all, nobody suggested the idea of maintaining the country's defense capability at exactly the level of the sum contained in the government's budget. Let backstage passions rage, let lobbyists tear each other's shirts off, but a simple point must be obvious to all deputies: The Army (whether reformed or unreformed) cannot be maintained on starvation rations. It is impossible to rush into the nuclear magazine with "shock therapy" mentality. Unfortunately, if we were to judge by the results of the vote, at least 80 State Duma deputies believe that this can be done. "This is both a strategic and a political defeat," I was told by Aleksandr Piskunov, deputy chairman of the Committee for Defense, after the sitting. "At best, the second reading will add just 1-2 trillion to the defense budget, which will not solve the problem." Even though Aleksandr Aleksandrovich did not explain who had been defeated, it is clear that it was neither the military department nor the Army. A temporary gain at the expense of Russia's defense might will hardly improve the country's ailing economy, and the loss will not be long in coming: The Army, put on financial starvation rations, will hardly be able to remain a factor of stability in the state.
