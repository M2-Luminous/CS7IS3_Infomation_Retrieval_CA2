Comprising such people as scholars, business leaders and journalists, the MITI panel is designed to coordinate Japan's views on a wide range of trade issues that may emerge under the WTO system, MITI said. Specifically, the panel will study how to enforce WTO trade rules on the domestic front and clarify Japan's stance on proposed admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by China and Taiwan, MITI said. Newly emerging trade-related issues under the WTO, such as competition, the environment, labor problems and investment, will also be on the task force's agenda, which holds regular consultations twice a year, MITI said. Recommendations by the panel could be consulted, for example, when Japan becomes a target of retaliatory trade tactics such as the United States' Super 301, a MITI official said.
