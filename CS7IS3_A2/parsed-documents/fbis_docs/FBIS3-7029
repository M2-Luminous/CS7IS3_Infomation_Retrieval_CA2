Meanwhile, the South Korean puppet army on the same days fired more than 50 shells with tank guns at the area near the demilitarized zone from Paju county, and on the 22d fired some 2,000 bullets with large-calibre machine-guns and automation rifles, advancing towards the Military Demarcation Line from Paju County and Yonchon County. They launched exercises for surprise strike at the targets and disturbance in the rear, repeatedly dropping "commandoes" in Paju county on March 21 and 22. The tension on the Korean peninsula is being screwed up by the war provocative moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets at a time when the schemes for "sanctions" against the DPRK are being hatched up in the arena of the United Nations and the U.S. aggression forces are moving towards the Korean peninsula from the U.S. mainland and U.S. military bases in the Pacific region.
