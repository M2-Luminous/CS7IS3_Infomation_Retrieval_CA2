Bosnian Serb Vice-President Nikola Koljevic, who headed the delegation, said to reporters that the issue had been discussed into detail, with a very concrete plan and lists of names. `We believe that talks on this subject are highly important because they will be the first indication in the next few days of whether an agreement on ending hostilities will be signed or not,' said Koljevic. The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and the European Union [EU] on Friday called the warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina to sign a four-month truce which would give them an opportunity to reach agreement on a territorial division of Bosnia on the basis of the E.U. formula granting 51 percent of the Bosnian territory to the Moslems and Croats, and 49 to the Serbs. The ICRC official said after the meeting that he expected Bosnia's Moslem-Croat federation on one side and the Bosnian Serbs on the other to show good will in connection with an agreement on the exchange of prisoners. He insisted that visits to prisoners should continue as well as the inspection of condition in which they are held. Health Minister Dragan Kalinic, who also attended the meeting, said that the Serb side had insisted on getting information about hundreds of Serb prisoners who have been held captive in a silo in the Moslem village of Tarcin in central Bosnia for more than a year. The talks also tackled the question of 16 Serb doctors and medical staff in Sarajevo who were last autumn prevented from being evacuated from the city and whom the Moslem authorities arrested and sentenced to two years in prison because of their alleged refusal to comply with the work obligation, Kalinic said.
