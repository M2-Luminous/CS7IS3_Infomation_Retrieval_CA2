Alarcon spoke after a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of the first Cuban Constitution, which was signed in this town during the independence war against Spain. The ceremony was a celebration of the origins of the Cuban nationality. At Constitution Plaza in Guaimaro, some 500 km from Havana, Alarcon stressed the similarity between the current struggle of the Cuban people to maintain their social project and the ideals of the founding fathers who established the motherland. Alarcon asserted that amid the difficulties Cuba is facing, the effort to perfect the Cuban socialist program is still pursued in difficult and unpredictable times. Alarcon recalled that from the very beginning of Cuba's struggle to gain its independence from Spain the island was threatened by the ambitions of the United States, the same country that is now trying to smother the social system that was able to fulfill the dreams of the founding fathers. He pointed out that following the historic principles of Cuban legislation, Cuban deputies will examine on 1 May the serious economic and financial problems of the island to seek viable solutions to improve the current situation. Alarcon underscored that the constituent assembly of Guaimaro made provisions to guarantee the equality of Cuba as a nation and that of all Cuban citizens among themselves to achieve the national ideal: the homeland, "the same one that we defend today on an island besieged as in the past century." Education Minister Luis Ignacio Gomez; Julian Rizo Alvarez, first secretary of the Cuban Communist Party in Camaguey; and Camaguey Mayor Evis Blas Gonzalez also attended the ceremony.
