The decision was made after the more than 464 members of the National Association of Processing Industry (Canacintra) executive commission and board of directors decided to vote in favor of a motion proposed by its president, Victor Manuel Terrones Lopez. During the meeting, Terrones urged all Canacintra members not to allow any nonfulfillments regarding the Stability, Competitiveness and Employment Pact (Pece) "because at this time, the country's situation is quite delicate." As a result of the manufacturers' concern prompted by recent developments in Mexico, Terrones Lopez said now more than ever it is necessary for the country's industrial sector, regardless of beliefs or affiliation, to join forces with the president in order to strengthen the nation. He added it is not the president who is in jeopardy now but, rather, the entire nation. "We must unite so we can reclaim the levels of social peace, justice, and liberty we once enjoyed only a few months ago," he said. Replying to a question by a member who participated in the monthly Canacintra meeting on 22 March on whether the president had requested support from the manufacturers, Terrones Lopez responded the president had not so requested. He added, nevertheless, it was Canacintra's obligation to support the country and that if they had to, they would back the president. Likewise, the Canacintra leader requested its members remain calm, saying the country's authorities were already taking the necessary measures to prevent the country from falling apart. The Canacintra president urged his associates not to become too apprehensive, saying, "at this time it is important for us to work." He said apprehension is the first step in demoralizing a country or making it deteriorate further. He promised the more than 464 Canacintra manufacturers there will be peace and that they will seek to ensure certainty "but that no way will they abandon President Salinas." During the meeting, it was agreed that all delegates throughout the Mexican republic would immediately contact their respective state governments to offer support. Likewise, they would conduct a campaign to urge all sectors of the country to remain united to support the institutions. They reiterated their commitment, respect, encouragement, and unrestricted support to the president concerning the measures he may adopt to clarify the events troubling the nation. Terrones said the country's manufacturers are aware the economic program has been adequate and that from that viewpoint we can conclude there is a need for the manufacturing sector to integrate, and "in this we will not fail."
