The declining dollar accompanied by rising U.S. interest rates is forcing payment of the piper for high valuations of financial instruments that were previously supported by a surfeit of U.S. investment funds. Financial authorities in Japan, the United States, and Europe have bolstered their coordination of policy actions, are desperately attempting to mollify market instability, and are now engaged in the hazardous venture of determining whether they can restrain the disruptive actions of the huge money supply created by low-interest policies. Focus on Rise in U.S. Interest Rates Bidding for 10-year U.S. notes issued by the U.S. Treasury on the 11th did not go well and securities dealers complained, "No one is placing orders to buy." Domestic and international investors disregarded the offerings even though the groundwork had been laid beforehand through actions such as coordinated market intervention by Japan, the United States, and Europe in the purchase of dollars and intensified coordinated actions in the area of interest policy. Financial market sources are showing nervousness ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting of 17 May, asking, "When is the Federal Reserve Board [FRB] going to raise the federal discount rate?" The prevailing view is that the U.S. consumer price index will rise no more than 3 percent in both 1994 and 1995. Even Merrill Lynch economist Mr. Steinberg estimates that "the U.S. economy is undergoing steady noninflationary growth." Nevertheless, U.S. long-term interest rates have risen 1 percent since the beginning of the year and the rise in interest rates continues unabated along with tightening measures taken by the FRB. Chairperson Laura Tyson of the U.S. presidential Council of Economic Advisers seems to be saying that the markets are responding erroneously, as she says, "The financial markets are reacting excessively to inflationary ghosts." Hirohiko Okumura, Nomura Research Center research director, takes the view that "the U.S. financial authorities themselves are responsible for triggering the market turbulence." The FRB's ultra-low-interest-rate policies of keeping real interest rates near zero percent for the last two years created the bubble in financial assets. Invest trusts recruited funds from ordinary households and went on a buying spree for domestic and international bonds and stock. Taking the road to full-scale recovery for the U.S. economy brought an end to low interest rates. The rise in interest rates triggered a withdrawal from investment trusts, and in March caused a net withdrawal of $7.7 billion from bond investment trusts and a drop of one-half in the flow of funds into stock investment trusts to a level of $6.7 billion compared to the preceding month. Dollar Being Sold Despite Recovery in Economy Financial and stock markets in Asia, Central and South America, and Europe dropped substantially as the flow of funds from the United States slowed. The international capital flow which had been sustained by the excess money supply in the United States underwent a sudden, simultaneous shut off. When the tempo of the U.S. economic recovery accelerates and interest levels rise, it should trigger dollar-buying, but the markets have begun to contrarily interpret such trends as reason to sell the dollar. It seems that the thinking affecting the markets includes the idea that "expansion of domestic demand equals a rise in imports equals an expansion of international balance-of-payments deficits equals a decline of the dollar" or "expansion of domestic demand equals tightening of the labor supply and demand ratio equals a rise in the inflation rate equals a rise in long-term interest rates and a drop in the value of dollar." According to Japanese economists who visited the United States recently, U.S. business attitudes which promptly look for price hikes whenever demand rises remain unchanged as consumers undergo a waiting period before delivery of new vehicles and hikes in selling prices become widespread. The tolerance of a strong yen by U.S. monetary authorities as a way to correct imbalances between Japan and the United States has now boomeranged on the United States in the form of a decline in confidence in the dollar. Japanese institutional investors such as life insurance companies are hesitant about buying U.S. bonds. It could be said that the only money now being made available to compensate for the recurring U.S. deficit is that flowing into the United States through the coordinated buying of the dollar by overseas central banks. Key To Restraining Inflation Although Japan and Europe have beefed up coordinated actions to stabilize the dollar from the interest rate aspect by assuming financial easing policies, they have failed to eliminate the market psychology of a cheaper dollar. Japan Industrial Bank's International Financial Research Department's Deputy Chief of Research Yasunori Nagai comments, "The recent drop in the dollar is a major U.S. issue wherein they've been forced to pay the piper because of ultra-easing financial policies." The key to recovery of confidence in the dollar rests with U.S. policy to restrain inflation, but the Clinton administration has chosen CEA member Alan S. Blinder, a growth advocate, to replace FRB Vice Chairman David Mullins, who was an advocate of stable prices. The markets' interpretation of the U.S. Government as stressing growth and neglecting restraint of inflation is undermining moves towards financial tightening. The U.S. Government has treated the low long-term interest rates as evidence of confidence in its economic policies, but long-term interest rates have risen to about 7.5 percent, the highest level since the current administration took office. Turbulence in the markets is a reflection of the fragility of the strategies being used to provide a soft landing for a U.S. economy moving towards being overheated and of the precarious nature of the reliance being placed on U.S. economic expansion to improve the global economy.
