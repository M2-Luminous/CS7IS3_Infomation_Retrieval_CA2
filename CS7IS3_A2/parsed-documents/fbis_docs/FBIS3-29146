Takemura made the remark on a TV Asahi debate program, referring to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's comments on the issue in Washington in connection with possible sanctions against Pyongyang for refusing to accept international inspections of its nuclear facilities. In a press conference in Washington on Saturday, after a breakfast meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Hosokawa expressed reservations in ordering a halt to the remittances, saying "I have not obtained a precise figure to show how much has been remitted from Japan." "The government has to decide on its actions by taking into consideration the issue of human rights (of Korean residents)," Hosokawa said. Takemura said, "the actual situation of remittances of Korean residents in Japan is not clear and thus (we) do not know what kind of steps are there (to halt them)." "Hosokawa would have expressed the difficulty (in doing so) because (the matter) involves human right problems and money moves around the world," the chief government spokesman said. Talks between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog, have been deadlocked because of Pyongyang's resistance to IAEA inspections of facilities suspected of developing nuclear weapons.
