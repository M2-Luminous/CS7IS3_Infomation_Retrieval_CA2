The Spanish political-parliamentary delegation, headed by Ernest Luch, was informed in detail by Markovic about the genesis and strategy of Albanian separatism in Kosmet and efforts by Serbia to normalize the situation in this province. A strong separatist movement has been active for decades in Kosmet, where ethnic Albanians are the majority population. Ethnic Albanian political leaders urge the secession of this province from Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its annexing to neighbouring Albania. The Spanish MP's, who have been touring former Yugoslavia for several days in order to collect information about developments and possibilities for a peaceful and just resolving of the crisis in this region, had talks in Belgrade on Saturday with a delegation of the republic of Serb Krajina, which was headed by Vice-Premier Stojan Spanovic. The Spanish delegation was informed about the history of the republic of Serb Krajina on the basis of data from works published by foreign historians and cartographers and figures of the Roman Catholic Church, which testify to the centuries-long compactness of the ethnic presence of the Serb people in the current territory of Krajina. The Spanish representatives said that these figures were generally ignored abroad. The Krajina delegation pointed out that the international community should accept the right of the Serb people to self-determination in agreement with the United Nations Charter, because Serbs in Krajina will never again agree to be governed by Croatia. The republic of Serb Krajina was formed in 1991 in Serb-populated parts of Croatia in answer to Croatia's forcible secession from former Yugoslavia and attempts to reduce the Serb people to a national minority. The republic of Serb Krajina has been a U.N. Protected Area since March of 1992.
