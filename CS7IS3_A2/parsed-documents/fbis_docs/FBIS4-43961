They said they would continue political activities abroad and could even consider asking [for] political asylum. Diplomatic sources said that with the closing down of the country's only Kurdish-based party and the possible defection of elected members of parliament, Turkey's international human rights record was expected to receive a serious blow. Friday's development came a day after the Constitutional Court permanently disbanded the Democracy Party (DEP) and ordered the seizure of all its assets and properties. The decision was taken unanimously by members of the supreme court after approximately ten hours of debate. "Turkey, by closing down the DEP, has shown that it is not a democratic judicial state," a statement issued by the deputies in Brussels said. "We will stay and be the voice of our imprisoned friends and of our disbanded party," added Remzi Kartal, deputy for Van province. The party's attorney Hasip Kaplan and Turkish Human Rights Association (IHD) chairman Akin Birdal said in Ankara on Friday that Thursday's verdict was of a political nature. "The right of Kurdish people to express themselves in the Turkish Parliament has been snatched out of their hands," both said. The verdict caused an immediate reaction among human rights activists around the world as the closure decision was taken only because of two speeches made by a former party official and a written statement issued by DEP. Late Thursday evening, a court official told journalists that the verdict was based on speeches made by DEP former chairman Yasar Kaya in Bonn, Germany and Irbil, northern Iraq. The final reason for the closure was a statement titled "Appeal for Peace" issued by DEP last year. All were deemed as violations of the Constitution and the Political Parties law. Kaplan told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS on Friday that although the verdict was related to the two speeches Kaya had made, the former DEP leader was still on trial for the same speeches and had not yet been found guilty. According to the verdict, a total of 13 members of parliament from the now-defunct party are to lose their parliamentary status as soon as the decision is published in the Official Gazette. The decision opens the way for an immediate prosecution by the State Security Court of eight DEP deputies out of which only two remain in Ankara. Hours before the verdict was announced, six members of parliament moved to Brussels. Five are still in prison since early March, waiting to be indicted after their immunity was lifted on March 2 by Parliament. According to the constitution, Turkey would have to hold by-elections if 24 out of the 450 seats in parliament are vacant. Currently there are eight vacant seats but this will go up to 21 once the court verdict is published in the Official Gazette. Kaplan and the two free DEP deputies Selim Sadak (Sirnak) and Sedat Yurttas (Diyarbakir) argued Friday that this was one reason why the court had not included four other former DEP deputies in its verdict. "They were members of the party when the case was launched but now they claim they were not. This is being done only to avoid by-elections and show that the case is a political case," Kaplan said. Currently DEP deputies Hatip Dicle (Diyarbakir), Orhan Dogan (Sirnak), Sirri Sakik (Mus), Ahmet Turk (Mardin) and Leyla Zana (Diyarbakir) are in prison waiting to be put on trial--all to face a prosecutors demand for capital punishment related to opinions they have expressed in written and verbal form. DEP deputies Naif Gunes (Siirt), Remzi Kartal (Van), Mahmud Kilinc (Adiyaman), Nizamettin Toguc (Batman), Ali Yugit (Mardin) and Zubeyir Aydar (Siirt) are in Brussels. Only one of the four deputies formerly related to DEP, Mahmut Alinak of Sirnak province, is in detention but he as well as Mehmet Emin Sever (Mus), Muzaffer Demir (Mus) and Mahmut Uyanik (Diyarbakir will maintain their parliamentary seats. Next week, the DEP deputies who have sought asylum in the West will start to apply to international bodies against the Constitutional Court decision. According to the party's lawyers, they will first apply to the Strasbourg human rights court and will be making their application on three grounds. First they will argue that the decision was based upon the 1982 constitution which is the product of the Sept. 12. 1980 transition regime and thus a military constitution and that the verdict completely depended on crimes of opinion. Secondly, they will argue that the party was closed down owing to statements made by its former chairman and that according to the individuality of crime, 13 members of parliament are being "punished" for crimes committed by another individual. Thirdly, they will demand compensation. According to Kaplan the party had previously applied to the court asking for a postponement of the verdict pending the result of a parliamentary effort to amend the Turkish constitution. Kaplan said Thursday's decision showed that this petition had been rejected but that the court had not even given an explanation. On Wednesday all deputies, provincial and district executives of DEP had submitted their resignations to avoid being banned from founding or heading a new party for at least ten years.
