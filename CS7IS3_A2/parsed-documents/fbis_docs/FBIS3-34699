They want to see how they will benefit amid economic problems in the Gaza Strip that include high unemployment. A senior government source says Gen. Rothschild spoke of internal strife within Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah organization -- those loyal to the peace process at odds with those who continue to hoard arms. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says the PLO negotiators holding talks with Israel on the Gaza-Jericho First plan are personally threatened. They do not have much room to maneuver in making decisions. A senior diplomatic source adds that Palestinian delegates have received death threats. And Minister Yosi Sarid, a member of the Peres team that signed the Cairo security agreement with the PLO last week, said Israel must take into account the duress of the Palestinian negotiators. Taking into account the recent spate of Palestinian attacks on Israelis, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said the question of whether to tighten the closure imposed on the territories last year is to be considered. The police are calling for steps that include limiting the number of Palestinian vehicles allowed to enter Israel from the territories and, once again, raising the minimum age of Palestinians permitted to cross over. Army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, told the cabinet the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has not yet come to the conclusion that the closure should be tightened, or that a complete closure should be imposed. But, he said, the Army is ready to reconsider whether such steps should be taken. [Jerusalem Israel Television Network Channel 1 in Hebrew at 1800 GMT on 13 February, in a report by political correspondent Gadi Sukenik, carries a recording of Minister Shim'on Shetrit's remarks to reporters after the 13 February cabinet meeting: "When we discuss the permanent arrangement, we will insist that no separate, independent Palestinian state is to be established." [Sukenik adds that "Minister Peres' remarks on the need for Israelis to discuss the evacuation of the Netzarim and Dugit settlements despite the agreement which leaves them in place, caused a controversy in the government."]
