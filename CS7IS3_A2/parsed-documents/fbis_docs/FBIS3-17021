Perry in Moscow, comprising report by Aleksandr Khokhlov and report by Leonid Krutakov and Dmitriy Kulik under the general heading: "The Russian Army Will be Getting Patrons From the United States"] [Text] [Khokhlov report] After the talks in Moscow with U.S. Defense Secretary W. Perry, Pavel Grachev said that Russia could join the NATO "Partnership For Peace" program at the end of the month. But, as might have been expected, there are many difficulties and provisos. Grachev was not very complimentary about the NATO "Partnership For Peace" program in his conversation with his U.S. colleague. In the very near future, Pavel Grachev said, Russia will be presenting to NATO (and to the United States as well, of course) its "amendments" to the "Partnership," to the effect that it does not wish to and cannot sacrifice its geopolitical interests to the interests of other states. When Russia will be submitting its proposals on implementation of the NATO program the Russian Federation defense minister did not specify. After a reasonably brief conversation in the company of others, Grachev and Perry withdrew. The word is that the ministers went through the Ukrainian nuclear weapons situation and Russia's geopolitical problems in the Caucasus and Central Asia with a fine-tooth comb. [Krutakov and Kulik report] According to senior Pentagon officials accompanying W. Perry, the "Partnership" program will develop in two basic areas: U.S. assistance in the conversion of the Russian defense industry and the creation of private Russian-American joint ventures based on Russian military-industrial complex enterprises. One promising area is the closure of research laboratories and curtailment of scientific studies in Russia as no longer needed, for example, in the nuclear weapons sphere. It was stressed that the United States will get access to the Russian market and Russia will get goods. It is a tempting prospect, particularly as the Americans are promising assistance in the construction of housing for discharged Russian servicemen. But it looks very much like one-way traffic. For example, Pentagon representatives did not explain why the program does not provide for the establishment of joint enterprises based on U.S. military-industrial complex plants. And asked why the rate of conversion last year was 68 percent in Russia compared with three percent in the United States, the answer was that in the United States conversion problems are linked to the problem of employment. In this context, it would be more logical to call the "partnership" "patronage." We are not calling for a return to the days of the cold war. But, to use William Perry's expression, Russian and the United States are acting simultaneously as partners and rivals within the framework of the new program. Until recently U.S. assistance to Russia took the form of a few inspection tours of Russian military-industrial complex enterprises and nuclear centers.
