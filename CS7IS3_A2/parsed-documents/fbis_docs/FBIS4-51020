[Reporter] Secretary General Zhu, would you please give an overall account of Chairman's Li tour of the four Nordic nations and Belgium? [Zhu Xun] At the invitation of the Governments of Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and the Belgian Senate and Chamber of Representatives, Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, made an official goodwill visits to these five nations from 2 to 21 May. During the tour, Chairman Li met leaders of the five nations; had extensive exchanges with people from all walks of life in the five nations; visited some industrial, agricultural, transportation, and energy facilities, enterprises, schools; received representatives of Overseas Chinese communities, foreign nationals of Chinese descent, and Chinese students studying abroad; and called on the personnel of Chinese embassies in the five nations. Chairman Li was also invited to speak in Sweden and Belgium on China's reform, opening up, and the modernization drive and its foreign policy. Governments and parliaments of the five nations took Chairman Li's visits seriously and accorded him warm and friendly receptions. The visits achieved the goal of enhancing understanding, expanding exchanges, and increasing friendship and cooperation. They were a complete success. [Reporter] Would you please tell us more about the achievements of the visits? [Zhu Xun] Chairman Li's visits are the first to Western and Northern Europe by a chairman of the CPPCC National Committee. They represent a major step on the part of the CPPCC toward expanding international exchanges and cooperation. The achievements are numerous, and the three major ones are as follows: First, mutual understanding and friendship between China and the five nations were enhanced. Chairman Li had frank and friendly [tan cheng you hao 0982 6134 0645 1170] exchanges of views with leaders of the five nations on further expanding bilateral relations and on some major current international issues, reaching a common understanding with them on many of the issues. Chairman Li briefed them on China's current economic situation. While fully affirming the progress China has made, he pointed out the difficulties and complexities involved in carrying out socialist modernization in a big country like China, stressing the need to keep a consistent grip on the intensity of reform, the speed of development, and the degree of stability and to balance the relations between reform, development, and stability. He told them that China is contributing to world peace and progress with its endeavors for stability and development. All the leaders of the five nations spoke highly of the tremendous achievements China has made in economic construction, reform, and opening up and expressed understanding of the measures the Chinese Government has taken to preserve social stability. Paying serious attention to China's growing role and influence in international affairs, they said that they wished to expand exchanges and dialogues and continue developing economic cooperation and trade with China. Addressing issues on human rights and Tibet that were raised by the other parties in one form or another, Chairman Li gave a systematic account of China's basic stance on human rights and reaffirmed China's solemn stand on Tibet. Second, we deepened our understanding of the five nations' economic and social conditions. During his tour, Chairman Li specifically observed the political, economic, and social conditions of the five nations. There is much in their methods in science and technology, education, economic management, and other areas that we can make use of in implementing modernization and establishing a socialist market economic system. Third, we expanded the CPPCC's influence. The five nations knew very little about the CPPCC. On many occasions during the visits, Chairman Li briefed leaders of the five nations on the people's congress system and the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC, which make up the basic forms of China's socialist democracy. In addition to the ruling CPC, China has eight democratic parties which participate in state and government affairs. They cooperate closely with the CPC on one hand and supervise one another on the other. The CPPCC serves as a major organization for implementing the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC. This has enabled the five nations and the international community at large to have a better understanding of the political construction of China's socialist democracy, the characteristics and strong points of the CPPCC -- an organization unlike either China's people's congress or the parliament of the West -- and China's political party system. [Reporter] What are your impressions of Chairman Li's successful visits? [Zhu Xun] As cultural traditions, social systems, ideology differ from country to country, it is inevitable that nations will have differences on some issues. Frequent exchange of visits and contacts between senior leaders and dialogue based on mutual respect will help us seek common ground while putting aside differences, enhance mutual understanding, dispel misunderstandings, and reach an understanding. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: The CPPCC should take initiative and make vigorous efforts in promoting international friendly exchanges. These visits have demonstrated the importance of Comrade Xiaoping's theory. The CPPCC, being both an official and nonofficial organization, has a special role to play in China's international exchanges. In the past, the CPPCC made major contributions in developing China's friendship and cooperation with people of the world and in creating a good international image for China. In the future, it should take full advantage of its unequaled superior features in promoting international cooperation and exchanges and in creating a favorable international environment for China's economic development. Accompanying Chairman Li on his tour were officials of the democratic parties and local CPPCC committees and other public figures. This reflects how broadly represented the CPPCC is. During the visits, these comrades did a great deal of useful work with good results. Their inclusion in the visits itself demonstrates the special features of the political construction of China's socialist democracy. The CPPCC should review experience in this regard in its dealings with foreign nationals or organizations in the future.
