This is the 11th delivery of the deadly freight from the company engaged in nuclear waste disposal. The Mayak production association has already received 200 tonnes of waste. According to a Norwegian ecological organization, there are about 30 tonnes of plutonium at Mayak's stores. Russian authorities have told the international organization Greenpeace that Mayak does not have the necessary licence entitling it to reprocess this specific material, and therefore the International Atomic Energy Association does not consider itself responsible for supervizing the reprocessing of waste. This report was supplied by the European-Asian News Agency.
