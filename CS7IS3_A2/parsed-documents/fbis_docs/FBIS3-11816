Honduras has been adversely affected by a series of incidents aimed at pressuring the government and which concern the population in general. The actions that have been carried out range from strikes in the processing industry areas (assembly plants), cement industries, high schools, and freight transportation to multiple cases of trespassing, especially in the capital of the Republic. As for the labor strikes, especially those in the two cement plants operating in the country, the situation is creating a crisis in the construction industry and immediately generating unemployment for more than 100,000 workers. The trespassing into the city's communal and private lands obstructs its orderly growth and creates difficulties for local authorities, who are in charge of urban development policies and who face the problem of being unable to evict the invaders because they do not have a police force. The strikes at the high schools are due to the student's rejection of compulsory military service just as the Armed Forces would like to maintain it. Likewise, the constant increase in family basket prices is the focal point of constant demonstrations by the various mass organizations, who conduct protest marches in front of the Economy Ministry and the downtown streets of Tegucigalpa. The military, however, views these events with indifference and even though several of these events have led to violence, the public security forces have not taken any action. The attitude of the Honduran Army is considered by the different sectors of society to be a pressure mechanism to avoid the reforms announced by President Carlos Roberto Reina aimed at turning compulsory military service into voluntary service. Likewise, the military officers' budget has been adversely affected because it will be reduced by 10 percent this year. In view of all these incidents which could create situations of anarchy in Honduran society, President Carlos Roberto Reina ordered the Armed Forces today to cooperate in maintaining public order. Adolfo Facusse, the top Honduran business leader, and Tegucigalpa Mayor Roberto Acosta said that if the Armed Forces do not want to take any action in view of the situation experienced in the country, the existence of certain posts makes no sense "and are good for nothing," according to Mayor Acosta. The top military hierarchy said their reason for not interfering in the different actions being carried out in the country is they do not want to show a lack of respect for the human rights policy, which is a priority for the current Honduran Government. Police Chief Colonel Mario Hung Pacheco said the military officers are learning to coexist with "the new policy of respect for human rights" and that is why they have to be very careful in their actions. He pointed out that they will only intervene in those actions where their presence is requested through a judicial order or at the explicit request of the president of the Republic.
