Moshenko, reported by N. Davydov: "Wages at the Right Time"] [Text] The continuing recession in transport services and the inoperative payment mechanism are not giving railroad workers any hope for a peaceful life. Despite the fact that continuous service is being provided for freight and passengers, the sector's economic situation is very disturbing. As First Deputy Minister O.A. Moshenko emphasized in opening a recent selector conference, roughly one-third of the wages for March still had not been financed by 12 May, although it is already time to pay the wages for April. We have written repeatedly about the reasons for this. The problem of problems is the shortage of "ready" money in the railroads' income accounts because of their clients' insolvency. It has already become the rule that at best, half of the funds earned are in money, and the remainder are in reciprocal credits, the output of debtor enterprises, and so forth. And in order to pay all the wages for March and half of April, let us say, by the end of May, it is necessary to have no less than 924 billion rubles [R], or 57 percent of all receipts from transportation services, in the accounts. But if it is taken into account that the railroads received less than 42 percent of their planned earnings in cash in April, it becomes clear how difficult it will be to resolve the problem. Without painstaking work every day to reduce the debt owed to the railroads, to reduce expenses and increase incomes, to bring maintenance personnel into conformity with the volume of transportation, and to bring down the costs from loads that are not safeguarded and fines for delays in freight deliveries, and so forth, it will be difficult to count on positive results. But after all, we have to finance not only the wage fund for the railroads and the plants, but manage the funds deducted for social needs (social insurance, the pension fund, medical insurance, and other items--39 percent altogether) and taxes for the state budget. The situation is aggravated because a number of railroads have permitted an unjustified wage increase, so to speak, over the amount granted by the Wage Agreement. The increasing expenses for these purposes have been made a catalyst to a certain extent for delaying the periods for settlement with labor collectives. The wage fund was exceeded by more than R14 billion in the first quarter (in relation to December 1993) on the October and Sverdlovsk railroads. The overexpenditure was half of this but still quite substantial on the West Siberian and Far Eastern railroads. As we see, the rates exceed the ones planned. The MPS [Ministry of Railways] and the trade union central committee have been forced to make adjustments, since the faster indexing of wages is making the task of eliminating the payments debt even more difficult. Especially as the right to warning indexation was stipulated by the Wage Agreement only for the first quarter, but managers of the Gorkiy, Kemerovo, Sverdlovsk, and certain other railroads raised wages by 12 to 17 percent in April. Although the predicted increase in consumer prices (in conformity with which indexing should be conducted in the second quarter) was no more than 10 percent and actually was less than 9 percent. All this has had a negative effect on attempts to completely eliminate the indebtedness for wages, and only the Moscow and Kaliningrad railroads are paying them on time at present. This is a serious problem for nearly all the other railroads. Which has been confirmed by statements made by the mainlines' managers, in fact. Nevertheless, the railroads have been supporting the strategic line proposed by the ministry--to bring the schedule for wage payments back to normal by Railroad Workers' Day. In short, the essence of the strategy is as follows. The wages for March should be paid in full before 20 May, the April wages should be paid by 15 June, the wages for May should be paid by 5 July, and the wages for June should be paid by 30 July. So with June's wages, we begin a normal routine for payment. That is, over a period of 2 and a half months, we have to collect R3.3 trillion in money from clients; this will be 48.8 percent of the earnings planned for this period. The task is very difficult, but as discussion has shown, it can be accomplished. It was stressed in particular that the sum designated is adequate under the condition that not 1 ruble will go toward other needs. Realistically this cannot be achieved, and for this reason, the task set is to obtain no less than 60 percent of the earnings in money. In addition, to more fully utilize other sources to obtain money. First of all, to sell the products received in payment for debts more expeditiously. This can yield about R100 billion every month. Secondly, through other proceeds (local incomes, fines, various services, and so forth), the monthly increment may amount to no less than R80 billion. And finally, the ministry has urged a more active effort to recover debts from so-called other clients. In the system as a whole, they now owe R1.77 trillion. This is a difficult task, but transport cannot continue to operate in debt. As O.A. Moshenko emphasized, the credits, debts, and earnings--everything should be accounted for specifically now. Each railroad manager should have a detailed plan on the table and daily supervision is essential to carry it out. Participants in the conference came to the conclusion that in the system as a whole, the amount of "ready" money in the railroads' income accounts must be increased by 6 percent in order to finance wages in conformity with the schedule adopted. But this is an average. The Sakhalin, Transbaykal, and Baykal-Amur railroads must have 65 to 75 percent more of such earnings. Collectives of the West Siberian, Krasnoyarsk, East Siberian, Far Eastern, and Kuybyshev railroads will also have to make a serious effort to work this out. We cannot fail to mention that the situation in the plants is even worse than in transport service itself. Of course, the sums needed here are less, but it is no easier for workers at the enterprises. But in the figure cited above--R3.3 trillion--funds have also been provided to pay the wages of workers at the ministry's plants. Serious claims have been made against the managers of loading railroads who sometimes "forget" about their financial obligations with respect to the transit railroads. And there is a special question--recovery of debts from the railroad administrations of the CIS countries, which are already over R400 billion. Summing up the discussion, the first deputy minister called upon the railroad managers to show that they are more demanding toward their clients and not to bypass nontraditional incomes which are "beckoning" directly to railroad workers. But the main objective is to look for and find uncommon means of increasing incomes and reducing expenses.
