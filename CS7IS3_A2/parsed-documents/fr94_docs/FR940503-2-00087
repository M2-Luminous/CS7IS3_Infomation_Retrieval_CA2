FR940503-2-00087 FR940503-2-00060 Geological Survey Technology Transfer Act of 1986; Proposed Cooperative Research and Development Agreement Negotiations AGENCY: United States Geological Survey, Interior. ACTION: Notice of proposed cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) negotiations. SUMMARY: The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is planning to enter a cooperative research and development agreement with several major oil companies. The purpose of the CRADA is to conduct geological field studies on Devonian and Carboniferous carbonate reefs and carbonate platforms in Kazakhstan that will lead to the development of predictive petroleum-focused models that can serve as useful analogs for interpreting the subsurface nature of facies belts, stratigraphic cyclicity, and distribution of potential reservoir, seal, and source-rock facies in the North Caspian basin and in other carbonate basins of the former Soviet Union. Any other oil companies or organizations interested in pursuing the possibility of a CRADA for similar kinds of activities should contact the USGS. ADDRESSES: Inquiries may be addressed to the Chief, Branch of Sedimentary Processes, U.S. Geological Survey, Box 25046, MS 939, Denver Federal Center, Denver, CO 80225. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Harry E. Cook, Branch of Sedimentary Processes, U.S. Geological Survey, MS 999, 345 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025; Telephone (415) 354&hyph;3007, FAX (415) 354&hyph;3224, E&hyph;Mail hcook@octopus.wr.usgs.gov. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice is to meet the USGS requirement stipulated in the Survey Manual. Dated: April 18, 1994. Benjamin A. Morgan, Chief, Geologic Division.
