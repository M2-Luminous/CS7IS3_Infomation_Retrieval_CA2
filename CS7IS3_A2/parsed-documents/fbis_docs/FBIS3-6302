Informed sources said Kanemaru, a former power broker in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), visited Miyazawa twice between December 1991 and January 1992 to call for his support to prevent an accusation by the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) against a 66-member cartel of building contractors in Saitama Prefecture over a bid- rigging practice. Kanemaru promised Miyazawa to cooperate with an FTC plan to raise the maximum penalty on corporations which violate the antimonopoly law, the sources said. At that time Japan was urged by the United States to raise penalties against violators of the law during the Structural Impediments Initiative talks. The former prime minister summoned then FTC chairman Setsuo Umezawa to the prime minister's official residence in February 1992 and conveyed Kanemaru's message, the sources said. Following the meeting, Umezawa met former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura, who was arrested last Friday for allegedly accepting a 10 million yen bribe from major contractor Kajima Corp. in January 1992, the sources said. Kajima was the key member of the cartel. Prosecutors said the money was intended as a reward for using his influence to help prevent the FTC from filing an accusation against the cartel. Nakamura, then deputy chairman of the LDP panel on antimonopoly laws, who quit the LDP last Wednesday, reversed his initial reluctance to support the penalty hikes. The LDP agreed in March of that year to raise the penalty from 5 million yen to 100 million yen. The FTC announced in May 1992 that it would not file an accusation with prosecutors against the cartel. Miyazawa said, "The integrity of the FTC must be respected and I have respected it." Kanemaru retired from politics in October 1992 and is currently on trial on charges of evading more than 1 billion yen in taxes.
