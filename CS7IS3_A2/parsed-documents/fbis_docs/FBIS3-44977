The SEC has already received nine applications to set up solely foreign-funded institutes or branches of foreign universities, said the commission's Cao Guoxing. A rapidly increasing number of foreign schools, enterprises and individuals is also applying to jointly establish or operate schools, he said. Though no exact statistics are available, many jointly-operated and solely foreign-funded schools have opened across the country, offering short-term training and vocational courses. These foreign partners include overseas Chinese, foreign schools, and business people, Cao said. The SEC is working hard to draft regulations to ensure a smooth and healthy development of co-operation, he said. No Sino-foreign higher-education projects have been empowered to hand out degrees, he added. Power Cao stressed that only the SEC has the power to do so while provincial governments and ministries can authorize lower-level projects. Co-operative projects have mushroomed in recent years, creating disorder, and some were started without proper approval. Cao urged governments to work out more regulations to strengthen their control of the projects and guide future development. Co-operation helps develop China's educational system as the projects introduce new management schemes, advanced teaching methods and more funds, said Cao. However, he advised a cautious approach, especially in higher- education, because of education's far-reaching influence in society. He stressed that China should have the decisive role in the projects. He also said there was a major gap in understanding between domestic and foreign education systems. Before any projects are launched, the foreign side should be well informed of China's educational system, policies and demands. And the Chinese should do more research into the partner's background and educational standards, he added. None of the projects should be profit-oriented, he said, and any extra cash should be used only to improve education facilities and teachers' living standards. Cao said the SEC would allow no foreign party to get involved in running Chinese primary and high schools, but it would welcome donations from foreign organizations and individuals to support their development. The SEC encouraged local authorities to establish more "international schools" specially for the children of foreign diplomats and business people working in joint ventures, so as to fulfill increasing demand. Such schools are now available in cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, he added. The SEC is also encouraging Chinese universities to establish branches in foreign countries, said Cao. It has given the green light to three Chinese universities to set up cooperative projects abroad in both undergraduate and graduate education.
