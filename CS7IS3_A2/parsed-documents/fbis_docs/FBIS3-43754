Dr. Hartzenberg was reacting to the announcement that the Transitional Executive Council [TEC], which is not recognized by the CP and the AVF, took the first step this week to establish a communist-controlled National Peace-keeping Force as a "single" defense force for all of South Africa. He said that the Afrikaner People's Republic, in the process of being established, would have to appoint its own security services. This means its own national army, its own police force, as well as other necessary security services which will be responsible for safeguarding the people's republic. The people's republic will have its own civil service, tax system, and control structures. There is no way key state departments of the people's republic will be entrusted to a future ANC [African National Congress]-SACP [South African Communist Party] government. Freedom at All Costs Dr. Hartzenberg emphasized that the Afrikaner people will get its freedom and will not be suppressed by any other nation or group. "If the people do not get their independence before 27 April, then the independence process for the Afrikaners and other patriots who align themselves with the internationally accepted principle of self-determination for nations and for the Boer-Afrikaners, will have to be quickly realized." Effective Steps PATRIOT has been informed that definite steps have been taken over the past week to bring about an Afrikaner People's Republic. The enemy of the Boer Afrikaner people, still denying them their right to self-determination, will have to decide if they want lasting peace with the "peaceful Boer nation" or if they want to engage in a struggle. If they choose the struggle, then they will have to deal with probably the most formidable freedom fighters in the world. In other words, the atheists and communists who are going to get South Africa served on a tray on 27 April by the outgoing National Party, should urgently decide if they want to give the Afrikaner people their right to self-determination in its own people's republic before the 27 April, and thus allow the election to proceed peacefully, or if they want to make South Africa the venue for the world's most dangerous freedom struggle. If the enemy of the Afrikaner people should choose a struggle, then they will find that they have chosen the most difficult opponent imaginable. Warning Dr. Willie Snyman, the CP's spokesman on defense, has issued an urgent warning to all white members of the SADF [South African Defense Force] and the SAP [South African Police] to decide now if they want to join the Afrikaner people's army or whether they want to serve the communist-controlled atheistic Azanian government who will control part of the country on 27 April. He says that the Boer Afrikaner people are irrevocably committed to freedom and a government in its own fatherland, and to the complete service of God in that territory. Unpractical General Constand Viljoen, chairman of the Directorate of Generals of the AVF, says that the AVF has always regarded the TEC structures as redundant and as a waste of money. The command structures of the SADF and the SAP should not be touched because these organizations are the only ones standing between anarchy and a manageable stability in the country. General Viljoen says that the TEC's peace-keeping force is merely a "political necessity." The force, consisting of 3,000 members, equipped with special uniforms and vehicles, still has to be approved and trained. It takes approximately 75 days to assemble and train such a force, at great expense. Without any practical experience and with only 3,000 members it is too small to really exercise any influence, according to General Viljoen.
