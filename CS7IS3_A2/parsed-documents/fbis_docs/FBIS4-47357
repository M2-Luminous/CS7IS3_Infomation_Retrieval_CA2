Osinchuk, VO (production association ``Ukrgazprom'')] [Abstract]Like several other countries of Western Europe Ukraine does not possess sufficient energy sources. However, unlike the former, the Ukraine meets most of its demand (up to 80% in 1990-1992) by importing gas from only two places ) Russia and Turkmenistan. Ukraine's energy consumption per capita is around 6.5 tonnes of equivalent fuel. Energy consumption per $1 of GDP is 4 to 6 times higher than in the USA, Western Europe and Japan. Natural gas consumption for 2000-2010 is forecast at 70 to 80 billion m[.sup]3[/] a year. The article lists possible sources that could satisfy the demand more efficient utilization of Ukraine's gas resources; the use of nontraditional sources; receiving gas as payment for the use of Ukraine's gas pipeline system by Russia, Turkmenistan and other countries; buying gas from the Russian Federation, which makes economic sense for both Russia and Ukraine; buying natural gas from Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Algeria, Norway and Netherlands; and buying liquefied natural gas from Algeria, Libya, Qatar, Nigeria and other countries. Ukraine could also use her intellectual and industrial potential and participate in projects of exploitation of natural gas fields in other countries and transporting the gas via Ukraine. Diversification of gas supply sources will create necessary conditions for reliable and safe functioning of the national economy of Ukraine.
