FR940513-1-00096 FR940513-1-00020 Classification The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Small Business Administration that this action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The action proposed by this rule will provide an undetermined amount of regulatory relief to affected fishing vessels, all of which are small entities. It is unknown how many vessels will choose to fish exclusively in state waters on a given trip if this rule is implemented. This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 651 Fisheries, Fishing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
