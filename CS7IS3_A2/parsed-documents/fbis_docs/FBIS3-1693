The incident should not repeat itself, Gonzalez said, adding that a tense atmosphere would undermine the budding hope of a long-waited peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The prime minister noted that the incident indicated the UN ban on air flights over Bosnia ought not to be violated. "In fact, the air attack is in strictly keeping with the resolution of the UN Security Council," he said. Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana also attributed NATO's air attack to Serbs' violation of the no-fly zone and emphasized that it should not undermine the favorable turn resulting from the lifting of the siege in Sarajevo. The attack occurred today as American pilots saw "bombing maneuvers" of the planes and explosions on the ground. One American F-16 fighter jet shot down three planes and a second downed a fourth. It was the first time NATO used its military might in the 23-month-old Bosnia war and its 44-year history.
