Aleksashenko, deputy minister of finance of the Russian Federation: "To Perfect the Process of Drafting Territorial Budgets"] [Text] The fall has come--the time to draft budgets. Our success in the coming year will largely depend on the results of this effort. This is why we should concentrate on the mutual relations between budgets and changes in the tax system in the coming year without embarking on theoretical discussions about how things happen in our country and why, which at present claims too much effort and time. First of all, it must be understood that the budget is a mechanism that operates continuously, every day. By virtue of a number of circumstances of restructuring, radical changes of some kind in the budget during the calendar, financial year are virtually impossible. We are bound by laws and obligations; besides, the economic situation is quite difficult. Under the circumstances, it is natural that all our hopes for the better may only be attached to 1 January of next year, and new patterns of some kind and their implementation may only be planned for that period. Perhaps no one sees our budget in its entirety or has an idea of its status. This is not surprising; after all, the budget is supplemented on a daily basis by the decisions of various authorities concerning new expenditures and grants of relief. Crowds (another word is hard to find) of visitors push decisions advantageous to them in the government. The adopted laws force the state to spend tremendous funds for programs whose effectiveness is dubious. The law on grain, the law on the social status of servicemen, and the law on guarantees to northerners are the best-known of such laws. These three laws, when fully implemented, result in expenditures of approximately 20 trillion rubles [R]. Of course, servicemen should be protected, the northerners should be helped, and our agrarians are facing a difficult situation. However, when we are told that we should pay world prices for grain to agrarians, plus compensate them for one-third of their expenditures, plus offset 50 percent of the cost of machinery, 40 percent of the cost of fertilizer, and 30 percent of the cost of motor fuel and lubricants, it will turn out that the grain price for the state in our country is greater than in the world, whereas the wages of kolkhoz members do not reach even 10 percent of world levels. The question is: Where is this money going? We invest tremendous funds in agriculture, but the result is zilch. In late July, a representative of the Tula Oblast administration, who had "pushed through" a government decree on conducting an experiment in the agro-industrial complex, came to see me and said: "We need R15 billion in easy credit, in which case we will produce additional agricultural output worth R15 billion." I was somewhat taken aback by these numbers and said: "Well, fine--we will give you R15 billion, the interest rate being 170 percent annually; this means approximately another R23-R24 billion. The total amount of expenditures will come to R42 billion, and the increment in output--R15 billion. Are the outlays and the returns commensurate?" One would think that budget expenditures should be viewed not only from the point of view of political lobbying; the time has come to look at whether such expenditures are needed from the point of view of the result produced. Frankly, the situation that is emerging in the tax sphere and in the sphere of budgetary federalism, in mutual relations between the federation and its components does not satisfy the government. We would like to have greater precision and clarity in this matter and less room for case-by-case decisions. As far as taxes are concerned, the government has a clear-cut position. The government evaluates the situation quite soberly and believes that it makes absolutely no sense to introduce some new taxes, some kind of large, heavy, complex taxes. We will not be in a position to collect more than 50 percent of the gross domestic product. At the same time, we are not currently in a position to reduce the tax burden on the economy. Last year, all revenues and receipts that the state collected for the budget and all off-budget funds came to approximately 48 percent of the gross domestic product. For comparison, this number comes to 40 percent in the countries of Western Europe, the European Community, and to 30 percent of the gross domestic product in the United States and Japan. To be sure, there are the examples of Denmark and Sweden where, respectively, 54 and 51 percent of the gross domestic product is collected. However, in this case, too, this is rather an exception from the rule. Therefore, elsewhere they collect less taxes, and we collect more. However, in addition to this we should say that the deficit of state finance last year came to approximately another 30 percent of the gross domestic product. That is to say, we collect 48 percent, and we print money for another 30 percent. The state is facing a unique economic situation whereby it may spend not only its revenues (the funds it collects in the form of taxes); it may generally meet all of its needs by using the printing press--simply printing money. In this case, all citizens of the country will pay an inflationary tax: by putting new money into circulation, we depreciate each ruble that is in circulation. At present, the federal budget receives approximately one ruble in three (which it spends on expenditures) out of the credit of the Central Bank, i.e., one ruble in each three that the budget pays as wages, allowances, retirement benefits, and investment is not backed by anything. This is new money that depreciates the money already available in the country. Under the circumstances, it is impossible to resolutely up and reduce the tax load by a factor of two if we still strive to avoid hyperinflation. At the same time, there is potential for reducing the tax burden. Out of the 48 percent of the gross domestic product that we collected in the form of taxes in 1993, 16.5 percent or slightly more went to off-budget funds: the Retirement Fund, the Social Security Fund, the Employment Fund, and another approximately two dozen small funds. As far as off-budget funds set up by the government are concerned, a decision in principle has already been made to the effect that from 1994 on, all of them will be incorporated into the budget, and the government will no longer have off-budget funds. There is a problem with off-budget funds that were managed and controlled by the Supreme Soviet. Out of the monies that the off-budget funds collected last year, approximately one-third of the funds remained unused (out of the 16.5 percent, which the off-budget funds collected, 5.5 percent remained in accounts). This says only that enterprises pay social insurance withholdings and those to the Retirement Fund (to all enterprises, these are just other taxes), but these monies are not used in any way. From the point of view of the state, they are not productive. Let us say frankly that the monies are used there for mercenary purposes: They are placed in deposit accounts at a low rate of interest, with someone collecting the difference. Under the circumstances, it would be feasible to allocate the temporarily unobligated monies of the off-budget funds, a certain proportion of them (70-80 percent), to the acquisition of state securities so that the federal budget would be able to borrow money from off-budget funds, pay a certain rate of interest to them, and spend it for budget expenditures, thus restricting inflationary pressures. In principle, the current tax system (as an aggregate of taxes, i.e., the list of 42 taxes) satisfies the government. Five or six key taxes generate 95 percent of the budget receipts. The rest of the taxes are needed to perform a regulatory function and to maintain the revenue base of local budgets. While not seeing it fit to change the tax system, the government considers it necessary to focus its efforts on implementing the principles of the Federation Treaty with regard to the budget and tax system. Understandably, the list of local and regional taxes that now exists is not in a position to meet the financial needs of our regions. At present, the situation is such that out of 89 regions, 41 regions receive from the federal budget 40 percent of the funds that this budget spends (this is the total volume of grants). Out of these 41 regions, 22 regions receive more than 60 percent. In general, there are fewer than 20 regions not receiving grants in our country as a whole. This is why it is clear that some kind of a substantive approach to the division of the collected taxes should be implemented in our country, in our federation. The practice of the world indicates that in principle there are three approaches to solving this problem. The first approach is to have different taxes. The federation would introduce its own taxes, components of the federation--their own taxes, and the local organs of power--their own. The rights and responsibilities of various levels of authority in laying taxes should be divided: there should be federal taxes, taxes of the components of the federation, and local taxes. Correspondingly, each level of authority should introduce taxes that are entirely taken in by its budget. That is to say, if someone wants to increase his revenues, he should introduce new taxes, and thus also be held politically accountable by his population. "You want to spend money--so tell us what are you collecting it for and how"--this principle should be the same for all authorities, so that everything will be precise and clear, and that no region will visit Moscow and bargain for better conditions for themselves than for the neighboring regions. Everyone should be responsible for his decisions. In conjunction with this, it is necessary to authorize the components of the federation and the local organs of power to introduce their own taxes, and to establish and revise the rates of the taxes that now exist. Are some kind of upper-limit restrictions needed in the process or not? The Ministry of Finance believes that these restrictions do not work; a way will always be found to circumvent them. However, in principle, this issue exists. The second approach is for a tax, for example, the profit tax, to combine rates: the federal level of power will introduce its own rate, the regional level--its own rate, and the local level--its own rate. The third approach calls for tax revenue sharing. In our country, the value-added tax that is distributed between the federation and components of the federation is a vivid example. The practice of what we call developed countries testifies to the fact that nobody has succeeded in adhering to just one principle. No budgetary system is built on a single principle, that is, nowhere do just different taxes or the combination of rates exist. As a rule, a combination of all three, or in rare instances two out of the three aforementioned approaches, is used. In view of this, it is not possible by any means to agree with the popular proposal to divide taxes: to give the profit tax to the regions, and to give the entire value-added tax to the federal budget. From a purely financial standpoint, approximately equal amounts emerge, that is to say, the federal budget will not lose, but the regions will because the distribution of the profit tax throughout the territory of the country is much more uneven than that of the value-added tax. According to estimates by the Ministry of Finance, 17 regions stand to win from the introduction of this arrangement, and the rest of the regions will lose. This means just one thing--that the need of the regions for additional financing will increase. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance believes that neither the federal budget nor the budgets of components of the federation can be held hostage by a single tax. All kinds of things may happen to the profit tax in a region: For example, a large-scale conversion program may begin, or else a natural disaster may occur there, the entire industrial sector could shut down, and there would be no receipts of the profit tax. What then? It will always be very difficult for both the federation and components of the federation in such emergency situations. This is why in our country, under our conditions, we should implement a combination of all three of these methods. In particular, the Ministry of Finance proposes to combine rates of the profit tax: to make the profit tax both a federal tax and a tax of the components of the federation so that the federal parliament will introduce its own tax rate, which will apply to all enterprises throughout the country, and representative organs of power of components of the federation will introduce their rates. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance believes that the profit tax and the personal income tax should be paid by all citizens and all enterprises. These should be federal taxes; at the same time, only a particular proportion of them will be federal. This is one of the principles that forms the foundation of the state. Uniform taxes and uniform currency--this is what should unite all of us. Each individual residing in the territory of our country or each enterprise operating in the territory of our country that generates profits through its activities must pay taxes to the federal budget primarily to perform common functions that exist in our country. The Ministry of Finance proposes to share and give to the regions a proportion of proceeds by virtue of the value-added tax. The rate of the value-added tax should be established in its entirety by the federal parliament and should be shared on a uniform principle between the federal and regional budgets. At present, these allowances are differentiated: between 20 and 50 percent is taken in by the budgets of the components of the federation. Unfortunately, personal preferences play a considerable role in whether the number 20, 28, 43, or 50 is laid down. The current situation is such that one-half of the regions receive substantial grants from the federal budget. Generally speaking, it makes no difference whether a region receives 20 or 50 percent; something will still have to be given to it additionally. However, the position of the Ministry of Finance is that uniformity in mutual relations should be introduced in a radical manner. As we see it, 25 percent of the proceeds by virtue of the value-added tax should be given to regions, and the uniform norm should apply to all. Everyone should stand on an equal footing and be guided by uniform rules. The concept of differentiating the rate of the value-added tax cannot be supported by any means. Technically, the value-added tax is very complicated. A system for refunding monies exists within it; if we introduce various rates in different regions of our country, our financial system will go crazy: To conduct all such resettlements, we will have to know the rates of the value-added tax that exist in each of 89 components of the federation. A similar experiment has already been conducted in Brazil, where each state introduced different rates of the value-added tax. However, this was very quickly abandoned because the financial system became chaotic. Understandably, disproportions will arise anyway, regardless of the manner in which territorial budgets are drawn up. There will still be regions (more than one-half) that will need financial support even after we make use of all theoretical tax-sharing arrangements. This is why it is proposed to introduce two types of transfer payments, payments from the federal budget to regional budgets. One payment would be given as general replenishment for the revenue base in the event that the per capita total of federal taxes in a specific region is lower than in the country as a whole. A proportion of this could be compensated from the federal budget. The second payment (in conventional terms--"social") in the event that the total per capita social expenditures are substantially lower in a particular place than in the economic region on the average. Once again, the federal budget may defray a certain proportion of these expenditures. According to calculations, the implementation of this arrangement on the basis of 1993 statistics results in the following: one-third of the regions win, one-third of the regions lose, the situation of one-third remains the way it exists now. In the process, the issue of regions that lose heavily is very complicated. There are regions that will lose up to 60-65 percent of their present-day income. Understandably, some kind of individual solutions should be sought. At present, there are regions that receive 85-95 percent of the funds for their expenditures from the federal budget. Understandably, others cannot shoulder the tax burden for them. If someone wants to finance large expenditures in his territory, let him set his taxes himself, or ask for assistance, subjecting his budgets to control by the Ministry of Finance in order to make it possible to determine how rationally money is being spent. This procedure should possibly have some political conditions attached to it, but everyone should know clearly: If you want to have assistance beyond certain rules that exist in our country be so kind as to do this openly.
