The banning of the article headlined "Dialogue on the Application of the Shari'ah" has come in the wake of the recent campaign against the writer, a campaign which has culminated in the publication of two articles in the same newspaper by two of Huwaydi's colleagues. [The 12 April issue of AL-AHRAM contains no article by Fahmi Huwaydi. In the space allocated for this column on page 9, there are two articles by Hasan Duh and Ahmad 'Abd-al-Halim. Duh's article discusses the issue of the "repentant youth" who recently appeared on television. 'Abd-al-Halim's article deals with Arab national security. The two articles make no direct or indirect mention of Huwaydi.]
