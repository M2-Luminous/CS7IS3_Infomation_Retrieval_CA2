President Makes His Choice"] [Text] According to an INTERFAX report, which was confirmed by a government source, Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the State Property Committee, has been appointed deputy head of the Council of Ministers by presidential edict. By doing so Boris Yeltsin veered away from his edict No. 66 signed 10 January, whereby Viktor Chernomyrdin was to name the candidacies of his two first deputies and two "ordinary" deputies by 17 January. Boris Yeltsin moved Anatoliy Chubays outside the edict's scope by effectively making him the head of government's fifth deputy. According to trustworthy reports, initially the prime minister did not consider the State Property Committee chairman as a candidate for his "deputy." Moreover, under that same edict No. 66, the status of the State Property Committee in the government structure was lower than that of a ministry; this meant that its chief would "fall" by as many as two rungs. It seems that there were two reasons for Boris Yeltsin's somewhat unexpected decision. First, Anatoliy Chubays has told the president and the prime minister, apparently off the record, that he did not want to be reduced to a figure that is moved too energetically on the political board. All the more so because presently the State Property Committee has to cope with a plethora of reforms: the completion of the small and large-scale privatization programs, including the voucher-based stage that must end by 1 July; the establishment of control over state-owned enterprises; and the introduction of the restructuring and bankruptcy procedures. Second, Boris Yeltsin's edict coincided with the visit of Bill Clinton, whose delegation includes Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. Both American guests have repeatedly admired in public the scale and pace of Russian privatization. Meanwhile, the situation with Finance Minister Boris Fedorov has so far remained unresolved. It has transpired from those same government sources that he would not accept even the status of a deputy prime minister, if Aleksandr Zaveryukha is a government member in that same capacity and Viktor Gerashchenko remains Central Bank chairman. The much-publicized differences of these people's views on the goals and content of reform have rendered their cohabitation within one government virtually impossible.
