General Petrov, chief of the General Staff, said the same thing, but in much stronger terms, and the General Staff even sent a letter to all units that frankly described the disastrous situation of the Army. Today, however, it is you who resigned. [Noev] I have not followed closely who has made what statements. When the budget estimates were being made and we asked for one-third of the available funds to be allocated to military needs, it was clear to everyone that we would not get one-third, because 37 billion leva is beyond the state's capabilities. As for whether I heard about the letter with information on the state of the army that was sent to the troops, the answer is yes. As far as I know, it expresses what the top army officer told parliament. My personal view is that the sending of this document to the troops has seriously damaged officers' self-esteem. The document in question contains assessments that, if they proved to be true, would mean that we simply would have no army. However, the situation is not so clear. We must see whether such a document was really sent out and how it affected the morale of the officers. [Vladimirova] The press organs of the political force that wants your resignation -- it is no secret that this is the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] -- are raising a furor over discontent being rife in the Army. At the same time, a letter of the kind that the General Staff reportedly sent out to the troops cannot in itself be a source of tension. Unprejudiced people are inclined to link this document with the newspaper campaign that ended with demands for resignations. What is your view on this? [Noev] Please allow me to decline to comment on your analysis. I would only like to say that it is indeed true that serious feelings of disappointment and loss of faith have arisen. I cannot say whether this letter represents the result, or whether it led to this discontent. [Vladimirova] What do you expect to happen after your resignation? [Noev] I hope that it will contribute to finding the best personnel decisions as far as the cabinet is concerned. I have confidence in the efforts of Professor Berov and Minister Aleksandrov. [Vladimirova] It is no secret that the minister held you in high regard, yet now you are leaving to enable Minister Aleksandrov and Prof. Berov to find the best possible personnel decisions. Is this not a logical contradiction? [Noev] No. because Minister Aleksandrov would not have accepted my resignation, that is why I submitted it direct to Prime Minister Berov. [Vladimirova] How do you assess the army reform so far? [Noev] The reform is going slowly, but Minister Aleksandrov is doing everything possible to press forward with the changes, and I am sure that his efforts are in the interest of all the democratic forces in Bulgaria. [Vladimirova] Thank you for the interview, Mr. Noev.
