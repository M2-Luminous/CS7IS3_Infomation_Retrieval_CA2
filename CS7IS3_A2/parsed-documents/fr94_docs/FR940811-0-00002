FR940811-0-00002 FR940811-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 7 CFR Part 301 [Docket No. 93&hyph;138&hyph;4] Imported Fire Ant Quarantined Areas AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Affirmation of interim rules as final rules. SUMMARY: We are adopting as final rules, without change, two interim rules that amended the imported fire ant regulations. The first interim rule designated all or portions of the following as quarantined areas: 5 counties in Arkansas, 6 counties in Georgia, 6 counties in Mississippi, 17 counties in North Carolina, 4 counties in Oklahoma, 4 counties in South Carolina, and 5 counties in Tennessee. The second interim rule added Laurens County, SC, as a quarantined area and corrected the description of the quarantined area in York County, SC. The interim rules were necessary to prevent the artificial spread of the imported fire ant to noninfested areas of the United States. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 12, 1994.

Brittingham, Operations Officer, Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, room 640, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8247.

In a document effective on January 21, 1994, and published in the Federal Register on February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6531, Docket No. 93&hyph;138&hyph;2), we corrected two editorial errors in Docket No. 93&hyph;138&hyph;1. In an interim rule effective and published in the Federal Register on May 2, 1994 (59 FR 22491&hyph;22492, Docket No. 93&hyph;138&hyph;3), we amended the imported fire ant regulations by adding Laurens County, SC, as a quarantined area and by correcting the description of the quarantined area in York County, SC. Comments on this interim rule were required to be received on or before July 1, 1994. We received one comment, which was in favor of the interim rule.
