"We consider that the South side's stand for the resumption of the working contact for the exchange of special envoys is motivated by its acceptance of our demand for a stop to all the large-scale nuclear war exercises against the dialogue partner and renunciation of 'an international cooperation system' over the nuclear issue," the message said. Recalling that the South side had created artificial obstacles to the working contact, continuing adventurous nuclear war manoeuvres, it said: "If the South side approached the exchange of special envoys between the two sides with sincerity, the working contact would have been concluded long ago and special envoys would have traveled to Pyongyang and Seoul, and the urgent pending questions raised between the North and the South would have been solved."
