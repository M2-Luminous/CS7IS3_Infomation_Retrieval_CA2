He demanded the resignation of the entire cabinet and decided to return home the day after tomorrow [25 April]. He was originally scheduled to return on 2 May. Chairman Yi Ki-taek asserted that President Kim Yong-sam's acceptance of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's resignation can be interpreted as the president's distrust in the cabinet and demanded the resignation of the entire cabinet to show that all the ministers are responsible. Chairman Yi Ki-taek clearly opposed the National Assembly's appointment of acting Prime Minister Yi by saying that the new acting Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok has no administrative experience and is too conservative and that a competent and progressive new figure should be elected as prime minister. Branding the resignation of the prime minister due to a disagreement between the president and the prime minister as a national misfortune, Chairman Yi strongly denounced President Kim's personnel policy.
