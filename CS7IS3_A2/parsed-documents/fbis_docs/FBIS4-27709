Information ministry spokesman Sieng Lapresse told reporters that the missing trio were being contacted on a daily basis through unspecified "sources," and that specialists were now working for their release. He said the government had ruled out a military solution to the problem, but did not elaborate on the steps it was taking to secure their release. Briton Dominic Chappel, his Australian girlfriend Kelly Wilkinson and a British friend, Tina Dominy, were travelling from the capital to the southern port town of Sihanoukville April 11 when their taxi was stopped by Khmer Rouge guerrillas and the three were ordered out into the bush. Meanwhile, the Royal Palace here released a telegram addressed to British Prime Minister John Major Wednesday in which King Norodom Sihanouk said the Khmer Rouge had denied kidnapping the three foreigners. In the telegram, the king said Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan had told him during Cambodian peace talks in Pyongyang on Friday that the radical faction had not been responsible for the abductions. He added that he had appealed on radio and television to those responsible for the abductions to let their prisoners go free.
