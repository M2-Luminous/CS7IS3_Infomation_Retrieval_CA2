"Remaining passive observers, regional countries did little to stop the crisis, except to make formal bids for unsuccessful mediation between former communist South Yemen and former conservative North Yemen, which merged in 1990," wrote the daily `TEHRAN TIMES.' The two Yemen, said the editorial, were different culturally and economically and it was natural that it would have taken time for them to be one. Therefore, Yemenis needed moral support and economic assistance which they could not receive for pure political reasons and because of drastic global changes, the article said. "Most observers believe that Yemenis are punished by the United States and its allies in the region because of Sanaa's support of Saddam Husayn during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990." Naturally, Iran is concerned with events in Yemen and recently offered to mediate. "Iran is the only country in the region which remains neutral so that Tehran's moves might bear fruit." The daily concluded by calling on leaders of Yemen to listen to voice of reason and invest all sources at their disposal for the reconstruction of their country. "The Yemeni people need bread and butter and jobs which can be provided through development projects, not bullets."
