FR941205-0-00006 FR941205-0-00002 The comments primarily focused upon the following topics: conformity with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); constitutional questions; the proposed $130 filing fee; retroactivity of the proposed rule; service of notice; employment authorization; the discretionary nature of asylum interviews; interpreters; the ``safe third country'' ground of denial for applicants otherwise eligible for asylum; the elimination of the Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) and the applicant's opportunity to rebut a NOID; and the definition and treatment of persons convicted of an aggravated felony. In addition, there were general comments regarding United States immigration policy. Many comments agreed that asylum reforms and a solution to the backlog problem are needed. Some stated, however, that even if the proposed rule met the objectives of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, it would do so at the expense of bona fide asylum applicants and would compromise fairness and humanitarian principles. Many comments stated that the proposed rule would not stop frivolous claims or reduce the backlog. 1. Administrative Procedure Act Issues Comment: Several comments stated that the proposed rule violated the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because the rule included changes to regulations affecting the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), and the INS has no authority to promulgate regulations on behalf of EOIR. Sections alleged to fall within EOIR's jurisdiction were 208.1, 208.2, 208.3, 208.12, 208.14, 208.18, 236.3, and 242.17. The comments suggested that the Department should republish the sections of the proposed rule that pertain to EOIR proceedings with instructions that comments should be directed to the EOIR. Response and Disposition: The proposed rule was published by the Department of Justice. The Attorney General has authority to promulgate regulations on behalf of all Department of Justice agencies, including INS and EOIR. Officials of EOIR participated in drafting all relevant provisions of the proposed rule. Upon publication of the rule, the name, address, and phone number of the Counsel to the Director of EOIR were included as a point of contact for further information. Since this rule chiefly concerns the process for adjudicating asylum applications that are received in the first instance by the INS, public comments were directed to the INS; however, a copy of every comment was forwarded by the INS to EOIR. Specific suggestions were made by EOIR and have been incorporated into this final rule. Accordingly, this rule has been issued in compliance with the notice and comment requirements of the APA. 2. Constitutional Issues Comment: Several comments stated that the proposed rule would violate the Constitution by infringing upon liberty and property interests protected under the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The comments identified the following as violations of due process: (a) not every asylum applicant would receive an asylum officer interview, which is essential for an asylum officer genuinely to evaluate a case; (b) those denied an interview would be deprived of the opportunity to have their claim decided in a non-adversarial setting and instead would be required to present their asylum claim to an immigration judge during an adversarial proceeding; (c) an applicant not granted asylum would be denied the opportunity, available under the current procedures, to rebut the asylum officer's initial determination to deny the claim (Notice of Intent to Deny); and (d) due to elimination of the Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID), the applicant would not have access to the information that the asylum officer relied upon in deciding not to grant the claim. The comments stated that such infringement could not be justified by the Government's interest in improving the efficiency or financial viability of the asylum process. Comments stated that procedures similar to those in the proposed rule have been invalidated by the federal courts. They pointed to Mendez v. Thornburgh, No. 88&hyph;04995 (C.D. Cal., Order filed May 26, 1989, modified June 23, 1989), in which the court preliminarily enjoined an expedited adjudication process put into place in Los Angeles and stated that applicants were entitled to a re-interview. Comments also noted American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh, 760 F. Supp. 796 (N.D. Cal. 1991) (hereinafter `` ABC ''), in which the Government agreed to re-interview Salvadoran asylum-seekers. Comments suggested that agency efforts to expedite the asylum process through measures compromising due process and equal protection have been enjoined as a ``pattern and practice violation'' in a number of other cases. Response and Disposition: The proposed rule fully recognized the due process rights of asylum applicants. By preserving asylum and withholding of deportation proceedings before an immigration judge, the rule provides due process: (a) the applicant is permitted to testify and submit all relevant evidence in support of his or her claim; (b) the applicant may be represented by an attorney; (c) the applicant is entitled to cross-examine all witnesses presented by the Government and to rebut any documentary evidence submitted by the Government; and (d) the applicant has the right to administrative appeal and judicial review of an adverse decision. In addition, as discussed below, the final rule amends the proposed rule by providing that the INS will conduct interviews for all asylum applicants within its jurisdiction who have filed a complete application. All who apply for asylum before an asylum officer will thus have an opportunity to present their claim in a nonadversarial proceeding. Furthermore, neither the settlement agreement in Mendez nor the settlement agreement in ABC suggests that INS procedures were invalid. The rule does not single out any class of applicants for distinct treatment and all asylum applicants will be treated in the same manner without regard to nationality or country of origin. Asylum officers will interview all applicants who appear for their scheduled interviews before determining whether to grant, deny, or refer their applications. 3. Federalism Issues Comments: Several comments argued that the proposed rule required a ``cost benefit assessment'' under Executive Order 12866 because it constitutes a ``significant regulatory action.'' The comments also suggested that the Department was required to perform a ``federalism assessment'' under Executive Order 12612, since portions of the regulation could affect state governments' public welfare programs. The comments argued that the inability of asylum applicants to work for 180 days and during the appeal process could lead the applicants and their families to rely on state public assistance that they might not turn to if authorized to work. This, the comments stated, constitutes a ``substantial direct effect on the States,'' triggering the need for a federalism assessment.
