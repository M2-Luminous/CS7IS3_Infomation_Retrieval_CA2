She was talking to newsmen early this morning at Islamabad Airport on her return from Saudi Arabia after performing a minor pilgrimage there. She was referring to a mob of Afghan demonstrators who attacked the Pakistani Embassy in Kabul, smashed windows and furniture, and intimidated and beat the embassy staff. The prime minister said Pakistan has sheltered three million Afghan refugees for more than 10 years and even now a large number of the refugees are present in the country. She said Pakistan has set up camps at Jalalabad in Afghanistan where displaced persons from Kabul are being provided relief. Benazir Bhutto said she is deeply saddened by the incident. About the rescue of school children who were taken hostage by three armed Afghan gunmen, the prime minister said she is happy that they were safely rescued. She commended the Pakistan Army commandos and their timely and safe action for safely rescuing the children. Ms. Benazir Bhutto also welcomed Afghan President Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani's statement in which he condemned the kidnapping. Pakistan has expressed regrets over the attack on its embassy in Kabul and has protested with the Afghan Government about this incident. Immediately after hearing the report about the attack by an agitated mob on Pakistan's Embassy in Kabul, Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan summoned Afghan Ambassador Sardar Roshan to the Foreign Office. The foreign secretary lodged a protest of the Pakistan Government with him on this regrettable incident which is a matter of deep concern. The Afghan ambassador was asked to tell his government to take all possible steps to ensure the security of the embassy and its staff. The Afghan ambassador was also asked to immediately provide full details of the incident and about the well being of the Pakistan Embassy staff. The Afghan ambassador was told that the incident is especially condemnable because it took place during the Pakistan foreign minister's visit to Kabul in connection with the establishment of peace in Afghanistan. The Pakistan Government is surprised at such a reaction in Kabul in support of a criminal act in which three criminals kidnapped innocent children at gunpoint.
