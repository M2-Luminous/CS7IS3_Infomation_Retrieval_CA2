Kato, minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, told a regular press conference after a cabinet meeting the panel is likely to meet before the summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations in Naples July 8-10. He said the schedule for the meeting of the council, an advisory panel to the head of the Food Agency, should be finalized early next week. The meeting to decide the rice price is widely expected to be held June 30-July 1 unless affected by political developments after the fiscal 1994 budget passes the Diet. The method of computing the price is expected to be the same as last year, by calculating figures taken from selected areas around the nation. Kato also said a third round of talks among cabinet ministers to discuss farm policy following the agreement on the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks will be held next week. Details of domestic farm policy in line with the agreement and budgetary problems are likely to be the major topics to be scrutinized. The last such meeting was held on April 5.
