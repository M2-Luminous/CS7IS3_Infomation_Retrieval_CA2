FBIS4-30472 "dreas124__a94004" FBIS-EAS-94-124-A Daily Report 26 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Poll: Hata Most Popular Prime Minister Candidate Poll: Hata Most Popular Prime Minister Candidate OW2806044094 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 26 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 26 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2806044094 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The MAINICHI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide telephone poll on 25 June, when Prime Minister Hata announced that his cabinet would resign en masse, to ask 100 voters about their choice for the next prime minister. The poll found that 60 percent of the voters said, "Hata should become prime minister again," or "other politicians would be the same as Hata." In the poll, the voters nominated 13 specific candidates, with the exception of Hata, to be the next prime minister, but the 13 candidates altogether were supported by less than 10 percent of the voters. The poll revealed the fact that the people were disenchanted with politics amid the political turmoil. When asked in the poll about the next prime minister, 44 voters, or nearly one-half of those polled, chose Mr. Hata, while seven voters chose Masayoshi Takemura and seven chose [Ichiro] Ozawa; 18 percent of the voters said, "I have no position," or "I have no politician to nominate"; and former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was nominated by two voters to be the next prime minister, while Yoshiro Mori of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Hajime Funada of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], and Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi were each nominated by one voter to be the next prime minister. [figures as published] Among the voters who chose Hata to be the next prime minister, a company employee, age 27, from Aomori city, said: "Hata was too short-lived. If no other politicians can do better than Hata, then Hata should become prime minister again." A housewife, age 37, from Fukui city, said, "Hata gives the image of being an ordinary citizen." The seven voters who chose Ozawa to be the next prime minister said, "Ozawa is now actually managing politics, and we want him to carry out his activities openly in the political arena." An overwhelming number of the voters favored an alliance between the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] for the next coalition government, while 41 voters expressed hope for the SDPJ's return to the government. Forty-five voters expressed hope for the LDP's return to the government, saying, "The LDP should participate in the coalition government, or the LDP should forge an alliance with Shinseito." Meanwhile, some voters stressed "the need to realign the established political parties" and asserted that "the LDP and the SDPJ should both be split up," or "what matters is not the alliance but the substance of policies." Asked in the poll what they expect of the next government, 46 voters cited economic stimulus measures, while 21 voters cited a reform of the tax system, with 18 voters citing an improvement in the social welfare system. All the voters polled reacted coolly to the prime minister's abrupt announcement that his cabinet will resign en masse. A female voter who works for an organization in Fukushima Prefecture said: "Japan is saddled with a host of domestic and external issues, such as the yen's appreciation, deregulation, and the [Naples G-7] summit. This is not the time for politicians to engage in political strife." Yachio Okura, a company employee from Mekuro ward in Tokyo, demanded a dissolution of the House of Representatives, saying: "The replacement of the prime minister alone is meaningless. Even if the SDPJ returns to the coalition government, it would not set out clear-cut policies. I am disgusted with the political strife and the attempts to secure the required number of parliamentary seats."
