The assailant, identified as Masakatsu Nozoe, 52, a member of a right-wing organization, was overpowered and detained by plainclothes men immediately after the incident in the third-floor lobby at the Keio Plaza Hotel, witnesses said. Hosokawa, 56, was unhurt. He was rushed out of the hotel and into a waiting car. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata denounced the attack, saying, "such an act would destroy democracy." The last known rightist attack on a politician came in March 1992 when a shot was fired at Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced kingmaker of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Hosokawa was on his way home from a party at the hotel marking the establishment of the Tokyo chapter of the Japan New Party (JNP) which he heads. The assailant later told police that he had become upset with Hosokawa's apologies for Japan's wartime responsibilities and over his economic policies, police said. A shaken Hosokawa reportedly expressed concern for his wife as he was escorted out of the hotel, saying, "Kayoko is still here. Please (take care of her)." Hosokawa, who has been burdened with questions surrounding his financial dealings, resigned last month as head of a fragile coalition government which replaced four decades of rule by the LDP. He has since maintained a low profile, reportedly staying at his Karuizawa retreat and at Tokyo hotels. According to party sources, Hosokawa has been threatened by rightist organizations since assuming office last August over his apologies for Japanese atrocities during World War II. The JNP has reportedly taken precautions to protect Hosokawa since then.
