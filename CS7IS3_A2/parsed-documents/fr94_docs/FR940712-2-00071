Broe, The Broe Companies, The Great Western Railway Company, Railco Inc., Chicago West Pullman Transportation Corp., et al._Corporate Family Reorganization Exemption On June 9, 1994, Patrick D. Broe (Mr. Broe), The Broe Companies, Inc. (BCI), The Great Western Railway Company (GWR), Railco Inc. (Railco), Chicago West Pullman Transportation Corp. (CWPT), OmniTRAX, Inc. (OmniTRAX), and their carrier subsidiaries jointly filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(3) to reorganize the carrier subsidiaries and for OmniTRAX, a noncarrier holding company, to control the carrier subsidiaries. Mr. Broe is a noncarrier individual who directly controls Panhandle Northern Railroad Company (PNR) and Central Kansas Railway Limited Liability Company (CKR) and who also owns and controls BCI and OmniTRAX. BCI is a noncarrier holding company that directly controls the noncarriers GWR and Railco. GWR directly controls the carriers Great Western Railway of Colorado, Inc. (GWRC), Great Western Railway Company of Iowa, Inc. (GWRI), and Great Western Railway of Oregon, Inc. (GWRO). Railco controls the noncarrier CWPT, which in turn controls six class III railroads: the Chicago, West Pullman & Southern Railroad Company (CWP&S); the Georgia Woodlands Railroad Company (GWRR); The Newburgh & South Shore Railroad Company (NSR); Chicago Rail Link (CRL); Manufacturers' Junction Railway Company (MJR); and Kansas Southwestern Railway Company (KSW). Under the reorganization, MJR, CWP&S, GWRR, KSW, CRL, GWRI, PNR and GWRC will be reformed as limited liability companies. GWRO will remain a corporation. NSR will be reformed as a limited liability partnership. BCI will convey its interest in GWR, Railco and CWPT to OmniTRAX and the GWR, Railco and CWPT holding companies will be dissolved. Mr. Broe will transfer his direct controlling interests in PNR and CKR to OmniTRAX. As a result of these transactions, OmniTRAX will control all 11 rail carriers (MJR, CWP&S, GWRR, KSW, CRL, GWRI, PNR, GWRC, NSR, CKR and GWRO). Mr Broe will continue to control OmniTRAX. The parties intend to consummate the transactions on or after June 15, 1994. These transactions are within a corporate family of the type specifically exempted from prior review and approval under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(3). The parties say that the transactions will not result in adverse changes in service levels, significant operational changes, or a change in the competitive balance with carriers outside the corporate family. The stated purpose of the reorganization is to obtain better tax treatment, to facilitate estate planning, and to simplify the corporate structure, which should allow a more efficient operation. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees adversely affected by the transactions will be protected by the conditions set forth in New York Dock Ry. _ Control _ Brooklyn Eastern Dist. , 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979). Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transactions. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Karl Morell, Ball, Janik & Novack, Suite 1035, 1101 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20004. Decided: July 6, 1994.
