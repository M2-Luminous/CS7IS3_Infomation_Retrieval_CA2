FR941102-0-00008 FR941102-0-00004 The OCC originally developed the abbreviated registration system through a series of interpretive and no-objection letters issued under the former part 16. While the SEC rules do not provide for this abbreviated approach, the OCC believes it is appropriate for several reasons. The market for such debt is well-developed and has not presented particular disclosure concerns. The requirements that the securities have a specified large denomination, be highly- rated, and that purchasers must meet the accredited investor criteria further ensure that the debt will only be offered and sold by a bank in situations when an abbreviated disclosure system is appropriate. Inclusion of this abbreviated approach in the final rule clarifies its criteria and provides better notice that such a system is available. The final rule also cross-references the SEC's Rule 415 (17 CFR 230.415) on shelf registration. This enables banks to register securities for future sale and then to sell those securities when market conditions are favorable. Under the OCC's former regulations, shelf registration was not permitted. This imposed additional and unnecessary costs on national banks and put them at a disadvantage with respect to other issuers seeking to raise capital. The final rule provides that nonpublic offerings of securities generally may be made in accordance with the SEC's Regulation D (17 CFR 230.501 through 230.508). The final rule permits sales to an unlimited number of investors who meet certain requirements (accredited investors), and up to 35 other sophisticated purchasers, or to any number of sophisticated purchasers subject to a limitation on the aggregate offering price. Cross-reference of the SEC's Regulation D increases the number of allowable purchasers in a nonpublic offering. The former regulation allowed banks to make nonpublic offerings to only 15 sophisticated purchasers (and an unlimited number of accredited investors) in a 12-month period, unless the bank received OCC permission to increase the number of purchasers. The revised rule makes certain conforming changes to §§5.46 and 5.47 to enable banks to use the SEC's Rule 415 (17 CFR 230.415) on shelf registration. The final rule further provides that a bank need not obtain prior OCC approval for a cash sale of preferred stock or an issuance of subordinated debt unless the OCC has notified the bank that prior approval is necessary. The OCC's former regulations required prior OCC approval for all cash sales of preferred stock and issuances of subordinated debt. The Interagency Statement on Retail Sales of Nondeposit Investment Products (February 15, 1994) applies to retail sales of nondeposit investment products including bank securities. Thus, if bank securities are sold to retail customers, banks must ensure that such customers are fully informed that the securities are not insured by the FDIC, are not deposits or other obligations of the bank and are not guaranteed by the bank, and are subject to investment risks including possible loss of the principal invested. Section-By-Section Discussion The OCC received 13 comments on the proposal. The commenters generally supported the OCC's plan to incorporate through cross-reference certain sections of the Securities Act and the SEC's rules thereunder, and to adopt the SEC's forms. The commenters focused on specific aspects of the revisions that they believed needed modification. The OCC has carefully considered each of the comment letters and has made a number of changes in response to them.
