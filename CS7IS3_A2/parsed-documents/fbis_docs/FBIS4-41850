According to its leaders, this academic institution is supposed to become a "nursery for Russia's economic elite." But the problems of Russian higher education, especially financial, have not bypassed the newly fledged "nursery." The "Democratic Choice of Russia" party has decided to give some support to the young intellectuals. It has instituted grants for Higher School of Economics students -- 15 for baccalaureate (first degree) students and 20 for master's degree (second degree) students, plus 20 grants worth 180,000 rubles each to allow students from other cities to pay for their residence in Moscow. It is also proposed to establish a permanent grant fund to which entrepreneurs wishing to support economics students can contribute funds. Sergey Blagovolin, chairman of the organizing committee of the "Democratic Choice of Russia's" Moscow organization, claims that the students will receive party grants for success in their studies and academic work irrespective of their political views. The fact that academics from such different poles as Yegor Gaydar and Leonid Abalkin sit on the monitoring council and figure among the Higher School of Economics teachers could help to guarantee this to a certain extent.
