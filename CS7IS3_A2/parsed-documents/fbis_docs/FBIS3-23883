Zharinov under the rubric "Political Commentary": "The President Has Spoken. What Can Russian Citizens Expect?"] [Text] After that memorable Thursday when President Boris Yeltsin spoke in the Federal Assembly, an awkward pause ensued in the political life of Russian citizens. The press and the public suddenly switched to comments on, or rather criticism of, the State Duma decree on political amnesty for the prisoners of "Sailor's Rest" and "Lefortovo" and the sudden removal of the General Procurator of the Russian Federation from his post. Hysteria again sounded over the impending civil war and a repetition of the tragedy of 1 May 1993. Seemingly overshadowed by these idle lamentations was a sober and detailed analysis of the President's Message and his "role in the fate of the future Russia." The latter sounds somewhat stilted, but it is customary to the philistine's ears. "For the first time Russia has received a concrete program of development." "The Message contains quite a powerful charge." The authors of such assessments are as a rule people from the president's circle who directly or indirectly participated in preparing the February theses "On Strengthening the Russian State" (A. Yakovlev, Yu. Baturin, and G. Satarov). We who have already heard a considerable number of perestroyka speeches in recent years are already familiar with the "epoch-making syndrome." And for that reason we do not immediately take everything on faith. But if we are talking specifically about the Message, generally speaking I would treat it in a somewhat more restrained manner. Roughly the same as Academician L. Abalkin, chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs V. Lukin, and many others who called the Message a "calculated political statement." Perhaps the strongest thing in the Message is that "true economic focuses weighing on the general political situation in society" are finally put in place. The analysis is harsh and merciless and contains criticism of the hard blows and lack of careful thought and of the radical, monetarist methods of becoming a market economy. Self-criticism and frank admission of his own guilt are lacking in this bitter presidential analysis, it seems to me. B. N. Yeltsin's complaint regarding growing national poverty and the "rapid social stratification of society," for example, left a painful and at the same time discouraging impression on many people I have talked with recently. The authorities in the center and local ones, don't you see, seem not to notice this! But was it really not clear before what this "all-economic freedom of the market" and the creation of the free owner at any cost and at a Stalinist pace would become? Exactly the same methods were used during the destatization of the economy ("Let us smash the monster!") and decollectivization ("Give us 100,000 private farmers and we will turn Russia around!"). They smashed it and they turned Russia around... But what have they created? So far not much. As the Message emphasizes, "There is more freedom in our country," and more and more Russian citizens are alas suffering from it. Although the president's address does not provide answers to many fundamental questions, there are a considerable number of new revelations and revealing statements in it: "The previous variant of the reforms has exhausted itself," "Optimal methods for the state to participate in economic processes are needed," "The `survival of the fittest' principle is destructive." Has the ice begun to break? We shall see. The points in the chapters "The Law-Governed State" and "The Individual in a Democratic State" seem attractive and generally do not arouse any objection. Or I should say their leitmotif seems so: "Toward strengthening of statehood and civil peace and accord, as well as rejection of the practice of senseless confrontation in society." True, just words. Unfortunately, they have frequently been pronounced in recent times both from behind the Kremlin walls and from the parliamentary rostrum. And heated political storms have at times followed them. But all the same, the hope remains that they will not become stale and lose their original meaning.
