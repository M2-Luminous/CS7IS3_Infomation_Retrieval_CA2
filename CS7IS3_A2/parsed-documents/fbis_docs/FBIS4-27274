Hata made the remarks at a meeting with members of the Tax Commission, an advisory body for the prime minister that has been examining ways of reforming Japan's taxation systems. Kan Kato, the head of the commission, told Hata that in order to carry out tax reforms, administration reforms should come first so as to show efforts of reducing government expenses to the people, they said. Hata replied that the government will draw up a plan for administration reforms by the end of June, before the Tax Commission is expected to compile a tax reform plan, according to the officials. They quoted Hata as saying, in administration reforms, that there will be no "sanctuary" areas. The officials said Hata also promised to consider drawing up a five-year plan for national and regional governments' administration, responding to a call by Kato for such a plan. On the recently shelved plans for raising public charges, Hata told the Tax Commission members that he did not mean to simply postpone such hikes, according to the officials. Instead, he will instruct concerned government sectors to review public service systems and charges, Hata was quoted as saying.
