Synopsis of the Memorandum Opinion and Order I. Introduction 1. This Memorandum Opinion and Order addresses issues raised in petitions for reconsideration of our Report and Order adopted March 11, 1993, 58 FR 17350 (4/2/93) which established rules to implement the mandatory television broadcast signal carriage (``must-carry'') and retransmission consent provisions of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (``1992 Cable Act''). In a Clarification Order adopted on May 28, 1993, 58 FR 32449 (6/10/93), we addressed specific concerns raised in these petitions relating to signal quality, copyright indemnification and translator ownership. In an Order adopted on July 15, 1993, 58 FR 40366 (7/28/93), we addressed additional concerns relating to carriage rights, to the failure of broadcast stations to elect either must-carry or retransmission consent status, and to the channel position for such stations. On October 5, 1993, we adopted a Stay Order, 58 FR 53429 (10/15/93), which stayed two provisions of the retransmission consent rules, with respect to VHF/UHF antenna ownership and carriage in the entirety of broadcast signals, pending our resolution of those issues in this proceeding. In this Memorandum Opinion and Order we will address all remaining issues raised in the petitions for reconsideration, as well as the outstanding issues from the Stay Order. We will also take this opportunity, on our own motion, to clarify certain other issues raised in the Report and Order. 2. We note that the constitutionality of the must-carry provisions of the 1992 Cable Act were challenged before the Supreme Court. In Turner Broadcasting Systems, Inc. v. FCC, a special three-judge panel of the District Court found the must-carry provisions constitutional. On appeal, the Supreme Court vacated the decision and remanded the case back to the three-judge panel for further proceedings. While the case is pending, the must-carry provisions of the 1992 Cable Act remain in effect, as do the Commission's must-carry rules.
