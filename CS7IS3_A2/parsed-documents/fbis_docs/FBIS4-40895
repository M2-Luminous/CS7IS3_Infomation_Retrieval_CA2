They threw off their mask during the Supreme Council elections in March and April this year. The Civil Congress of Ukraine, the Labor Party, the Communist Party of Ukraine, the Socialist Party of Ukraine, and the leadership of the United Trade Unions of Kharkov Oblast have waged a furious propaganda campaign against Ukraine's independence, the state leadership, and the population of western oblasts. A great number of Ukrainian-eaters [Ukrayinozher], with the help of proimperial magnates, have infiltrated our state's legislative body -- the Supreme Council. They can be easily recognized by their deeds: In parliament, they behave in a blatant manner, speak only in Russian, and voice opinions which can lead to destabilization of political life and loss of Ukrainian statehood, and can transform Ukraine into an economic appendage of the Russian empire. In terms of ideology, these deputies are fed by similar forces in the regions. In Kharkov Oblast, the proimperial forces have almost completely captured the media -- they have established the "Tonis," "Orion," "Symon," "Vympel," and "A/TVK" television companies and the "Radio 50," "Master-Radio," and "Onyks" radio companies. VECHERNIY KHARKOV and SOBYTIYE are published instead of such Ukrainian-language newspapers as VECHIRNIY KHARKOV and LENINSKA ZMINA. A whole range of new Russian-language newspapers are published. Newspapers from Russia are sold for pittance. Russian literature dominates the city's and oblast's bookstands. At state expense, libraries are furnished with Russian papers, magazines, and books. Only two Ukrainian newspapers -- SLOBIDSKYY KRAY (three times per week) and children's ZHURAVLYK (twice per month) -- are published in Kharkov. The attack against the Ukrainian language is conducted by physical methods as well: The stands, on which Ukrainian newspapers were displayed, have been dismantled. We, the plenipotentiaries of political parties and public organizations of democratic orientation, are concerned over the attack of proimperial forces in Kharkov Oblast. We Propose: To the Cabinet of Ministers: 1. To hold a special meeting concerning the implementation of the "State Program for the Development of the Ukrainian Language and Other National Languages of Ukraine by the year of 2000" dated 12 November 1991. 2. To provide state assistance to Ukrainian-language media, to ensure their normal operation. To the Supreme Council: 1. To revise the issue of using the technical radio and television equipment on the Ukrainian territory, which is used to hamper the process of Ukrainian national revival, cultivate separatism, and sow hostilities among people in different parts of the state. 2. To ensure the introduction of the state language at plenary sessions of the parliament and its standing commissions.
