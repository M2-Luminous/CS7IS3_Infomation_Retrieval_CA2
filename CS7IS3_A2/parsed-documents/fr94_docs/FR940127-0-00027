FR940127-0-00027 FR940127-0-00005 In addition to general comments, the FCC and the ACA offered technical suggestions that they believe would improve or clarify the regulation. Commenters were concerned that the words ``at loan closing'' in proposed §615.5060(a)(2) created some ambiguity because it is often not possible to obtain a title insurance policy at the time of loan closing. One commenter stated that a loan is closed based on a title commitment and a final title insurance policy is not issued until after loan closing when there is satisfaction of the requirements set out in the commitment. Another commenter stated that it is a common practice to obtain the actual title policy at a later date, with the policy being issued ``as of'' the date the lien documents are recorded. Commenters asserted that FCS institutions would be unable to take advantage of the additional flexibility and cost savings the proposed regulation is intended to provide if the institutions were required to obtain a final title insurance policy at loan closing. FCA modified proposed §615.5060(a)(2) by deleting the requirement that the policy be obtained ``at loan closing'' but notes that the Act authorizes an FCB to make a long-term mortgage loan only if that loan is secured by a first lien on real estate. The FCC and the ACA also commented that, as currently written, proposed §615.5060(a)(2)(ii) might be construed to mean that counsel must approve not only the standard form to be used, but also the way in which the form is completed in each particular case. Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) requires only that the final title policy be issued on a standard title insurance policy form that the counsel for the lending institution has approved. The language in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) was revised to make this clearer. Further, the FCC and the ACA suggested that, because many ACAs and FLCAs do not have their own in-house counsel, the regulation should be modified to allow counsel for either the association or the ``supervising'' bank to approve the standard form. The phrase ``counsel for the lending institution'' in §615.5060 (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(2)(iv) is not meant to require that an association have in-house counsel. An association may, if it wishes, rely on counsel for the affiliated bank or the association's retained counsel if counsel agrees to act for the association in approving the form of the title insurance policy and prescribing these standards. Proposed §615.5060(a)(2)(iii) requires that the title insurance policy be issued ``for an amount equal to the balance outstanding on the real estate mortgage loan.'' Commenters stated that multiple tracts of real estate are frequently offered as security for a loan and in some situations separate title insurance policies for various tracts are obtained from different insurers. The FCC further stated that title insurance companies often require that the insured amount be allocated among the various policies, and often refuse to issue a policy in an amount in excess of the value of the particular tract they are insuring. The FCC further stated that the amount of the title insurance that should be required should be directly related to the value of the lender's interest in the property that is being insured. Therefore, the FCC suggested that §615.5060(a)(2)(iii) be revised to require that the final policy be issued for an amount equal to the balance outstanding on the real estate mortgage loan ``or such lesser amount as is sufficient to protect the interest of the lending institution in the insured property.'' The FCC believes that such language would enable the lending institution to determine whether the title policy should be issued for the full amount of the loan or, when multiple tracts are taken as security, for the market or appraised value of the property being insured, whether that value is greater than or less than the amount of the loan. The FCA Board conceptually agrees with the commenters that the title insurance should be issued for an amount that is sufficient to protect the interest of the lending institution. However, the FCA Board believes that the amount of title insurance necessary to protect the lender on a long-term real estate mortgage loan is no less than the outstanding loan balance. The Act and FCA regulations limit long-term real estate loans to a percentage of the appraised value of the real estate security. FCA's regulation does not require that an institution obtain title insurance for an amount that is in excess of the value of the real estate security, but rather requires coverage in an amount at least equal to the outstanding loan balance, an amount less than the value of the real estate security. In the case of multiple tracts, if a separate policy is issued for a tract, the minimum amount insured by that policy shall bear the same ratio to the outstanding balance that the appraised value of the tract bears to the appraised value of all the real estate security. Accordingly, the final rule requires that if only title insurance is used to document the existence of a first lien, the final title policy or policies must be issued for an amount at least equal to the outstanding loan balance.
