Cuando Cubango Province is often referred to as the land at the end of the world. Do you agree with that name? [Hungo] Yes, you are quite right. It is really the land at the end of the world. [Reporter] The military situation appears to be taking on difficult overtones? [Hungo] Yes, it is true, the military situation is becoming somewhat complex because the enemy, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], continues to siege the farming areas where the people go to fetch food. UNITA continues to train men in its old bases. Relatively low intensity shelling continues to claim lives, as do ambushes and mines. We would have liked to take advantage of the opportunity we have been given. If there is no peace, it will be tragic for the people of Cuando Cubango Province, who have had to endure this protracted war. [Reporter] Governor Hungo: How do you reconcile the fact that UNITA is attending the Lusaka peace talks while attacking your province? [Hungo] We have known UNITA for a long time now and UNITA has always behaved like this. At a time when talks are under way, UNITA appears to feel compelled to show its military might so it can participate in the talks on equal terms with the government. Moreover, UNITA has always displayed bad faith in relation to the Angolan people, thereby showing its poor political capabilities and its failure to accept the democratic game. [Reporter] Mr. Governor Hungo: Do you think that the peace proclaimed by UNITA is false? [Hungo] We must see to believe. I am not trying to weave any tales here. I have known UNITA since 1964 and our relations have always led to dead ends. We discuss peace, peace, and peace yet again, and it has been 30 years that UNITA has prevented us from enjoying peace. I think that we must really see to believe, but seeing all their twists and turns I am less than confident. Let me give you the concrete example of Malange yesterday: If they were really interested in signing a cease-fire accord and bringing peace to the Angolan people, they would not have shelled Malange yesterday. There were U.S. congressmen visiting the city and the United States backed UNITA for a long time. [Reporter] Mr. Governor: And how has Cuando Cubango Province been defended? [Hungo] I am happy about the way defensive operations have been organized in my province. Together with the civilian defense force, the defense and security troops have been indefatigable in their preparedness. This has meant that our troops have become more organized and more experienced. I can even tell you that we are ready for anything at any time. With the help of the central government, we shall take the appropriate steps to defend Cuando Cubango Province. [Reporter] The land at the end of the world... [Hungo] That is correct!
