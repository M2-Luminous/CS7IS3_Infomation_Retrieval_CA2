FR940419-0-00056 FR940419-0-00019 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Acquisition Management (3802F), 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460, attn: Calvin C. McWhirter (202) 260&hyph;9165. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 9.501 defines an organizational conflict of interest as existing when ``because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage.'' Under EPA's Superfund program, contractors are often asked to assist the Agency in designing remedial actions to clean up hazardous waste sites, in identifying potentially responsible parties (PRPs) at hazardous waste sites and in implementing actions to effect the cleanup. After identification of PRPs for specific sites, the Agency will attempt to secure private party conducted response action or to expend Superfund Trust Funds to conduct response action and to recover costs expended for cleanup either through consent agreements or litigation. Under the Superfund program it is essential that contractors not enter into outside contracts or use personnel which might result in an actual or potential conflict of interest. In addition, since litigation may continue for several years after a contractor has completed work and the contractor may be asked to testify on the work performed for EPA, it is essential that actual or potential conflicts of interest be avoided even after the contract work has been completed. In addition to organizational conflicts of interest, EPA must ensure that contractor personnel assigned to work on EPA contracts are free from personal conflicts of interest that might impair their ability to perform the required work in an impartial manner. EPAAR clauses have been developed which will require EPA's Superfund contractors to ensure that actual or potential personal conflicts of interest regarding contractor personnel are identified and reported to the EPA Contracting Officer. These clauses shall be incorporated into new solicitations and new contracts. Clauses for contracts existing as of the effective date of this rule shall be negotiated by the EPA Contracting Officer, on a case-by-case basis, and shall be substantially similar to the clauses required by this rule. The Agency has developed a Long Term Contracting Strategy to more effectively manage the Superfund program over the next ten years. The clauses in this rule reflect the changing nature of the Superfund program. Although we intend to implement the Strategy with minimal program disruption, there may be some changes to the form of some existing Superfund contracts. Therefore, we anticipate the clauses in this rule may require updating to reflect ongoing changes to the Superfund program. This rule was published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register on April 26, 1990, at 55 FR 17724. Twenty-two public comments were received. We express our appreciation to all the interested organizations for the time they took in studying the proposed rule and preparing comments. As a result of these comments, we have made a number of revisions to the rule. In seriously considering all of the comments, we implemented recommendations that would improve the quality of the rule and minimize the burden to the contractor community, yet ensure that EPA's programs are adequately protected. Part B of the preamble summarizes the general issues raised and provides EPA's response and Part C of the preamble addresses section-specific comments. In addition, the numbering in EPAAR subpart 1509.5 is being amended to conform with numbering changes to FAR subpart 9.5. These changes are made solely to conform to the FAR numbering scheme and do not otherwise affect the existing EPAAR. B. General Comments 1. Response to EPA Conflict of Interest Rule Many commenters expressed support for an EPA rule on conflict of interest although some recommended that EPA withdraw the proposed rule. We welcome public support and are committed to implementing a conflict of interest rule that protects the integrity of the Superfund and other EPA programs.
