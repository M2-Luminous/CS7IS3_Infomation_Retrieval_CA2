The jump in gas production will be even greater: from 20.2 million cubic meters per day to 24.6 million cubic meters per day--a rise of 22 percent. It happens that 1993 was not one of the most promising years for investment in Petrobras, which was working with a limited budget. Investments by the end of the year totaled about $2 billion, of which something like $980 million was spent to develop the production of petroleum and natural gas. But results were better than the company expected, according to the assistant superintendent of the Production Department, Bergson Antonio Cajueiro. The company extracted 669,000 barrels per day, or 6,000 barrels per day more than had been expected initially. By the end of the year, the country had produced about 2 million barrels more than expected, with the result that it did not have to import the equivalent of $32 million worth. Compared to 1992, petroleum production was up 2.4 percent, and gas production was up 6 percent. That performance was due in particular to the fact that the Bijupira-Salema (Campos Basin) and Caravela (Santos Basin) fields produced more than expected in Petrobras' initial calculations. There was also increased operational productivity, according to Cajueiro. The stars in petroleum production in 1993 were the Campos Basin off the Rio de Janeiro coast and the Santos Basin, which extends from Cabo Frio in Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina. They played an important part in the increase in production and in reserves, which, according to preliminary Petrobras calculations, ended the year at 4 billion barrels, or 8.1 percent more than the total of 3.7 billion barrels in 1992. All indications are that the Campos and Santos Basins will continue to perform outstandingly in 1994, when Petrobras plans to invest $1.1 billion to develop our country's petroleum and natural gas production. The amount scheduled for all Petrobras deals is $3.4 billion, according to Orlando Galvao, the company's financial director. Two-thirds of that will be spent on petroleum exploration and production. Challenge Increasing petroleum production from 669,000 barrels per day to 719,000 is being considered a challenge at Petrobras. After all, as Cajueiro explained, that will come to 50,000 more barrels per day, a quite significant amount. Moreover, there will be the natural decline in production by producing wells. If nothing is spent to expand production, production will fall from 669,000 barrels per day to 629,000 barrels per day--a drop of 40,000 barrels per day. So in fact, according to Cajueiro's calculations, Petrobras will have to produce an additional 90,000 barrels per day to achieve 719,000 barrels per day (40,000 to make up for the natural decline in production plus the additional 50,000). By the end of the year, assuming an average price of $16 per barrel (based on 1993 prices through November), the state firm will have saved $520 million that it otherwise would have had to spend on petroleum imports. The major contributors to increased production will be the giant Marlim and Albacora fields (in the Campos Basin), Caravela (Santos Basin), and Urucu (Amazon Basin). If petroleum production of 719,000 barrels per day (on average) is confirmed by the end of 1994 and if consumption is on the order of 1.3 billion barrels per day (a conservative estimate), our country's oil fields will be supplying 55 percent of our domestic requirements, while the remaining 45 percent will have to be imported.
