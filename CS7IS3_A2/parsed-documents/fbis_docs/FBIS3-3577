Provincial party committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu attended and delivered a speech in which he emphatically stated: Under the new circumstances, we should build the party in accordance with the party's basic line and political line as well. Party organization work should submit to and serve the party's basic line and political line. This year, China's deep-going reform is expected to enter a crucial stage marked with comprehensive progress and earthshaking breakthroughs. At the moment, the party is undergoing another major strategic transformation since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, namely, a shift from a planned economic structure to a socialist market economic structure, this being a significant change foretelling a new round of national rejuvenation and development. Secretary Pu Chaozhu noted: Under the current circumstances and at such an important historical juncture, we should make redoubled efforts to step up party building, this being the key to all our work. The party's work should closely focus on such key aspects as emancipating the mind, grasping each and every opportunity, furthering in-depth reform, pushing forward development, and maintaining stability. Party building work should first and foremost submit to and serve these key work aspects. Insofar as guiding ideology is concerned, we should shift the focus of party organization work from cadre management to overall party building. Insofar as work style and methods are concerned, we should shift the focus of the party organization work from such routine matters as selecting, promoting, appointing, and removing from office cadres to overall party building. To this end, we should concentrate on resolving all major contradictions and strive for tangible results in party organization work. Secretary Pu Chaozhu maintained: We should strive to accomplish the following three major party building tasks over the next two years: 1. To attach primary importance to the party's ideological and theory building; 2. To arm the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; 3. To step up leading organ building at all levels with an eye to making them capable of emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, persisting in reform and opening up, conducting fruitful work, opening up new vistas for overall party work, adhering to democratic centralism and the party spirit, broadening people's horizons, being broad-minded, uniting the broad masses of people, fighting battles, maintaining close ties with the broad masses of people, conducting in-depth investigations and study, adopting a strong sense of the masses, conducting work in a down-to-earth manner, showing concern for the overall interests, making selfless contributions, submitting to and serving the party's overall interests, as well as persistently and whole-heartedly serving the people. Secretary Pu Chaozhu asserted: In building leading party organs at all levels across the province, we should closely follow the above mentioned criteria and requirements, make persistent efforts, and strive to achieve tangible results. In order to improve party style, Pu Chaozhu added, it is imperative to persistently further the on-going anti-corruption struggle while building socialism with Chinese characteristics at the same time. It is also imperative to reinforce and successfully build grass-roots party organizations with forceful measures.
