In the first nine months of 1993, the republic experienced 7628 cases and 300 deaths, a 3.5-fold increase over the previous year (Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 4 Dec 93). By year's end authorities had recorded 15,229 cases, 4503 of them in children, and 468 deaths. The first two months of 1994 saw 4000 new cases and 100 deaths (Moscow RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA 16 Apr 94). Experts consider the main cause of the epidemic to be a low vaccination rate, resulting from public concerns about vaccine safety (Moscow TRUD 1 Jul 93, Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 4 Dec 93). 11111111 [RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA 16 Apr 94, etc.] [Editorial Report] During 1993, Russia experienced an unusually high incidence of diphtheria.

By year's end authorities had recorded 15,229 cases, 4503 of them children, and 468 CSO In October 1993, the Russian Federation government opened a special diphtheria control center, headed by A. Tsaregorodtsev (Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 4 Dec 93, Moscow MEDITSINA SEGODNYA No. 21-22 1993, Moscow RAB0CHAYA TRIBUNA 16 Apr 94) and passed a decree requiring vaccination of 75 percent of the adult population by 1995 (Moscow MEDITSINA SEGODNYA No. 21-22 93, Moscow Ostankino Television First Channel and Orbita Networks 3 Feb 94). Neither the country's stocks of diphtheria vaccine nor its production capabilities were adequate to support the immunization program (Moscow MEDITSINA SEGODNYA No. 21-22 1993). Consequently, at the Center's prompting, the government allocated funds to purchase foreign vaccines and develop domestic production (Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 9 Nov 93, Moscow MEDITSINA SEGODNYA No. 21-22 93, Moscow RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA 16 Apr 94).
