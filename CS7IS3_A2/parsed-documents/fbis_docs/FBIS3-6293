The approach taken by Japan's Posts and Telecommunications Ministry in settling the dispute involving Motorola Inc. and Nippon Idou Tshushin Corp. (IDO) is of a different nature from autos and other trade issues covered under the "framework" talks, said Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy international trade and industry minister for international affairs. At a luncheon sponsored by the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan, Okamatsu was responding to remarks by U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale in which he welcomed last Saturday's phone trade accord as "a model" for getting the stalled framework talks rolling again. Citing part of the accord that says Tokyo will take "all available measures to ensure compliance with the commitments" shown by IDO, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the Japanese Government "guaranteed the fulfillment of the agreement." Telecommunications trade is a regulated sector, requiring a government license or permission to start business while autos and auto components are "completely free trade areas," Okamatsu said. This remark indicates Japan's renewed opposition to setting "numerical targets" guaranteed by the government by clarifying it has no control over private businesses such as the auto industry. Okamatsu said a market-opening package to be announced at the end of this month will contain macroeconomic measures. But he withheld comment on details of the measures, including whether or not the politically sensitive issue of tax cuts will be included. A specific framework of macroeconomic measures, which is being worked out at the moment, will not be announced at the end of March but will be unveiled around the time of the Naples summit of the seven leading industrialized countries in July, Okamatsu said, echoing an earlier remark made by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. Okamatsu denied rumors that a discrepancy of views exists over Japan's macroeconomic policy among the trade, finance and foreign ministries. The Foreign Ministry is said to be receptive toward setting objective criteria on the macroeconomic front, taking into account Japan's current-account surplus as against its gross domestic product, while the Finance Ministry is opposed to the idea. "We have no discrepancy over the issue at vice-ministerial levels," Okamatsu said. On voluntary plans now being formulated by Japanese automakers to increase imports of U.S.-made auto parts and automobiles, Okamatsu said such plans will not be included in the market-opening package. "Auto trade is an activity of the private sector," Okamatsu said. "MITI is not in a position to force automakers to do this or that." Okamatsu said MITI has yet to decide if Japan will extend voluntary restraints on auto exports to the United States for fiscal 1994 starting in April. He said MITI will "carefully watch the situation" and make a decision on the issue in line with a global trade accord under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that calls for the repeal of such practices within four years.
