The entire sum was seized. It has not yet been established where the so-called businessmen obtained the scarce commodity. But one thing is for sure: They were not selling it legally. Right now they stand accused under Article 88 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code of breaking the rules of currency transactions, since osmium is classed as a precious hard-currency commodity. Osmium-192 is used as a catalyst in nuclear reactors. According to the counterintelligence agents' information, the purchaser was a middleman and the goods were not intended for a Russian customer.
