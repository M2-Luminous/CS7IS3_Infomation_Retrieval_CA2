After the meeting, president of the Srpska republic Radovan Karadzic said: [Karadzic] I wish to say that today's talks were long. Considering the crisis that we are gradually overcoming, it is not surprising that they were long and difficult, but in any case we have made some progress in overcoming the crisis, particularly regarding our relations with the United Nations and the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]. Today we achieved certain progress as regards the position of UNPROFOR members on our territory. [Words indistinct] that it has still not reached all the headquarters, but it will reach them in any case. As far as Gorazde is concerned, the situation is much more complex and very difficult to resolve. We have agreed to order an immediate cease-fire, a certain disengagement of forces in the conflict -- as much as it is possible -- maximal restraint regarding activities and provocations, and finally, to do the utmost that can be done in the humanitarian field. I believe that UN helicopters will fly in in the morning to evacuate the wounded and killed. If we manage to implement the cease-fire and achieve a certain disengagement of forces, then we can say that we are drawing closer to peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Kusmuk] Addressing the assembled journalists, Akashi said: [Akashi in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] President Karadzic and I agreed that a cease-fire around Gorazde should go into effect immediately and that troops would be withdrawn from the town as soon as possible. We agreed that all sides should maximally restrain themselves from all offensive activities. In the meantime we shall review the talks and try to sign an agreement as soon as possible in order to stabilize the situation. President Karadzic agreed to an urgent evacuation of humanitarian personnel and population from Gorazde. UNPROFOR is ready to do so tomorrow morning at 0800. [Kusmuk] At around 1730 in the presidency of the Srpska republic, informal talks continued between diplomats and the political leadership of the republic. [end recording]
