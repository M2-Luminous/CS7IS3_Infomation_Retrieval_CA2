In that time both international organizations, including the United Nations, and the press have talked sometimes of a bomb that has already been created, and have sometimes said that it is on the point of being manufactured. However, so far no one has produced evidence of the bomb -- neither the Americans, nor the Koreans themselves. Pyongyang is continuing to insist that it is not even dreaming of having its own nuclear cudgel. Meanwhile, the United States is preparing to implement economic sanctions against the DPRK and persuade the rest of the world to do the same -- the Americans themselves have never had trade dealings with the DPRK. There has even been some talk of a military solution to the problem. It is hard to object to sanctions, which could solve the problem, although they threaten the emergence of yet another hot spot on Russia's borders. But will sanctions provide the answer to a number of very important questions? First of all, why has Pyongyang taken such a long time to furnish itself with a nuclear bomb (the first nuclear reactor in the DPRK was started up in 1965)? Why, by analogy with the "Korean nuclear problem," does the world not know about the "Israeli," the "Pakistani," or anyone else's problem? No one can guarantee the absence of a bomb in those states. How much will it cost Russia to suddenly discontinue economic relations with the DPRK as a trade partner of many years' standing? The wise Chinese will most likely refuse to participate in the sanctions. Why at the time was there no such concern about the acquisition by Pyongyang of MiG-29 aircraft? After all, it is clear to the most pathetic expert in distant France or Great Britain that the use of these airplanes (with conventional weapons) against the nine nuclear electric power stations in South Korea is no less dangerous than the detonation of a nuclear munition. It is also unclear why all the "interested" parties, including the DPRK, have unambiguously failed to support the Russian idea to convene an international conference to break the "deadlock," while the United States is moving increasingly toward the use of coercive methods. Is not the present massive pressure on the DPRK connected with the U.S. President's statement that the campaign for freedom which began with the landing of the allied troops in Normandy in 1944 did not end with the demise of the USSR? You get the impression that the United States, Japan, South Korea, and indeed Pyongyang itself are not worried by the problem as such of the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, but that each of these countries is exploiting it merely to achieve its own political ends.
