Actually, this is not the most important thing just now. North Korea, the eternal outsider of the international community, has finally maneuvered itself into a corner and is standing with its back to a wall. The question now is, can the Korea crisis be settled peacefully or is a conflict unavoidable? China could have the answer to that. China is the only country that has good contacts with Pyongyang and with Seoul -- the ideal mediator, therefore. Therefore, South Korea's President Kim Young Sam hopes for diplomatic support during his visit to Beijing. However, PRC President Jiang Zemin told him only what he had told to the worried Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa a week ago: China relies on patient negotiations. China does not want any pressure on North Korea. Wu Jianmin, spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry says: [Begin Wu Jianmin recording] Political pressure or even sanctions would just escalate the current tensions and make the situation even more complicated. China is in contact with all parties involved, but our influence is limited, and we do not want to interfere in the negotiations. The dialogue must be held between North Korea on the one side and the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency], the United States, and South Korea on the other. Of course, China wants stability in Korea and we do not want nuclear weapons there -- be it in the north or in the south. [end recording] If North Korea is working on the bomb in its nuclear facilities, this cannot be a matter of indifference to China. It does not want a new nuclear power in its neighborhood, in particular because South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan could arm themselves with nuclear weapons within the shortest possible period out of fear of North Korea. The strategic balance in eastern Asia, which is still to China's advantage at the moment, would be lastingly disturbed. Therefore, some see the reason for Beijing's imperturbability in the fact that the Chinese intelligence service knows more than the West, which has only some satellite pictures. Perhaps China knows that North Korea will not be able to produce nuclear weapons for a long time to come. Perhaps, however, China is still loyal to the fraternal communist country. In the Korean war, half a million Chinese soldiers died on Kim Il-song's side, and in China's leadership there are still the old revolutionaries, who have not forgotten that. However, whatever the reason, the official justification is: China does not interfere, particularly not when sanctions are threatened. [Begin Wu Jianmin recording] I give you an example that explains why China insists on finding a solution by means of negotiations. This is just as with Chinese herbal medicine. It needs a very long time to have an effect, just as negotiations. If you treat an illness with herbs, the healing process might take longer, but in the end, it might be much better than to have precipitate surgery. [end recording] [passage omitted]
