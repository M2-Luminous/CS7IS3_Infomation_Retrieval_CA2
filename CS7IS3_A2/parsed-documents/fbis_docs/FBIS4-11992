[Rabin] We should make a distinction between withdrawing -- that is, ceding the overall responsibility -- and between starting to implement certain elements of the agreement, even if all the details have not been concluded yet -- providing the security issues are being implemented in a clear and well-organized manner. After all, we must set up completely new security networks there. We have to establish a foundation for the Palestinian police force which will assume responsibility in Gaza. Greater Gaza numbers 250,000 Palestinians. I have no desire to see Israeli soldiers and policemen roaming there. They have no business being there once a Palestinian element assumes responsibility for law and order and for preventing terrorism in Gaza, but this cannot happen overnight. We must prove to the enemies of peace on all sides that despite the despicable murders of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], the Islamic Jihad, the rejectionist front organizations and those coming from the Israeli side -- mainly the crime of that murderer from Qiryat Arba' whose name does not deserve mention -- that we are continuing the process. [DAVAR] In view of the present situation, wherein every step forward is followed by three steps backward, is it not preferable to skip over the interim stages? [Rabin] It is impossible to skip over the interim stages, because that would lead to a complete stalemate. If we start dealing with the permanent solution, the problems of Jerusalem, the settlements, and the borders will crop up. The main test now is to continue the negotiations and to implement the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. I understand the Palestinians' and 'Arafat's predicament, but he has to understand -- just as I and the Israeli Government do -- that any delay only causes problems in implementing the agreement and is helping the enemies of peace on both sides foil it. The answer is that both sides overcome all the difficulties and realize that the appropriate answer to the enemies of peace is to attain and implement the agreement. [passage omitted] [DAVAR] There are those who claim -- some ministers included -- that in order to minimize the friction in Hebron the Jewish settlers should be evacuated now, without waiting for the next stages. [Rabin] I do not want to remark here on various operative proposals. When I was prime minister between 1974-1977 I did not permit any Jewish settlement in Hebron. Now, however, after the fact and on the basis of the Declaration of Principles, we are not uprooting settlements. It is very probable that in the special circumstances of Hebron, as long as the small Jewish settlement exists there, we will have to find other arrangements which would provide security to the 120,000 residents of Hebron vis-a-vis the 415 Jews living there. [DAVAR] Will you at least make sure that no more Jews move there? [Rabin] I do not want to enter the details. [DAVAR] Was it not possible to evacuate the two minor Jewish enclaves in Hebron a long time ago? [Rabin] Tall al-Rumaythah was established in August 1984, a month after the elections and a month prior to the establishment of the national unity government. The place is an archaeological site, perhaps even a cemetery. Mrs. Pli'a Albeck, who approved the Jewish holdings there, at the time stated that it is forbidden to dig in that ground and is necessary to dwell in mobile homes there because they do not call for digging foundations in the ground. If anybody dared to build a road somewhere in Israel over such a site, a great outcry would have ensued. Some seven or eight families live there. Two people under administrative arrest live there -- Barukh Marzel and No'am Federman. One of them is under detention and the other is on the wanted list. The decision to settle there was stupid, it is the classical example of a stupid political decision. [DAVAR] Is not the presence of five armies in Hebron -- the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], armed settlers, international observers, the Palestinian police, and Hamas people -- a sure recipe for a powder keg? [Rabin] Unfortunately it has already been proven that Hebron is a powder keg. Today we are paying the price of this despicable murderer, the lives of Jews worldwide and in Israel have been endangered by him. The first thing we must do now is to provide security for both Jews and Arabs in the present layout, with a urban police force and international presence. This is the price we must pay for the crime perpetrated by the despicable murderer in the Cave of the Patriarchs. [passage omitted] [DAVAR] How do you see the West Bank following the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho? [Rabin] I regard Gaza as marginal for Israel's future and security. The status of Judaea and Samaria, from both the historical-religious and the security aspects, is totally different. My national priorities are as follows: United Jerusalem has top priority. Then come parts of Judaea and Samaria, the Golan Heights, and Gaza is in last place. [DAVAR] Will you consider the removal of problematic settlements such as Netzarim following the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho? [Rabin] I want to adhere to the agreement. At this stage we are not discussing the removal of settlements. In Hebron we somewhat deviated from the agreement by accepting the international presence, but here we are paying the price of the despicable murderer from Qiryat Arba'. [DAVAR] There are assessments according to which if we declare our willingness to withdraw from all of the Golan, a full peace agreement with Syria can be attained in a short time. [Rabin] I maintained that in the previous circumstances, faced by an inflexible Syrian position, we should have given priority to negotiations with the Palestinians. I hope that upon the resumption of the talks in late April Syria will evince a new willingness. We must remember that the Palestinians do not constitute a threat to Israel's existence. The main problem with them has to do with the personal security of Israelis. A strategic threat to Israel's existence comes from the direction of Arab armies, and it is possible that in future they will be supported by military aid from another Muslim country. This is where we invest most of our defense budget. We do not need the F-15's, F-16's, Apache helicopter gunships, and Merkava tanks for our confrontation with the Palestinians. This is why we need a peace agreement with Syria, but it must be a peace treaty which will provide Israel with strategic security. With the Palestinians we are trying to create a new reality which will improve chances for coexistence. In the framework of the interim arrangement we are trying to bring about coexistence in a different format than today, a format enabling the Palestinians to run their own lives and defend themselves. [DAVAR] Based on what you heard from Clinton about his meeting with al-Asad, and on what Ambassador Rabinovich told you, do you think there are any chances for a breakthrough with Syria? [Rabin] I always believe there is a chance. But I cannot tell you that this breakthrough is within reach at this stage. [DAVAR] Are there secret contacts with Syria? [Rabin] Unfortunately, no. [DAVAR] Turning to Lebanon, it looks as though things are getting worse there. Palestinian terror organizations have taken advantage of the agreement with the Hizballah for firing katyusha missiles at our northern settlements for the second time. [Rabin] There is no point in downplaying this. There has been an escalation in Hizballah activity, and Palestinian organizations have been joining this activity more intensely than before. At the same time, the understandings remain in effect even if there are occasional deviations. If I am not mistaken, there were two such cases since last July. At the same time, for the last eight or nine months calm and security have prevailed along the northern border. The IDF and SLA [South Lebanese Army] are paying a dear price for maintaining this security. [DAVAR] In retrospect, do you not think it would have been preferable to continue Operation Accountability for another few days in order to attain a better agreement? [Rabin] No, we achieved our main objective. It would have been a grave mistake to repeat the Lebanon War. [DAVAR] What expectations do you have of your upcoming meeting with Yeltsin? [Rabin] I have not asked for this meeting. He invited me, and during the visit in late April I will try -- if nothing unexpected happens -- to discuss various political issues with him and with the top Russian echelon. We are witnessing renewed Russian political activity. This is not up to us, it is a fact. We are mainly coordinating our moves with the United States, but we cannot ignore the fact that Russia has been a partner, together with the United States, in the Madrid process and the ensuing negotiations, and we must maintain the dialogue with it. The second important aspect of this visit will be the meeting with Russian Jewry. [DAVAR] Can the Russians offer any help on the Syrian track? [Rabin] It is hard to answer this question before I speak with Yeltsin. [DAVAR] Will you ask Yeltsin to act on the issue of the POW's and MIA's? [Rabin] Everywhere I go I raise this issue, including during my meeting with the pope. [passage omitted] [DAVAR] A group of South African scientists have threatened to reveal the secrets of nuclear and missile cooperation between Israel and South Africa. Are you concerned about this? [Rabin] I am not concerned about anything relating to what you term the nuclear cooperation between Israel and South Africa, because there never was such cooperation. [passage omitted]
