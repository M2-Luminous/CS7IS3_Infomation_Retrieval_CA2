I do not believe in the alliance between Arnoldo Aleman and Steadman Fagoth. Fagoth is unstable, has been going from one extreme to the other, Rivera stated this afternoon at the Supreme Electoral Council office in Metrocentro. Had we not participated in the vote-counting process on the Atlantic Coast, we would have given the impression of being incompetent. Leading troops is not the same as being political leaders and presenting a political platform. We are not thinking of any political agreements before 1996, Nicaraguan Resistance [RN] Commanders Jose and Johnson have stated. The Liberal Constitutionalist Party, PLC, is anticipated to be the election winners in the upper and central region and lower valley of Rio Coco, as well as in Siuna sectors one, two, and three. The PLC is expected to follow a similar trend in Halban, Pancazan, and Nueva York neighborhoods in the city of Bluefields. Dr. Mariano Fiallos Oyanguren, Supreme Electoral Council president made the previous statement at a news conference held a few moments ago.
