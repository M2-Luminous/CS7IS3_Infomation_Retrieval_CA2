FBIS4-6153 "dreas075__a94010" FBIS-EAS-94-075-A Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan DA To Build Helicopters Under Sikorsky License DA To Build Helicopters Under Sikorsky License OW1504103994 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 14 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1504103994 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The Defense Agency [DA] has tentatively decided to adopt helicopters built by American Sikorsky Company as a model to build next-generation multipurpose helicopters (UH-X) for use by the Ground Self-Defense Force [GSDF], and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries will build the helicopters after obtaining a license from the American helicopter builder. The DA, which has informally notified the American helicopter builder of its tentative decision, plans to include expenditures for the procurement of several helicopters in its preliminary budget request for fiscal 1995. Eurocopter, a French and German joint-venture helicopter-manufacturing company, has negotiated with the DA, but it has decided to seek the license for the production of advanced helicopters from Sikorsky Company which has granted Japanese defense contractors licenses to build helicopters for use by the Air Self-Defense Force and the Maritime Self-Defense Force. The advanced helicopters cost approximately 4 billion yen each and the DA is expected to procure about 50 of them in the long run. The UH-X is a successor to the current UH-H helicopter which is used by the GSDF for transport of troops and rescue operations. The DA has classified the successor into two types -- the advanced model and the conventional model. The UH-X belongs to the advanced one whereas the UH-H belongs to the conventional one. The DA has begun to procure UH-J helicopter, a new version of the UH-H, which Fuji Heavy Industries has built under the license granted by American Bell Company. The DA has worked on choosing a model of large helicopter that exceeds the UH-J helicopter in flying range and transport capability. Although Eurocopter has negotiated with the DA, it has tentatively decided to adopt UH-60J built by Sikorsky Company as a model to build the UH-X helicopters. No decision has been made on the next plan for defense buildup which begins from 1996. Details of the DA's plans to purchase the advanced helicopters are unknown, but it is expected to procure about 50 advanced helicopters.
