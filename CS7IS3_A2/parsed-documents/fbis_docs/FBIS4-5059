The outline, set for release in June, suggested that such a transfer would enable Japan to "realize a land structure suitable for the 21st century." The issue of transferring the Diet outside the capital has been debated for years. The panel said it would also serve to facilitate political and administrative reforms, including deregulation and decentralization of power. The outline will serve as the basis for an intermediate report to be issued in June on the subject of the "significance and effect" of making such a transfer. Afterwards, the committee will come up with a master plan. At the end of the month, a separate advisory panel will begin considering what conditions should be met before considering new sites for the Diet. Contenders include such cities as Sendai in northern Japan.
