A source with the General Staff of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] says the bombing was carried out at 1045, resulting in two dead and four seriously wounded. The dead include 78-year-old Antonio Jose Capando and a two-year-old child. Meanwhile, clashes were reported in Bie yesterday. It all began when an MPLA-PT air force plane overflew UNITA defense lines and parachuted lethal equipment. Military sources say that once government troops realized that the supplies had fallen beyond their positions, they used force to try to break through UNITA lines. FALA forces stationed in Bie are instructed not to react to any provocation, but had to take action in view of the threat posed by the advancing troops of Brigadier Simeone. Fire was exchanged for over three hours. The government army suffered at least 15 killed and an unspecified number of wounded. It is believed that a number of civilians have been killed because of clashes in a residential area. FALA's command in the city of Bie regret the occurrence and has warned Luanda to desist from overflying the city of Bie with its air force. Today the situation returned to normal and the residents were able to go about their lives.
