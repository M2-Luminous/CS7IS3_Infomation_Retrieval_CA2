The efficiency of conversion from light energy to electric energy by solar cells drops when temperature rises, so experiments will be carried out to search for an effective way to cool solar cells in Malaysia, where high temperatures prevail. The system is composed of monocrystalline solar cells with 10 kilowatt (kw) output, 136 kw hour (kwh) storage batteries, and data collection equipment. Experiments will be conducted with several types of natural cooling and forced cooling methods. In experiments with natural cooling, modules of multiple solar cells mounted on a single board will be placed on water or separated from the ground surface; and various angles of inclination will be tried. In experiments with forced cooling, the surface of the modules will be sprayed with water or air will be blown from the back of the modules. A 100 kw output system will be built in FY95 in order to switch to large-scale research. NEDO's share of the cost is about Â¥600 million.
