Last week, the leadership of ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] which signed the Cotonou Peace Accord with the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] and the interim government, was split by a challenge to Alhaji Koromah. Today's swearing-in ceremony was delayed after it was reported that the NPFL had made a last-minute change to its nominee on the council replacing Isaac Musa with Robert Brice. From Monrovia, Nianate Allison telexed this report. Liberians today joyously sang national songs and shouted: The Lone Star forever, Lone Star forever, as the country moved closer to reunification with the induction into office of the five-man Transitional Council. The faces of many in the half-century-old Centennial Hall were brightened when Chief Justice James Bull administered the oath of office of the five-member council. The ceremony finally began after nearly five hours of delay. An official of the outgoing interim government said later the delay was to clear remaining hurdles. Council Chairman David Kpomakpor and Phillip Banks are nominees of the dissolved interim government of Amos Sawyer; while co-chairman, Isaac Musa, represents the NPFL. ULIMO is represented by Mohamed Sheriff and (Dexter Tayul). ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] chairman, Benin's president Nicephore Soglo, who attended the ceremony, urged Liberians to unite and work rapidly to achieve the democratic institutions you have so long desired. He said: Everyone of you have much to forgive and to forget because that is the only way peace can come to Liberia.
