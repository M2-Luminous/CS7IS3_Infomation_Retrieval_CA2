This action is connected with the investigation of the explosion of a car bomb in front of the Monaco Building, owned by the late Pablo Escobar Gaviria. Through a citation order posted at 0800 yesterday, in the prosecutors' common secretariat, the Prosecutor's Office summoned Rodriguez and Santacruz to submit to questioning as presumed intellectual perpetrators of the car bomb. Its explosion occurred at dawn on 13 January 1988, in front of the building in which the "capo" was residing with his family. The citation order was posted in Medellin, Cali, and Mariquita, and its terms will run from the time that the document is posted in the two latter cities. According to official spokesmen, if, within the next three days, the pair accused of this terrorist act fail to appear for questioning, implementing their submission to justice, the process will follow its normal course and court-appointed attorneys will be named. Killed in the attack on the Monaco Building were Miguel Angel Espinoza and Javier de Jesus Tamayo Perez, guards of the property. After the explosion, the authorities discovered inside the building a valuable art collection containing such works as paintings by Botero, Dali, Grau, Obregon, and Dario Morales. It also included one of the seven copies of Rodin's "The Thinker" existing in the world, Chinese vases of the Ming Dynasty, and pre-Columbian works. Moreover, they found in the Monaco Building's basement eight antique vehicles, a collection of motorcycles, and a completely armored Mercedes-Benz limousine. The explosion destroyed three nearby houses and seriously damaged several adjacent buildings, causing losses in the millions. Furthermore, yesterday the authorities extended the questioning in the Antioquia Regional Prosecutor's Office of Valentin de Jesus Taborda, one of Pablo Escobar's aides, arrested in Itagui, and Luis Eduardo Fernandez Bedoya, alias "Lucho," ringleader of the people's militias in Valle de Aburra.
