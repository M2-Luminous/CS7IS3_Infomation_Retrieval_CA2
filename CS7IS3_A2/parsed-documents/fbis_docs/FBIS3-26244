Chiang Friday welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to lift a U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam, saying it will help accelerate economic reforms which will eventually benefit Taiwan investors. The Clinton decision, announced Thursday night at the White House, will end an embargo imposed on Hanoi in 1964 and extended to the whole country at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Chiang said U.S. businesses led the rally to end the embargo. U.S. businessmen said the embargo locked them out of the potentially lucrative Vietnamee market while European and Asian nations invested hundreds of millions of dollars and secured development contracts there. Chiang said with the lifting of the trade embargo, more foreign capital will flow into the burgeoning Vietnamese market, which will help boost incomes and buying power. The country's need for machinery and consumer products from Taiwan will also increase, Chiang remarked. Up to Jan. 19, the Vietnamese Government had approved 113 applications by Taiwan investors for investments worth over US$1.53 billion, making Taiwan the No. 1 foreign investor in that country. Chiang added that the government will continue to promote Taiwan investments in Vietnam, fully implementing the Republic of China [ROC]'s "southern strategy." Two-way trade between Taiwan and Vietnam, inaugurated in September, 1989, jumped by a factor of five in under four years. In 1993, bilateral trade totaled US$655 million with Taiwan enjoying a US$360 million trade surplus, according to ministry statistics. Trade and investment ties between Vietnam and Taiwan became closer after the two countries signed an investment guarantee agreement on April 21, 1993, according to the Vietnamese Economic and cultural office in Taipei. With the signing of the investment agreement, more and steady Taiwan investments weno to vietnam, contributing to the country's economic growth, said Lin Shui-chi, ROC representative in Vietnam. "It won't take long for Vietnam to turn itself into the fifth little dragon in Asia," Lin said. Taiwan previously lent Vietnam US$30 million to expand a highway and another US$15 million to fund the development of small- and medium-sized Vietnamese companies. Taipei decided to lend an additional US$10 million to Vietnam last month to help the country build an industrial park in Hanoi to house Taiwan-invested factories.
