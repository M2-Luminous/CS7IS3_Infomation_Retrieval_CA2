They were going to board a bus at the Chiang Mai Ah Khet bus station. Thus, he ordered Police Lieutenant Colonel Leophong Chiamkarakit, the inspector for investigation, Police Captain Suwit Luanprasoet, the deputy inspector for investigation, and a team of officials to conduct an investigation. Police 1st Lieutenant Sirimon Wisutthikun, the deputy inspector for investigation and coordination, was ordered to go see Mr. Thanongkiat Chimphli, the head of the northern ONCB [Office of the Narcotics Control Board] unit, and obtain his cooperation in arresting the traffickers. At 0830 hours on 1 November 1993, police and ONCB officials concealed themselves around the Ah Khet bus station. At that moment, a man dressed in a military uniform carrying a satchel started to board the Chiang Mai-Phayao bus. He fit the description provided by a police informer and so the officials conducted a search and arrested him. When the police searched the satchel, they found four bags of Tiger and Globe brand heroin weighing 1,440 grams. The suspect was identified as Sergeant Ranaphum Phrabun, age 30, who lives at 115 Village 8, Nong Faek Subdistrict, Saraphi District, Chiang Mai Province. He was stationed at the provincial army base in Phayao Province. During the interrogation, Sergeant Ranaphum said that a merchant, name unknown, had paid him 2,000 baht to deliver the heroin to a customer in Bangkok. But he was going to go to Phayao Province first before delivering the heroin to the customer in Bangkok. He had been paid the 2,000 baht in advance. After delivering the heroin, he was supposed to be paid an additional amount, but he did not know how much. The merchant who hired him had told him that he had purchased the heroin in Fang District, Chiang Mai Province. He asked him to serve as a courier because he was a soldier. The man thought that that would be more convenient than hiring a civilian. But he was arrested. This was the first time that he had tried to transport narcotics. [passage omitted]
