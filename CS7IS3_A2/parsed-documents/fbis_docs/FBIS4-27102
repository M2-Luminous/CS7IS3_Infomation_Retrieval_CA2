FBIS4-27102 "dreas104_c_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 28 May 1994 North Korea `Slanders' on Fuel Rods Replacement Alleged `Slanders' on Fuel Rods Replacement Alleged SK2805062194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0613 GMT 28 May 94 SK2805062194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Obstruction to Replacement of Fuel Rods Denounced" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today refutes the slanders persistently hurled by seditious forces at the refueling of the 5 megawatt experimental atomic power station of the DPRK. The analyst says: They are demanding the selected separation of fuel rods and sampling. This is intended to invent a new pretext for claiming credit for the inconsistency faked by them by forcing the DPRK to fully implement the safeguards agreement, ignoring its unique status. We can never allow this under the present condition, no matter what others say and what a counteraction they may take. The United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have practically recognized the unique status of the DPRK after the temporary suspension of the effectuation of its withdrawal from the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. They recognized it only yesterday and ignore it today, attempting to reverse it. This is a shameless act of denying what they have just said in order to attain their sinister aim. It is utterly nonsensical to tell us to suspend the refueling of the reactor. We had frozen the operation of the graphite moderated reactor, suffering enormous economic losses, in the hope that the DPRK-U.S. agreement on its conversion into a light water reactor would be implemented. However, the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks ended abortive and the prospect of the implementation of the agreement became dim owing to the perfidy of the United States. Under this condition, we cannot allow ourselves to suffer unilateral economic losses by freezing the operation of the graphite moderated reactor. And to tell us to stop the replacement of fuel rods halfway is as good as urging us to reconcile ourselves to the danger of radioactive leakage. As regards the refueling of the reactor, we informed the agency of it five times, urging it to be present on the scene and take necessary measures including the removal of the seals. The current refueling is taking place under the strict watch of the inspection cameras installed by the agency and the fuel rods are placed under the surveillance of the agency as soon as they are taken out. Thus, the replacement of fuel rods is being carried on from a fully justifiable position. Nevertheless, they demand that we suspend the replacement of fuel rods. This means that we should comply with their demand, braving colossal economic losses and formidable danger. How can we accept their demand? The United States and the agency should feel themselves responsible for the impasse where the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has reached today and put their heart and soul into its removal. The most reasonable solution to the issue is to preserve all the replaced fuel rods under the surveillance of the agency and measure them when the nuclear problem is solved in a package deal in the future. Then the nondivergence of the fuel rods replaced this time for another purpose will be guaranteed and the uprightness of our past nuclear activities be verified through the measurement of all the fuel rods. It is an arrogant stance to insist that anyone must accept their demand, though wrong. The international seditious forces must act reasonably, clearly knowing that their untenable demand may lead the situation to a more complicated phase.
