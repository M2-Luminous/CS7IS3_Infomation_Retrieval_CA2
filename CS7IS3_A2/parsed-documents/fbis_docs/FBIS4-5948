A Pentagon spokesman, Maj. Steve Little, said he does not know when Perry will be able to make the trip. "We don't know yet how long it will be delayed. The scheduling is definitely a problem," little told KYODO NEWS SERVICE by phone. The Pentagon issued a statement about the cancellation of Perry's trip hours after a senior Defense Department official briefed reporters on the upcoming visit, which would have been Perry's first to the region since becoming defense chief in early February. "The decision (to postpone the trip) was made to allow Secretary Perry time to ensure that the families of those who were killed are fully supported, to guarantee a thorough investigation, and also to review the existing procedures," the Pentagon said. Perry was originally scheduled to arrive in Seoul on Sunday and travel on to Tokyo on Tuesday before returning home on Thursday.
