In moving the first and second reading of my private member's bill -- the Electoral Provisions (Miscellaneous Amendment) (No 3) Bill 1994 -- on June 1, I sought to implement a pledge I made when I stood for direct election in September 1991, that is, I would fight for a fully directly-elected Legislative Council. To the British Government, Hong Kong people's demand for democracy was a bargaining chip in negotiations with China to help Britain secure economic benefits, as was demonstrated in the Daya Bay nuclear power plant and the new airport. Britain probably would not go out of its way to harm Hong Kong's interests, but when conflicts of interest arise, Hong Kong would inevitably lose out. In 1984, Beijing and London foisted the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong people. It stipulated that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) legislature would be constituted by elections and the SAR would have a high degree of autonomy. My bill is fully in line with the Joint Declaration and provides for an important element in safeguarding the high degree of autonomy which was promised. It is also in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance. I admit my bill violates the Basic Law stipulation that only 20 of 60 Legislative Council [Legco] seats should be directly elected in 1997, but the Basic Law only comes into force in 1997 and my bill is about elections in 1995. Furthermore, since Beijing has vowed to dismantle the Council in 1997 no matter how it is constituted, concern for the so-called political through train is irrelevant. The Basic Law, like the Joint Declaration, was imposed on the powerless Hong Kong people in 1990. Given a choice, I believe many would support universal suffrage rather than a hopelessly complicated hybrid system. To coincide with the Joint Declaration, the British administration published a White Paper in November 1984 stating that Hong Kong would make "a gradual start by introducing a very small number of directly-elected seats in 1988 and building up to a significant number of directly-elected seats by 1997". In November 1985, sensing Britain's intention, the Chinese accused it of deviating from the Joint Declaration and demanded all arrangements during the transition period must converge with the Basic Law, a mini constitution for post-1997 Hong Kong which would be promulgated by the Chinese National People's Congress in 1990. Former British foreign minister, Timothy Renton, visited Beijing in January 1986 and said the British Government agreed developments in Hong Kong should "converge" with the Basic Law. So Beijing had virtual veto power over important decisions during the transition. Faced with growing demand for direct elections, the Hong Kong Government rigged an opinion poll in 1987 to say there should only be 10 directly-elected Legislative Council seats in 1991 since the people's views on direct elections in 1988 were divided. This was roundly condemned, among others by members of the UN Human Rights Committee, which held hearings on Hong Kong in November 1988. Shaken by the Tiananmen massacre in 1989, the British did some damage control by offering to increase the number of directly- elected seats in 1991 to 18. When Chris Patten was appointed Governor, he proposed cautious constitutional reforms in October 1992, seeking to widen the franchise within the Basic Law. I called it "a drop of democracy". Even then, it was brutally attacked by the Chinese Government. Such an antagonistic attitude showed Beijing would not even tolerate a limited degree of democracy, let alone give the SAR a high degree of autonomy. Apart from being less than democratic, the Government's package is complicated and contrived. The other amendments members have proposed are even more complex and have not been examined by the Council. It is farcical to think the Council might pass a bill which has not been scrutinised! Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd once said he did not want the final chapter of the history of the British Empire to end in a shabby way. If the Government insists on putting forward an undemocratic and incomprehensible system, Mr Hurd's fears could well come true.
