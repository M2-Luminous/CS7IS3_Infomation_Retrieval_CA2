Right after absorbing the two-digit inflation in 1993, they have witnessed the tide of rural workers who have flooded the cities. When the raging tide of rural workers slightly subsided, they are once again awakened by the loud clamors of "price increases." Under the influence of increasing demand and high production costs, the market price had sharply increased in January. The prices for consumer goods in January rose 23.1 percent as compared with that of the same period in 1993. The rate of increases for food, clothing, health care, entertainment, education and culture was even relatively higher. Due to the after-effect of the excessive amount of currency in circulation, the price of basic industrial products continued to rise on a large scale in February, and signs showing price increases were everywhere on the market. The rate of price increases for the first two months in 1994 still exceeded 20 percent over the corresponding period in 1993. Since the People's Bank of China had once again handled value-guaranteed saving deposits on 11 July 1993, it had, for the first time, announced that the annual subsidy rate for value-guaranteed saving deposits was set to 1.19 percent in March 1994. The All China Federation of Trade Unions also made public that about 7 million workers are badly off in the whole country. On the eve of the "two sessions," Fang Shunping, a benchworker in Yongsheng Machinery Plant in Fuzhou, Jiangxi narrated a pathetic story to a grassroots-level trade union cadre about how he suffered from the skyrocketing commodity price. He said: "Our plant suffered financial losses since last year. I and my wife persistently worked hard everyday. Our combined wages total slightly over 300 yuan. "Our chubby boy is a fourth-grade student. He does not care much about food or clothes. The only thing he likes most is to play the game machine. However, I cannot afford to buy a game machine. "In order to play the game machine, my son let those students with game machines to ride him as a horse everyday. Once I discovered that. I pulled my perspiring son to the side, and asked him why he did something stupid like this? He said nothing, but struggled to get free and ran away. Only when he came home, did he tell me the reason in tears. "In the evening, my son who finished his homework told me quietly: `Dad, buy me a game machine please. If I have a game machine, I will not let other students ride me as a horse.' "I felt really bad. Hugging him tightly, I said: `It is not that I am unwilling to buy you a game machine. It is just because that commodity price is so high that I cannot afford to buy the game machine. I can barely buy food with what I earn. I really cannot help you.' "My son seemed to understand my plight. With grievous disappointment, he went to bed. That night, I could not sleep. The price is going up and up like a balloon filled with hydrogen gas. Why is that?" The question posed by Fang Shunping is also in the minds of the 7 million workers who are badly off. Whoever listens to his grievances is not only the basic-level trade union cadre. These workers often hear that they must pay a price for carrying out reform. They only want to know how high the price they need to pay this year. They also understand that they need to withstand hardship in order to successfully carry out reform. They only want to know for what they need to suffer so much. Probe Sources of High Price Index The civilian sector and the government have their own forecasts for this year's general level of retail sales. Not long ago, the "Department of Macro-Economic Analysis of China" conducted the 6th survey on China's economic situation by distributing questionnaires to the specialists concerned. One hundred fifty-eight economists expressed their own views on this. According to statistics, 32.9 of them predicted that the rate of increase of retail sales will be in the range of 12-14 percent; 29.1 percent of them predicted 8-10 percent; and 22.8 percent of them predicted 12-14 percent. Some young scholars conducted simulated tests on the economic situation in 1992 and 1993. Their conclusion was that if the rate of economic growth in 1994 is maintained at approximately 10 percent, then the rate of increase of retail price index will be in the range of 12-13 percent. Their judgment has been proven correct by the red light shown by the price indices of the three months in this year's first quarter. Therefore, high commodity price will remain the major rhythm in 1994. There are five reasons for this. 1. After-Effects of Price Reform. Since the price reform, more than 80 percent of the price for means of production and 90 percent of the price for means of subsistence have been completely decontrolled. The seriously distorted price structure has been gradually corrected by the large price increases for the basic industrial products. For example, after its decontrol, the price of grain and fuel rose by 35.5 percent and 78 percent, respectively. These large price increases for basic capital goods and consumer goods have pushed up the production costs of farm products and industrial manufactured goods, and made the prices for products manufactured by related industries to go up. As seen from the situation in 1994, the series of price adjustments recently announced will become a major reason for pushing up China's general price index for this year. 2. Excessive Issuance of Currency. Prior to this round of inflation, the amount of currency issued in 1992 was increased by 115.9 billion yuan as compared with that in 1991. Because of the multiplicative effect, the issuance of 115.9 billion yuan basic currency is equivalent to derivative loans of 200 to 250 billion yuan. The additional currency issued in 1992 not only helped awaken the enthusiasm in production and consumption, which was dampened by the campaign for improvement and rectification of the economic order, but also pushed the 1993 commodity price to a high rate of 13 percent. Thus, the 1993 policy of putting more money into circulation in support of high economic growth (50 percent higher than that in 1992) will definitely impose a burden on the economy in 1994. Excessive currency issuance accounted for 5.5 percent of the total blame for the inflation in 1993. It is estimated that this figure may exceed 7 percent this year. 3. Rising Cost of Social Labor. In order to arouse the enthusiasm of workers, enterprises that are making good profits often increase workers' wages and bonuses. The total amount of wages for workers in 1993 grew approximately 20 percent over 1992. Those local governments with more money also increase subsidies to their administrative personnel. The plan to readjust salaries of government employees announced in October last year had given pay raises to all members of the civil service. Due to the rigid nature of the wage system, it has objectively raised the cost of social labor and become a major factor in pushing the price up. 4. Restraints by "Bottleneck" Effect and Resources. These two types of restraints have always been hampering economic development. If the rate of economic growth is maintained at approximately 10 percent, the effect of the two types of restraints will be felt even more distinctively. It will make the price of relevant products to sharply increase. 5. Rapid Investment Growth. Over a protracted period of time, the rapid growth in demand for investment is the major factor in China's economic growth. However, the year of high investment often means a year of high prices. The main reason is that price increases are caused by increasing investment and by the imbalance between supply and demand due to irrational investment structure or poor investment performance. Government Is Determined To Tame "Wild Horse of Inflation" Due to lack of information and other reasons, the general public in China often fails to foresee an inflationary trend. However, the high commodity price for two years running has exerted great pressure on the residents psychologically. For the first two months in 1994, the retail price for consumer goods on the domestic market was up 25.9 percent over that in 1993. People are on the verge of panic buying. The issue of commodity price becomes the focus of deputies' conversation at the "two sessions" and arouses the close attention of the government leaders. At the group meeting with the Beijing deputy group of the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress held on 12 March, Premier Li Peng said that it is necessary to exercise the macro-control in the course of decontrolling price. At the group meeting with the Hunan deputy group on the same day, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji emphatically pointed out that in order to keep down prices, the CPC Central Committee and State Council decided to adopt the following four measures: 1) Efforts should be made to control the size of investment in fixed assets and that of consumer spending. 2) The governments at all levels must pay full attention to agriculture and the "shopping basket" project. 3) The government must strengthen the macro-control over market price. 4) In the very near future, a series of economic measures will be taken to keep down prices. Prior to and after the two sessions, the State Council in late March decided to conduct a major checkup of commodity price. This checkup is expected to last three months. It also instructed the State Planning Commission to work in coordination with the supervisory, financial, taxation, auditing, and technical control departments as well as the industrial and commercial administration to form work teams to go to various provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities under the direct administration of the government to help carry out the work of price checkup. Some local governments have also worked out rules and regulations to prevent people from making sudden huge profits in order to keep down prices. All these measures were highly praised by economists and ordinary residents. They appreciate the efforts made by the government in quickly tackling the issue of inflation which is menacing the rapidly developing economy. At the same time, an official of the Ministry of Labor stressed that the state has officially promulgated the "Regulations on Minimum Wage in Enterprises" aimed at ensuring that each worker will earn at least the minimum wage with which he can meet the basic needs in livelihood for himself and his family members. The official also asked various localities to make wage adjustments from time to time according to the living expense index. Taking Part in Investment, You May Run Faster Than a Wide Horse Whether you are willing to do so or not, you will feel an impulse to make investment and like to increase your credit, as long as China maintains a high rate of economic growth. This kind of economic growth on the basis of credit will make you live with inflation. For most of the wage earners, no one is living like Fang Shunping any more. Right now, the total amount of savings deposits in rural and urban areas has reached 1.65 trillion yuan. If we count the cash in residents' hands, the social capital in China has reached 2 trillion yuan. Economists pointed out that we must make all kinds of investments in order to preserve and increase the value of the money while living in an inflationary environment. During the 1980's, people in China only have two totally different markets. One is the market of consumer goods for basic subsistence, while the other is one for expensive high-quality merchandise. In recent years, stocks, bonds, fund-raising associations, real estate agencies and rural foundations of a shareholding and cooperative nature have emerged. In face of all types of investment programs with higher investment returns, more and more urban residents want to make money not only for filling their shopping baskets, but they also for buying houses, investing in stock and taking part in other investment programs. Signs have indicated that more and more people are investing money in China's capital market. The main participants of the capital market will be the 200 million urban population and the 30 percent of the rural population -- peasants who are capable of extending reproduction. The growth of this major group of investors means that the state-run economic sector may gradually let the nongovernment economic sector to share the market. Meanwhile, it is precisely because of the nongovernment financing market which has attracted a huge amount of currency on the market that the "wide horse of inflation" was reined in to a certain extent and a runaway inflation of more than 30 percent as predicted by some economists did not appear. At a time when individual investments aimed at withstanding inflation and achieving social diversity have gradually become the common choice of hundreds of millions of people, various strategies and tactics for investment are being offered to all those who are interested in making investments. If you want to invest in stock, you must understand the company which floats the stock, and read reports on its financial situation. If you buy and sell bonds, you must know how to calculate the earning rate. If you handle transactions in futures, you must pay attention to the price of rice and cotton at home and abroad and even the situation concerning ocean freight as well as the weather conditions and political situation in various countries. If you buy and sell foreign exchange, you must be able to predict the changes of economic policies of the major countries, and understand the rules and regulations governing the international foreign exchange market. If you make investment in real estate, you should at least take into consideration the prospect and the potential value of the estate in that area... [JIDIAN RIBAO ellipsis] After securities were officially issued for the first time in Shanghai in January 1985 and in Shenzhen in May 1987, four shareholding enterprises in Beijing also openly floated 175 million shares of stock on the market at the end of March 1994. Stock which was once regarded as "torrential flood and wild beast" withstood the test of the reform program and is now available to the general public after nine years in one locality and seven years in another. This is something of great symbolic meaning on Mainland China. At a time when ordinary people in China, who had little sense of investment and never dreamed about becoming rich before are allowed to pursue capital gains with open arms, why should you hold your cash tight and worry about the plus or minus few percent of the inflation rate?
