Qin Chijiang said: Unification of the exchange rates is the prerequisite for the establishment of a socialist market economy, which is favorable to converging with the international currency market and is very beneficial to our current economy. 1. In the past, when foreign enterprises invested in China, converted their incomes in renminbi for foreign exchange, and remitted the money to their own countries, they had to use the swap rate rather than the official exchange rate. Foreign businessmen regarded this practice as "discrimination." Now, the exchange rates have been unified, this obstacle has been removed, and it is beneficial to foreign investment in China. 2. It is beneficial for foreigners in other ways besides trade transactions. When they come to China, they can exchange their own currency for more renminbi according to the market swap rate rather than the official rate. Of course, the domestic situation is a direct contrast. Since the prices of buying foreign currency are higher, there is a heavier burden. 3. For China's enterprises engaging in foreign trade, the unification of the exchange rates has pros and cons, and they have to sell their foreign currency earned to banks according to the swap rate and buy foreign currency from banks according to the swap rate, but the system has become more reasonable. He said: Whether or not the time is ripe to unify the exchange rates should be determined by whether or not renminbi is a stable currency, whether or not there is a balance of international payments, whether or not the central bank's intervention capability is strong, and whether or not the relationship between domestic demand and supply is governed by the mechanism. Controversy over the question of whether or not the time is ripe remains. Some people question that with the emergence of trade deficits, a huge domestic demand, an extremely high degree of fixed-asset investment, and insufficient competitive power of domestic products, if large fluctuations of the exchange rate will occur following the unification of the exchange rates. But Qin Chijiang said: The unification of exchange rates is a very courageous measure, and as long as the government is mentally prepared and appropriately utilizes policies and measures, there is no need to fear, even if large fluctuations occur. Free Conversion of Renminbi in Trade Must Be Realized Before Readmission to GATT Responding the question of what measures the government would prepare, Qin Chijiang cited an example and said: The government has reduced the tariff rates of certain imports and this helps stabilize the exchange rate. When fluctuations occur in the foreign exchange market, the central bank will interfere with foreign exchange. If there is large domestic demand for foreign exchange, the central bank can also take the measure of tightening the supply of currency and putting less renminbi into circulation, and, as a result, the prices of renminbi in exchange for foreign exchange will naturally rise. As unification of the exchange rates is the first step of free conversion of renminbi, when will free conversion be realized? Director Qin said: Free conversion of renminbi in trade must be realized before we are readmitted to GATT, whereas free conversion of renminbi in nontrade activities will depend on improvement of domestic management standard and will take a longer time, but it is not possible to realize free conversion of capital because there is a great domestic demand for capital and the outflow of domestic capital through free conversion is not allowed.
