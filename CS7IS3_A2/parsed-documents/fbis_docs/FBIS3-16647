He is convinced that the positive aspects of this program and NATO's potential should be used for creating a European collective security system, for strengthening the CSCE and for broadening cooperation in peacemaking and military conversion. Nazarkin was supported by head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Department for European Cooperation Yuriy Ushakov, who said that Russia's isolation from NATO's initiative will deprive it of the opportunity to influence the implementation of the Partnership or Peace program, and NATO's cooperation with Eastern European and CIS countries. Ushakov believes that Russia will also sustain considerable financial losses, because it will lose its Eastern European arms markets which will "completely pass over to NATO after the Eastern European countries join this program." As we reported earlier, this program envisages a standardization of armaments. To quote Ushakov, Russia's participation in the NATO program does not exclude protection of its national interests. Chairman of the State Duma's Committee for International Affairs, Russia's former ambassador to the U.S. Vladimir Lukin thinks, however, that Moscow should not join this program hastily because, he said, "we have already missed the most appropriate moment for doing so." In his opinion, since the U.S. is ready to broaden relations with Russia, instead of "pushing its way to the head of the line" Russia should analyze what should be done for a more active rapprochement with this organization and closely follow its reorganization.
