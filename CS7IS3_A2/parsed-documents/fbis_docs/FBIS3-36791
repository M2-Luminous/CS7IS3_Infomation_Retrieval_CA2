He quoted military experts as saying that "the peace keeping units would immediately become hostages of such action." Zlenko thinks that Serbians could then use the air strikes as a pretext to retaliate against the peacekeeping forces. The Ukrainian minister thinks that a decision on air strikes should be made by the UN Security Council. He does not doubt that Russia would veto air strikes. He did not rule out the possibility that NATO could make a unilateral decision and emphasized that the security of peacekeeping units had to be guaranteed, in particular the Ukrainian battalion. Zlenko would not, however, welcome unilateral withdrawal of the Ukrainian unit, even if a decision to stage air strikes was made. He told the journalists that his country had earlier proposed adopting a convention on UN peacekeeping forces.
