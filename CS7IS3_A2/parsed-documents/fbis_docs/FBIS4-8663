The RS Information Ministry also informed foreign correspondents that it would no longer acknowledge press credentials and visas issued by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. This measure follows two NATO air strikes of Serb positions near Gorazde but, as is stated by the Information Ministry, could have m been adopted much earlier because of the unobjective, warmongering and openly anti-Serb coverage of events in the RS by American journalists. NATO-U.S. planes carried out air strikes Sunday and Monday against the positions of Bosnian Serbs near Gorazde, eastern Bosnia, which should have been demilitarized long ago as a protected area. Instead of being demilitarized more than 10,000 Moslem troops concentrated in this area and surged at the end of March into a fierce offensive against Serb territories. Following the strong counter-attack of the Serb forces when the Moslems were threatened with total defeat the U.N. got involved in the combat calling on NATO forces to carry out strikes on Serb positions to allegedly protect peacekeepers in Gorazde. So far the American journalists were given equal treatment as the one reserved for journalists from other countries, the RS ministry statement says. RS Information Minister Miroslav Toholj praised the decision of Yugoslav Information Minister Slobodan Ignjatovic Tuesday to revoke credentials of the journalists of AFP and CNN for spreading anti-Serb propaganda, the Bosnian Serb agency SRNA reported Thursday. SRNA states that Toholj supports the decision because the war-mongers with journalist accreditations are responsible for the largest number of the victims of the war in former Yugoslavia, and also those who died as a result of the economic sanctions.
