To what can we attribute the Workers Party's increasing popularity? We interviewed Gyula Thurmer on these issues among others. [Pogonyi] Do you agree with Peter Boross who recently said that the country would come to grief if it listened to Gyula Horn, namely to his statement that the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] government has to be replaced? [Thurmer] This poor country came to grief when it elected the current government and when the parliamentary parties did not force early elections in December 1993. If the country listened to Boross, its days would be limited. [Pogonyi] To remain with the prime minister's words, he said that the elections would be decided between the MDF and the MSZP, and that the liberal parties would be a "natural wastage." In your view, what will be at stake at the elections? [Thurmer] It is almost a fact that the Boross government will fail at the elections. The real stake is whether the consolidation of the capitalist system that was imported from the West in 1990 will continue or Hungary will choose a way of development in which the millions of workers also find their place. [Pogpnyi] In your view, what kind of system do we now have in Hungary? [Thurmer] This system mostly reminds me of the democracy of Athens. [Pogonyi] In what way? [Thurmer] Five percent had a perfect and pleasant life while 95 percent of the population were slaves. We would like the majority to feel good. [Pogonyi] I think that you are not the only one who says this. The question is which party the electors will believe. [Thurmer] I feel that the Socialist Party has a better chance to implement this policy and to achieve prosperity for the majority. In my view, the liberal parties do not have enough strength or consistency to deviate from the model of capitalist consolidation. The liberals might not drop out but I am convinced that they will not be the ones who determine the country's future. All depends on how much courage the MSZP's leadership has. [Pogonyi] Courage for what? [Thurmer] Today, one needs courage to govern the country and to deviate from the current road. If the MSZP tries to find allies from the right then it will sooner or later find itself in conflict with ordinary people, many of whom will have voted for them, and the party might even get into conflict with its own members. [Pogonyi] And if the MSZP seeks allies from the left? [Thurmer] The Workers Party is the main candidate here. In this case, the MSZP would have a bigger chance to successfully solve society's problems. [Pogonyi] Will the Workers Party have the necessary 5 percent to get into parliament? You recently predicted 7 to 8 percent for yourselves. [Thurmer] According to the data of the National Electoral Committee, some 1,800 individual parliamentary candidates have been registered in the country. Taking an average of 1,000 nomination slips per candidate, this means some 1.8 million slips. The Workers' Party candidates collected much more, a multiple of a thousand nomination slips on average. [Pogonyi] You now have 156 individual candidates, in 20 regional lists. [Thurmer] This means that the Workers' Party collected some 7 to 9 percent of the nomination slips. We are happy that very many young people gave us their nomination slips, and very many people said that although they were afraid to do this, however, they would certainly vote for us at the elections. If no violent acts take place in the country and there is no rough and obvious cheating at the elections then the Workers Party will be in parliament. [Pogonyi] Personally, to what do you attribute the Workers Party's relative advancement? Is nostalgia for the former regime so widespread? [Thurmer] People are now judging on the basis of their own experiences. Boross is saying it in vain that the economic situation is better now than in 1989-1990. It is impossible to explain it to 1 million unemployed people that, as a matter of fact, they are living in prosperity. People with large families, or others, especially the school leavers who are without jobs, or the deceived teachers cannot be persuaded to believe this. Everyone knows that the Workers Party is not responsible for the past four years. If any consistent opposition party existed in the past four years then that was us. We did not make compromises or pacts, we do not have headquarters affairs, and our deputies are not members of boards of directors in banks. People can see this and they trust in us. Within the party, we have seen an important change of generations. I have had a look through the national lists of parties. Well, none of them have a 23 years old laborer from Csepel or 30 years old nuclear engineer from Paks. Apart from the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] the parties are full of elderly gentlemen -- although their number is increasing in the Fidesz, too. [Pogonyi] What is the opinion of the Workers Party on the media's current situation? You have not yet said much about this. [Thurmer] We are in favor of the freedom of the press. We have sympathy for the 129 dismissed radio journalists, and we made this view public, but even the affected people did not write about this. They have our sympathy, even though some of the dismissed people have not had much sympathy for us in the past four years. Today, a real freedom of the press does not exist, therefore, it will be very difficult to neutralize four years of brainwashing with tulips [symbol of the MDF] in the remaining four weeks.
