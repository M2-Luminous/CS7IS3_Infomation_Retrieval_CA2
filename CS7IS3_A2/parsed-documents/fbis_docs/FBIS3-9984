The group says it has created "shooting blacks week." The group threatens to attack with bombs sites regularly visited by blacks. In publications known as "skinzines," the group reports it is settling in Florianopolis to "defend racial purity and preserve social order." It proposes "expelling blacks from Brazil." Councilman Marcio de Souza (Workers Party) sent the committee a publication in which the neo-Nazis promise to blow up the building where his office is located. The messages are signed by pen names such as "Black Killer" [preceding two words in English]. It is stated in them that people involved in the bomb explosion at the World Trade Center building in New York have been contacted by the group and asked to come to Santa Catarina to conduct similar attacks. The Attorney General's Office will ask Federal Police to begin investigating the charges.
