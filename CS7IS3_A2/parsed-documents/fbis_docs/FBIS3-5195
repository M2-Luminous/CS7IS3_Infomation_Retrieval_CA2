In the first part of his address, Comrade Do Muoi emphasized the following three points: 1. We must thoroughly understand the resolution of the recent midterm national party conference. We use the working class stance as a base to examine the situation. By doing so, we will be able to see more clearly that the entire revolutionary line of our party faithfully reflects the Marxist-Leninist doctrine and Ho Chi Minh Thought, the law of evolution of history, and the desire of the laboring people and all the oppressed people. That is why we must resolve to struggle against all distorting allegations and must properly apply and develop the Marxist-Leninist doctrine and Ho Chi Minh Thought under the new situation in Vietnam. 2. Our party is the party of the working class. It faithfully represents the interest of the working class, the laboring people, and the nation as a whole. 3. Far from being abstract notions, the ideas of liberating the nation, liberating the classes, and making the people masters of their own country have been translated into life by our party in a very copious and vivid fashion. This has brought about realistic benefits for the people such as making peasants the owners of the pieces of land which they till, workers the owners of the factories in which they work, and the laboring people the owners of their means of production. We have encouraged the people to enrich themselves legally along with efforts to eradicate hunger and reduce poverty, carry out the motto of building a powerful country and a prosperous people, and ensure the all-people great unity bloc. The resolution of the mid-term national party conference and other resolutions of the Seventh Party Central Committee's plenums have been institutionalized into laws and substantive policies. These are essential issues which the comrade general secretary asked the military delegates to firmly grasp when they study to fully understand the resolution of the midterm national party conference. Comrade Do Muoi went on by pointing out successes scored by our country over the past a little more than two years in implementing the renovation policy set forth by the Seventh Party Congress. He also emphasized two essential points needed for socioeconomic development in our country: 1. We must effect a change in the economic structure, redistribute our work force, and socialize our production process intensively and extensively in order to mobilize to the fullest all social resources for development. This is to create a groundwork for steady development with high results for the entire national economy. 2. Industrialization must be linked with modernization by fundamentally carrying out gradual technological renovation, by seizing opportunities to shorten our development process, and by shaping spearhead movements to acquire the high standards of science and technology in the world. At this conference, the comrade general secretary cited the many great achievements scored by the armed forces. He said that they have firmly defended the fatherland while effectively engaging in economic construction. Together with the entire party and people, they have helped foil all the peaceful evolution strategy-related schemes of hostile forces. Touching on the duty of the armed forces toward the cause of building and defending the fatherland in the period ahead, Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi said: Various party organizations and command echelons must concentrate on making the armed forces strong politically, ideologically, and organizationally. These things can be used as a foundation to increase integrated qualities and militancy. We must firmly grasp the enemies' schemes, together with the people in various localities, to maintain the initiative in defense under all circumstances. We must continue to step up building an all-people national defense and must effect a profound change in the thinking of each party cadre and member and of the people regarding the enemies' schemes in order to defend the fatherland and safeguard our party, state, and regime. We must ensure technical equipment for the armed forces and must increase party leadership and state management over the cause of national defense and security. In the period ahead, we must carry out the system of leadership by the party and operational management by the state in a more close-knit and proper fashion. Various party committees and the party-youth union cadre affairs sections of various state organs must clearly realize their functions and duty to provide leadership and guidance in the field of national defense and security. Various government ministries and sectors must clearly reaffirm and satisfactorily carry out their state management functions in terms of national defense and security. The Ministries of National Defense and Interior must clearly reafirm their state management functions. They must act as an advisory body for the party and the state while directly exercising their state management functions in accordance with their assigned duty and powers.
