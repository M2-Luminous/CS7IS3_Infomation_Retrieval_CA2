Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Work Injury Report (WIR) Injuries in the Logging Industry, Bulletin 2203, June 1984. 4. OSHA First Reports of Serious Injury (FRSI). OSHA also utilizes a telephone reporting system for the field staff to inform the national office of the occurrence of serious or significant accidents. This telephone call system is part of the OSHA emergency communications system. Regional Administrators are required to file first reports of fatalities, catastrophes and other important events (such as those that receive significant publicity) to the National Office. The information is recorded on a form entitled First Report of Serious Accident (FRSI). Approximately 1,200 reports are received by the National Office yearly. None of the reports are screened prior to OSHA receiving them to eliminate those from a certain industry, occupation or because of other factors. None of these reports may be considered statistically significant by themselves in attempting to determine the number of accidents that have occurred. However, they do give an indication of where many serious accidents have occurred and the types of work being performed at the time of the accidents. OSHA has examined the FRSI reports and identified 105 (Ex. 4&hyph;65) that occurred while employees were performing logging operations. These accidents occurred between October 1985 and December 1989. Table 17 lists the logging accident reports as a percentage of all accident reports received.
