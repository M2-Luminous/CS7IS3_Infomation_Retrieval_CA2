A Belgian, a Pakistani, an Afghan, and an Iranian citizen are under arrest. Information has been laid against a Serb. On Sunday, through the mediation of the other two men, the Belgian and the Pakistani tried to sell 1,040 grams of heroin. However, the customer was an undercover agent of the Interior Ministry, the Lower Austrian Security Directorate stated. According to the investigations, Zahid Mushtag M. (33), who is resident in Gent, had taken the 1,040 grams of heroin in a rented car from Belgium via Germany to Austria last week on Saturday. On the next day, the man wanted to sell the drug for 650,000 schillings together with Pakistani Hussain Tahir M. (38), who is, among others, registered in Vienna-Favoriten. Afghan citizen Ahmad Zia R. (29), who is resident in Vienna-Leopoldstadt, and Iranian Mehrdad S. (24), who is registered in Traunkirchen in the Gmunden District, mediated the deal. The customer turned out to be an undercover agent. According to the officers, Serb Bozidarka T. (40), who is resident in Vienna-Favoriten, is presumably an accomplice. When the apartment of the Serb was searched, 42,000 schillings were seized. The money probably comes from Hussain M.'s drug deals, the investigators stated.
