Although this is economic aid, this shift is dictated by politics, the rudiments of a different U.S. strategy that has not as yet been formulated clearly enough. The "new approach" to Russia that has been developing since last December concerns both the situation within Russia and its behavior in the "post-Soviet area." The aspirations nurtured by some of the U.S. establishment to act as trailblazers en route to the market economy of the future have virtually vanished into thin air, and U.S. aid -- if you compare it to the extent of the crisis in Russia and the tasks that lie ahead -- is paltry. But Washington remains Moscow's main strategic interlocutor outside the CIS, and the "new approach" needs scrutiny especially since, even in the early stages, it appears to be flawed due to inadequate understanding of the situation whereby trends toward integration are confused with imperialism. If this confusion is not avoided in time, the "new approach" will have to be adjusted like the old one. So, within Russia the Clinton administration has distanced itself from Gaydar's radical-democrat school, ceased to associate the future of economic reform and Russian democracy with him and him alone, and to all intents and purposes acknowledged Premier Chernomyrdin as a reformer and leading contender for the post of president. While maintaining all the necessary relations with the Russian head of state, it is stealthily performing the delicate task of ensuring continuity of the new-type U.S.-Russian relations in the post-Yeltsin era. There is every indication that people in Washington are growing accustomed to the idea that this time is not far off. Another aspect of the "new approach" concerns the U.S. attitude to the nearby foreign countries. Here too, relatively speaking, they have stopped putting all their eggs in the Yeltsin basket. The "counterbalance" of U.S. economic aid is the response to the stepping up and tightening of Russia's policy in neighboring countries -- the former Soviet republics. This is eliciting more and more questions and growing misgivings in the United States. That which all politicians in Moscow across the board, including the foreign minister, call Russia's legitimate "special interests," is generally qualified by people in Washington as recurrences of "imperial ambitions." People there would like to warn Russia by paying additional signs of attention to those post-Soviet states which are the targets of "imperial ambitions." This too is an extremely tricky diplomatic task -- these signs must be noticeable otherwise they become pointless, but not provocatively noticeable so as not to further rouse Moscow "imperialists." Mindful of this, official Washington received the leaders of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Georgia in February and March. Likewise, Clinton gave Shevardnadze the go-ahead for the idea of deploying UN peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia...on condition that an agreement is concluded between the Georgians and the Abkhazians and that U.S. servicemen are categorically excluded from these forces. William Perry, the new U.S. secretary of defense, carried out a tour under the slogan of a new "pragmatic partnership," starting in Moscow and then visiting Alma-Ata [Almaty], Kiev, and Minsk, announcing an increase in U.S. aid, primarily for nuclear disarmament. Despite the cautious nature of the "new approach," one initially glimpses a failure to understand certain fundamental and seemingly obvious things. That is to some extent excusable since it was inspired by the Russian side. People are talking, for instance, about the end of the "honeymoon" between Russia and the United States. But was there one at all? If you think about it, there was not a "marriage" with the United States but a "divorce" between Russia and the USSR, the Russian leadership and the Union leadership, and the "divorce" went hand in hand with a "romance" with the United States since Yeltsin and the democrats used the West's political backing against Gorbachev and against preserving the "imperial" union. The "honeymoon" lasted as long as the amnesia over our own national interests. It is not the "honeymoon" that is now over, but the amnesia. In fact, it is impossible to divorce ourselves from the fundamental geopolitical realities of Russian existence in Eurasia and in this regard Russia is bound to inherit some of the interests of the Soviet superpower and the Russian empire especially since the main material justification for Russia's great power status -- nuclear weapons -- was also the legacy of the Soviet Union. Tens of millions of people have been plunged into a new historical era and they are behaving not quite or not at all as the politicians who did the plunging would like. The people formulating the "new approach," leaving aside this basic fact, should look at the democracy of the ballot box, which now seems different from that of the speeches made by politicians elected previously. The latest example being the Ukrainian elections, where inhabitants of eastern oblasts and the Crimea voted by an overwhelming majority in favor of union with Russia. So are they voicing solidarity with Moscow's "imperial ambitions"? Who else but Washington should realize that general democratic elections are the main act and irrevocable verdict of democracy (until the next elections take place). Unlike presidents, ordinary people speak rarely but, when they do, what they say is to the point and weighty, based not on speculative concepts but on their own future. However, the CIA guessed this result, predicting in a recent secret report the possibility of Ukraine breaking into two states over the dispute between the western part geared to the West and the eastern oblasts with their leaning toward Russia. And it did not ascribe this to Moscow's machinations. Needless to say, it would be the height of folly for Moscow to promote the worsening of the intra-Ukrainian confrontation but surely Kiev's politicians are primarily responsible for finding a peaceful and constructive solution to the situation through Ukrainian federalism, say, and closer links with Russia? In a recent programmatic article in the FOREIGN AFFAIRS journal, Zbigniew Brzezinski declared that a U.S.-Russian partnership would be premature and suggested an alternative policy of "geopolitical pluralism," which means curbing Russia's imperial instincts by developing relations with the "new independent states." Brzezinski came up with a "simple but indisputable axiom: Russia can either be an empire or a democracy but it cannot be both." That is an example of the rigid rule that is easily construed by an outsider. The well-known conceptualist even sees Russia's confederative relations with Ukraine as a roundabout victory for Russian "imperialism." But the sentiments voiced during the elections in eastern Ukraine and the Crimea illustrate that democracy Brzezinski-style is a procrustean bed for millions of people even if they opted to lie on it by voting in favor of Ukrainian independence in the 1991 referendum by a majority. Former President Richard Nixon is more of a pragmatist than a conceptualist and is not that keen on rules. During his recent 10th visit to Moscow he found the claims that Russia is once again becoming an "imperialist power" "exaggerated." In Nixon's opinion most Russians and their leaders are opposed to "fresh adventures" and are unwilling to even "take economic responsibility for the other new independent states." At the same time he warned that any attempts by Moscow to "destabilize" Ukraine will have "destructive consequences for Russian-U.S. relations" since "Ukrainian stability is in the U.S. strategic interests." Indisputably such attempts would also be ruinous for Russian stability, placing an intolerable burden on its already extremely frail shoulders. But here too it is no good failing to take life's complexities into consideration. Are the Ukrainian elections part of Moscow's attempts to destabilize Ukraine? Will the Kiev leadership's disregard for the results of these elections, which revealed mass resistance to severing the close economic, cultural, and human ties with Russia, be in the interests of Ukrainian stability? This notwithstanding, can U.S. "strategic interest" in Ukraine be ensured? I think that Nazarbayev, if not Kravchuk, has already answered these questions -- as regards Kazakhstan. He used his stay in Moscow to proclaim his vision of the future from the Moscow State University rostrum -- a Eurasian union throughout the post-Soviet area apart from the Baltic countries (or at least covering Russia and Kazakhstan) with a common parliament, single citizenship, joint armed forces, and close economic coordination. In the different Soviet conditions the idea of a Eurasian union was advocated by Andrey Sakharov, if you recall, as an idea for the democratic transformation of the totalitarian superstate. It is now being revived amid the chaos, ashes, and disorder of devastation. As a politician who is better aware of our common realities than the Americans, Nazarbayev does not absolutize the concept of independence. Reasonable interdependence can be a guarantee of reasonable, democratically sufficient independence and stability. Nazarbayev the dialectician opposes dual citizenship but is in favor of single, common citizenship. He is in favor of U.S. cooperation in the running of Baykonur in order to haggle over leasing the cosmodrome...with Russia. But by the strictest criteria the Kazakhstani president needs good relations with the power on the other continent in order to regulate and strengthen good relations with his immediate great neighbor with the common destiny and to force this neighbor to get a move on. And this is no paradox but the call of geopolitics. On the other hand, if stability, above all nuclear stability (what else?) is primarily the U.S. strategic priority in the post-Soviet area the "new approach" should have its supertask. The avowed counterbalance of aid for Russia's neighbors ("over one-half") is politically justified if it helps find a reasonable measure and link between independence and interdependence and places confederative (or federative!) relations between the former republics, with Russia, and with the center (not the imperial center!) in the form of Russia on a new voluntary footing. Only then can lasting partnership relations between Russia and the United States have a future.
