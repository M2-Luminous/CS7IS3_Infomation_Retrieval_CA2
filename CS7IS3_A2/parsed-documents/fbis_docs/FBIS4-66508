The citizens' group that was formed at the meeting last Thursday was a committee to prepare for the day-long regional rally scheduled for 22 March at T.R.O. Square. Various work groups have been set up to this end, to make contact with well-known personalities, associations, and union leaders and raise funds to support the event. At a preliminary meeting marked by lively discussion, the platform adopted could be summed up as defending the republic against the threat of a fundamentalist "parallel state" and pressuring state institutions to meet their responsibility to defend the citizenry. "Before we are forced to the dreadful point of taking up arms," one participant emphasized. Their actions will be aimed at building bridges between the elites, prominent defenders of republicanism, and the mass of ordinary citizens. There were many proposals to issue calls for international action. In that context, the role of the press and intellectuals was underscored. Some participants undertook to make contacts with a view to reestablishing the committee of intellectuals. To stop the killings, which have become increasingly commonplace, to combat attitudes of denial, and to alleviate citizen fears, the committee decided at this meeting to make contact with numerous leaders of voluntary associations--UNEP [National Union of Public Entrepreneurs], UGTA [General Union of Algerian Workers], etc.--with a view to collective action and mobilizing maximum support from the republican sector. Attention was drawn to the fact that many ordinary citizens are demanding reprisals for the actions of the fundamentalists. In that regard, several people in attendance proposed a national strike, to give republican forces the chance to make their voices heard and demand action from the state. On another front, speakers proposed 26 March, when schools reopen around the country, as a day for protest against mandatory wearing of the hijab, and denunciation of certain headmasters and school administrators who acting out of fear have forced students to wear the hijab. A working group was created to follow through on the necessary actions. Underlined was the need for teachers in cooperation with parents of students to take charge of their own lives. Finally, the citizens' committee will urge people to start preparing for the 22 March regional demonstration in Oran. The idea of a news release is also being developed. The birth of this committee is one contribution from the ranks of the republicans. There will doubtless be others in the coming days.
