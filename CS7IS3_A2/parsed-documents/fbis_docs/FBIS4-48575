[passage omitted] In theory, a cease-fire -- or rather a truce -- should have started in Kigali half an hour ago, at 0800 local time, at the initiative of the United Nations. [passage omitted] Here is one of the main officials of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, whom Dominique de Courcelles has just contacted in Geneva. He is Jacques Bihozagara, member of the political bureau of the organization: [Bihozagara] I think we have to make a distinction between a truce and a cease-fire. We have never refused a truce for a specific action, for example consultations between the United Nations and the forces on the ground. As for a cease-fire, we are saying that first you have to get a cease-fire between those who are butchering the people and the people themselves, but there is no question of speaking of a cease- fire between the fighters of the Patriotic Front and this routed army. [De Courcelles] So after the truce we should expect the fighting to begin again? [Bihozagara] Of course. [De Courcelles] So this truce is to get an explanation of the UN mandate, because a priori you rather tend to be against a reinforcement of the UN troops? [Bihozagara] You know, we are not formally against it, but we weren't there when the UN Security Council resolution was adopted in New York, so we are expecting further clarifications from the United Nations about its make-up, its deployment, and its numbers.
