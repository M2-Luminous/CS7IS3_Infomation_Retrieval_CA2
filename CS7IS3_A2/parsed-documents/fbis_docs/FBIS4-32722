The agreement would guarantee the unchangeability of the present borders and the status of ethnic minorities in the two countries. Moravcik said the Stability Pact proposed by French Premier Edouard Balladur created very good conditions for the confirmation of the existing borders. "Territorial autonomy for the Hungarian minority in Slovakia is ruled out, and this has also been accepted by the Hungarian party during the talks," Moravcik said. He was reacting to a statement by ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar that the next Hungarian Premier Gyula Horn had made territorial autonomy for the Hungarian community in Slovakia a condition for the conclusion of the inter-state treaty. About 560,000 Hungarians live in Slovakia, constituting about 11 percent of its population. Some of their leaders, assisted by certain forces in Hungary, have demanded territorial autonomy for southern Slovakia heavily inhabited by ethnic Hungarians.
