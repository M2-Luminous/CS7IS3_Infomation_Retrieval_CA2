"Those powers in international politics which have decisive influence on the formation of international order believe that order on the territory of the former Yugoslavia can presently be established in contact with Serbia and Croatia as well as the other countries which came into being there," added Tudjman. Tudjman pointed out that "Europe and the world have finally realized that the Muslims are not just a `victim'" but that they have turned against the Croats, and now "they carry out aggressive raids and threaten the very physical survival of the Croats." When he was asked to evaluate the criticism emerging from the conservative ranks of the Croatian opposition regarding his dialogues with Slobodan Milosevic, the Croatian president said that even all of European and the world authorities have spoken with him and that "he is the only politician with authority in today's Serbia and the only one with whom to talk." On the subject of Krajina, the Croatian president stressed that he is definitely determined to find a peaceful solution, that Knin and Glina counties should be given territorial autonomy and guarantees of civil and ethnic rights along with the right to be "completely included in the total economic and legal systems of Croatia." However, Tudjman noted that if this should prove to be unacceptable, Croatia would find "other means" to resolve the issue. He was asked whether he would offer anything else to the Serbs, i.e., "whether he would again include them in the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia." In response, the Croatian president expressed his opinion that the Croatian Constitution is "on the level of the most progressive constitutions in the world," since it states that Croatia is a nationalistic state, but also the state of its citizens. The Serbs are entitled to both cultural and territorial autonomy in the regions where they are in majority, but, as Tudjman sees it, "there is no need for any constitutional changes."
