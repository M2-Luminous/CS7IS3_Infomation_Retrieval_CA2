(SNARK) -- Most resultive in settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict may become the initiatives stemming from Russia and Iran, told SNARK today Larissa Allaverdyan, the head expert of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) Commission in Armenian parliament. In her opinion, these two states are not only participants of peacemaking processes, but also bear responsibility in the international-law aspect, in front of the world community, for resolution of Karabakh problem. Russia and Iran, told the expert, are historically the last title-holders of Karabakh. Joint initiatives, should they stem form Russia and Iran, would have been in the interests of all world states, and not only of Transcaucasus population, said Larissa Allaverdyan.
