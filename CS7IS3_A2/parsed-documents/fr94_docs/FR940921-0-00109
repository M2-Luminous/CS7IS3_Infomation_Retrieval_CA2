FR940921-0-00109 FR940921-0-00016 67. A new section 86.401&hyph;97 is added to subpart E, to read as follows: §86.401&hyph;97 General applicability. (a) This subpart applies to 1978 and later model year, new, gasoline-fueled motorcycles built after 31 December, 1977, and to 1990 and later model year, new, methanol-fueled motorcycles built after 31 December, 1989 and to 1997 and later model year, new, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled motorcycles built after 31 December, 1996. (b) Motorcycles with engine displacements less than 50 cc (3.1 cu in) are excluded from the requirements of this subpart. (c) Motorcycles are excluded from the requirements of this subpart, if with an 80 kg (176 lb) driver, it cannot: (1) Start from a dead stop using only the engine; or (2) Exceed a maximum speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) on level paved surfaces. 68. Section 86.410&hyph;90 of subpart E is amended by revising paragraph (a)(1) introductory text, to read as follows: §86.410&hyph;90 Emission standards for 1990 and later model year motorcycles. (a)(1) Exhaust emissions from 1990 and later model year gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled motorcycles shall not exceed (compliance with these standards is optional prior to the 1997 model year for natural gas- fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled motorcycles): * * * * * 69. Section 86.509&hyph;90 of subpart F is amended by revising paragraph (c)(4), to read as follows: §86.509&hyph;90 Exhaust gas sampling system. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (4) The location of the dilution air inlet shall be placed so as to use test-cell air for dilution air and the flow capacity of the CVS shall be large enough to virtually eliminate water condensation in the system. Control of water condensation with methanol-fueled vehicles is critical. Additional care may also be required to eliminate water condensation when testing natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Procedures for determining CVS flow rates are detailed in ``Calculation of Emissions And Fuel Economy When Using Alternate Fuels,'' EPA 460/3&hyph;83&hyph;009. * * * * * 70. A new section 86.513&hyph;94 is added to subpart F to read as follows: §86.513&hyph;94 Fuel and engine lubricant specifications. (a) Gasoline. (1) Gasoline having the following specifications will be used by the Administrator in exhaust emission testing of gasoline-fueled motorcycles. Gasoline having the following specifications or substantially equivalent specifications approved by the Administrator, shall be used by the manufacturer for emission testing except that the octane specifications do not apply.
