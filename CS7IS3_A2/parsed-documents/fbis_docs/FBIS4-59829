The Iraqis achieved this thanks to the inspiration they derived from their long history and from their historic leader Saddam Husayn, who imparted to them a growing resolve to go on living, to progress, and to preserve their sovereignty and dignity despite the destruction, blockade, plotting, and intervention. In an article today, the paper, speaking for the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, adds: The aggressive, conspiratorial, and interventionist U.S. policy against Iraq has clearly ended in failure. The military aggression has not given the White House control over Iraq's will and decisionmaking, nor has Iraq weakened from the destruction, hunger, and chaos. The paper wonders about the U.S. interest in insisting on following George Bush's policy against Iraq. What political and economic gains are there in this policy for the United States? This policy has drawn a blank on the ground and has resulted in a great burden for the United States, considering the political and moral condemnation that has smeared the U.S. reputation. The paper adds: U.S. President Bill Clinton has the right to review facts, away from the positions of the defeated Bush. This is because Iraq is here to stay, with its will, leadership, and resolve. Iraq has finished rebuilding what was destroyed by the U.S.-Atlantic aggression and has even introduced improvements to it. The paper points out that Bill Clinton, who inherited the U.S. Administration, can cast aside the inheritance of Bush's aggression and hostility to Iraq, even though Clinton has pursued Bush's policy for some time, committed aggression against Iraq, and maintained the blockade. The paper concludes that it is the right of the U.S. President to brag about opposing the U.S. war against Vietnam. He also has the right to say that he inherited the U.S. intervention in Somalia. He was the one who decided to withdraw U.S. troops from Somalia. Somali sacrifices and resolve also contributed to the withdrawal decision.
