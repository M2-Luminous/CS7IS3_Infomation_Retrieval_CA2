FR940802-0-00046 FR940802-0-00008 Under the final reformulated gasoline regulation, downstream blenders are prohibited from violating the assumptions/instructions for RBOB used by refiners. Blenders, although not responsible for compliance with the renewable oxygenate mandate, are still responsible for adding appropriate oxygenate of the type specified in the RBOB transfer documentation under the final renewable oxygenate regulations. Under §80.83(c)(2)(i)&hyph;(ii), no person may combine any oxygenate with ``any renewable oxygenate'' RBOB, ``non-VOC controlled renewable ether only'' RBOB, ``renewable ether only'' RBOB unless the oxygenate meets the ``renewable oxygenate'' definition. The ``renewable oxygenate'' definition is discussed in greater detail in section III of this preamble. Sections 80.83 (d) and (e) specify compliance calculations and conditions for the creation and transfer of credits. These criteria for creation of credits are the same as those specified in §§80.67(h)(1)(i) through (iv) and §§80.67(h) (2) and (3) of the reformulated gasoline regulations. The renewable oxygenate rule includes recordkeeping requirements, specified in §80.83(f). Refiners are required to maintain records demonstrating the renewable nature, volume, type, and purity of the oxygenate used and product transfer documentation for all renewable oxygenate, reformulated gasoline, or RBOB for which the refiner is the transferor or transferee. These same recordkeeping requirements also apply to oxygenate blenders who blend oxygenate with RBOB designated as ``any renewable oxygenate,'' ``non-VOC controlled renewable ether only'' or ``renewable ether only.'' The records required by §80.83(f) must be retained for a period of five years and must be delivered to the Administrator or the Administrator's designated representative upon request. In today's final rule, EPA is requiring that refiners maintain records showing the renewable nature of all oxygenates. Under the proposed rule, records demonstrating the renewable nature of renewable ethanol were not required. However, today's final rule seeks to ensure that all oxygenates claimed as renewable do, in fact, come from renewable sources. Section 80.83(g) deals with reporting requirements. All refiners are required to submit reports related to compliance with the renewable oxygenate standard for reformulated gasoline, compliance calculations for the renewable oxygenate standard, and the transfer of renewable oxygen credits. These renewable oxygenate reports go beyond the reporting requirements included in the reformulated gasoline final rule issued in December 1993. Refiners are required to report, on a per-batch basis, the total weight percent oxygen and weight percent oxygen attributable to renewable oxygenates contained in the gasoline they produce. For all types of renewable RBOB, the refiner must report the weight percent oxygen subsequent to oxygenate blending, subject to the conditions set forth in §80.83(c). These requirements supplement the quarterly reports requirements found in existing §80.75(a) of the reformulated gasoline regulations. Refiners are also required to submit, on an annual basis, a report for all reformulated gasoline and RBOB produced during the previous calendar year averaging period. These requirements supplement the fourth quarterly report requirements found in existing §80.75(a). The fourth quarterly report must include (among other specified items) information regarding the total volume of reformulated gasoline and RBOB, the compliance total for renewable oxygen, the actual total for renewable oxygen, information about credits generated and transferred, and information about the party to whom (or from whom) credits were transferred. EPA intends that the attest engagement requirements for reformulated gasoline will apply to the renewable oxygenate standard. Sections 80.128 and 80.129 contain agreed upon procedures for refiners and importers and downstream blenders, respectively. These new provisions supplement the reformulated gasoline attest engagement requirements found in subpart F of that regulation. Furthermore, other provisions contained in the reformulated gasoline regulations, and not specifically discussed in this preamble, would apply to the renewable oxygenate standard in the same manner as they apply to other reformulated gasoline standards. These include, among other things, the definitions of parties; the designation requirements; testing requirements, including sampling and testing; and controls, prohibitions, liabilities, and defenses. There are no gasoline survey requirements associated with the renewable oxygenate requirement, because there is no covered area-specific standard associated with this program. 2. Requirements Specific to the State of California Today's renewable oxygenate rule also applies to all gasoline that is sold in the Federal reformulated gasoline areas of Los Angeles and San Diego. Refiners of California gasoline, as defined in §80.81 of the reformulated gasoline regulation, are responsible for all renewable oxygenate provisions (including recordkeeping and reporting), except where a specific enforcement exemption has been granted under §80.81 of the reformulated gasoline regulation. Today's regulation specifically provides that California gasoline must meet, to the extent the requirements relate to the renewable oxygenate rule, the designation of gasoline requirements for the two types of renewable RBOB; the annual attest engagement requirements; and downstream blending requirements of §80.69. Section 80.84(h) of the renewable oxygenate regulation includes specific provisions for California gasoline sold within reformulated gasoline covered areas as specified in §80.70. Under §80.83(h)(2), California gasoline is presumed to be used in the Los Angeles or San Diego covered area if the gasoline is produced by a refinery located within Los Angeles or San Diego. Gasoline is also presumed to be used in the Los Angeles or San Diego covered area if the gasoline is transported to a facility within one of these areas or to a facility from which gasoline is transported within one of these areas. Refiners may refute these presumptions through the production of appropriate documentation showing that the gasoline, in fact, is transported for use outside of the Los Angeles or San Diego reformulated gasoline areas. These areas are specified in §80.70. Under §80.83(h)(3), California gasoline is considered to be designated as VOC-controlled if the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of the gasoline, or RBOB subsequent to oxygenate blending, is or is intended to meet a standard of 7.8 pounds per square inch (psi) or less in the case of gasoline intended for use before March 1, 1996, or 7.0 psi or less in the case of gasoline intended for use on or after March 1, 1996. 21 21 Beginning March 1, 1996, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) will enforce regulations which set the maximum RVP for the air basin containing the Federal reformulated gasoline areas of Los Angeles and San Diego at 7.0 pounds per square inch (psi). These requirements apply during the period of April 1 through October 31 (March 1 for upstream parties).
