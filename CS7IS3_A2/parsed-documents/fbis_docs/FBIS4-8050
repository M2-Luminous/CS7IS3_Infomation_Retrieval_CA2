A report by our reporter Sherif Konjufca: [Konjufca] Kosova, an independent and neutral state, simultaneously open to Albania and Serbia, is the most lucky solution for both Albanians and Serbs. However, to avoid armed conflicts in this area, the president of the Republic of Kosova said at a meeting with reporters, we once again reiterate our demands that Kosova be placed under international protection. Asked whether there exists a conflict between the prime minister, the LDK, and the president, Mr. Rugova answered that such a conflict does not exist. The government has worked in very difficult conditions, partly abroad and partly in the country, but it has acted in cooperation with us. Under the present situation, it is very normal and reasonable to complete the government with the most creative people. For this, there exists a disposition by the majority of the Albanian political parties in Kosova, whose willpower will be outlined in their coordinating council, but cannot assume the government prerogatives. Mr. Rugova said that as chairman of the republic, I have prerogatives as well as an obligation to think about the completion of the government and other bodies that will assist it. The best work in this situation is that regarding national political capital questions, we have reached a consensus with all political parties, and this makes us stronger. Asked about the importance of the international conference on the Balkans, which is being held in Istanbul, President Rugova said that this is the first time such a meeting is being held, in which the Balkan problems are being examined in a complex way and in a historic, actual, and future aspect. The delegation of Kosova led by Mr. Bukoshi is attending this conference, among experts from 26 countries. Meanwhile, we are expecting much from the conference's final statement. Talking about the forms of the Serb violence against Albanians, Mr. Rugova particularly pointed out the eviction of Albanians from their homes and other forms of the colonization of Kosova with Serbs and Montenegrins. He mentioned cases of the division of 150 hectares of social land in Kline for Serbian refugees from Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina and the decision to erect 220 houses for them in the Istog commune. For the Serb refugees from Albania, whom the Serbian installed power is placing in Junik village and in several Gjakove villages, President Rugova said that we will ask the UN High Commission for Refugees to treat them only as temporary refugees, and not as elements for the colonization of Kosova. Otherwise, Mr. Rugova said, we will consider the Commission to be responsible for violently changing the ethnic structure of Kosova.
