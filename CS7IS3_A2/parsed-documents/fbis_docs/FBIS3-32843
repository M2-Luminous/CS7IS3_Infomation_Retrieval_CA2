Peace Commission President Hector Rosada Granados confirmed that Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez Morales informed him of his decision to seek new mechanisms to participate in the peace process. In that sense, he said that he plans to carry out a number of military changes within the government Peace Commission. He added that a consensus is being sought to determine who will replace Generals Marco Antonio Gonzalez Taracena, Victor Manuel Ventura Arellano, and Victor Manuel Argueta Villalta. Rosada Granados said he is getting ready for discussions on human rights with the URNG and is preparing with information from human rights representatives at the Archbishop's Office, the Presidential Commission, and Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garcia, with whom he will arrange a meeting. Former Guerrilla Commander Offers To Cooperate in Process It was also reported that former guerrilla commander Cesar Montes or Macias on various occasions has expressed his willingness to cooperate with the peace process, particularly with the demobilization of rebel troops. Rosada Granados said that although he has talked with the former rebel commander on several occasions, he has never expressed his desire to seek amnesty or safe-conduct that would enable him to join society. In any event, he added, if he wanted to return to legal life, Montes or Macias would be protected by the amnesty program implemented in 1986 and 1988.
