Speaking at Moscow State University this afternoon, Qian said that 16 years ago China shifted the focus of work of state onto economic development, beginning a new period of building socialism with Chinese characteristics through reforms and opening to the outside world. The reform in China, first changed the previous single public ownership system but practiced multi-ownership one with the public ownership as the main part, he said. Then, the reform broke the planned economy system, giving full play to market mechanisms in economic development. Thirdly, it formed a situation of opening China to the outside world in various spheres, the Chinese vice premier noted. Pursuing the process of reform and opening up, China has at the same time fought crimes, strengthened democracy and the legal system and strengthened clean government, he added. He stressed that the all-round reform steps have resulted in historically significant changes in the country. China needs both internal stability and a long-term stable and peaceful external environment for its socialist modernization drive, and is willing to continue to exchange experience in reforms with Russia, he said.
