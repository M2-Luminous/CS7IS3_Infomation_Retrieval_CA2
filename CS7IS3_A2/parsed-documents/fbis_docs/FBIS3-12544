He added that the Security Council's postponement of the issue for reasons related to the stand of this or that state cannot be understood. Commenting on the council's failure so far to adopt a resolution on the massacre, Musa said: The important thing is that this massacre was a criminal one and it cannot be passed over or forgotten. Musa went on to say that the issue has changed from merely a human catastrophe to a political situation that represents a regression in the Security Council's status and role. He added that the Egyptian delegation in New York has been instructed to support the issuance of a resolution, not a statement, and to work to have the Security Council discuss this issue in light of the UN secretary general's report, which spoke about the presence of UN observers. Musa stressed that the status of the Israeli settlements has become very serious and that the settlements and settlers must be put under control because their presence has become extremist and criminal, as was shown in the Hebron Mosque carnage. He said that it is high time that the status of the settlements was reviewed because they not only have political and legal, but also security effects, as they contain a large number of extremists, gunmen, and crazy people. On the Israeli Cabinet's resolutions yesterday on the settlements and settlers, Musa said that it is important that the resolutions not be cosmetic. If the resolutions are cosmetic, they are rejected because the roots of the problem lie in the existence of the settlements and settlers, their encouragement, and the failure to protect the Palestinians. He stressed the need for a solution that will protect the Palestinians.
