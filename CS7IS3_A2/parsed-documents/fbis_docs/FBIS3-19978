FBIS3-19978 "drweu058__a94024" FBIS-WEU-94-058-A Document Type:Daily Report 25 March 1994 ANNEX Germany Social Services Cost Over 1 Trillion Marks AU2203163394 Hamburg DPA in German 1311 GMT 22 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2203163394 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The overall expenditure on all the public and private social services was more than 1 trillion German marks [DM] in 1993 -- DM1,062 billion, to be exact. The share of this expenditure in GNP (social services quota) was approximately 34 percent. This is reported by the first all-German social report, which Labor Minister Norbert Bluem (Christian Democratic Union) presented to the Cabinet on Tuesday [22 March]. The current increase in the burden of social insurance contributions is largely due to the expansion of social insurance to all of Germany that resulted from German unification, the report says. The transfer payments to eastern Germany corresponded to approximately 3 percent in contributions to west German social security. About DM118 billion from the coffers of pension and unemployment insurance went to the new laender between 1991 and 1993. In western Germany the social services quota was 30.3 percent in 1993; in the new laender, however, it was approximately 70 percent. For 1997 the report predicts a decline in the all-German quota to 32 percent. In western Germany the share of social expenditure in GNP declined from a record of 33.4 percent in 1981 to 28.9 percent in 1991. Most recently it has increased again because of improvements in the equalization of burdens for families and rising unemployment. In eastern Germany the quota reached its record so far in 1992 with 73.1 percent. The number of employed people in eastern Germany declined from about 9.9 million in 1989 to only about 6.1 million in 1993. The number of registered unemployed was only 1.15 million in 1993. About 1 million former GDR citizens have found jobs in western Germany, according to the report. The Federal Government's social report has been presented irregularly since 1970. The previous report was published in June 1990 only for the old laender. At that time social expenditure of DM703 billion or 29.4 percent of GNP was predicted for all of 1990 in western Germany.
