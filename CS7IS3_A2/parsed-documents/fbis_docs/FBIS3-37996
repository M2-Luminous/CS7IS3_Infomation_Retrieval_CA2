"February will soon be over, but wages have not been paid even for January," writes a worker from a Moscow engineering works. According to the works manager, "workshops are packed with ready-made products which are not paid for by customers. Non-payments topped one billion roubles". In this connection, the newspaper cites the opinion of professor Valeriy Vorontsov, adviser to a Russian vice-premier. The government's economic and social policy, he writes, "should be conducted in such a way as to permit able-bodied citizens earn as much as it would be enough for their high living standards". In the next few days, the government will discuss, he continued, "the guidelines of social policy for 1994" where it will be worded as a concrete programme "for the first time over the past years". The TRUD newspaper features a interview with Gavriil Popov, leader of the Russian Movement of Democratic Reforms, who spelled out his ideas on how to pull the country out of the political and economic crisis. "We have won nothing by destroying the Soviet Union," he stresses. "All republics thought that they would live well by separating from Russia. But they were labouring in the wrong. The West did not help us either. And will not help." Popov expresses hope that his movement will make a contribution to a search for a new course of reforms meeting Russia's conditions. However, "there is no alternative to reforms," he claims. The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper singles out an article on forging the poll of December 12, 1993 on the draft Russian constitution. Facts of forgery were exposed, as a result of which the number of votes "for" were increased and votes "against" cut. Rimma Korelova, a former member of a constituency electoral commission in the Far East, described these facts in an article published by the AMURSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper. She expressed protest in the newspaper and said that she quits the regional organisation "Democratic Russia". The same newspaper prints an essay on Russian geopolitics under the headline "Russia's feat", which is to be continued. The essay was penned by Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist Party. Tracing the sources for the growth of Russia's continental might which, according to the author, seemed "to be eternal and invincible", Zyuganov writes that, despite evident facts, "the 20th Century was for our country a period of destructive social cataclysms". To understand this, he believes it is necessary to turn to spiritual and conceptual processes which determined the strength of the Russian power. The PRAVDA newspaper singles out an article by Valentin Kuptsov, first deputy chairman of the Russian Communist Party, where he advocates Russia's return to the socialist way of development. "Only the socialist locomotive will pull the country out of the crisis," Kuptsov claims. The TRUD newspaper comments on a decision by the State Duma (lower house of the Russian parliament) on the political amnesty, claiming that "this is a clean victory of factions opposing the president" in the lower house. Reporting a visit by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to Prague where the Russian minister and Czech leaders focused on a Bosnian settlement, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries his interview. The newspaper writes that "a chance has emerged to return from unilateral to joint efforts of the entire world community" to settle the Bosnian crisis. The Russian president's initiative gives such a chance. The IZVESTIYA newspaper singles out a report on the arrest of Aldrich Ames, 52, "the most important foreign spy in the system of American intelligence" who worked for the KGB from 1985 and then for the Russian intelligence service. Noting that U.S. experts express indignation at "Russia's perfidy" in their comments and that the master spy betrayed many American agents to Moscow, the newspaper writes: Russia "has the same rights to secret operations in the United States as America to espionage in Russia". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA notes that the arrest of Ames in the U.S. "can trigger the biggest spy scandal over the past years". Writing about the same topic, the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper notes that "his (Ames) recruitment and long-standing operations can be regarded as a clear success of national intelligence".
