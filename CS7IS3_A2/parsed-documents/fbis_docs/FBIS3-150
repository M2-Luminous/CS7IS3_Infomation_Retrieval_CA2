The African franc zone "will not be safe from a new devaluation" over the next few years if it is the "most realistic" option for promoting long-term macro-economic growth, a study published by the CEA Tuesday said. [passage omitted] In a study on the macro-economic effects of the CFA franc's devaluation, published during the fifth meeting of African finance ministers which opened in Libreville on Tuesday, the CEA cautioned, however, that despite the "numerous studies on the subject, one cannot say with certainty if devaluation is an efficient measure or not." The study predicted three possible scenarios for the development of the 14 affected economies over the next six years. The "most realistic of the three" calculated a 50 percent increase in domestic prices in the first year, a permanent five percent increase in annual public spending, a thirty percent increase in foreign capital flows in the first year and a stabilisation at 18 percent in the following years. The devaluation would provoke a short-term increase in production with a growth in gross domestic product at 7.8 percent in the first year, thanks to a 39.7 percent boost to exports, the CEA said, confirmed by a rise in exports from Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso since January French officials at the meeting said. However, after the first year, the outlook will deteriorate, the CEA said, and in the long term there would be a "net slowing of growth," due mainly to inflation slowing down exports, increasing trade deficits and cutting funds available for investment and production. "In fact, the long term model gives production figures which are almost unchanged from those that would have been seen if no devaluation had taken place," the CEA said The effect of the devaluation on the region's trade balance was also doubtful, because of the rise in prices, the CEA said. At the end of six years, "national output will become less and less competitive and imports less and less expensive," the CEA said, ending up in "a continuing degradation in the trade balance". In total, "the direct expansionist effect of the devaluation on the whole of the economies of the franc zone will be wiped out in the long term," the study said, predicting another devaluation to follow. CEA Executive Secretary, the Algerian Layashi Yaker opened the African finance ministers' meeting warning that "poverty was developing" on the continent which was facing a "spiralling rise in unemployment". After the "lost" decade of the 1980s, Africa had not started out any better in the 1990s, he said, with an average growth in output of 1.5 percent since 1990, less than half the rate of growth of the population. Debt problems have continued to grow, Yaker said. "Why have ten years of structural adjustment not succeeded in bringing Africa out of the crisis?" Yaker asked, saying it was the "central" question for the continent. [passage omitted]
