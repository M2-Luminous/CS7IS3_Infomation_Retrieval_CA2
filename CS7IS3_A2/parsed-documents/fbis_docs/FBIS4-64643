In an attempt to respond to the criticisms and to explain his foreign policy on Tuesday [3 May] evening during a spectacular production by CNN broadcast "to 200 countries"--according to the network--the U.S. President for 90 minutes responded to the main criticisms leveled at him for months over his management of all the hot issues at the moment -- Bosnia, Haiti, Korea, and Somalia. But at the end of this lengthy expose, the American and international public had no answers to the main questions raised by U.S. foreign policy since Clinton's election: Is he really a new kind of president trying a new style of diplomacy in a radically different world? Or do the very qualities which often help him in domestic policy, such as his desire to build a consensus at all costs and his caution, render him incapable in the field of foreign policy? The very fact that Clinton decided to devote a lengthy evening to answering the questions of international journalists -- in CNN's studios and on a link-up with several tense areas throughout the world -- reflects his obsession with opinion polls, according to his critics. It is a kind of delayed reaction, and various stances adopted in recent days look more like a desire to repair a falling poll rating than a real desire to define a clear and, if possible, bold foreign policy. Only 40 percent of Americans now think that Clinton is doing "a good job" in this sphere, and the President's political advisers thought that a kind of crisis point had been reached. Americans like their presidents to be direct and decisive in foreign policy. Debate, public analysis of issues, and vacillation can be accepted as proper democratic procedures in the realm of domestic policy, but in the diplomatic sphere, the public tends to like a "leader" rather than a university professor well versed in the analysis of the pros and cons. On Tuesday evening, Clinton continued to be the university professor, while peppering his speech with remarks dictated by the opinion polls rather than by a personal vision. With regard to Haiti, he had already spoken out during the day, stating that, with regard to the military junta, it was "time they went." On CNN, he went so far as to say that the United States could not "afford to rule out the possibility of a military option" for restoring exiled President Aristide to his rightful place. The same firm message was delivered recently with regard to North Korea. Clinton said on Tuesday that "nobody wants a confrontation" with that country, which has probably built a nuclear bomb, but he added that it was a "potentially dangerous situation." Attacked by domestic critics who accuse him of having passed on the role of American "leadership" to collective and anonymous bodies such as NATO or the United Nations and of systematically trying to make decisions multilaterally which he ought to make alone, Clinton admitted that he had "underestimated the problem of building a coalition" of big international powers with regard to Bosnia. "That took longer and was more frustrating that I thought," he said. "But it is part of the reality of the post-Cold War world." Clinton stressed several times that the leaders of the world's major powers were facing situations for which there are "no easy solutions," in which they "do not know what will work." His diplomatic team, strongly criticized in the United States, "is working on new ground," he stressed, defending his aides. Aside from the firmer language on some points, this televised desire to show all that he does not intend -- or no longer intends --to leave foreign policy to his aides, Clinton reiterated the two main guidelines which he has used to define his foreign policy since he came to office: First, the fact that "America cannot solve every problems and should not become the world's policeman," but that it "will not hesitate to act alone when (its) major interests are at stake," and, second, the fact that his long-term strategy is "to encourage the success of new democracies," a policy pursued under the name of "expansion" (of the circle of market democracies -- LIBERATION editor's note) by National Security Adviser Tony Lake. Following this professorial lecture, the irritated Americans and the bemused world are still awaiting a presidential foreign policy.
