FR941110-0-00323 FR941110-0-00019 (1) Advisory services to assure full choices and real opportunities to obtain relocation within a full range of neighborhoods where suitable housing may be found, including timely information, counseling, and explanation of the resident's rights under applicable civil rights statutes and implementing regulations, as specified in §905.115, and referrals to suitable, safe, sanitary and affordable housing (at a rent no higher than permitted by the Act), which is of the resident's choice, on a nondiscriminatory basis, in accordance with applicable civil rights statutes and implementing regulations, as specified in §905.115. This requirement will be met if the applicant is offered the opportunity to relocate to another suitable unit in other low-income housing, under any of the housing assistance programs under Section 8 of the Act, or any other Federal, Tribal, State or local program that is comparable, as to standards of housing quality, admission and rent, to the programs under the Act, and provides a term of assistance of at least five years; and (2) Payment for actual, reasonable moving and related expenses. (c) Temporary relocation. A nonpurchasing resident who must relocate temporarily to permit work to be carried out shall be provided suitable, decent, safe and sanitary housing for the temporary period and reimbursed for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied housing and any increase in monthly rent and utility costs. §905.1011 Nonroutine maintenance reserve. (a) When reserve is required. A nonroutine maintenance reserve shall be established for all multifamily properties sold under a homeownership plan. For single-family dwellings, such a reserve shall not be required if the availability of the funds needed for nonroutine maintenance is adequately addressed under the affordability standard prescribed by the plan. (b) Purpose of reserve. The purpose of this reserve shall be to provide a source of reserve funds for nonroutine maintenance (including replacement), as necessary to ensure the long-term success of the plan, including protection of the interests of the homeowners and the IHA. The amounts to be set aside, and other terms of this reserve, shall be as necessary and appropriate for the particular homeownership plan, taking into account such factors as prospective needs for nonroutine maintenance, the homeowners' financial resources, and any special factors that may aggravate or mitigate the need for such a reserve. §905.1012 Purchase prices and financing. (a) Below-market terms. To ensure affordability by eligible purchasers, by the standard adopted under §906.8(e) of this chapter, a homeownership plan may provide for below-market purchase prices or below-market financing, or a combination of the two. Discounted purchase prices may be determined on a unit-by-unit basis, based on the particular purchaser's ability to pay, or may be determined by any other fair and reasonable method ( e.g. , uniform prices for a group of comparable dwellings, within a range of affordability by a group of potential purchasers). (b) Types of financing. Any type of private or public financing may be used ( e.g., conventional, Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Farmers' Home Administration (FmHA), or a Tribal, State or local program). An IHA may finance or assist in financing purchase by any methods it may choose, such as purchase-money mortgages, guarantees of mortgage loans from other lenders, shared equity, or lease-purchase arrangements. §905.1013 Protection against fraud and abuse. A homeownership plan shall include appropriate protections against any risks of fraud or abuse that are presented by the particular plan, such as collusive purchase for the benefit of nonresidents, extended use of the dwelling by the purchaser as rental property, collusive sale that would circumvent the resale profit limitation of §905.1014. §905.1014 Limitation on resale profit. (a) General. If a dwelling is sold to the initial purchaser for less than fair market value, the homeownership plan shall provide for appropriate measures to preclude realization by the initial purchaser of windfall profit on resale. ``Windfall profit'' means all or a portion of the resale proceeds attributable to the purchase price discount (the fair market value at date of purchase from the IHA less the below-market purchase price), as determined by one of the methods described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. Subject to that requirement, however, purchasers should be permitted to retain any resale profit attributable to appreciation in value after purchase (or a portion of such profit under a limited or shared equity arrangement), along with any portion of the resale profit that is fairly attributable to improvements made by them after purchase. (b) Promissory note method. Where there is potential for a windfall profit because the dwelling unit is sold to the initial purchaser for less than fair market value, without a commensurate limited or shared equity restriction, the initial purchaser shall execute a promissory note, payable to the IHA, along with a mortgage securing the obligation of the note, on the following terms and conditions: (1) The principal amount of indebtedness shall be the lesser of: (i) The purchase price discount, as determined by the definition in paragraph (a) of this section and stated in the note as a dollar amount; or
