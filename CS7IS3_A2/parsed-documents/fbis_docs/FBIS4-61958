The delegation is led by Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs. During the visit, there was discussion with French officials of the possibilities for the two countries' cooperation in the economic, defense, and security spheres, as well as Latvia's participation in the European stability pact. Today Birkavs met French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. Birkavs tells us about this from Paris, specially for Latvian Radio: [Begin Birkavs recording] Here the main achievement is that within the framework of the European stability pact, (?we have gained) certain political guarantees in connection with the agreement signed on 30 April. It is clear to us that after signing a (?free) agreement on the European Union, France and Germany together support the signing of a treaty of association with the European Union this year. When we started talking about the Council of Europe, in which Latvia must also participate, the French side believed it was a question that was not to be discussed practically, because only a citizenship law is necessary, and we immediately received the support of European countries in this connection. What is also very positive is that we have attained the role of associate partner in the Western European Union [WEU], and that gives (?the right) to take part in the military operations of the WEU, their planning, in direct contacts with the planning office of the WEU, and also a whole range of issues connected with Latvia's security.
