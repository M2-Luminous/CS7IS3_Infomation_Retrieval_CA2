This is contained in a special article of the January 1992 edition of INFORMATION AND NATIONAL SECURITY, a U.S. publication that specializes in gathering and disclosing secret information. The article is entitled "International Espionage Activities Mentioned in Top-Secret KGB Documents: 1975-1985." This publication notes that a secret cable dated 20 April 1978 and addressed to a Soviet espionage network operating in Hong Kong says that "even though Kim describes himself as a hero who liberated his fatherland from the Japanese imperialists in August 1945 by waging a bold partisan struggle, the KGB headquarters know very well that he was not in North Korea at that time." This cable also says: "When the Soviet forces liberated North Korea, Kim was serving as a lieutenant in the Red Army and an agent of the NKVD (KGB's predecessor)." It also says that the KGB feels a sense of betrayal as well as a sense of contempt toward Kim."
