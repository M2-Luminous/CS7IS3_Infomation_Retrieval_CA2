This information was relayed to journalists who had been invited to the famous firm by Aleksandr Bashilov, general director of the science and production association, and his deputy Konstantin Borovoy, director of the new commercial project. Since it is simply impossible at present to support the aerospace industry at the proper level within the framework of the state budget, it has been decided to pool the efforts of our best aerospace firms with the financial potential of Russia's commercial structures. "Molniya's" specialists regard the following as the principal long-term projects with a good chance of success: A multipurpose aerospace system and an orbiting spaceplane launched from a delivery vehicle rather than a space center, a function that could be performed by the An-225 (the "Mriya"). Incidentally, the science and production association plans to develop its own heavy aircraft with a much bigger cargo carrying capacity than "Mriya." This system, which would not require a space center, would enable us to place payloads in orbit from virtually any point on the globe, thus making orbital payload delivery five to seven times cheaper. "Molniya" is already preparing to offer customers a series of light business aircraft, one of which -- the six-seater "Molniya-1" air taxi -- is successfully undergoing flight tests. A total of 20 series aircraft have already been manufactured by the Samara plant. It is expected that the incorporation documents for the establishment of the Russian Aerospace Company could be signed this June. The first profit, Konstantin Borovoy believes, could show up literally within the next few months: The "Molniya" Science and Production Association already has a competitive product both on the domestic and the world market. In addition to the aerospace technology already mentioned, it includes advanced technologies and new materials, for example adhesives which were developed during work on "Buran." Moreover, most of this "know-how" is extremely adaptable and can be applied in a number of sectors of the national economy.
