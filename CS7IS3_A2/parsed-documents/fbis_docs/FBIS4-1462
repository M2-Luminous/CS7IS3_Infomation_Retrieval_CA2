Mrs. Cooper should have been confirmed this week along with two other NPFL nominees who have already been confirmed and inducted into office for the portfolios of information and agriculture. Although TLA [Transitional Legislative Assembly] Speaker Morris Dukuly, has said he is awaiting instruction from the State Council before carrying out Madame Cooper's confirmation hearing, the statement runs contrary to the prerogatives of the various parties to present their nominees for the confirmation as already done by the NPFL. NPFL leader, Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor, has made it expressly clear that the Transitional State Council has no hiring or dismissing power over any of the nominees of the various factions. Mrs. Cooper, the first woman to be appointed to the Foreign Ministry portfolio in Liberia, was recently nominated to the post by NPFL in place of Mr. Momolu Sirleaf after a contention from IGNU [Interim Government of National Unity] over the suitability of Mr. Sirleaf for the job. A delay in carrying out Mrs. Cooper's confirmation represents a flagrant abuse of the conciliatory move by the NPFL to have Mr. Momolu Sirleaf replaced for the post of foreign affairs, considering that none of the various factions to the Liberian Council is under a binding obligation of so doing to the seat of another party to the Council. The delay tactic is another bizarre attempt by the Monrovia group to stall the transitional process leading to the holding of free and fair general and presidential elections and restoration of lasting peace to Liberia. The NPFL has vowed not to give in to any ploy that will cause any further delay in the peace process. Liberian women are also arguing that the delay in conducting confirmation hearings of Madame Cooper is a manifestation of prejudice against Liberian women who have distinguished themselves as capable of assuming high office in the country. News just in says the NPFL is taken aback by the delay in a peace process, endangered by a Council of State negotiated for and subsequently sworn in to accelerate the process of peace in this country. The Council of State, in effect, has no authority whatsoever to appoint ministers or heads of public corporations and autonomous agencies. This is the exclusive domain of the negotiating parties after the Cotonou Agreement. According to an NPFL release, the chairman of the State Council is merely first among equals. As such, the NPFL is therefore disturbed that it is assuming the role of superstar, making decisions even when only two of five council members are present. This is totally unacceptable, according to the NPFL. Such a drift from the Cotonou Agreement can only lead to a total breakdown of the process, according to the NPFL statement. The NPFL leadership then urged all peaceloving Liberians and the international community at large to do whatever they can to make sure that this Transitional Government is finally and totally seated and functions.
