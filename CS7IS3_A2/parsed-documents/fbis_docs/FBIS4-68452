In the report published here on the results of research they carried out, it is noted that the decrease of Russia's gross national product, which was 12 percent last year, will slow somewhat and will comprise 7 percent. The average level of inflation will drop from 880 percent in 1993 to 500 percent. As for the other countries of the CIS, they can expect a larger economic slump than last year. One of the reasons for this, in the opinion of the institute's specialists, is the cut in deliveries of raw materials and energy from Russia, which will lead to growth in prices and acceleration in inflation. As it is noted in the report, in 1993 the general volume of gross national product in the CIS countries dropped 10 percent and the output of industrial prodcution decreased 14 percent. The average level of inflation comprised 1,450 percent. According to results of last year, the decrease in gross national product in Ukraine comprised 15 percent; in Belorussia [Belarus]--9 percent; in Moldavia [Moldova]--4 percent; in Uzbekistan--3.5 percent; in Kazakhstan--13 percent; in Kirghiziya [Kyrgyzstan]--13.4 percent; in Tajikistan--21 percent; in Armenia-- 9.9 percent; and in Azerbaijan--13.3 percent. Positive results were noted only in Turkmenistan, where growth in GNP comprised 7.8 percent. The situation in the labor market looks somewhat better in the CIS countries than in other states of East Europe. However, the reason for this, in the experts' opinion, is because of the very slow formation of the structure of a market economy. As a result, as in the past a large number of inefficient jobs are maintained at enterprises. According to official data, there are almost 1.2 million unemployed people in the CIS countries. But hidden unemployment is much higher because many people are on unpaid or partially paid leave. As a whole for the 1990-1993 period, according to data from the institute, the volume of industrial production in the CIS countries decreased almost 40 percent. This is more than during the U.S. "Great Depression" of the 1930s.
