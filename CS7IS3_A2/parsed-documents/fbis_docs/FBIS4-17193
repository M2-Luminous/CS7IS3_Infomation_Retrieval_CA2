The UN secretary general's special envoy, Y. Akashi, also said this recently. A whole number of states with peacekeeping forces in the zone of conflict have said several times that if a real threat to peacekeepers develops, the question may arise of withdrawing military contingents. It goes without saying that, in this event, the Russian side would not sit with its arms folded either."
