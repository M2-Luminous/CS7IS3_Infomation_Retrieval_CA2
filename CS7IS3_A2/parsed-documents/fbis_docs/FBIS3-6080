On 10 March, it decided to review Japanese business practices and the keiretsu system of interlocking corporate groups -- which have drawn severe criticism from foreign countries -- looking for possible measures to reduce Japan's trade surplus. A "distribution and market opening division" is to be established under the Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters to discuss deregulatory measures which can produce immediate effects. The government plans to ask the division to discuss business practices and review them. This idea has already been approved by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and has been conveyed to each ministry as the prime minister's plan. According to a government source, the government decided to review business practices because: 1) the United States has not been satisfied with the measures that Japan has worked out to cut its trade surplus, and the government has faced difficulties formulating measures to open markets in priority trade areas, such as autos and auto parts, which resulted in the breakup of the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks; and 2) Japanese business practices lie behind arguments that "Japan is different from other countries" and behind U.S. demands for Japan to set numerical targets, as well as its impatient actions toward imposing sanctions on Japan. The government is worried that the United States and other countries might intensify their criticism that "Japan's trade surplus is aggravating the world's employment situation" through a G-7 job summit scheduled in Detroit this month and a Naples summit in July. The distribution and market opening division, which will be inaugurated at the end of March, is to review business practices and the keiretsu system. Specifically, it will review keiretsu transactions among interconnected business groups and groups in which banks form the central elements. Also, it will discuss group boycotting, a practice in which a group of companies prevent newcomers from entering their markets, as well as collusive bidding practices in tenders for public works projects. The division is expected to reach a conclusion before the Naples summit.
