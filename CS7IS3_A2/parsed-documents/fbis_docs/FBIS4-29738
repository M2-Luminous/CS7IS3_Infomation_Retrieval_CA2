The sources interpreted the visa extension shortly ahead of an expected meeting between U.S. and North Korean diplomats Tuesday as a conciliatory gesture from Pyongyang to set the tone for the talks. The inspectors' visas, which would have expired at the end of this month, were extended for two weeks, they said. North Korean President Kim Il-song promised former U.S. President Jimmy Carter during unofficial talks in Pyongyang last week he would allow the two officials to stay. Commenting on Carter's trip, U.S. President Bill Clinton saw "hopeful signs" earlier Monday for an end to the standoff over North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program. Speaking in a live TV interview, Clinton said the U.S. will resume high-level talks with North Korea provided Pyongyang keeps its promise to freeze its controversial nuclear program. Upon return from Pyongyang Carter declared Sunday that "I personally believe the crisis is over" and that Kim "wants to be sure" the crisis on the Korean peninsula is over. North Korea in may started to remove the fuel rods in its 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang, without the required agency supervision. The U.N. nuclear watchdog pulled out its team in late May after negotiations with Pyongyang broke down over the inspectors' demand to be able to select, segregate and secure some 300 fuel rods for measurement needed to verify whether nuclear material had been diverted in the past. In response to a request by the U.N. Security Council, the agency, however, retained two inspectors to report on the removal activities. They have since been observing the fuel removal and were allowed to continue checks of surveillance cameras at Yongbyon facilities. According to their report, reactor workers have meanwhile discharged all spent nuclear fuel rods, but have not yet started to load the reactor core with new ones.
