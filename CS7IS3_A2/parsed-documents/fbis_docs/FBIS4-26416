Two different cases; hence, different meanings. But the method which the Chinese Communists used to try the culprits who were involved in the Qiandao Lake incident was almost identical to the one adopted by the Kuomintang 14 years ago when it put on trial those involved in the Kaohsiung incident. Because, however, of the valiant defense put up by those who were charged in the Kaohsiung incident and their lawyers, the Kuomintang's prepared script went awry. Following a successive retraction of confessions extracted during interrogations and the launching of a counterattack, the eight "most wanted persons of the Kuomintang" survived their courtroom ordeal. Woe betide the three young men in Hangzhou who will be made the scapegoats and who will pay with their lives within days for the vicious killings on Qiandao Lake, thus adding three more wronged ghosts to the netherworld. I was the first one who openly retracted a forced confession during the great trial in the military court many years ago. Because I have been working on behalf of the families of the Qiandao Lake incident's victims, I know instantly the hypocrisy and the illegality of the trial by the Hangzhou intermediate court of the three persons who were charged with robbery and murder. The Hangzhou intermediate court has violated the "human rights" safeguard standard as set forth in modern international law -- that is, all have the right to an open and free trial. Seriously Violate the "Due Process of Law" I had intended to go with the families of the victims to Hangzhou for the court hearing. Being unable to make the trip, I became resigned to reading newspaper reports about the case. I found that in handling this case, China has at least seriously violated the "due process of law." 1. The contents of the indictment document have not been made known to the public. The families of the victims and their lawyers also have not received copies of the indictment. Even the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] said that it has no idea about the contents of the indictment. 2. Although claiming an open trial, the court did not allow the lawyers of the victims' families or Taiwan legislators to attend the court proceedings. The SEF was notified, just 24 hours before the opening of the trial, that it would be allowed to send a person "in his capacity as an individual" to attend the court hearing. This was too late, because there were neither flights nor enough time to reach Hangzhou. It was reported that most of the people who attended the court hearing dressed well. Men were reported wearing Western suits and women wearing traditional Chinese-style dresses. They were apparently senior Communist officials. At the center of the courtroom there hung a red cloth banner with the words "The Qiandao Lake incident trial court" written on it. It looked rather like the holding of a wedding reception or the staging of a theatrical play. It was completely out of place for a court which was supposed to be holding a great trial of robbers and murderers who had committed the heinous crime of killing 32 people. 3. Reporters were prohibited from attending the court hearing. They were only allowed to watch the court hearing on a television at a building across the court. Photos and videotaping were also forbidden. Many plainclothesmen surreptitiously took photos of or videotaped reporters who were at the scene to cover the event. The Communists even brazenly offered to sell reporters a 20-minute censored and edited videotape of the trial for $100. 4. The trial was conducted on 10-11 June. The three persons who were accused of the crime each were given two death sentences on the morning of 12 June. But, 12 June was a Sunday. There is no country in the world which holds trials on Sundays. It was also strange and uncommon that the Hangzhou court hastily handed down death sentences on Sunday, just one day before the Dragon Boat Festival, which falls on 13 June and which is one of China's three major festivals and a day for family reunions. It was a great feat indeed that they managed to finish drafting, typing, and proof-reading a long-winded court verdict just a few hours after the trial. All this points to the fact that the Communist authorities wanted to speedily conclude the case and that the court verdict had already been prepared before the trial opened. The court trial was nothing but a political farce. Flatly Reject the Legitimacy and Authenticity of the Trial The above are the serious procedural flaws that I found in the course of the Qiandao Lake trial. People who did not the trial also can discern these criticisms, but if one were present at the trial, one surely would have found even more instances of absurdity and hypocrisy. Because of these obvious and serious procedural flaws, we of course question whether the three who were charged with the crime were the real culprits. Therefore, we should categorically reject the legitimacy and authenticity of the verdict. As a matter of fact, we can detect a great deal of whitewashing even from the limited images contained in the doctored videotape. When arriving at the court to stand trial, the three persons who were accused of the crime wore smiles and were at ease. They did not look like vicious robbers who had committed such a heinous crime. When recounting the commission of the crime, they readily answered questions while cooperating perfectly with the judge. They even consulted prepared notes when replying to the judge's questions. They seemed to be memorizing the script. They did not give a slightest impression that an imminent disaster would soon befall them. They also did not betray a trace of fear that their heads would soon be chopped off. That scene reminded me of the Wu Tai-an communist spy case, which occurred one year before the Kaohsiung incident. [passage omitted] Are Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan, and Yu Aijun the real culprits who were involved in the Qiandao Lake incident and who cruelly killed 32 people? Were they capable of committing such a heinous crime? With what sort of weapons did they commit the crime? We've got to know the answers to these questions, because these have to do with the real truth of the tragedy and with the criminal responsibility of the three accused persons. However, the accounts given in the court by the three accused persons were evasive, farfetched, and tended to avoid the important and dwell on the trivial when it came to the important points. The judge did not have the slightest intention of energetically pursuing the case by asking more penetrating questions, and he left major suspicious points unclarified. For instance, were there more than three persons who committed the crime? What kinds of guns were used in the crime? What was the actual situation of the setting of the boat on fire? What were the real causes of death? Were the victims killed by gunshots? Were they burned to death? Or, were they just asphyxiated? These issues were all left unprobed. One can see clearly that the truth of the case had not been brought to light with the conclusion of the two-day trial. Instead, the truth may never be known because of the hurried sentencing and execution of the three accused persons. We Should Never Allow Ourselves To Be Treated as Idiots and as the Meat on the Chopping Block Following the handing down of the verdict, presiding Judge Yang Gang immediately called a news conference at which he insisted that there were only three culprits and that "there were absolutely no other people involved in this case." The chairman of Zhejiang's Taiwan affairs office also called on Taiwan compatriots to believe in the sincerity of the Chinese Communists and not to let the Qiandao Lake incident affect the feelings between the people living on both sides of the strait and hamper the "virtuous development" of the cross-strait relationship. Well, if this is their wish, then why didn't they let lawyers representing the families of the victims attend the court hearing? Why didn't they allow reporters to visit the scene of the crime? Why did they go to such unusual lengths in covering up the case following its occurrence? These all point to the fact that there must have been a cover-up of the Qiandao Lake incident. There must be other real culprits. Even when things have reached such a state, the Communist authorities still treat the "Taiwan compatriots" like idiots; they still want to treat Taiwan as the meat on the chopping block. My dear Taiwan compatriots, do you still want to be treated like idiots by the Communists? Here is a warning to those incompetent officials at the SEF and Mainland Affairs Council: If you still continue to treat Taiwan as meat on the chopping block for others to chop, we will surely force you to step down.
