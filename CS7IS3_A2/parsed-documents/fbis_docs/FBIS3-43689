In other words, 1 French franc, which was worth 50 CFA francs, is now worth 100 CFA francs. Since the announcement of news of the devaluation yesterday, a lot of images have collapsed -- that of a friendly and generous France. And for most francophone countries, especially those in the franc zone, the attitude of France is felt as an apparent affront to solidarity, a form of injustice and even a betrayal. For instance, in Gabon it is believed that with the devaluation of the CFA franc, the yard sale of the black continent has been set in motion. This perhaps harsh statement is tinged with more or less justified pessimism. Today, everyone knows that this devaluation will plunge all the countries of the zone into a maze of difficulties which they will now have to face all alone. These difficulties comprise a budget deficit, debt, a decrease in purchasing power, and unemployed youth, bringing in their stride the risk of social conflicts. Our country, which is presented as one of the rare African countries likely to gain from the CFA franc devaluation, and which has for a long time prepared for this eventuality, hopes that the devaluation which has just been decided in Dakar will make for a better exploitation of its economic potential. Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan returned to Abidjan this morning. The head of government has just participated in the deliberations of the dual-purpose summit on multinational company Air Afrique and the CFA franc. The heads of state and government of the franc zone -- as we very well know since yesterday -- have accepted the devaluation of the CFA franc by 50 percent. While waiting for the news conference on this decision, here are the initial comments of the head of government on his return this morning from Dakar. He was talking to Rene Bah: [Begin Duncan recording] At several meetings that we had with the national and international press, I indicated clearly that when an economy is sick, there are three types of measures to be taken. There is internal adjustment which is an important measure consisting of reducing state expenditure and increasing state revenue. The second measure is monetary adjustment while the third measure consists of a mixture of the two. In reality, in a case where internal adjustment does not yield sufficient results, monetary adjusment will complement the internal adjustment measure. This has positive elements and I will elaborate at length later. But first of all I must give an overall account to the head of state. However, I simply wish to say that this measure will make our country more competitive and improve its chances of exporting abroad. That we are one of the relatively industrialized countries in Africa and therefore have a large export capacity worth over 400 billion CFA franc a year. So we can have a larger revenue. It is a positive measure since state revenue will increase. This means that the country will have more room for maneuver. It will especially enable us to solve the dogged problem of internal debt. This is something that we must not lose sight of. Moreover, it will enable us to increase internal savings and permit the rapatriation of capital from abroad, since there was an evident lack of confidence in our economy. It will also permit the development of our local industries and what is important our local agricultural production. We shall have to consume much more of local produce because local prices of imported products will increase. So there are significant prospects for the country and it must be underlined that there will again be significant financial assistance to the country. We shall have the opportunity to develop all these at a news conference before the end of the week. [end recording]
