Chief Secretary for the CP Dr. Lem Theron says it seems as though the American contribution is directed at giving assistance to the ANC [African National Congress]-SACP [South African Communist Party] alliance so as to subject whites within the SADF to the authority of the ANC-SACP blacks in a process of blatant racist affirmative action. The CP requests all military personnel who are to be subjected to this degrading and humiliating action to see the American advisers for what they really are as there is no merit for their so-called expertise regarding racial integration. Dr. Theron said the U.S. is an excellent example of a country where racial integration has failed. Since the 1960's, the U.S. has been trying -- with its "melting pot" [preceding two words in English] approach -- to unite all races and cultures in one big American society. These efforts have failed dismally despite forced blackening of white schools through active integration of blacks in the civil service through affirmative action and others, such as the dishing out of significant roles to blacks in movies. Despite all their efforts, the natural tendency for races to associate with their own has led to the phenomenon where blacks and other ethnic groups have demonstrated -- in the course of time -- preference for association with their own people by spontaneously establishing black and own culture-dominated schools. There are currently 18 black-dominated universities in the U.S.A. which give priority to black students. According to Dr. Theron, the black caucus in the U.S.A's House of Representatives is damning evidence against forced racial integration.
