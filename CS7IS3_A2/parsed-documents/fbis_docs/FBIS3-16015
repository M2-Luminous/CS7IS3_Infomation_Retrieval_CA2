He emphasized that at the moment, Moscow is engaged to a greater extent in material and technical provisions for the Black Sea Fleet. Disruptions in supplying the fleet are due to the economic state of both Ukraine and Russia. The Black Sea Fleet commander evaluated the morale of personnel as satisfactory and capable of ensuring the completion of tasks set for the fleet. "This was tested in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict," said the admiral. According to information from the Black Sea Fleet press center, Admiral Eduard Baltin agreed with the assertion of the television journalists that the fleet's dual subordination is an unusual phenomenon in world practice. In his opinion, such a situation does not create any problems for officers, as the latter are subordinate to the fleet's command. However, problems sometimes arise for the command. The Black Sea Fleet commander expressed the hope that the presidents of Russia and Ukraine will solve the problems of the fleet in the near future, proceeding from the military-political tasks facing it: "I am currently subordinate to two presidents," stated the admiral, "and I concur with them on all of my operational actions. As for some of the high-ranking military, I have gotten used to some dissatisfaction on their part. I think that the presidents will make the right decision, taking into account the military-political situation and economic possibilities. In my opinion, Russia and Ukraine do not have great differences, and those that they do have will be resolved by political means."
