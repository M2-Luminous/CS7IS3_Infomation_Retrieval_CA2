Officials of the Metropolitan Expressway Public Corp. said the 11-kilometer tunnel project, which will begin in 1995, is aimed at easing traffic congestion in central Tokyo. This is expected to become a very hard construction project as the heavily populated area is patchworked with gas and water lines, not to mention rivers and underground railways. The total cost of the project has been put at some 840 billion yen. About of half that amount is to be used for the purchase of private land, since property rights extend below the surface of the land. But so far the public corporation has only managed to buy up a fourth of the needed land. The tunnel will be a spacious 40 meters wide and accommodate the latest fire prevention and antipollution technology.
