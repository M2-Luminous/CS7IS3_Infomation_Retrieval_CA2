The Egyptian Government closed this plan's dossier under pressure from a number of international circles, despite repeated appeals by Egyptian nuclear energy experts stressing the inevitable entry into this strategic field. At the end of last month, the Arab Mining and Petroleum Association held a symposium, entitled "Energy and Constant Development Challenges," that was attended by a large number of petroleum, electricity, and nuclear plant experts. They included Dr. Hafiz Hajji, chairman of the Nuclear Plants Authority [agency name as published]; Dr. Nabil al-Hadhiq, chairman of the Nuclear Materials Authority; Dr. Mustafa Suwaydan, deputy chairman of the Egyptian Electricity Studies Authority; Engineer Mahmud Sami Zaffun, chairman of the New and Renewable Energy Authority; Dr. Husayn 'Abd-al-Muhsin, former chairman of the Nuclear Materials Authority; and a large number of people concerned with energy in Egypt. Most of the experts' debates were on the issue of nuclear energy in Egypt. Upon concluding its meeting, the first recommendation the symposium made was that it is inevitable that we enter the nuclear age peacefully as of now so we can meet the coming oil shortage in Egypt. The same thing was stressed by petroleum experts who announced that Egypt's oil reserves will hardly last 30-40 years. Some experts referred to the petroleum minister's statement that "oil reserve is a dynamic reserve, meaning that it increases at times as a result of new finds." These experts have said that even if the reserve increases as a result of new finds, it will be depleted some day, and this has been confirmed by the reports of Egypt's Higher Energy Council. Dr. Husayn 'Abd-al-Muhsin, former chairman of the Nuclear Materials Authority, said that officials must move promptly to make the political decision immediately because we already have studies in place. Moreover, it is important to begin implementation now because the construction of a nuclear plant takes 10 years, considering that bids have to be invited and agreements concluded, all of which takes years. This is what makes us declare that this plan has to be started now. In this report, AL-SHA'B presents the latest developments it has learned from the statements of nuclear energy experts, especially since officials use the two points of "cost and nuclear safety" as an excuse to kill this plan. First, the point concerning the plan's costs; a high-ranking nuclear energy official has disclosed to me that financing is secured by Law No. 45 of 1975, in accordance with which President al-Sadat set up the Alternative Energy Fund in 1975 to finance the nuclear power plants project. At the time, the fund had $700 million, which has now risen with interest to more than $1.3 billion. This fund's revenues are not touched by the government because it was set up especially for nuclear plants. The official has said that a number of countries are in the process of concluding contracts for nuclear plants, especially for the Cando [design] from Canada. These countries include South Korea (three plants) and Romania (five plants). Turkey has also initiated steps and contacted the Canadians to build a power plant, and so has Indonesia, because these plants are distinguished by their lower cost and their high degree of safety. The official added that the cost of this plant is $1.35 billion, which will be divided as follows: - There is an existing plan for the possible manufacture of some parts of this plant locally, in cooperation with the Canadian Atomic Energy Agency. A number of domestic Egyptian firms have been comprehensively surveyed. What this means is that we will contribute at least 25 percent in Egyptian pounds. - The second point is that the Alternative Energy Fund has enough at present to purchase this plant, whose cost does not have to be paid all at once. If we consider the matter, we will find that we will have to pay just $160 million annually. This means that we will take only $600 million from the Alternative Energy Fund and that we will acquire the rest in bank interest. In addition, Egypt has at present programs to transfer Canadian technology in this particular area so as to strengthen domestic industry. The Nuclear Plants Authority will study anew the types of raw materials available and will conduct a survey of construction companies that can contribute to building a nuclear plant. This program will determine the percentage of domestic participation. Nuclear energy esperts surprisingly revealed that Bechtel, a U.S. Firm, has applied to the Ministry of Nuclear Energy to cooperate with Canada and the Nuclear Plants Authority and that it has, according to an expert, received the "go-ahead signal" on the grounds that "Egypt is a signatory of the nuclear weapons nonproliferation treaty." The second point used is the "nuclear safety" point, especially since the Egyptian Government has used the incident at Chernobyl--a Russian reactor that did not meet minimal safety requirements and where the people in charge of operating the reactor made a mistake--as a justification to kill this plan. Dr. Hafiz Hajji, chairman of the Nuclear Plants Authority, has said, "High levels of safety have been developed in nuclear plants. It is sufficient to know that the Canadian-made Cando is distinguished by the fact that the possibility of reactor core meltdown is absolutely nonexistent because Cando's cooling systems are highly sophisticated, contrary to the PWR [pressurized water reactor]. Moreover, this plant's operation is computer-controlled and the plant has two independent safety systems." Dr. Hajji added, "This safety issue is over. As an example, I will note in this regard the earthquake that hit Los Angeles recently. A report published by an international magazine says that nuclear plants are the only plants that were not affected by the earthquake and that withstood it and continued to supply the state with power, whereas gas and coal-operated plants came to a halt. Moreover, the United States, Germany, and France are developing safer reactors so as to achieve greater assurance and safety. So, there is absolutely no problem." Dr. Hisham Fu'ad, deputy chairman of the Atomic Energy Authority, has said, "Experts are in a poor psychological state and there is increased fear that specialists in nuclear technology will flee to other countries. I don't wish to repeat what I have already said about nuclear plants meaning life. They supply us with electricity and they involve great technology, in which we should absolutely not lag behind. These plants also contribute to development in all areas, including agriculture and industry, and they are used for sea water desalination." Dr. Fu'ad added regretfully, "At a time when we kill the plan with our own hands, we find that Israel works systematically; that it has future plans; that it uses its reactors for the military; and that it is now trying to build a powerful reactor for electricity production. We have reiterated this fact again and again, but who is listening?" The truth has actually been reiterated again and again. But nobody has listened. It is sufficient to restate that, while inaugurating a nuclear power plant two weeks ago, China's prime minister said, "there will be no recurrence of another Chernobyl catastrophe."
