FR940512-2-00103 FR940512-2-00055 3. To effect the transfer of the Interest from the Original Plan to the New Plan, the Employers will direct the Trustee to establish separate trusts for each of the Plans, and to transfer from the existing Original Plan trust a 57 percent ownership interest in the Property to a new trust established exclusively for assets of the New Plan. The Original Plan will retain the remaining 43 percent interest in the Property. The Interest will be transferred subject to the Original Lease, and the Employers will direct the Trustee to transfer to the New Plan a 57 percent lessor's interest in the Original Lease, while the Original Plan will continue to own a 43 percent lessor's interest in the Original Lease. The Property had a fair market value of $1,050,000 as of December 16, 1992, according to Steven L. Bowen, MAI (Bowen), an independent professional real estate appraiser in San Diego, California. The Employers represent that total assets in the Original Plan were valued at $13,177,499.29 as of December 31, 1992, including account balances of all participants in both Plans. 4. It is proposed that each Employer, as lessee, will execute a separate lease with both Plans, as lessors (the New Leases), to enable the Employers' lease of the Property from the Plans under the same terms and conditions as the Original Lease (except for provisions relating to rental review, described below). Under each New Lease, the Plans will be co-lessors of the Property, and each Employer will be a lessee. Based upon their proportionate uses of the Property and the improvements thereon, the Employers have determined that the Original Employer will execute a New Lease with respect to 58 percent of the Property, while the New Employer will execute a New Lease with respect to the remaining 42 percent, and each Employer will be responsible for the corresponding percentage of the Property's total rent and all other expenses relating to taxes, insurance, maintenance, and repair of the Property. The Trustee will continue to act as an independent fiduciary and will represent the interests of the Plans under the New Leases by overseeing and enforcing the Employers' performance of lease obligations and by securing compliance with the conditions of this exemption, if granted. The Trustee represents that at all times under the Original Lease, the Original Employer has been in compliance with all lease terms and all conditions of PTE 84&hyph;175. 5. The proposed New Leases are triple net leases with initial terms ending April 30, 2004, the same termination date of the Original Lease initial term. Rent is payable monthly under the New Leases, which provide for a review of the annual rent every two years on February 1, commencing as soon after February 1, 1994 as the Department publishes the exemption proposed herein, if granted. Such review will be conducted by an independent, unrelated professional real estate appraiser selected by the Trustee. Any adjustment of rent resulting from such review shall be upward only, and any decrease in the fair market rental value of the Property shall not result in any decrease in the rent under the New Leases. In accordance with this procedure, initial rent under the New Leases will be no less than the greater of (a) $13,750 per month, which is the current rent under the Original Lease, or (b) the fair market rental value of the Property as determined as of the initial date of the New Leases by the appraiser selected by the Trustee. The New Leases require the Employers to pay all repair and maintenance costs of the Property, to pay all real estate taxes on the Property, and to carry fire, extended coverage and public liability insurance on the Property to the full extent of the insurable value of the Property, with the Plans as the named insured. Under the New Leases, the Employers agree to indemnify the Plans and hold the Plans harmless from all claims, demands, liens, losses and liabilities of any nature arising from the Employers' use of the Property. Each New Lease will provide that upon the expiration of its initial term, with the approval of the Trustee, the Employers may extend the New Lease for up to two additional terms of five years each upon written notice to the Trustee at least six months prior to the expiration of the initial term or the expiration of the first five-year renewal term, whichever is applicable. Rental under such extended five-year term(s) will be payable pursuant to the same procedures required by the New Leases during the initial term, including rental review every two years. 6. The Trustee represents that after a review and analysis, it has approved the proposed transactions on behalf of the participants and beneficiaries of the Plans. In this regard, the Trustee engaged the services of two independent advisers (the Advisers) to serve in fiduciary capacities on behalf of the Plans in determining whether the retention of a 43 percent interest in the Property by the Original Plan and the receipt of a 57 percent interest in the Property by the New Plan are prudent investments for the Plans and in the best interests of their participants and beneficiaries. The Advisers were also engaged to determine whether the New Leases constitute prudent investments for the Plans and whether their terms and conditions are protective of the Plans' participants and beneficiaries.
