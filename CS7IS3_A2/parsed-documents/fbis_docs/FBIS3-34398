But before the meeting with the Israeli president, he [Klaus] had talks with Binyamin Netanyahu, chairman of the right-wing opposition Likud bloc, who is a staunch opponent of the present Israeli Government's policy on Palestinians. Talks between President Weizman and Vaclav Klaus centered mainly on the general situation in the Middle East while Klaus' discussions with Binyamin Netanyahu concentrated on the level of privatization in both countries and on economic reform in the Czech Republic. Prime Minister Klaus commented to Czech radio on his talks [with Netanyahu]. [Begin Klaus recording] This is a political party that puts emphasis on similar principles as the political party [Civic Democratic Party], which I lead, and [on similar principles] as the government coalition that rules in the Czech Republic. We, therefore, preferred to talk about our views on civic, social, political, and economic matters. The Middle East issue or the question of Palestine did not dominate our discussions. [passage omitted] It is absolutely evident that the Czech Republic is, in these areas [of privatization], the country with a greater private sector, the country with a lesser tax burden, the country with less regulatory measures and state intervention in the economy. These were matters the Israeli party was exceedingly interested in. [end recording]
