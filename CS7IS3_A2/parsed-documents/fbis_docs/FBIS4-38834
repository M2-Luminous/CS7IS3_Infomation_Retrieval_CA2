"Our attitude to the problem of nuclear armaments of any state is resolutely negative. Surely, it is better to reach an agreement than impose sanctions, but the non-proliferation regime should be maintained very strictly", he told TASS on Thursday. Lukin, who participated in Russian-South Korean talks on Thursday, said that "Russia is especially not interested in the appearance of new nuclear states on its borders" and added that it is necessary to hold a dialogue with Pyongyang when possible. If the dialogue fails "then those countries which do not want to abide by international and even their own decisions should be convinced more resolutely", he said.
