Tsai] [Text] Taipei, April 1 (CNA) -- In a new effort to better protect intellectual property rights, Taiwan will establish the information product anti-piracy union in late April, the Information Service Industry Association (ISIA) announced late Thursday [31 March]. ISIA Secretary-General Arthur Hwa said at a news conference that the union, aiming to intensify crackdowns on counterfeit computer products, will be patterned after the US-based business software alliance (BSA). More than 30 domestic computer software manufacturers have decided to join the new union, Hwa noted. To give a helping hand to Taiwan's anti-piracy efforts, BSA said the American Alliance has chosen April as "Anti-Piracy Month" for Taiwan, and will launch a series of activities here to advocate the importance of protecting innovative information products from unauthorized use. BSA will sponsor seminars on software management and offer incentive measures to encourage Taiwan residents to inform the alliance of software piracy cases, a spokesman said. Anyone who provides information which leads to the indictment, sentencing or out of court settlement of a software pirate will be rewarded NT$50,000 (US$1,886.79), he elaborated. Louis Wang, director of the Interior Ministry's Copyright Committee, hailed the BSA move, saying the anti-piracy drive will promote the development of a sound, healthy information industry in Taiwan. Also speaking at the news conference were Director-General B. Lynn Pascoe of the American Institute in Taiwan, Deputy Director- General Lin Yi-fu of the Board of Foreign Trade, and Hu Tzu-yin, deputy director-general of the Information Industry Institute.
