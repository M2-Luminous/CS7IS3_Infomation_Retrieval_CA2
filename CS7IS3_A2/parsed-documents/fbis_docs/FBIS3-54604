In its statement, Fatah stressed that it views with gravity recent Israeli practices in the occupied territories, the culmination of which was the recent campaign of detentions in the Gaza Strip. The statement referred to opening fire on residents in Jabalyah last Saturday [22 January], the demolition of houses in Rafah, the detentions that have covered most areas of the Gaza Strip, and the campaign of confiscating magnetic identity cards from hundreds of workers without any justification. The statement emphasized that the Israeli side is incapable of proving its credibility and seriousness with respect to the current peace process. In its statement, Fatah called on the Israeli authorities to immediately release all prisoners, especially the sick, the elderly, and those who have spent long periods in detention, without discriminating against one people. The statement also called on the authorities to release fugitives who were detained after the signing of the Declaration of Principles and to return recently revoked identity cards to hundreds of workers. In conclusion, Fatah stated that the Israeli side should immediately stop these practices, which will have a negative effect on the negotiating process.
