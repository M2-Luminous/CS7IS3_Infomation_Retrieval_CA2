Fidel arrived in the company of Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the National Assembly of the People's Government, and Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina. Fidel was greeted at the foot of the Cubana plane by Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin and writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. Colombian Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez and Communications Minister William Jaramillo were also present. After reviewing the honor guard and speaking with approximately 20 reporters, Fidel said he was very pleased to be in Colombia and replied to a question by saying it would be too optimistic to hope the U.S. blockade would end during the summit. Fidel added that he has several things he wants to say but we have to wait until 14 June, when he will address the heads of state of the 21 Ibero-American nations. Last night, along the route of the caravan taking Fidel and Foreign Minister Sanin to the hotel, numerous people gathered to shout support and welcome slogans. Some of the slogans displayed along the route of the caravan read: Welcome Fidel! With Cuba for all Times!
