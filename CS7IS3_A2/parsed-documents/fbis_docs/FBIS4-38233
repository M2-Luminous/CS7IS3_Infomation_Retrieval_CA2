It seized all their documents and files, as well as the passports the defendants used in their travels to numerous countries. A ranking security source told AL-AHRAM correspondent Ahmad Musa that confessions by the terrorist group revealed that their leadership, which has fled abroad, dispatched them inside the country after the successful security blows dealt to terrorist leaders 'Awad Siyam and Tal'at Yasin Hammam.
