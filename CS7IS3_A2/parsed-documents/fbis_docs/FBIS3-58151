Speaking after talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Dehaene said the West had to send a signal of its determination to act in the face of continuing bloodshed in Bosnia. NATO agreed in August to launch air raids on Serbs in the former Yugoslav republic if requested by the United Nations to break the siege of Sarajevo and other Moslem communities. But it has yet to be given the green light by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, even as the shelling of Sarajevo has intensified in recent days. "We must seriously consider the possibility of launching air raids," Dehaene told reporters after his meeting with Clinton. "I think that more and more countries agree on this." France is pressing the two-day summit to take strong action on Bosnia but there is little sign the United States is ready to support any new initiative. Washington once strongly supported air raids, but U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher last week repeated warnings that such attacks were bound to endanger UN forces guarding relief operations on the ground.
