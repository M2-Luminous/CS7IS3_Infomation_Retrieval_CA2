This "Details" edition is in response to criticism from the LDPR that the program's announcer Nikolay Svanidze, in a previously edition, said Zhirinovskiy allegedly paid 500 dollars to each member of the LDPR faction to get them to vote for the country's budget. The program starts with a clip containing Svanidze's earlier comment on the Zhirinovskiy bribes, followed by a three-and-half minute introductory question by Svanidze to today's guest, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who chews his lips, shuffles papers, and tries to interrupt Svanidze's introduction several times. Svanidze asks how much truth there is in various, sometimes outlandish, rumors circulating about Zhirinovskiy and his party, and why Zhirinovskiy is so upset at the suggestion of his bribing his deputies. To this Zhirinovskiy replies: "Moscow courts are inundated with our cases about the defense of honor and dignity, my personal dignity, and that of the party. We keep on protesting. "For the first time in six months you have given me an opportunity to speak here, and only after a measure by the entire faction, when we left the conference hall of the State Duma. In such situations some political figures or even mass media people would resign. The only thing that has happeened so far in our country is that you have finally graciously permitted the leader of a party with a big electoral victory, the leader of the largest party faction, to come here and explain himself in the light of your untruthful accusations. Ninety percent of what has been said about the party in the five months since our electoral victory is lies. Ten percent of those rumors are correct." Zhirinovskiy goes on to criticize every level of government for not providing him and his party with appropriate offices in the center of Moscow, saying that even petty criminals have better accommodation than the LDPR. He then goes on to reply to the second part of the introductory question regarding the alleged bribes, saying: "Well then. No member of the party has received or will ever receive anything from me. You have said that I gave them 500 dollars each. I would not have given even 500 rubles. I will never pay anyone, not even Moscow functionaries. You have told such a lie, such an despicable accusation, and not only against me. You said I paid them, and thus you have insulted the entire faction, the entire party. You spat in the face of almost 13 million voters, who voted for us because we are the most honest group of deputies." Zhirinovskiy goes on to repeat the same thing several times over, then shouts at Svanidze: "You tell me, why is it that all the media, including Ostankino, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, the Moscow channel, and all the others, always slander the party? Why is it? We are depicted as fascists, ultra-right wing. Is any of it contained in the party program? You tell me, why is it that you lot, the TV journalists, slander not only me and my party but also the entire country?" Svanidze replies that even if he wanted to, which is not the case, he never would have been able to spit in the face of 13 million people. As for the media in general, he says Zhirinovskiy often is himself the cause of various rumors. Svanidze then suggests Zhirinovskiy is trying to present his comment as an insult to the Duma, and then plays a clip in which Zhirinovskiy himself says the Duma has many corrupt deputies. To this Zhirinovskiy replies, shouting at times, that this is all true. According to him, the Central Electoral Commission has discovered that various democratic parties and groups have been supported by what Zhirinovskiy calls "Western intelligence services." He then accuses Svanidze, the media, and everyone in general of not having the guts to accept the fact that his party is the most popular one -- and the cheapest as well. Svanidze replies: "Yes, I understand now that the only clean and cheap deputies, as you say, belong to the LDPR faction." He reminds Zhirinovskiy, quoting one of his own recent speeches, that he likes to deliberately deceive voters, especially women, peasants, and certain national minorities, for their own good. He then suggests the reason Zhirinovskiy is so upset about the accusation of bribery is simply because he is looking for a scandal, as scandals are much more amusing than the daily dreariness of the Duma, and at any rate, Zhirinovskiy is a natural when it comes to scandals. Amid much shouting and arm-waving from both men, Zhirinovskiy replies that lying is simply an electoral tactic, that there is nothing wrong with it. The rest of his reply is lost in simultaneous shouting from both men and the program ends.
