First, this government has been born of a republican parliament for the first time elected on the first-past-the-post system desired by the vast majority of citizens. Second, the government's support is based on elected MPs in political parties which have never had ministerial responsibilities. This radical innovation is the fruit of a long and tortuous crisis of credibility of our institutions -- a crisis which swept away in name and deed the quasisupremacy of the parties which 50 years ago gave life to the Italian republic. Good policies are always the result of reflecting on what a maestro of renaissance ideology called the experience of things ancient and things modern. Indeed, what is new, for better or worse, is defined by its relationship with what is old. On this question -- in other words, on our relationship with the fundamentals of 50 years of republican life -- we must make one thing once and for all clear from the outset, because domestic and international public opinion is curious about and interested in this change, and in some cases it is understandably concerned. This government sees itself, without any doubt, as being within the legal foundation embodied in the constitution of 1948. Following the defeat of fascism in Europe the choice of democracy as the as the supreme value of liberal action is the common and explicit objective of all components of the majority. The past has been judged in different ways, but all agree in considering civil liberty as the basis for public life and in loyally respecting our constitutional architecture. The unity of the country and its indivisibility is another principle on which the majority agree without any reservation. Italy is a republic with a strong system of local and territorial autonomy wanted by all constituents on the basis of a long tradition whose roots are set in the communal life. The world sees us as the country of 100 cities, and our geographical, political, and cultural landscape would be unrecognizable if the great and rich variety of life which both unites and distinguishes the North from the South is not taken into account. Within these limits and boundaries, the majority regards with respect and interest the federalist debate, which is old and new both in its European dimension and in the sense of a better working of the nation. Loyalty to NATO, economic and political cooperation in the European Community, the repudiation of war as a way of solving international disputes, the principles of the Helsinki conference on the stability of borders, on the defense of human rights, and on the self-determination of peoples and noninterference: These are other fundamental components of this coalition's identity and the programme with which it has undertaken to form a government able to match up to Italy's international role. Notwithstanding the great progress made in the Middle East peace process and the extraordinary election of Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa, new wars are breaking out across the world. In the heart of black Africa, in Rwanda, terrible acts of violence are even being carried out on poor and defenseless children. The Bosnian tragedy on our doorstep continues to make the news, but neither Europe nor the United Nations seem able to bring it to an end. Anywhere in the the world where freedom and human rights are brought into question, Italy's voice must be heard, and the government will make every effort to make it heard. Solidarity, based on the Christian and humanistic roots of our culture, is at the heart of our foreign policy. The foreign minister is in Brussels, and is already at work to affirm and strengthen Italy's leading role in the European Union. Italy will support the widening of the Union, even toward East Europe, and increasing commercial links with the free trade areas of North America and the Pacific -- also to avoid the consolidation of spiralling protectionism. Careful consideration of the Maastricht Treaty must not delay the realization of the unification program, and we must forbid any indulgence concerning common defense or foreign policy. Two important foreign policy appointments are the European Council meeting in June, and the G-7 summit. In the first of these meetings the realization of Jacques Delors' white paper will be discussed and the new president of the Union's Commission will be chosen. In Naples, where Italy is playing host to the leaders of the world's major industrialized nations, careful attention will be paid to the issue concerning the treaty of friendship with Russia, and the summit will be the occasion to consolidate our country's role in the world as well as its tried and tested diplomatic skills. Senators, respect for our country's republican traditions and values cannot be unjustly used to hinder the process of deep change and renewal that our people urgently and passionately demand from us. The citizens have every right in the world to demand this from their representatives in the government. For years institutions and political parties were the same thing. Laws and civil servants -- starting from the cabinet -- were totally controlled by the forces which, under the old proportional system, represented the country. It has quite rightly been said that parties must step back today, while maintaining the role assigned to them by the constitution. I can add that we must move from the government of parties to the government of institutions. We are lucky because those who wrote the constitution devised a process to introduce any kind of change, provided they do not affect the state's form and the nation's unity. We must carefully follow that process. One of the main characteristics of the majority which has created the new cabinet can be seen by everybody: The forces which support this government are together not because of some alliance decided by the parties, but because they have received a direct mandate from voters. What we called the Freedom Alliance was an alliance for the elections which has now become a government coalition with a clear mandate from the citizens. [passage omitted] We now have to take a step: We must return the power to public institutions, starting with parliament. We must re-create a strong respect for the state and respect for the cabinet. We must repeat that private associations, parties, and movements have an essential role to play. But this role is clearly different from the role played by those in charge of the administration of public assets and those who are in the cabinet. In this framework, it is very important to have a correct, competitive, and loyal relationship with the Left and Center. [passage omitted] I have to be very frank with the secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left who said that he wants to oppose the government democratically and within the limits of the constitution. He called this cabinet a government which humiliates Italy. This is not a good start. [applause] This is the country's legitimate government, freely chosen by the voters and led by me, chosen by the head of state. To call it humiliating is a gratuitous insult to the prestige and honor of the country. [applause] [passage omitted] The presence in the cabinet of ministers belonging to the National Alliance cannot be used as an excuse for a campaign of defamation. [passage omitted] The opposition not only has the right but also the duty to prepare -- with all its forces and also with all the tricks of the trade it knows -- an alternative to this government. But it has no right whatsoever to pursue the goal of stopping the country from having a government. [applause] Senators, the government's economic program has as its first goal the broadening of the country's productive base and the creation of new jobs. Prosperity and happiness in this country will first of all depend on the country's ability to give to citizens of all ages -- and to the young in particular -- a decent job and wage. Businessmen and the fantastic network of small and medium enterprises which created wealth in this country -- in the fields of agriculture, industry, and trade -- want to be helped to conquer new markets again, to be able to be competitive and to increase productivity in order to create new jobs. All the parties I spoke to while forming this cabinet told me that the creation of new jobs is a hard but possible task and that the fulfillment of this task must absolutely follow economic and social recovery after years of stagnation. We must control inflation and we must act to control and reduce public debt. This means that there is little scope for new public spending. [passage omitted] One thing is certain: State bonds cannot be written off in any case whatsoever. The public savings belonging to people who put their trust in the state cannot be damaged. The government knows very well that recovery will not be sustainable without deep and sharp action on public spending. This is what the financial markets demand, and this is what is required to slow down the growth of public debt. This is also a necessary condition if we want to participate in the process of European integration and it is a condition for the long-term fall of interest rates and for the resumption of private investments. [passage omitted] A modern state, a big industrial nation -- deeply rooted in West Europe and wide open to the world -- has many resources, often hidden by the figures relating to the public sector. The government and the ruling class must use these resources in order to induce growth. This is the main task of a liberal government. This is the the government's objective. There is an Italy of the private sector -- both in the production and service sectors -- which can and must be encouraged to stand on its own feet. [passage omitted] We must change a lot and free the private sector from oppressive obstacles, from the weight of a suffocating bureaucracy, from a tax burden which has become too heavy too quickly and which has proved to be a burden for those who create wealth and useless for the state's finances. [passage omitted] The Greens in Italy have not yet become -- in spite of the importance and appeal of their ideas -- as important as in other European countries. However, this government thinks that the research and proposals made by the Greens over all these years must be used by the government as part of its policy. [passage omitted] A fundamental part of our program concerns the structure of public and private health care. This is a very sensitive area for Italians. Citizens know that too much is being spent and that it is being spent badly. There is a great deal of chaos and the inefficiency of services is a permanent slur on the right to health care. It is urgent that managers run hospitals and that the health care system is made more efficient and competitive. We all feel bound to keep this promise, this undertaking, without any reservations. We undertake, within the first 100 days of this government -- in the first stage of our program -- to unveil our legislative proposals for reducing the tax burden on companies which create real, new, jobs, for making it possible to hire workers on a names basis; for making it possible for companies with between three and 15 employees to hire directly; for modifying training contracts so that they present more of an incentive to companies; for introducing temporary work contracts and modifying the previous government's proposals, for introducing norms which make it possible to set working hours and create part time jobs, above all for women, as well as other measures which increase flexibility in the workplace; for revising norms concerning public contracts in order to avoid the continuation of the freeze on public administration contracts. The government undertakes to speed up the process of privatizing state companies, starting with INA, STET, ENEL and ENI; to remove the tax on incomes of less than 10 million lire -- also to meet the expectations of millions of senior citizens, who have the right to be protected and to have the purchasing power of their incomes safeguarded, safeguarded -- and to introduce tax incentives to stimulate investment, especially in small and medium-sized companies. [passage omitted] The government's priorites will be to reduce the number of laws, using regulations and other administrative instruments wherever this is possible, to simplify direct and indirect taxation, and to run the public administration keeping in mind the needs and interests of the citizens, on whom the nation is built and society's affluence based, and who should not be the enemies or victims of bureaucracy. [passage omitted] The system of guarantees safeguarding the interests of citizens in all areas will be confirmed and strengthened, from the administration of justice to information, a sector -- especially as far as concerns radio and television -- which must be assured of a market comprising a qualified public presence alongside a variety of other operators. This government wants to bring morality to public life. This work has been undertaken by brave judges, by press and sectors of the political and social world. This is a government of irreproachable people, who respect the laws and moral code of public life. [applause] This government will not question the independence of the judiciary. The penal system will be supported so that those pending investigations of suspected of corruption will be held in an atmosphere of civilized law and respect for all laws by the Justice Ministry, the judges, and those representing the plaintiffs and the defendants. The government's first task is to guarantee order and public safety so that citizens' lives are respected and safeguarded. In this area my predecessors' record is far from negative. Organized crime and the Mafia remain a danger and a cause for alarm, and it would be suicidal to lower our guard now. A long season of civil reawakening, which has visited public institutions and society -- all of society, but especially in the South -- has had extraordinary results. The Mafia has been recognized for what it is -- a single, organized criminal organization with historical and social roots which are difficult to destroy without a collective effort on the part of the state and the public. Alongside the work of many honest judges, of many police officers, Carabinieri, and of the Armed Forces, are the committed protest movements which have raised their voices against crime and the Mafia. The question of the often ambiguous and always insidious links between Mafia and politcs, between organized crime and the parties, has been tackled head on. This country can boast of and is honored by what has been done in the war against crime without prejudicing freedom or constitutional rights. In common with every other area, there are still serious problems which must be solved. The legal authorities and the judicial police must be supplied with improved instruments with which to operate, investigating judges must be properly equipped, and all judges must be guaranteed their independence and peace of mind. At the same time, according to various sources, including the best informed sectors of the legal world, it would be opportune to revise the legislation concerning cooperation the law, known as the supergrass phenomenon. On this matter, the government bows to a fundamental principle: It will not do anything to weaken the capacity to cooperate or to corrode criminal organizations from within, but it will actively operate to prevent the supergrass phenomenon from becoming a flagrant violation of rights. Among others, two great Italian judges gave their lives in the battle for law against the Mafia, and in their name -- the names are Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino [applause] -- the government feels obliged to continue this work. [applause] The problem of a conflict of interest in government has quite rightly been raised, sometimes fairly and at other times with a touch of spite and to score all too obvious political points, insofar as the head of this government is a businessman. It is our belief, beyond the only too obvious considerations, that the prime minister is fully aware of his role as the guardian of public interest, and that Italy has a strong system of checks and balances. There is the head of state, with whom we have a relationship based on trust and to whom we send our respectful regards; the anti-trust authority; the publishing watchdog; the judiciary, the collective nature of the Council of Ministers and its decision-making procedures; and, of course, the special role of the opposition. Turning to the strengthening of some of these powers, which still lack official sanction, in its first sitting the Council of Ministers has already decided to set up a committee of experts who by the end of September will be called upon to make proposals which we will undertake to transform into draft laws. The government asks, above all in this area, that it be judged on its deeds and not on the basis of preconceived ideas. On the other hand, we must point out that everything is possible as far as checking conflicting interests, apart from one thing: You cannot establish that a businessman does not have the same political rights as all other citizens. [applause] There is nothing in the constitution or the legal system of this country which casts even the slightest doubt on the legitimacy of the formation of this government or on the task of leading it which the head of state has given me. [passage omitted] Today there are conditions for a real change, to give new breath to the great love and passion for freedom which for centuries has fuelled our highest and most serious political and civic life -- the state. The state has no other ideology but that of tolerance and the most honest rejection of any form of racism, of anti-Semitism, of xenophobia. It has the duty to respect all minorities, including the ethnic minorities, to attain a balance in its relationship with the different religious beliefs. These are principles and values which we reaffirm with conviction because we are against all forms of intolerance and discrimination and are aware of the dangers lurking behind any form of anti-Semitism, historically the most odious form of discrimination in Europe but not the only one, of defining one's neighbor as the enemy. With the Catholic church, beyond the Concordat, there is a relationship of coexistence and collaboration. I take advantage of this opportunity to wish His Holiness Pope John Paul II, a pope who has done much for freedom and peace in the world, my heartfelt hopes for a speedy recovery. [applause] The task of building a freer Italy belongs to everyone, to the lay Italians and to the Catholic Italians, of which I am one. It is a task to be carried out starting from the most extraordinary social institution which recent times has produced -- education open to all. [passage omitted] Today everybody, or nearly everybody, says they are liberal democrats. This is triumph of which we ought to be proud. If words have any meaning, this means that the power of the state should put a barrier, a limit, coinciding with the sphere of indvidual rights. When a citizen ends up by depending for his own survival on professional politicians and bureaucracy, then it becomes useless to talk of freedom. When an excessive part of earned or saved income is confiscated by the bureaucracy without being put into necessary and defective services, then the limits of power are breached and beyond the intentions an illiberal government is born. [applause] Without haste, without trauma, with cautious gradualness, the government intends to work so that the tax system gets only the amount compatible with absolute collective needs, returning overpayments and therefore giving greater freedom. What will become of the social welfare state if too much is asked of the traditional social services in crises? What will become of solidarity? My personal reply and that of the government on this matter is not unequivocal. Austerity implies eliminating social benefits of the past because progressive degeneration has led to an impoverishment of the whole of society which is an inefficient and deceptive reflection of social solidarity. But this should coincide with a new beginning of a policy of real solidarity counting on effective and decisive support for the weakest sectors, for the less protected, for those who live in real conditions of marginalization and suffering and poverty, which constitute a daily affront to modern society. [applause] If I were to say what the final legacy of our government would be, I would say that this would be demonstrating that a freer society can be a more solid society, more coherent, and that there is no need for a sullen government, which is a stranger to the lives of our people, to carry out the aims of autonomy for the individual and communities. And it is with this spirit, and without any other meaning, that the government has decided to set up a minister for the family. [applause] We will work with parliament, in a constructive dialogue with the opposition, on a program, approved by the political majority in the country. It is our constitutional duty. We will attempt to discharge it with dignity and with compassion. The government is aware of the fact that there is a disparity in the balance between the two houses of parliament, with a different distribution of seats. The government believes that it will work to respect the autonomy of the opposition. Only an open and loyal dialogue based on mutual effort and mutual recognition of values can produce what the country is waiting for and what it needs -- a government of change, a working government that enjoys the confidence of parliament and a phase of political stability in which the majority and opposition play their different but complementary roles. On this point we are open to a dialogue with the opposition, in particular with the Center, which evolves from the tradition of Christian populism. To renounce this role would be an act of pure irresponsibility to the country. From this point of view I have no difficulty in asking even the opposition, and independent senators, for a vote of confidence which will represent respect for the needs of the government and not necesarily as a political credit for the team I have the honor to lead. Finally, allow me to remind you, Mr. Speaker and senators, of the real spirit fuelling the coalition, the government, I have the honor to lead. Ours is a country of extraordinary vitality, capable of miraculous leaps which surprise the world, and joie de vivre. For some time difficulties in political life, the crisis in the ruling class, and a certain atmosphere of mistrust have introduced into Italy a certain amount of universal pessimism and skepticism which risks turning into a subtle and lethal poison. Our aim is to overturn this situation. Our focus is on the people who, having more experience of life and its harshness than of palace politics, still know that the institutions and the state are the mirror of society. Even I, as others before me, have had a dream -- the dream of complete openness and returning to society, from which so many new parliamentarians and ministers come, that impulse, vitality and creativity which are the real great genetic heritage of the Italian people. [applause] To reach this goal the prime minister needs your help and support for the government but the country also has a strong, and I would say desperate, need to again find its strong will and stubborness, its taste for challenge and exploring new things, the pleasure of dislodging, wherever they might be, the bad temptations of fear, envy, and factiousness. My government aim remains that which made me take up politics and the civic duty of challenge. I believe in a great collective enterprise, in a great adventure which has need of fire and moral faith. I believe that it is possible to dream with eyes wide open of the reality that is coming -- the future. I believe that we will be able to build a more just Italy, a more generous and more solicitous Italy toward those who need it and those who suffer, a more modern and efficient Italy, more prosperous and calm, more orderly and safer. I am absolutely convinced that with the help of God and man we will manage it. Thank you. [applause]
