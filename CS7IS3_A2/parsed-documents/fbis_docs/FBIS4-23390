The call was made in a communique issued at the end of a meeting attended by 348 members. The 11 June deadline was chosen because it is the eve of the first anniversary of the 12 June 1993 presidential elections annulled by the military. The results of these elections are expected to be announced and the winner sworn into office to form a broad-based national government, the communique stated. It also indicated that the number of delegates at the meeting was sufficient for the necessary quorum to be attained. "The meeting came to the irrevocable conclusion that the current military junta lacks the necessary spirit or wisdom to move the country forward," the communique added.
