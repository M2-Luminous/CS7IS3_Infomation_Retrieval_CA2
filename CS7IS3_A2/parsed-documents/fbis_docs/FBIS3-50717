The enemies of Cuba miscalculated. Those who dreamt of our collapse see us taller today. Those who wished for our downfall do not know the immense good fortune of having a free fatherland. Those who forecasted our death cannot stand to see us brimming with life. We are the fruits of a tree with deep roots in the earth of our patriotism. The true child of a people of Mambises is not born a traitor. Forty-eight hours before his death, Camila said that the values and pride of the Cuban people are today as high and solid as the invincible peak of the Turquino. And it is here that the invincible values and pride of Cubans arise today, to the highest point in Cuba, to ratify with Camilo that it will be easier for us to stop breathing the pure air of the Sierra than to relinquish a principle, than to bend a knee to imperialism, than to compromise a single revolutionary ideal, than to be disloyal to the fatherland, to socialism, the Revolution, and Fidel. We have arisen with Cuba since 1868 and will continue to rise for her for all times. These are times for rising up to confront all difficulties and preserving with our actions the fatherland's past, which is now once again our present, a more beautiful present because it is the time to preserve our dreams, the memory of so many heroic lives, so much blood that fertilized the idea. Thank you, Mambises, for teaching us to fight without surrender. Thank you, Mella, for having left us your great love for the party you founded. Thank you, Guevara, for your genuine lesson for the 21st century. Thank you, Celia, for your permanent presence, together with Marti, on this peak. Thank you, Fidel, for this daily lesson in Cuban revolutionary spirit. Peaceful rest for our dead, for whom it will not be necessary to raise their arms in defense of our fatherland because it will never be torn to bits. Viva forever the dead -- our happiness. [Crowd: Viva!] Eternal life to our party, our revolutionary slogans, our socialism, and our fatherland. Invincible commander of all times: Here we are. Onward! This is also the generation of the centennial. Viva the 35th anniversary of the Revolution! [Crowd: Viva!] Viva the people of Cuba! [Crowd: Viva!] Viva the party! [Crowd: Viva!] Viva Fidel! [Crowd: Viva!] Socialism! [Crowd: or death!] Fatherland or death! [Crowd: We will win!]
