The sources added that the issues that will be raised in this context include ways of combating insects that cause losses to farmers in the Ghawr region, making use of the power linkage networks in the region, as well as banking and trade issues. The talks are also expected to address the impact of the PLO-Israeli Paris economic accord on the economic agreement between Jordan and the Palestinian side and its possible impact on the memorandum of understanding between Jordan and Israel on economic affairs. Political observers noted that the talks come in the wake of a series of contacts and meetings conducted last month between Jordanian and Israeli officials in several European capitals, including London. Sources have asserted that a senior Israeli official met officials in the Jordanian Government and discussed with them economic issues, as well as the border and water issues. The Israeli side said it was willing to hold border negotiations on the basis of Resolutions 242 and 338. Informed sources also said Syria has warned Jordan against holding bilateral negotiations with Israel on the water question, since it is a vital issue that concerns Syria as well. Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, the deputy prime minister, visited Damascus recently and held direct talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad.
