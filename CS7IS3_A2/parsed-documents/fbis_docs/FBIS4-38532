The statement was circulated following the recent assassination attempt against Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev. In Chechnya any terrorist act may trigger off civil war with unpredictable consequences, the statement underlined. The opposition described the assassination attempt as a result of the criminal policy of the Chechen leadership from the very beginning aimed at linking up with criminal structures. This proves that the leadership can exercise no real influence on the situation which encourages different armed groups seeking power. As a rule, such groups have no social support and resort to terrorism, the statement said.
