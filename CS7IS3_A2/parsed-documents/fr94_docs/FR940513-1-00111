FR940513-1-00111 FR940513-1-00022 Of particular concern to the CLAC was the lack of sufficient and relevant data to support comprehensive review of existing HOs or findings that certain contemporary occupations, processes, machinery and worksites are particularly hazardous for employment of youths under age 18, or detrimental to their health or well-being. The lack of comprehensive statistics on minors injured in the workplace has been a longstanding concern of the Department. Historically, some limited information was generated, largely from secondary sources and statistical records from the few States that compiled worker compensation data, to support the case for each of the existing HOs. Fundamental to some of the existing HOs (e.g., HO 15, shipbreaking), however, was the notion that work found to be particularly hazardous or detrimental to the health and well-being of adult workers would be injurious to minor workers. To address this concern, the Department is continuing its efforts to develop reliable youth injury statistics through enhancements of information reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). BLS is redesigning its Occupational Safety and Health Statistical reporting system to collect more comprehensive work-related injury and illness data on all workers, including young workers. This new system, the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, will collect information from about 280,000 establishments from a sampling frame of approximately six million establishments. The new survey will include data by occupation, age, gender, race, and length of service with details on, among other things, the nature of the injury/illness, the part of body affected, the primary and secondary sources of the injury/illness, and the event or exposure leading to the injury/illness. BLS has developed another major safety and health data reporting system with its Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries program. This data base includes information on fatally injured workers (industry, occupation, age, sex, and race) and the fatal events (nature of the injury and how it happened). The Department believes that such injury data is essential to support ongoing comprehensive and systematic reviews of occupations, processes, machinery, and worksites which are particularly hazardous for workers under 18 years of age, or detrimental to their health or well-being. While such data will enhance the Department's ability to pinpoint patterns of injuries and illness by various characteristics, i.e., problems areas, specific information about workplaces, processes, and machines causing injuries or illness must still be identified, e.g., data can indicate that a ``machine'' was the object which produced injuries in a particular industry, but specific information on the type of machine and/or its peculiar characteristics may continue to be a key part of HO determinations. The Department's review of State child labor laws supports the view of the CLAC that the existing HOs need to be revisited and that contemporary circumstances may warrant new or different protections for minors under the age of 18. The standards in those States that regulate employment under age 18 prohibit employment on certain types of machines, in work involving hazardous substances, in hazardous locations, in dangerous occupations, and in specific industries. While specific prohibitions vary widely among these States, a significant number of States have promulgated work prohibitions in areas of particular interest to the Department: At least nine States (Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, and Washington) prohibit exposure to carcinogenic, corrosive or toxic substances; a number of States (Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, and Pennsylvania) prohibit work on electric apparatus or wiring; four States (Illinois, North Dakota, Washington and Wisconsin) now prohibit exposure to body fluids and infectious agents; and several States (Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Minnesota, and Washington) place restrictions on work above specified heights. Further, the Department is aware of Congressional interest in the updating of workplace protections for minors under the age of 18. The bills referred to above, H.R. 1106 and S. 86, would direct the Secretary of Labor to find and declare HOs prohibiting the employment of minors in poultry processing, fish and seafood processing, and in the handling of pesticides. In addition, H.R. 1106 would, among other things, eliminate any exemption from the motor vehicle operation prohibition in HO 2 except for driving by a 17-year-old that is ``secondary and incidental'' to the minor's main occupation; and expressly apply HO 10 to restaurants and fast food establishments. While the Department is interested in obtaining public comment on any modifications, deletions, clarifications, or other changes that may be appropriate in existing HOs, and any areas of work that should be addressed by new HOs, public comment is specifically invited on the appropriateness and feasibility of the following:
