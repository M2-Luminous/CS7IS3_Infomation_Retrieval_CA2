Clinton said: Over the past year, with Vietnam's cooperation, the United States has made "major and substantial progress" [zhong da de shi zhi xing jin zhan 6850 1129 4104 1395 6347 1840 6651 1455] in finding American MIAs from the Vietnam war. Therefore, the best way to ensure Vietnam's continued cooperation is to "end the trade embargo" against Vietnam. He said the United States will continue to work to find out the whereabouts of those American servicemen who are still missing. Before Clinton made the announcement, he discussed the matter with family members of some American MIAs. Some American Vietnam war veterans organizations and family members of MIAs had asked President Clinton not to lift the trade embargo before the whereabouts of all American MIAs are known. Clinton also announced that he has decided to establish a liaison office in Vietnam to "provide services for Americans" in Vietnam and to "help us to pursue a human rights dialogue with the Vietnamese Government." But, he expressly pointed out that "these actions do not constitute a normalization of our relationships." Before our relations can be normalized, "we must have more progress, more cooperation, and more answers." To achieve this goal, Clinton said he will "send another high-level U.S. delegation to Vietnam" "this spring." Clinton's announcement of lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam immediately met with welcome from U.S. enterprise circles. Some people from U.S. enterprise circles have held that Vietnam is a new hot market and said Clinton's decision will open up a new channel for U.S. exports and investment.
