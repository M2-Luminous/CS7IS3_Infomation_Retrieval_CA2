[Shetrit] I believe there are several common aspects. You are a democratic country; so is Israel. You respect your religion, but are secular at the same time. We also respect our religion and we are a secular society. The policies of both countries are western-oriented. You support the free market economy based on social justice, and so do we. I believe that we can cooperate successfully on the basis of these common characteristics. There is a potential for great cooperation between our countries. The current volume of bilateral trade of $250 million is not sufficient. This year's reciprocal tourist activities will add another $200 million to this figure. Hundreds of thousands of Israeli tourists are visiting Turkey. This is an indication of the Israeli people's confidence in Turkey and in the Turkish economy. I am also very positive on this matter. [Gokce] Could you give more details about the areas of cooperation you mention? [Shetrit] For example, cooperation can be undertaken in various areas on the basis of a triangular model to be established among Turkey, Israel, and the Palestinians within the framework of the Palestinian autonomy project. I am hopeful about the trade talks to be held in July. Moreover, I am also optimistic about the future of bilateral relations. [Gokce] How do you view the future of the Peace Water Project? [Shetrit] There is plenty of water in Turkey. The Middle East, however, has meager water resources. I am convinced that your abundant waters will one day reach the region in order to solve the sensitive water problem in the Middle East.
