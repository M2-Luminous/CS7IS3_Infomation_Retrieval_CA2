On his return home, he held a news conference on 1 March, and, speaking in fairly high spirits, Saito said: "In front of American manufacturers, I denounced in strong terms their inappropriate law suits against Japan for dumping iron and steel products." On the issue of setting macroeconomic targets to help reduce the trade surplus -- which the Japanese Government rejected -- Saito reiterated that "he, personally, thought such targets should be presented." Saito seemed to be satisfied with the results of the meeting, which was attended by senior executives of American and European steel makers. He said: "Some of the participants from Europe and the United States supported our assertion." Saito reportedly handed out copies of his draft speech to the U.S. Commerce Department and other agencies in an effort to win the understanding of U.S. Government officials on the stand taken by Japanese makers. Since an antidumping tax is imposed on surface-treated steel plates, one of the main Japanese steel plate products, such plates are no longer exported to the United States. At the Washington conference, Saito said: "Since the United States itself decided that Japan was doing nothing wrong in its export of heat-stretched and cold-drawn steel plates, we have resumed the export of these products. Although the market conditions for these products is on the advance now, slow changes have been seen in the prices of surface-treated steel plates." Saito's comments revealed that he believes the charges against Japanese makers of dumping are simply groundless. It is questionable, however, as to how far Saito's arguments have affected the American steel industry. And Chairman Saito himself was not so sure about the effects, because he appeared to be trying to convince himself when he said: "Without giving up our hopes, we must take advantage of such opportunities to speak out."
