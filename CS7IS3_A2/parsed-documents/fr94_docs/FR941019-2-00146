FR941019-2-00146 FR941019-2-00081 Second, there is little danger that the court and the parties will be inundated by a flood of hypertechnical disputes about know-how and confidentiality claims. Once the burden of proof is placed upon Pilkington_where it obviously belongs, coupled with the requirement that a detailed specification of the basis of the claim be prepared and shared with the accused party, the era of generalized and vague allegations of impropriety and veiled threats of litigation will finally end. Indeed, there is every likelihood that the dispute resolution mechanism would need to be used perhaps only once, to initially and definitively clear the air regarding the usual litany of Pilkington allegations of impropriety by U.S. NON-LICENSEES. Once the U.S. NON-LICENSEE passed its initial litmus test, there is little likelihood that Pilkington would have much stomach for insisting upon rematches, and the U.S. NON-LICENSEE would be free to immediately enter the market place and would do so. Apart from the sui generis Muliaglass situation, the Pilkington cartel, aided by various U.S. LICENSEES and others, has succeeded in preventing every effort by U.S. NON-LICENSEES from entering the float process technology market, all of which entrenches the myth that Pilkington, by virtue of divine right, is the exclusive worldwide source of such technology. In sum, once the Pilkington canards about know-how rights and confidentiality are exposed for the empty shells they are, as ITC is confident they would be by the proposed procedure, the walls of the cartel will finally crumble and the forces of competition will finally prevail. Conclusion ITC recognizes that the proposed decree is the product of considerable negotiations between the Department and Pilkington and that to press Pilkington further in hopes of achieving the additional relief described above may jeopardize the deal. So be it. The Antitrust Division has rarely been exposed to a cartel with the reach, longevity and anti-competitive consequences of the Pilkington cartel. The evidence of willfulness and of liability, as we both know, is unusually rich and unambiguous. The world business community, upon whom the Antitrust Division quite properly devotes considerable time and public resources in order to both demonstrate the commitment of the U.S. government to aggressive enforcement of the U.S. antitrust laws and the important public benefits to be derived therefrom, has long been aware of Pilkington and its success in creating and maintaining its worldwide cartel. Thus, should the Division lack the tenacity and commitment to principle to insist that the decree be amended in order to meaningfully eradicate this particularly pernicious, long-lived cartel, the message received by the many observers of the antitrust scene will be most unfortunate. That message, however unfair from your perspective, is that the Antitrust Division lacks the will to litigate potentially protracted cases, preferring instead to settle for the appearance of progress by accepting what has been characterized as a ``sleeves off the vest'' type of decree. At some point, in some case, the Department must demonstrate that this message is incorrect; that in the appropriate circumstances, the Division will litigate aggressively and fearlessly in order to fully vindicate the public interest. ITC submits that the Pilkington case_should Pilkington be unwilling to renegotiate the decree to satisfy the concerns expressed above_is the perfect vehicle for the Division to use for this purpose and ITC urges it to do so.
