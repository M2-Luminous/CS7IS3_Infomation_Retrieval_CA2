However, SNS Chairman Jan Slota ruled out cooperation with the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) led by Jan Carnogursky, with ethnic Hungarian parties or the Democratic Left Party (SDL) of Peter Weiss. "I intentionally did not name Cernak's followers," Slota stressed, referring to the National Democratic Party (NDS) of Ludovit Cernak. According to Slota, the NDS, a faction which split from the SNS, "is not a political entity." Reacting to NDS representatives' participation in the KDH's open election list of candidates, Slota stated that this was the "alliance between the devil and the angel". "The strength of freemasons is immense and whole of Western Europe is in their grip," he added, referring to the KDH.
