Japanese flat glass makers have done all they could to promote fair competition while their U.S. counterparts' efforts to do business in this country have been insufficient, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said. Citing the latest poll on Japanese wholesalers of flat glass, MITI said 11.4 percent of those polled handle imported flat glass, an increase from 5.7 percent in the previous June 1993 survey. The data does not necessarily suggest that the remaining 88.6 percent or 303 firms are reluctant to import foreign-made flat glass, MITI said, noting that most responded they had no records of buying foreign products just because they have not received any inquiries from foreign makers. Of the 303 wholesalers, only 74 reported having had contact from foreign firms whose efforts were described as limited by 53 wholesalers in failing to progress beyond exchanging greetings or sending direct mail, MITI said. The survey was conducted from November through December 1993 with 385 wholesalers belonging to the nationwide flat glass wholesalers' group. Of the total, 342 responded. A MITI official said the survey was conducted to check the openness of Japan's flat glass market following the enforcement of a variety of market-opening measures after then U.S. President George Bush's visit to Japan in January 1992. Based on the "Tokyo Declaration on the U.S.-Japan Global Partnership" signed during Bush's Japan visit, MITI formulated an antitrust program for Japan's three major flat glass makers, encouraged users to step up imports and encouraged greater efforts by foreign makers, the official said. The U.S. often describes Japan's flat glass distribution system as exclusive of imports but Washington's "distorted perception" of the Japanese market as closed should be rectified, the official said. The MITI official said Japan's top glass maker Asahi Glass Co. has scrapped shady pricing systems and "a progressive rebate system," a practice that has drawn foreign criticism as exclusionary by promoting wholesale buying only from a single maker. The two other major glass makers also unveiled a plan to abolish these practices from April, the official said. In the latest survey, 30 of 39 wholesalers that handle foreign products cited further qualitative improvement as a top condition for increasing purchases from foreign companies in the future. In contrast, only three of the 39 firms cited quality as a reason for handling foreign products. Japan's flat glass imports from the U.S. surged 27 percent in 1993, the official said. Imports could rise in the future if foreign makers improved quality, prices and delivery, the official said.
