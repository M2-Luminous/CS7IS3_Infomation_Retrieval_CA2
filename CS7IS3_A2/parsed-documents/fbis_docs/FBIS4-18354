[Iliescu] It is true that during the past two years foreign factors encouraged the elements of dispute in the region instead of promoting dialogue toward achieving a peaceful settlement. We believe, and so does Greece, that the solution to the crisis cannot be achieved by force. This is interpreted to mean that neither the path of military intervention nor embargoes are acceptable solutions; instead of settling things they complicate the situation even more and can only lead to a deteriorated situation. So, the only way to a settlement is by promoting political solutions between the negotiating parties that are involved in the crisis. After all, one should not forget that these communities have coexisted for decades; they withstood German pressure and, in certain cases, jointly resisted the Germans. [passage omitted] We welcome efforts such as those exerted recently by the United States and the European Union [EU] to persuade the conflicting sides to find a path to a dialogue that can lead to a political solution. [Polikhroniadhou] Does the dispatch of Turkish Blue Helmets contribute toward the peaceful settlement you have mentioned? [Iliescu] No, because the dispatch of troops violates the principle of nonparticipation of bordering states. The official position not only of Romania and Greece but also of the United Nations is that bordering states should not be used. Such a dispatch would be harmful primarily now when some steps are being made toward a dialogue and relaxation of the crisis. However, we see that the United Nations "has frozen" this dispatch and we hope that this will be its final decision. [Polikhroniadhou] During the current critical times that the Balkans are passing through, some quarters talk about the promotion of Muslim arrows and circles that aim at striking against Orthodoxy. Do you agree with such conjectures? [Iliescu] No, all this merely intensifies nationalistic stress. I do not believe it is a question of Orthodox, Catholic, or Muslim states. Why is Poland, which is a Catholic country, facing huge problems? Why is the same also happening in Hungary? The whole of Europe is now facing a lot of problems with the increasing economic crisis, unemployment, and inflation. So, let some quarters not hurry to oversimplify their judgments. [passage omitted] [Polikhroniadhou] On your country's accession to the EU, what are the prospects and what do you expect from the EU's Greek presidency? [Iliescu] My country recently managed to overcome the prejudices that many Western countries had about it by signing the Partnership for Peace agreement with NATO, which took place last year, and the recent Romanian-IMF agreements. Today, many foreign analysts agree that Romania will play an extremely interesting role in the region. This is because Romania has natural resources, which under government guidance can be utilized exceptionally; its geographic position also allows Romania to play the role of a link between Europe and the Middle East. Concerning our accession to the EU, we are on a good path because promising conditions have been created for Romania's integration into Europe and the development of its relations with all European Community [as published] countries. We express our satisfaction for the support of Greece, which is now holding the presidency, and believe there will be positive developments. [Polikhroniadhou] With regard to the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue, what is your view? [Iliescu] We consider your country's position as reasonable. Your country does not have any claims against this republic and respects the will of this newly established state to exist as a sovereign entity. We also consider as positive your country's stance on assisting this state's economic development so that it will become viable. So, as long as Greece has crystal-clear positions and good intentions toward this state, the latter should also have equally clear positions and not express some tendencies against the status of the existing borders. Relations of mutual trust that safeguard the existence of good-neighborliness should be achieved through dialogue. [Polikhroniadhou] Some quarters claim that some powers, by strengthening [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov's intransigence, aim at destabilizing the region. [Iliescu] I do not believe there are such interests. I do not understand what the prolonged preservation of a conflict in this region would serve. It could have only negative results for everyone. On the contrary, I believe the interests of both the United States and the European countries should be directed toward resolving this dispute, something that would lead to stability in the region.
