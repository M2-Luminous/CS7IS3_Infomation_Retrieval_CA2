The meeting pointed out: It is necessary for us to firmly grasp the fundamental guidelines of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to closely revolve our efforts around the central task of economic construction; to subordinate ourselves to and serve the overall situation of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability; to fulfill the tasks of the propaganda and ideological front in an all-round way; and to provide an effective ideological guarantee and a favorable environment of public opinion for accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic system, for promoting sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development in Tibet [cu jin wo qu guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan], for maintaining Tibet's social and political stability, unity among nationalities, and unification of the motherland, and for expediting Tibet's sweeping social and economic progress. Deputy Secretary Danzim of the autonomous regional party committee presided over the conference. Lieque, Buqiong, (Lu Huimin), and Puqung, leaders of the autonomous region, attended the conference. Du Tai, executive deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Party Committee, delivered a concluding speech. He pointed out: The regional conference on propaganda and ideological work is a meeting that has a bearing on the overall situation held at a crucial moment of Tibet's reform, opening up, and economic development. It is a meeting held by the autonomous regional party committee to stress the persistence in grasping two links at the same time and the mobilization of the whole party to step up propaganda and improve ideological work to provide a more effective ideological guarantee and a more favorable environment of public opinion for reform, development, and stability. Through the meeting, we gained a clearer understanding of the situation; reached a consensus; improved our understanding; enhanced our vigor; boosted our confidence; acquired a clearer understanding of the role played by propaganda and ideological work; further defined the fundamental guidelines and main tasks of propaganda and ideological work; gained a clearer understanding of the responsibility and mission shouldered by ourselves; and boosted our confidence in doing a good job of propaganda and ideological work. Du Tai said: Propaganda and ideological work have always played an important role since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. They are mainly manifested in the fact that every time people's minds were emancipated to a great extent, such emancipation invariably promoted great development of the productive forces and sweeping social progress. It fully proves that the more efforts we make to carry out reform and open up, the more necessary it is for us to improve propaganda and ideological work. Now is a crucial moment for us to deepen reform, open up wider, and accelerate economic development. Both the central authorities and regional party committee proposed new tasks for and set new demands on propaganda and ideological work. We must promote propaganda and ideological work to a new level by making fruitful efforts so as to better serve the drive to deepen reform and accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economic system. All the fundamental guidelines, basic principles, and ideas and overall arrangements for the tasks of propaganda and ideological work have been clearly defined for the present and for a certain period of time to come. What counts now is that we must conscientiously have a thorough understanding of and carry out the guidelines of the conference, do solid work, and pay close attention to implementation. Du Tai pointed out: If we want to comprehensively fulfill the tasks of the propaganda and ideological front and to promote the work to a new level, we must further emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, and follow the road of reform and opening up. Meanwhile, in compliance with the requirements raised by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, we must arm the people with scientific theory, use correct public opinion to guide them, use noble spirit to mold them, and inspire them with excellent works [of literature and art]. This is an important mission and a glorious responsibility entrusted to us by the new period. Only thus can we correctly propagandize the party's theories, line, principles, and policies, and give prominence to the keynote of our times. To practically succeed in implementing the guidelines of the conference, Du Tai stressed: The party committees and governments at all levels must further improve their understanding; treat the comprehensive implementation of the guidelines of the conference as an important matter; practically pay close attention to their successful implementation; draw up and perfect various measures; and successfully handle the tasks to be done now and in the future in a down-to-earth manner. They must treat the successful handling of propaganda and ideological work in agricultural and pastoral areas as the main point for improving propaganda and ideological work in Tibet, and handle it accordingly. They must strengthen the building of contingents of personnel; they must raise the level of propaganda and ideological work; they must improve cadres' training and education; and they must continuously enhance the political integrity as well as professional proficiency of cadres engaged in propaganda and ideological work. If cadres want to be qualified for propaganda and ideological work, they must have a strong sense of responsibility for and dedication to a revolution; unswervingly adhere to the party's basic line; maintain close ties with the masses; uphold materialist dialectics; have a keen political sense, remain sober-minded, and take a clear-cut stand; maintain unity with the CPC Central Committee in ideology and in action; and provide an effective ideological guarantee and a favorable environment of public opinion for Tibet's social stability and economic development.
