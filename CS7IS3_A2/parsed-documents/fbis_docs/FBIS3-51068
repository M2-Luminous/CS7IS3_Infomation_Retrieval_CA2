At the same time, he alerted his troops and ordered them to mobilize toward the different security areas bordering Colombian territory. The GN's decision is due to the recent increase of border problems, and according to the GN high command, there is no quick solution in sight. Apparently, Colombian authorities are not willing to cooperate in finding solutions to the problem. On the contrary, they have accused the GN of raiding their territory, thereby violating, according to their story, their territorial integrity. What occurred three days ago is the best example. On Friday, at approximately 1200, a GN commission was implementing an intensified border patrol program in the southwest region when their aircraft, a Bell Ranger 212 helicopter with registration No. GN-8008, was downed by a group of Colombian rebels. Nevertheless, the Colombian authorities accused the GN of violating their airspace. According to the Venezuelan aircraft pilots' story, GN Commander Manuel Bompart Pinango and GN Major Jesus Lozano Guanipa, accompanied by six soldiers -- one of whom was wounded, 2d Corporal Yasmin Jaimes Canas -- were patrolling the security strip. Suddenly, Colombian guerrillas moving about in Venezuelan territory attacked the unit. The missiles hit the tail rotor forcing the aircraft to crash to the ground, thereby destroying the equipment. Fortunately, no human lives were lost. The rebels' attack took place exactly 500 meters from Hato El Tormento and approximately 10 km from the border checkpoint El Cututi on the banks of the Arauca River. Given this case as well as others on other occasions, the GN high commanders believe the border problem with Colombia is becoming more and more intolerable. To begin with, the region is not secure. There is no way to prompt Colombian authorities to plan and carry out actions with Venezuela to guarantee territorial integrity on this side of the border. Therefore, guerrillas, kidnappers, and drug traffickers are having a heyday in this region, specifically in the Paez District, the Apure State, and in the autonomous municipalities of Catatumbo and Colon in Zulia State. Meanwhile, according to authorities, the GN has been the target of a campaign to discredit them in recent months. This campaign has been stepped up recently not only by rebels who operate in the security areas, but also by Colombian authorities, who do not hesitate to accuse GN members of attacking Colombia's territorial integrity. Given this serious situation in which a satisfactory solution has not been reached with the Colombia authorities, the GN high commanders, with prior authorization from their superiors, issued a general alert order to all commands in border security areas. Simultaneously, as a support operation, troops have been deployed in the region bordering Colombia. Division General Pedro Jose Romero Farias, GN general commander, confirmed that all the commanders on the border have, in effect, been issued a "general alert" order. In addition, military personnel have been deployed to the region to control attacks by Colombian rebels. Romero Farias said: "We will combat these irregular actions without any hesitation. We will also defend, however, the GN's honor, considering the GN has been the target of a campaign to discredit it by bandits who now feel cornered as a result of the operations carried out by the GN." Meanwhile, it was learned at Fort Tiuna that Army commands have stepped up their action in the Joint Task Force mission. These are contingents that jointly execute military operations to guarantee Venezuela's territorial integrity. Within this framework, their task is to combat and wipe out the presence of Colombian rebels and combat other crimes, among which are drug trafficking, contraband, and common crimes that constantly disrupt the peace and prevent normal socioeconomic development in the region. The Army's idea with the so-called Joint Task Force is to create an atmosphere of security for the people in the area and to combat guerrilla activity -- that is, to minimize the Colombian guerrillas' presence as well as their activities, reduce the number of kidnappings, increase the Armed Forces' prestige in the region, and preserve sovereignty and territorial integrity. Given these incidents on the border, Army Div. Gen. Alberto Emerich Esqueda Torres, permanent secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, announced yesterday the new border security arrangements will definitely be made known this week. It is very possible, he added, that President Ramon J. Velasquez will disclose the decree's details. It is also possible the president will speak to the governors and cattle ranchers of those regions in the province that borders other nations. After these talks, President Velasquez will make the final decision on whether or not to issue a decree regarding border security areas. Precisely because of the course of events on the nation's borders, a group of experts from the Institute of Higher Studies on National Defense, directed by Vice Admiral Mario Ivan Carratu Molina, traveled to the western region -- specifically to the Falcon, Zulia, Tachira, and Apure States. Pompeyo Marquez and Leandro Area from the Negotiating Commission on Border Matters with Colombia; Jose Rodriguez Iturbe, president of Congress' Foreign Policy Commission; and other personalities are also participating in this mission. According to Carratu Molina, the mission's goal in these areas is to verify important political, economic, social, and military aspects within the security and defense framework. Carratu Molina said: "At each of the sites to be visited, we will meet with the state governors, garrison commanders, and military unit and development corporation commanders of each region. In Zulia State particularly, Army Brigade Gen. Romer Cumare Roa, commander of the Army's 1st Infantry Division, and his staff will discuss the military situation on the state's border area with the mission. This situation is very critical because of constant attacks by Colombian criminals. The Army's 2d Infantry Division brigadier general and GN Brig. Gen. German Valera Araque, chief of the GN's 1st Regional Command in Tachira State, were the ones who reported what was happening in the region. The mission arrived at Guasdualito (Apure) and La Fria (Tachira) yesterday, where they toured the border posts and visited the corresponding military units.
