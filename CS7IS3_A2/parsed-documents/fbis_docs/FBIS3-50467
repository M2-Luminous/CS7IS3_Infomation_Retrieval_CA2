The guerrilla members, it was confirmed by TIEMPO newspaper in San Cristobal, burned the municipal palace in Ocosingo early this morning and continued to hold their positions in the town as of 0730 (1330 GMT). The San Cristobal Municipal Police said the EZLN members left the city, the second most important one in the Mexican state of Chiapas, and painted graffiti on the wall to announce they were en route to the town of Rancho Nuevo. A local journalist, however, noted that the announcement was actually "black humor," because the 31st Military Zone is located in Rancho Nuevo and the guerrilla members "will not walk into the wolf's lair." The EZLN members' graffiti indicated they will continue along their way "to Tuxtla Gutierrez (capital of Chiapas) and there will be no rest." Other graffiti read: "We do not want NAFTA. We want freedom and a legitimate government." The authorities have yet to issue a report on the situation which prevails in Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, Chanal, and Altamirano, or to indicate if troops are pursuing the guerrilla forces which left San Cristobal and whose whereabouts are unknown. According to different reports, the toll of the EZLN's arrival is six dead -- three in Ocosingo and three in Las Margaritas. Chiapas, on the Guatemalan border, is located 700 km south of Mexico City, and it is one of the most backward and poorest states in the country and has a predominantly Indian population.
