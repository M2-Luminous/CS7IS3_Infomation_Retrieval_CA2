Kazakhstan, Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan constitute for the time being almost an unknown continent for Chinese politics and economics. And an impressive "continent," one which combines a large market with very rich reserves of strategic resources and a quite well developed industry created during the Soviet years which promises to become a pretty important "pole" in world politics. Mutual understanding and cooperation between China and this region are still only in the formative stage: The exchange of goods is worth only millions of dollars and does not match up to its true potential. By all accounts, economics will be the focus of attention at the upcoming meetings. Li Peng is accompanied by a large group of Chinese businessmen. Incidentally, present-day China is capable of giving these countries almost all they need, including both consumer goods and the products of heavy machine building. In other words, much of what those countries now lack as a consequence of the rupture of the many links that existed within the USSR. There is no doubt that the interests of those states' relations with Russia will be taken into account during the upcoming talks in the four Central Asian capitals. Li Peng notably said at a press conference just before his trip began that his visit "could have only a positive effect" on those countries' relations with Russia and "could not exert a negative influence." China, according to him, would like the four countries of Central Asia also to maintain friendly relations with Russia." There is no doubting the sincerity of those words: Calm, stability, and prosperity in the region are really in the long-term interests of both Russia and China. However, in an economy (especially a market economy) competition in some form or another is an inescapable feature. However, I do not think that the chances enjoyed by the two states in this market are even. On the one hand, you have Russia, which was until recently powerful and influential but which is now rent by internal conflicts and is squandering its resources and destroying its economy, while, on the other hand, you have a stable, dynamic, and self-assured China which is rich not just in terms of export potential but in the practical experience of "shock-free" economic reform. In the eyes of many Central Asian politicians China is an attractive partner and patron. China's growing political and economic influence in Central Asian countries is bound to work to their benefit and to the stabilizing of the general situation in the region. It is important, however, that this should not happen at the expense of the region's traditional relations with Russia; that, however, depends not on China but on Russia itself.
