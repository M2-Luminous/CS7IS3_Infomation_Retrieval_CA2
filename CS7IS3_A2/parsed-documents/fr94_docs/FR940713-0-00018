(a) Each licensee who transfers and each licensee who receives special nuclear material shall complete in computer-readable format a Nuclear Material Transaction Report. This should be done in accordance with instructions whenever the licensee transfers or receives a quantity of special nuclear material of 1 gram or more of contained uranium-235, uranium-233, or plutonium. Copies of these instructions (NUREG/BR&hyph;0006 and NMMSS Report D&hyph;24 ``Personal Computer Data Input for NRC Licensees'') may be obtained from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Division of Fuel Cycle Safety and Safeguards, Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001. This prescribed computer-readable format replaces the DOE/NRC Form 741 which has been previously submitted in paper form. (b) Each licensee who receives 1 gram or more of contained uranium-235, uranium-233, or plutonium from a foreign source shall: (1) Complete in computer-readable format both the supplier's and receiver's portion of the Nuclear Material Transaction Report; (2) Perform independent tests to assure the accurate identification and measurement of the material received, including its weight and enrichment; and (3) Indicate the results of these tests on the receiver's portion of the form. (c) Any licensee who is required to submit inventory change reports pursuant to §75.34 of this chapter (pertaining to implementation of the US/International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safeguards Agreement) shall prepare and submit these reports only as provided in that section (instead of as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section).
