The Chamber of Deputies modified the original text of the amnesty bill. Preserving its spirit and main objective, the deputies made important contributions to peace in Chiapas by turning the amnesty bill into a broad and flexible legislation to pave the way for peace. The core of the approved law offers amnesty to all those who committed crimes in relation to the violent acts in Chiapas between 1 and 20 January at 1500. The bill was made more flexible to grant amnesty to those who participated in preparing violent incidents during December 1993. The most important change made to the approved amnesty bill was the authorization granted to the federal chief executive to establish a commission tasked with coordinating the implementation of this law. This is very important, because this commission will be authorized to establish deadlines for the surrender of weapons, explosives, and hostages should amnesty be accepted. The commission for the implementation of amnesty will determine when and in which cases the enforcement of criminal proceedings and the punishment imposed will no longer be enforced [extinguirse las acciones penales y las sanciones impuestas] regarding the crimes in question. All of this is contingent, however, to the commission declaring the definitive end of hostilities. Another example of flexibility is that the deputies eliminated from the amnesty bill a deadline for the surrender of weapons. Article Two originally stated that the deadline to surrender weapons for those who would like to take advantage of amnesty should be within 30 days, beginning on the date of publication of this law. The elimination of this deadline ensures that peace negotiations will be surrounded by a pressure-free atmosphere and that the amnesty law will be applied at the right time. We must point out that the only party that did not vote for the amnesty law was the PRD, which abstained. During a news conference Deputy Ricardo Valero, coordinator of the PRD parliamentarian bloc, said his party abstained because it disagrees with the terms under which the amnesty bill was approved although the party favors it. Congress will play a very important role in the search for peace in Chiapas State. Besides the already approved amnesty law, there are plans to hold special sessions beginning the first half of February to modify several constitutional articles to wage a strong fight against poverty among Chiapas residents. The holding of extraordinary congressional sessions is contingent upon the six political parties represented at Congress drafting a working agenda and identification of which laws and constitutional articles should be modified. There is already consensus on the need to go to the root of the problem. For example, PAN [National Action Party] has basically called for the modification of the laws on revenues and on the budget of the federation for 1994 to ensure a just and real redistribution in the poorest regions of the country. The PRD demands the reform of constitutional Articles Four, 53, 73, and 115. All political parties agree on the modification of Article 115 of the Constitution to ensure the governments of ethnic groups, which have regimes based on habits and customs [regimenes de usos y costumbres], are recognized within the realm of constitutional town councils. The approval of the amnesty law is the first major legal step toward attaining peace in Chiapas. [end recording]
