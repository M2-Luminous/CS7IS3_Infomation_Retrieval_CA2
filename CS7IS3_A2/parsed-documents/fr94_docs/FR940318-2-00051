FR940318-2-00051 FR940318-2-00041 [OPPTS&hyph;62138; FRL&hyph;4765&hyph;6] Lead Renovation and Remodeling Guidelines; Notice of Availability AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of Availability and Request for Comment. SUMMARY: This notice announces the availability for review and comment of EPA's draft renovation and remodeling (R&R) guidelines document entitled ``Reducing Lead Hazards When Remodeling Your Home.'' This document is being developed pursuant to Title IV, section 402(c)(1) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Section 402(c)(1) specifically, mandates that EPA develop guidelines for homeowners and other persons who may engage in renovation and remodeling activities. EPA is developing the R&R guidelines in response to Congressional concerns about the public's knowledge of lead hazards when conducting R&R activities in homes. DATES: Written comments in response to the draft R&R guidelines document must be received on or before April 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please submit three copies of all written comments on the draft R&R guideline document to: TSCA Document Receipts (7407), Room G&hyph;99, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. All comments on the draft Guideline document should be identified by Docket Number OPPTS&hyph;62138. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For technical information, contact Darlene Watford, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Chemical Management Division, Technical Programs Branch [7404], 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: 202&hyph;260&hyph;3989, Fax: 202&hyph;260&hyph;0001. For a copy of the draft R&R guideline document, ``Reducing Lead Hazards When Remodeling Your Home,'' contact: the TSCA Assistance Information Service at 202&hyph;554&hyph;1404, TDD: 202&hyph;554&hyph;0551 or fax your request to 202&hyph;554 &hyph;5603. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The draft R&R guidelines text is available as an electronic file on the Federal Bulletin Board at 9 a.m. on the date of publication in the Federal Register . By modem dial 202&hyph;512&hyph;1387 or call 202&hyph;512&hyph;1530 for disks or paper copies. The document is available in WordPerfect and ASCII formats. Under the Congressional mandate in section 402(c)(1) of TSCA, EPA has developed guidance for homeowners and building occupants to alert them to potential lead hazards associated with renovation and remodeling activities (which may create a risk of exposure to dangerous levels of lead). Congress specifically required that these guidelines be developed for homes and buildings constructed prior to 1978. It is further mandated that these guidelines are to be distributed through paint and hardware stores, employee organizations and trade groups, State and local agencies, and through other appropriate means. The Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics is seeking public comment on all aspects of the content and design of the R&R Guidelines document. In particular, EPA requests comment on the tone of the document, and the extent to which the current wording and design tend to support (or undermine) its effectiveness as an informational tool. One issue that EPA has considered is the need to balance technical accuracy with clarity and freedom from overly technical jargon. The extent to which the current draft is clear and understandable is of primary concern to the Agency, given the broad distribution that the document will have. In addition to soliciting public input through this notice, EPA will conduct a series of focus group reviews on the draft R&R guidelines document to evaluate the effectiveness of the current reading level, content, and graphic presentation. EPA will include a summary of the focus groups' test results when it announces the availability of the final R&R guidelines document in the Federal Register . EPA also recognizes that this lead hazard information may be important in some communities that may have a limited ability to utilize information provided in English. For that reason, EPA is developing a Spanish language version of the Guidelines document as well. The Spanish-language R&R guidelines document will be available after the English version has been completed. Dated: March 15, 1994.
