He adds that no power plant except the Chaira Pumped Storage Power Station has been under construction since 1990 and that in three to four years time the Maritsa Iztok 1 Thermoelectric Power Station and some other minor thermal power plants will be closed down. According to Mr. Shervashidze, a nuclear as well as some conventional types of generating facilities should be built in Bulgaria. At the same time, he believes that the current 40 percent proportion of nuclear power in electricity production is the optimum and should be maintained. According to Mr. Shervashidze, it would be more profitable to build an N-plant but this would take at least six years and the only feasible site is in Belene (where a new nuclear power plant went under construction back in the 1980's and was put into cold storage in 1990 for lack of money and under environmentalists' pressure). The chairman of the Power Engineering Committee denies press allegations of the existence of a "nuclear Mafia" in Bulgaria but says he himself belongs to a nuclear power lobby campaigning to convince the government and people in this country of the excellent prospects and the economic efficiency of nuclear energy in Bulgaria. Further in his interview, Mr. Shervashidze says there are several projects for completion the second nuclear power plant in Belene (on the Danube). According to him, the site in Belene can accommodate six nuclear reactors of 1,000 megawatts each. The draft project envisaged two nuclear reactors of 1,000 megawatts each, but later it became clear that 500-100 [as received] megawatt units suited better Bulgaria's energy supply system and their construction was feasible. Nikita Shervashidze believes the motion by 14 MP's for a moratorium on the development of nuclear power engineering and the construction of nuclear facilities can not be serious. "A plant for recycling cool radioactive waste is being built and if such a moratorium is imposed, the construction will have to be stopped," Mr. Shervashidze says. He points out that the construction of gas-powered stations, worth about $1,100-1,200 per kilowatt of installed capacity, is also possible in Bulgaria, but the high prices of imported gas raise the cost of such projects.
