FR940803-1-00035 FR940803-1-00008 40 CFR Part 180 [OPP&hyph;300353; FRL&hyph;4902&hyph;7] RIN No. 2070&hyph;AC18 Calcium Hypochlorite; Exemption From Tolerance AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA proposes to establish an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of chlorine gas in or on grapes when applied as a fumigant postharvest by means of a chlorine generator pad in accordance with good agricultural practices. Chiquita Frupac requested this proposed expansion of the tolerance exemption.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Ruth Douglas, Product Manager (PM) 32, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 278, CM #2, Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703) 305-7964. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), EPA proposes to exempt from the requirement of a tolerance residues of chlorine gas in or on grapes when applied as a fumigant postharvest by means of a chlorine generator pad. The fumigation process uses polyethylene-lined paper pads containing calcium hypochlorite that are packed in grape containers during shipment. Under conditions of normal use, the pads are not in direct contact with the grapes. The moisture from inside the box and the carbon dioxide produced by the metabolic process of the fruit permeate the pad, activating the release of chlorine gas. The chlorine gas released in the pad diffuses through the paper and the polyethylene liner before depositing on the grapes. The exemption for chlorine generators would not apply to the use of chlorine gas during food processing or as a food-contact surface sanitizer since these uses are under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration. Several clearances already exist for the calcium salt of hypochlorite used as the precursor of the chlorine gas. Calcium hypochlorite is exempted from the requirement of a tolerance when used preharvest or postharvest in solution on all raw agricultural commodities (40 CFR 180.1054). Calcium hypochlorite is an approved inert ingredient in pesticide products when added to a formulation as a sanitizing and bleaching agent (40 CFR 180.1001). Calcium hypochlorite is cleared by the Food and Drug Administration when used as a rinse on food-contact surfaces (21 CFR 178.1010). Chlorine gas is exempted from the requirement of a tolerance when used preharvest or postharvest in solution on all raw agricultural commodities (40 CFR 180.1095). When added to water, chlorine gas reacts to form hypochlorous acid, a pesticidally active chemical which kills microorganisms on the surface of the commodity to which it is applied. Hypochlorous acid is consumed when it reacts with bacteria, fungi, and other organic matter. Because of the rapidity with which chlorine gas degrades, there is no reasonable expectation that residues of chlorine gas will remain in eggs, meat, milk, or poultry in accordance with 40 CFR 180.3. The residues that do remain are not of toxicological significance. Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural practice, this active ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended that contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulations. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [OPP-300353]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will be available in the Public Information Branch, at the address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances, or raising tolerance levels, or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests. Dated: July 15, 1994. Lois Rossi, Acting Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs. Therefore, it is proposed that part 180 be amended as follows: PART 180_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a and 371. 2. Section 180.1054 is revised to read as follows: ยง180.1054 Calcium hypochlorite; exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance. (a) Calcium hypochlorite is exempted from the requirement of a tolerance when used preharvest or postharvest in solution on all raw agricultural commodities. (b) Calcium hypochlorite is exempted from the requirement of a tolerance in or on grapes when used as a fumigant postharvest by means of a chlorine generator pad.
