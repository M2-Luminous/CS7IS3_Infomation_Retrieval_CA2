FBIS4-38199 "drnes125_o_94001" FBIS-NES-94-125 Daily Report 29 Jun 1994 SYRIA Rabin's `Threats' Meant To Obstruct Christopher Mission Rabin's `Threats' Meant To Obstruct Christopher Mission JN2906080394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0450 GMT 29 Jun 94 JN2906080394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] Under the headline "Rabin Is Besieging Christopher's Mission Anew," AL-BA'TH says: When the head of the Israeli Government sees that there is no use for peace, this means he still follows the policy of separate solutions and partial deals and still obstructs the mission of the U.S. diplomat who seeks to activate the peace process. AL-BA'TH adds: Rabin is trying to lay siege to Christopher's mission to make it fail, just like his other recent tours. Rabin may have found an acceptance of his conditions by some who are going to the talks through his separate deals. Syria, however, is determined to adhere to its constant, principled positions that reject any solution that does not restore Arab rights. In conclusion, AL-BA'TH says withdrawal from the Golan, southern Lebanon, and the rest of the occupied Arab territories is a primary condition for peace, stipulated by the peace initiative. Syria will continue to adhere to its constants and to its commitment to international legitimacy. It restates that it is not in a hurry and that the party obstructing the peace process will bear the consequences, sooner or later. Under the headline "Rabin's Threats," TISHRIN says: The clearly threatening tone in Rabin's speech about opportunities for peace, Rabin's establishment of a timeframe for signing a peace agreement with Syria, and his statement that if this is not achieved, he will propose supplying the Israeli Army with weapons in preparation for the prospect of war -- all these threats and statements include fallacies. They represent an obvious attempt to falsify facts, strike a blow at the peace process, and raise tension in the region. The paper adds: Syria has dealt with the U.S. initiative and the question of peace very seriously. It has made concrete suggestions to make progress in the peace process. The paper says Rabin's statements are an obvious attempt to thwart the mission of the U.S. secretary before it even starts. TISHRIN says Rabin's threats do not frighten Syria. Everybody knows there can be no peace in the region without Syria. All the fragile agreements that have been concluded are destined to fail utterly if Israel does not submit to the resolutions and principles of international legitimacy and the foundations of the Madrid conference by withdrawing from all the Golan and southern Lebanon and restoring Arab rights. TISHRIN concludes: If the peace process is to collapse because of Israel's intransigence and evil intentions, then Israel alone will be to blame for its failure. The international community and the parties sponsoring the peace process should intervene to correct things and stand up to and deter Israel's belligerent threats.
