FR940127-2-00014 FR940127-2-00008 The Department is initiating COP investigations for the two companies where petitioners provided company-specific home market prices, contingent upon whether these companies become respondents in this investigation. The Department is not initiating COP investigations for those companies and exporters where petitioners did not provide company-specific home market prices. Petitioners allege a price-to-price dumping margin for stainless steel bar from Italy of 15.15 percent. Petitioners allege a price-to-CV dumping margin of 157.03 percent. Japan Petitioners based USP on June 1993 sales invoices from Daido Steel Sheet Corporation (Daido), a Japanese producer of stainless steel bar, to an unrelated U.S. customer. Since the USPs were quoted ex-dock, duty paid, Los Angeles, petitioners deducted from USP amounts for U.S. duty, ocean freight, marine insurance, harbor maintenance and U.S. merchandise processing fees. Petitioners used Daido's delivered May&hyph;June 1993 home market sales prices as the basis for FMV. These prices were contained in a market research report. To calculate an ex-factory price, except for credit, petitioners used expense information from the market research report. For credit, petitioners used the rate in effect in Japan for March 1993 as reported in the International Financial Statistics, July 1993. Petitioners deducted from FMV an amount for inland freight and insurance, trade discounts, rebates and sales promotion expenses, advertising and warranties. Petitioners made circumstance-of-sale adjustments for credit and packing. Based on a comparison of USP to FMV, the dumping margins alleged by petitioners for stainless steel bar from Japan range from 48.00 to 61.47 percent. Spain Petitioners based USP on a September 1993 price quote for U.S. sales made by Acenor, a Spanish producer of stainless steel bar, to an unrelated U.S. company. Since USP was quoted on a direct mill delivery basis, petitioners deducted the applicable import duties, ocean freight, marine insurance, harbor maintenance and U.S. merchandise processing fees. Petitioners calculated FMV using two methodologies. First, petitioners used Acenor's delivered home market prices as the basis for FMV. These prices were contained in a market research report. Petitioners deducted inland freight from FMV using information contained in the same report. Second, petitioners based FMV on CV because they alleged that Acenor's home market sales are being made at prices below the COP. Petitioners also allege that another Spanish company, Roldan, is making home market sales of stainless steel bar at prices below the COP. These allegations are based on a comparison of home market prices for Acenor and Roldan, obtained from the market research report, with COP. COP was based on the COP of an efficient U.S. producer, adjusted for known differences in costs between the United States and Spain. Where petitioners calculated CV, they used the COP from this producer and added the statutory minimum of eight percent for profit. The Department is initiating COP investigations for the two companies where petitioners provided company-specific home market prices, contingent upon whether these companies become respondents in this investigation. The Department is not initiating COP investigations for those companies and exporters where petitioners did not provide company-specific home market prices. Petitioners allege a price-to-price dumping margin for stainless steel bar from Spain of 38.82 percent. Petitioners allege a price-to-CV dumping margin of 144.88 percent. Initiation of Investigations We have examined the petitions on stainless steel bar from Brazil, India, Italy, Japan and Spain, and have found that the petitions meet the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating antidumping duty investigations to determine whether imports of stainless steel bar from Brazil, India, Italy, Japan and Spain are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value. Preliminary Determination by the International Trade Commission The International Trade Commission (ITC) will determine by February 14, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of stainless steel bar from Brazil, India, Italy, Japan and Spain are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. A negative ITC determination on any one of these investigations will result in that investigation being terminated; otherwise, the investigations will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b). Dated: January 19, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
