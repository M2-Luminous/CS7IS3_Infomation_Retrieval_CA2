A joint communique has been issued that mainly discusses the regional conflicts in the former Soviet Union, disarmament, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Sources close to the conference have said that no concessions were made to Russia's objections concerning the Azeri-Armenian conflict and the reduction of Conventional Forces in Europe [CFE]. The statement supports the idea of holding a conference within the framework of the CSCE to reach a lasting and just solution to the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. The statement says that the problem can be resolved only through negotiations. The statement points out that the NACC follows developments in the Crimean Autonomous Republic with concern. It adds that the problem should be resolved within the framework of the territorial integrity of the Ukraine. The statement discusses the Russian military presence in the Baltic countries without using the word Russia. It says that the withdrawal of foreign troops from these areas as soon as possible will contribute positively to the security of both the regional countries and Europe. On Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement says that a political solution should be reached as soon as possible. On arms control and disarmament, the statement stresses the importance of fully implementing all the existing agreements on the issue. The statement stresses the need to fully implement within this framework the CFE, the agreement to prevent the proliferation of nuclear arms, and the agreements on chemical and biological weapons, as well as poisonous gases. The statement says that an agreement must be concluded as soon as possible that completely bans nuclear experiments. NATO Acting Secretary General Sergio Balanzino held a news conference at the end of the meeting where he said that Russia accepted the Partnership for Peace plan as it is, but that it requested a [word indistinct] on how the plan will work. Balanzino stressed that it was very important for all the members to reach an agreement. If that had not been achieved, he said, we would have given a negative message to the world. Replying to questions, Balanzino said that Russia is a very important force in Europe and NATO's close relations with this force will contribute to world peace. Asked if Kozyrev's objections to the joint statement are a negative sign that Russia might change its policies in the future, Balanzino said: I do not know the answer to that question. I do not know about the future. However, today, there is no change of policy. Maybe Kozyrev lacked sleep, maybe he was tired.
