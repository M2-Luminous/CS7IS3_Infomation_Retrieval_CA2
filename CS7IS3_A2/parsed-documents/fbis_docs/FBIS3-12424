This is reported by our correspondent Moti Amir. In one hour, 400 hundred prisoners will be released from the al-Zahiriyah prison. The first batch from among the 500 prisoners to be released from Qezi'ot today were released half an hour ago. Our correspondent reports that prisoners from Judaea and Samaria are being released from Qezi'ot this morning, while Gaza Strip prisoners will be released this afternoon. Sufyan al-Zaydan, the Fatah spokesman in Gaza, says today's release of Palestinian prisoners will not bring the PLO back to the negotiating table because the number of those being released is insufficient.
