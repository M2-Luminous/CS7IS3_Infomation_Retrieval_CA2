FR941220-0-00085 FR941220-0-00014 Further, to prevent employers from obtaining H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants in the event of a labor dispute, the Department proposed, through the proposed new ยง XXXX .733, to prohibit employers from placing H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants in employment at worksites in occupations that are involved in a strike, lockout, or work stoppage in the course of a labor dispute. Modification of Form ETA 9035 was proposed so that employers would be required to attest that they would not use the labor condition application in support of any petition filed with INS for H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants if a strike, lockout, or work stoppage in the course of a labor dispute involves the occupation covered by the LCA at the place of employment at any time during its validity period after the labor condition application is certified. The Department also proposed to amend the regulations to require employers to notify DOL within 3 days of the start of a strike, lockout, or other work stoppage in the course of a labor dispute in the occupation of the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) at any worksite. Upon receiving such a notification, the Department would undertake the necessary factfinding to determine whether the Secretary shall issue a strike determination to the INS pursuant to the INS's regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(17). Comments from 18 parties addressed this issue specifically, with over half against the proposal. However, all those comments opposing this proposal were conditional, suggesting that the restriction would be acceptable if it is limited to the occupation in which the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant is employed ( i.e., nonimmigrant's employment would be permitted in an occupation other than one(s) subject to strike/lockout). Since the proposal was, in fact, so limited, these commenters' concerns would be alleviated by careful attention to the regulatory language. After careful consideration of the comments, the Department is promulgating this proposal as it appeared in the NPRM, applicable not only to job contractors but to all employees, and relative to strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages in the occupational classification of a potential H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant at a given worksite. See also pages 31&hyph;32 regarding the provision for placement of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants in an area of employment for which the employer does not have a valid LCA on file. f. ``Interested Party'' and ``Aggrieved Party'' definitions (See ยง XXXX .715.) In section 212(n)(2) of the INA, Congress directed the Department to establish a process to respond to complaints from ``aggrieved'' parties and to provide opportunities for administrative hearings for ``interested'' parties following investigative determinations. 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2). The legislative history reflects Congress' intention that the Department's enforcement process would be the means for protecting both U.S. and foreign workers; no comprehensive pre-admission screening or review process was established. The Department concluded, in order to comply with the Congressional mandate for effective enforcement, that the terms ``aggrieved'' and ``interested'' party should be defined broadly in a manner consistent with their common meaning. In the NPRM, the Department proposed that ``aggrieved party or organization'' would be defined as one whose operations or interests are adversely affected by the alleged violation(s). Based on the Department's experience regarding the scope and nature of adverse effects of violations, as well as the sources for reliable, actionable allegations of violations, the Department proposed that the definition of the term ``aggrieved party or organization'' would encompass not only private-sector persons and organizations ( e.g., workers, their representatives, competitors of the allegedly violating employer), but also government agencies and officials ( e.g., Department of State consular officers, State Employment Security Agency Officials).
