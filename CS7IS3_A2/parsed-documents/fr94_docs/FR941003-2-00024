Northwest Pipeline Corporation [Docket No. CP94&hyph;784&hyph;000] Take notice that on September 16, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), P.O. Box 58900, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108&hyph;0900, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;784&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205, 157.216 and 157.211 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act for authorization to abandon certain facilities at the Twin Falls Meter Station in Twin Falls County, Idaho, 1 and to construct and operate upgraded replacement facilities at this station, under its blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;433&hyph;000, 2 all as more fully set forth in the request for authorization on file with the Commission and open for public inspection. 1 See , Docket No. G&hyph;8934 (14 FPC 157). 2 See , 20 FERC Â¶62,412 (1982). Northwest states that upgraded facilities are needed to better accommodate its existing firm maximum daily delivery obligations at this delivery point to Intermountain Gas Company (Intermountain). Northwest proposes to replace four existing 3-inch regulators with four new 4-inch regulators, relief valve, new upstream headers, relocate filter, replace station by-pass and appurtenances. Northwest states that the upgrade will increase the design capacity of the station from 14,670 Dth per day to approximately 24,600 Dth per day. Northwest further states that the total cost of the project is estimated to be approximately $289,191. Since this expenditure is necessary to increase the design capacity to serve existing maximum daily delivery obligation, Northwest will not require any cost reimbursement from Intermountain.
