The Nicaraguan foreign minister said a note will be sent very soon to the U.S. Government rejecting the report. [Begin recording] [Leal] We believe the report is not fair. We find the report unacceptable. It reports things that occurred in the past, but it tends to imply there is a systematic policy of human rights violations in our country. We find reports by Amnesty International and other organizations are more objective in their analysis. [Unidentified Reporter] Does the Nicaraguan Government reject the part of the report which says that military authorities are not under civilian control? [Leal] Well, basically, we cannot accept that either. You have heard and read the president's speech from 2 December 1993. What we are trying to do here is institutionalize and professionalize the Armed Forces. In fact, very soon the executive branch will be sending the Legislative Assembly a draft law on the military organization process and social security for the military. [Reporter] Does this mean relations with the United States are not good? Why has the White House drafted a report which says human rights are being violated in Nicaragua? [Leal] I do not think relations with the United States will sour because of the report. We do not agree with the report. We are not saying violations have stopped. Unfortunately, there are still cases of human rights violations in our country. The government is completely convinced and determined, however, to ensure strict respect for human rights. [Reporter] Will the government take steps to reject the report? [Leal] We are drafting a response to the document, certainly. What [U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs] Mr. Watson has said in the past few months is completely different from what the State Department is saying now. This document, which you should have, relates the cases that occurred in 1993. It refers, for instance, to confrontations between recontras and recompas. It refers to clashes between Sandinists and non-Sandinists, which we all know have occurred in the rural areas of our country. This does not mean, however, that the government wants these things to happen. [end recording]
