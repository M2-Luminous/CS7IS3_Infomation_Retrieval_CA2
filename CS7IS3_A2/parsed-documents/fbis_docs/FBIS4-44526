Current Status of Peasant Occupational Differentiation The survey showed that more than a decade of reform has demolished the peasants' single occupation status of the people's commune era. Today, the peasants have the freedom to change their status and select an occupation. The employment structure has undergone marked changes. This survey divided peasant occupations into 10 categories as follows: 1) Peasant laborers. This category consists primarily of peasants who contract the use of collective land for farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and the fishing industry, all or most of their income coming from agriculture. They may be further divided into those who work solely in agriculture, and those who work mostly in agriculture but also in some other industry. 2) Peasant workers. These are peasants who work all year round, or most of the time, in township and village collectively owned enterprises and state-owned enterprise units doing jobs in secondary or tertiary industries. 3) Township and village collective enterprise managers. These are plant directors and plant managers, as well as people who head up laboratories, and supply and marketing personnel in township and village (or group) collectively owned enterprises. They are the people who hold administrative and management authority and decision making authority in enterprises. 4) Individual or partnership industry and business workers and business persons. These are laborers engaged in nonagricultural labor and business in industries, transportation, businesses, or food and beverage services in which the means of production or money are individually owned or owned in partnership. These industries and businesses may have hired workers, but they have not yet attained the status of a privately owned enterprise. 5) Operators of privately owned enterprises, i.e., owners of privately owned businesses. A privately owned enterprise is one in which an individual or partners own the means of production, in which mostly hired labor does the work, in which all or most after-tax profits go to the owners of the means of production, and that are rural economic entities of substantial size. Specifically, a privately owned enterprise: 1) hires eight or more workers (including apprentice workers); 2) has fewer than eight worker but has assets (fixed assets and working capital) of more than 50,000 yuan; 3) is a partnership in which the number of hired workers is greater than double the total amount of family manpower put into the partnership, and whose assets are worth more than 50,000 yuan. 6) Hired laborers. This means laborers who work year round, or most of the year, as laborers in a noncollective and nonstate owned enterprise unit such as a privately owned enterprise, an individual owned enterprise, or a partnership industry or business. These laborers do not have enough land or other means of production to make a living by themselves. 7) Township and village cadres. This term applies to township and village cadres who do administrative leadership and management tasks year round, or most of the time. For the most part, they do not have production jobs. Most draw a fixed wage or enjoy a fixed allowance. 8) Workers in education, science and technology, medical treatment and health care, culture and the arts. These are peasants and intellectuals engaged in intellectual occupations in rural villages. 9) Houseworkers. This term applies to laborers who do house work year round and who do not engage in production for the most part. (10) Other laborers. This means workers other than those in the above nine categories, such as laborers having no fixed occupation. Inasmuch as houseworkers do virtually no work in production, since other laborers have no relatively fixed occupational status, and since township and village cadres and workers in education, science, medical treatment, and the arts are groups that have not newly appeared since reform, they are not the principal focus of this article's analysis. Thus, the current spread of the rural work force is as shown in Table 1. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Most of the manpower that has left agriculture has flowed in one of two directions. First, it has gone into township and village collectively owned enterprises and state-owned enterprise units. A relatively small 5.2 percent has gone into nonagricultural work such as in state-owned enterprise units, while a much larger percentage has gone into township and village collective enterprises. Second, it has flowed mostly into the individually or privately owned economy. This category of laborers is comprised largely of the owners of the owners of privately owned enterprises, and the owners and hired workers in individual or partnership industries or businesses. The number of people who have gone into state-owned enterprise units, township and village collective enterprises, and the private economy total 28.3 percent of the nonagricultural population. The development of township and village enterprises and the individually and privately owned economy has played an important role in the shift of agricultural manpower. Gender plays a definite role in rural manpower's selection of an occupation. This is manifested largely in a much larger percentage of females than males leaving production to do housework. However, except for the old and the physically impaired, virtually all males are involved directly in production activity. Among agricultural laborers, females employed solely in agriculture account for 45 percent of total manpower in this category, 4.9 percentage points more than males. However, in the various nonagricultural occupations, the percentage of males is higher than females. The occupational situation in the country's three main regions as shown in Table 2 suggests that the percentage of the rural work force working as agricultural laborers increases from the eastern to the central and western regions of the country. Correspondingly, the percentage of nonagricultural laborers is largest in the eastern region. The nonagricultural manpower in township and village collective enterprises (the peasant workers in township and village collective enterprises, and managers in township and village collective enterprises) is 31.8 percent in the east, 26.8 percent in the central region, and 23.2 percent in the West. In the eastern region, those who have become owners of privately owned enterprises in the individual and private economy, or operators and hired workers in individual or partnership industries or businesses number 31.8 percent of the nonagricultural work force. It is 23.8 percent in the central region and 26.8 percent in the western region. In the eastern region, the peasant occupational structure shows a fairly marked nonagricultural shift, and the collective and privately owned economies play an equally important role in soaking up nonagricultural manpower. In the western region, the tilt of the occupational structure toward other than agriculture is reactively slight. The percentage of agricultural laborers is relatively high, and the percentage of nonagricultural manpower flowing into township and village collective enterprises is relatively low. In the central region, the situation is in between that of the eastern and western regions. By comparison with the western region, township and village collective enterprises soak up a comparatively large amount of the work force; however, the role of the individual and private economy in soaking up manpower is relatively slight. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

The percentage of village laborers having a net per capita income of more than 1,500 yuan is lowest, and the percentage of those engaged purely in agriculture is even less, amounting to only 14.6 percent of rural manpower. However, in the group making a net per capita income of less than 400 yuan, they number 60.2 percent, the highest group of all. In the group making between 600 and 800 yuan, they number 50.7 percent. Township and village enterprises are fairly well developed in villages where people have a net per capita income of more than 1,500 yuan. These township and village enterprises employ 52.1 percent of non-agricultural manpower as peasant workers and managers. Private enterprise owners, individual or partnership industry or business operators, and hired laborers account for 27.9 percent of nonagricultural manpower. In the 600-800 yuan group, township and village enterprises employ 34.7 percent of nonagricultural manpower as peasant workers and managers, and private enterprise owners, individual or partnership industry or business operators, and hired laborers account for 26.5 percent of nonagricultural manpower. In the below 400 yuan group, the percentages are 8.4 and 21.2 respectively. This shows a relatively high percentage of nonagricultural manpower in high income villages, an overwhelming majority of which has fairly stable employment, while in low income areas, the nonagricultural manpower percentage is very small, and a substantial percentage of it is not engaged in production activities. The role of collective enterprises and individually or privately owned economic components in absorbing surplus agricultural manpower is very limited, agriculture being the main occupation. To summarize the foregoing, the peasant occupational structure at the present time may be capsulized as follows: 1. Rural reform has freed the peasants from the bondage of the people's commune system. As the rural economy develops, bringing steady changes in the industrial structure, some peasants have left agriculture for jobs in the nonagricultural sector. The substance of peasant employment has changed with reform, employment opportunities becoming more varied. 2. The occupational structure today has a marked transitional character. On the one hand, because of various limitations, most peasants remain on the land. Despite the large surplus labor, they are unable to transfer into secondary and tertiary industries. On the other hand, the manpower that has transferred out of agriculture still maintains countless ties with those who have not. They are still not secure in their jobs, where mergers are constantly occurring. The survey results show 0.7 persons per household surveyed as working in other than agriculture, 0.3 of them working there for less than six months each year. Moreover, each time a change occurs in government policy orientation, a chain reaction is produced in the percentage of rural manpower employed in nonagricultural pursuits. 3. Occupational structure reflects an area's industrial structure, and differences in industrial structure make for differences between one area and another in peasant employment. In economically developed areas, nonagricultural industries are usually also fairly well developed, and the amount of manpower working in other than agriculture is substantial. However, in economically backward areas where agriculture still plays a dominant role, the occupational structure is also tilted toward agriculture. 4. Township and village collective enterprises, privately owned enterprises, and individual or partnership industrial and business households are the main outlets for surplus manpower. Collective enterprises are frequently fairly large and soak up substantial manpower. However, the number of such enterprises is fairly small, and they are very unevenly distributed. Although fairly small in size and absorbing little manpower, privately owned enterprises, and individual or partnership industrial or commercial households are fairly large in number and cover a wide area. Both of these economic components play a major role as outlets for the shift of manpower today. 5. From the standpoint of the peasants becoming prosperous, since they have a great radiating effect, township and village enterprises play a substantial role in bringing about joint prosperity for whole villages. That more than half of the non-agricultural manpower is employed in township and village collective enterprises in villages where net per capita income is above 1,500 yuan provides good testimony to this. The radiating effect of privately owned enterprises and individual or partnership industrial and commercial households is small by comparison, so their role is not as large as that of township and village collective enterprises. Their effect on the rural economy is expressed largely through their demonstration effect on villagers. Main Reasons for Peasant Occupational Diversification The main reason for the diversification of peasant occupations since the advent of reform has been the shift into other than agriculture and other than the publicly owned economy of agricultural laborers who contracted collectively owned land. Therefore, six occupational changes in the primary industry and secondary industries should be the main emphasis of this analysis. Reduction in the number of agricultural laborers is the starting point for peasant occupational differentiation. Many factors account for peasant occupational differentiation. There are both internal reasons and objective reasons, both historical reasons and practical reasons, and both general reasons and special reasons. Summation of all the factors leading to the main reasons for peasant occupational differentiation today may be understood from the following several aspects. (1) Economic Development Is the Basic Animus for Peasant Occupational Differentiation Economic development has its own inherent objective necessity. The contemporary economic development process is a process of change that has gone from primarily an agricultural economy to primarily an industrial economy, from primarily a rural village economy to primarily an industrial economy, from primarily a rural economy to primarily an urban economy, and from primarily a natural economy to primarily a commodity economy. The diversification of peasants occupations is an important ingredient of this process. The direct force powering this process is rise in agricultural productivity. The widespread use of improved breeds and crop varieties, increase in material inputs such as chemical fertilizers, agricultural pesticides and agricultural plastic film, a rise in the degree of mechanization, improved capital construction of agriculture, perfection of the agricultural services system, etc. have brought a rise in both the soil productivity rate and the labor productive rate, thereby setting the stage for a shift in agricultural manpower. This survey shows that 72.8 percent of villages have centrally organized the supply of improved breeds and crop varieties, that chemical fertilizer use totals 84.43 tons per village, or 34.78 kilograms per mu of cultivated land; that mechanization averages 1,014.58 horsepower per village, meaning that 57 percent of the total cultivated land area is machine cultivated today; and that 83 percent of villages have centrally organized medium and small farmland capital construction, year-end effective irrigation and drainage ditches averaging 6,533.89 meters per village for the irrigation of 56.4 percent of the total cultivated land area during the year. Improvement of the agricultural services system has not only improved working conditions, but has also saved manpower. Among rural agricultural laborers surveyed, females already outnumber males, and the educational level of agricultural laborers is also fairly low; however, neither of these factors impairs bumper agricultural harvests. On the contrary, they set the stage for male manpower and manpower of relatively high caliber to take part in nonagricultural production. Agricultural production is characterized by seasonality. The widespread existence of long periods of surplus agricultural labor is also a basic factor in the long history of rural sideline occupations, and it also makes possible the holding of separate jobs. The survey shows that 30.6 percent of agricultural laborers hold a second job, and that only 42.8 percent of the rural work force works solely in farming. The experience of some economically developed areas shows that the shift of manpower out of agriculture usually goes through three stages: farming alone, two jobs other than farming, and concentration on a single occupation. Since China has scant resources for agriculture, and a large population relative to available land, surplus manpower exists in every rural village. This produces inherent pressure for peasant occupational differentiation. This survey shows only 3.08 mu of cultivated land per rural capita, and each person engaged in farming cultivated 5.49 mu. Idle rural manpower runs to 286.45 per village, or 36.4 percent of total manpower. Different occupations and differences in income from different occupations play a guiding role in peasant occupational diversification. Results of a sampling of 10 percent of the high income families among all peasant families based on a 1991 ranking by per capita income showed: Forty-two percent of the high income peasant households were from among households operating privately owned enterprises primarily; 25 percent came from households engaged mostly in individual or partnership contracting of collective enterprises; 18.3 percent came from households engaged primarily in running partnerships; and 8.6 percent came from households operating family businesses, for the most part. Clearly, the percentage of high income households from the operation of family businesses mostly was lowest. The number of high income households in various occupations as a percentage of all households was as follows: 4.5 percent in farming (3.5 percent of them from grain farming), 8.7 percent in forestry, 14.1 percent in animal husbandry, 12.5 percent in the fishing industry, 27.4 percent in industry, and 28.6 percent in construction. Very clearly, the percentage of high income households engaged in farming, for the most part, was the smallest. (2) Economic Policy Readjustments Since the Advent of Rural Reform Have Given Tremendous Impetus to Peasant Occupational Differentiation The sidelining of surplus agricultural manpower resulting from increases in agricultural productivity, the surplus labor time and the surplus manpower employment pressures resulting from the shortage of agricultural resources, which characterize agricultural production, as well as the different occupations and the differences in income from different occupations are things guiding the shift of manpower out of agriculture and inherent causes of economic development, most of which have not just come into being. However, rural reform brought new changes and new combinations of these factors that have hastened peasant occupational diversification. Before reform, rural villages practiced a highly centralized planned economy management system in which the peasants had no right to make their own production decisions and no division of labor and trades, to say nothing of occupational diversity. The peasants were shackled to the limited amount of land to produce enough food to eat. "Taking grain as the key link, cutting out all else" was a true picture of agricultural production. Commune members were agricultural laborers virtually all of whom looked alike. Following reform, the peasants became relatively independent producers and operators. They had the right to make their own production decisions. They could choose what they would farm, how they would farm it, and ways to become rich. Consequently, more and more peasants devoted themselves to commodity production, left the land without leaving the village, headed for cities, and engaged in economically diversified tasks using different operating methods under different forms of ownership. The rise of nonagricultural industries and a nonstate owned economy was the basis reason for peasant occupational differentiation. As a result of rural reforms approximately one-half of the agricultural manpower under the traditional system has changed, or is in process of changing, occupation. (3) Socio-economic environment Is an Important Condition Affecting Peasant Occupational Differentiation Why is it that the degree of occupational differentiation differs substantially in different areas and different villages despite the same policies? This can be explained only in terms of the objective conditions such as socio-economic environment and availability of resources. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Table 4.

Agricultural laborers as a percentage of total manpower is 70.8 percent in the western region, 65.6 percent in the central region, and 57.0 percent in the eastern region. Clearly it is a result of the socio-economic environment in the different regions, which causes a stratification in the extent of peasant occupational diversification. The macroenvironment in open coastal regions, in particular has an extremely great affect on peasant occupational differentiation. In addition is the difference in topography, and differences in social environment and natural resources, which, generally speaking, affects peasant occupational diversification. However, it is only in an appropriate socio-economic environment that natural resources conditions can become transformed into real productivity. Peasant occupational differentiation is related to the degree of economic openness, the degree to which the commodity economy has developed, and the degrees to which the nonagricultural economy has developed. Without convenient transportation, and without the present of important things such as money, markets, facilities, technology, and information, which is to say that if the socio-economic environment is not very good, it is difficult to make most of advantages in plentiful natural resources. (4) Personal Traits Are the Decisive Element in Peasant Occupational Differentiation In the final analysis, peasant occupational differentiation comes down to peasant personal economic behavior. Ultimately the inherent force of economic development, the powerful impetus of economic policies, and the important influence of the economic environment have to be realized through the peasants. The peasants personal traits play a decisive role in occupational diversification. Take the three major areas of China as an example. In the eastern region, the level of education of rural manpower is higher overall than in the central and western regions. It is lowest in the western region. This is consistent with the progressive decrease east to west in the extent of peasant occupational differentiation (See Table 4). Using the same method to survey the average degree of peasant education in all occupations surveyed, one can see that the peasant that have differentiated into various occupations all have higher educations that agricultural laborers, hired employees and houseworkers who do not engage in production activities excepted. (See Table 5). Those having a higher degree of education update their ideas faster, more readily learn special skills, and have greater ability to adjust to their external environment. Changes in thinking lead to changes in behavior. Some peasants who have skills and ability have separated from the mass of agricultural laborers to take a road toward riches. This survey shows that most of those who have become rich first today have diversified out of agricultural labor. As to how they were able to get rich first, 56 percent of the peasants feel that they either had a special skill or they had a head for economics and business.
