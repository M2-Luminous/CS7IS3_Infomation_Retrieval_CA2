He said the Agency had received no word from North Korean authorities Monday, which led IAEA officials to believe that "for the time being" there was no reason to think the inspectors would be expelled. Yun Ho-chin, spokesman for Pyongyang's Vienna embassy, said Friday North Korea would take "adequate retaliatory measures" following an IAEA vote that day to suspend technical aid to North Korea in an escalating row over North Korea's refusal to meet international demands for inspection of its nuclear facilities. Yun said that North Korea's retaliatary measures could include the expulsion of IAEA inspectors from North Korea, a ban on all verification procedures, and a possible withdrawal of North Korea from the IAEA and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. But Kyd said no official message had reached the IAEA headquarters and its two inspectors were currently observing 8,000 spent fuel rods removed from the 5-megawatt Yongbyon experimental nuclear reactor. The inspectors were not allowed to take samples from the rods. The IAEA and Washington believe that Pyongyang has restricted the inspection of the reactor in order to conceal alleged diversion of nuclear material to an atomic weapons programme. Kyd said last Friday's IAEA resolution condemning North Korea for refusing to abide by its safeguards had been forwarded to the UN Security Council. He added that he expected the analysis of samples taken in May from a radio-chemical laboratory at Yongbyon to be available by the end of June.
