Recently, Japanese Foreign Minister Hata unprecedentedly picked on us by raving that we are going to produce nuclear weapons, that we are suspected of possessing one or two nuclear bombs, and that if North Korea refuses inspections again, or takes a vacillating attitude, or uses the nuclear card in a strange manner, Japan will take a staunch countermeasure within the boundary of the constitution. We cannot but take it seriously because Japan's top diplomatic authority personally came out to make such remarks. The Japanese foreign minister's remarks, which were made at a time when Japan's nuclear armament has actually reached a danger line and the Japanese reactionaries are seeking a legitimate pretext for nuclear armament, are in fact no different from an official announcement that Japan will openly proceed with nuclear armament. The problem is serious because Japan's nuclear armament is one of decisive obstacles that block the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. For the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula to become truly meaningful, it has to be able to guarantee peace and security of the region. However, under the condition that Japan's nuclear armament is becoming dangerous in actuality, even if the Korean peninsula is denuclearized, it will be useless being not able to guarantee peace and security of the region. Particularly, Japan's attempt to legalize the nuclear armament is bringing about a crisis of invalidating the Joint Declaration of Denuclearization between the North and the South. The objectives of the Joint Declaration of Denuclearization between the North and the South are to remove the risk of a nuclear war by denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, to form a favorable condition and environment for our country's peace and peaceful reunification, and to contribute to peace and security of Asia and the world. Japan's nuclear armament is bringing about an opposite result. Japan's nuclear armament is aggravating the nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula and forming a situation of tension. Since long ago, we have felt that the Joint Declaration of Denuclearization between the North and the South is useless as long as Japan's nuclear armament attempt is not withdrawn. The more Japanese authorities take issue with our nuclear issue in an attempt to legalize their nuclear armament, the stronger such a feeling grows. Because of this, we cannot but raise the question whether or not the Joint Declaration of Denuclearization between the North and the South is necessary. Judging from all these, we may face a situation of having no choice but to reconsider our position regarding the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

The Japanese authorities should take all the responsibilities. The Japanese authorities should carefully think about the dear price their remarks and behavior have to pay and act with discretion.
