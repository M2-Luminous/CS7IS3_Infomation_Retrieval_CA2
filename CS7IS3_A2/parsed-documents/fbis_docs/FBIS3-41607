P. Mozhin, member of the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences: ``The Organizing Principle of the System''] [Text] The system, that is, of active promotion of the improvement of the environmental situation in the country and the provision for the population's environmental safety through the mobilization of nonbudgetary financial resources and organization of their rational utilization--that Is How V. P. Mozhin, member of the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, views the Federal Environmental Foundation. The Law on Protection of the Environment envisages the establishment of a unified system of nonbudgetary state environmental foundations--federal, republic, kray, oblast and local foundations. They are supposed to take part in solving urgent environmental-protection problems, restoring losses in the natural environment, compensating for damage that has been caused, and carrying out other environmental-protection measures. This system started functioning in practical terms a year ago. The foundations' financial resources--ZELENYY MIR's readers know this--are being created in accordance with established normative rates, through the payments of enterprises and organizations that pollute the environment and fines for the violation of environmental-protection legislation. The law specifies that 60 percent of the money received by environmental foundations is to be used for environmental-protection measures at the city and rayon level 30 percent is to be used for measures at the kray and oblast level; and 10 percent is to be allocated to the Federal Environmental Foundation, whose activities have been of interest to ZELENYY MIR's readers with increasing frequency. We believe that the following article by Academician V. L. Mozhin, chairman of that foundation's board, contains answers to most of the questions ZELENYY MIR has received about what the foundation's money will be spent on and what problems its board envisages tackling. At present, in connection with the reduction of budgetary financing, the nonbudgetary environmental foundations are becoming one of the main investors in environmental-protection activities. Over the past year the monies of the Federal Environmental Foundation were used for a broad spectrum of environmental measures. The greatest share went for participation in the financing of research and development on resource-conserving types of machinery and technology and control systems. Substantial funds were invested in the development and outfitting of nature preserves, national parks and nature reserves. Financial support was provided to organizations engaged in the environmental enlightenment and education of the public, and in various environmental publications. To improve the activities of the whole system of foundations, serious work needs to be done on improving the normative rates of payments for pollution, a number of legal questions need to be resolved, and correct approaches, criteria and priorities in choosing specific environmental-protection measures to be financed out of the environmental foundations' monies need to be gradually figured out. It appears that the monies of the Federal Environmental Foundation should be spent mainly for measures that ar of statewide significance. In the system of instruments for the implementation of state policy in the area of environmental protection, an extremely important place belongs to interstate, federal and regional programs for addressing the most urgent environmental problems. These programs, which so far exist only in the form of drafts, have been adopted by the Federal Environmental Foundation as its main guidelines in selecting measures for financing. The Waste Program. The total amount of all types of accumulated wastes in the Russian Federation comes to about 50 billion tonnes; and the storage of them occupies about 250,000 hectares of land space. Every year about 75 million tonnes of hazardous industrial wastes are formed. The purpose of the program is to meet one condition for the country's environmentally safe development: the stabilization and eventual reduction of environmental pollution and saving of natural resources through the maximum possible use of wastes in the economy. The Ozone Program. The goal of the program is to ensure the step-by-step reduction of the production of ozone-destroying compounds, and the putting into production and use of ozone-safe coolants. The Provision for the Conservation and Rational Utilization of Lake Baykal's Natural Resources Program. The program's goal is to ensure the stable development of the Baykal region and the restoration of Lake Baykal's unique ecosystems. The Rational Utilization of Water Resources and Restoration of Water Quality Program, subprogram: The Saving and Rational Utilization of Water Resources in Moscow and Improvement of the Reliability of Its Water Supply (in the period up to 2000). The program's goal is the conservation and rational utilization of water resources, the development and implementation of measures to improve the quality of surface and ground waters, the development and introduction of environmentally clean water-use technologies, and the development of methods and equipment for the treatment of effluent and methods of intensifying the self-cleansing of bodies of water, including the attainment, in stages, of drinking-water quality in water-supply sources and bodies of water. The Improvement of the Environmental Situation and Enhancement of the Volga Basin's Resource and Economic Potential (Revival of the Volga) Program. The need to develop the program stems from the especially complex environmental situation in the Volga basin. The program's goal is to improve the environmental situation in the Volga River basin. The Ecological Improvement of the Environment and Protection of the Health of the Population of Tula Oblast in 1993-1994 and in the Long Range up to 2000. The program's goal is to carry out an experiment in Tula Oblast in working out economic, organizational and legal methods for the ecological improvement of its territory and protection of the population's health. The program has been approved by the Russian Federation government. The Russia's Participation in Improving the Environmental Situation in the Sea Basins and the Arctic Program. The program's goal is the stabilization and improvement of the environmental situation in the basins of international seas; the provision of required scientific research for and development of specific measures at industrial and agricultural enterprises and in municipal services; and the provision for the protection and rational utilization of the natural resources of the Russian Arctic. The Protection and Restoration of the Species Diversity of Fauna and Flora, and the Preservation of the Biota's Gene Pool Program. The program's goal is to ensure the nonexhaustive use of fauna and flora, and the development of new methods for preserving the gene pool and species diversity of flora and fauna. The idea here is to finance work to develop and support a system of especially protected natural territories. Obviously, the development and implementation of the aforementioned programs will require many billions in outlays and fairly long time periods, and the Federal Environmental Foundation's financial capabilities will make it possible to take part in this work only within certain limits. But what is important is that, in selecting environmental-protection measures for financing, we will proceed on the basis of their importance to the implementation of the indicated programs, which are aimed at solving the most urgent problems. In addition, the foundation is proposing to take part on a shared basis in the implementation of pilot programs for the development of certain environmental-protection and resource-conserving technological processes, units and production processes. In accordance with the Statute on the Russian Federation Federal Environmental Foundation, it is also planned to provide financing for measures for the environmental upbringing and education of the population. Financing of the development and implementation of specific programs and individual measures will be carried out in accordance with the Statute on the Russian Federation Federal Environmental Foundation and on the basis of statements of requirement and technical and economic feasibility studies presented by clients of programs or projects. The results of the activities of the environmental foundations' system will in large part depend on the success achieved in organizing the joint work of the federal and territorial foundations. The strengthening of the Federal Environmental Foundation's financial base is also a top priority. So far its financial capabilities are limited by the fact that some of the territorial environmental foundations have not been reallocating it the 10 percent deductions stipulated by law. In 1992 there were 24 such foundations (the foundations of 12 republics in the Russian Federation, six national okrugs and six oblasts). This year the environmental foundations of the following republics continue to evade the reallocation of monies to the Federal Environmental Foundation: Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, Kalmykia-Khalm Tangch and Dagestan; the Kabardino-Balkar, Karachayevo-Cherkess and Chechen krays; and Krasnodar, Maritime, Voloda, Sverdlovsk, Irkutsk and Sakhalin oblasts. In order to expand the financial capabilities of the nonbudgetary environmental foundations' system, it would be a good idea to establish an Environmental Bank. The establishment the foundation projects of a Center for Business Cooperation in the Area of Environmental Protection would contribute to the concentration of information on the latest equipment and technologies, and to the improvement of publishing activities in the field of environmental protection.
