An agreement on setting up a telephone hotline between the two countries' defense ministers in order to hold consultations and exchange opinions on defense and security issues was reached last September during the official visit of the Russian minister to the United States. Yelena Agapova, the Russian defense minister's aide responsible for public and press relations, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that in their telephone conversation the defense ministers discussed a number of military-political issues of mutual interest. More specifically, they exchanged views on the prospects of bilateral cooperation in the military-political sphere and agreed on a number of issues concerning the preparations for the Russian-American command and staff exercise of peacemaking troops, scheduled to be held in the summer of 1994 in the Privolzhskiy Military District. At Les Aspin's request, Pavel Grachev set out his point of view on questions of the possible expansion of NATO. "We support a path which would lead to a truly all-European security system," the Russian minister said. "We believe that security and international stability should be inseparable and be backed up by all-European structures." Regarding the question of military cooperation between Russia and NATO, Pavel Grachev noted that today it is being implemented on a bilateral basis and within the framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. This includes questions of peacekeeping activity, within the framework of which the possibility is being discussed of preparing for and carrying out joint peacekeeping operations under the aegis of the United Nations and the CSCE and training military cadres to take part in peacekeeping operations. "It is our hope that the `partnership for peace' concept, proposed by the United States, will not lead to a broadening of NATO detrimental to Russia's interests, but will help to strengthen stability in Europe," Pavel Grachev stressed.
