At the fourth national conference held today to crack down on illegal exports of textile products through transit trade, Zhou Keren, director of the MOFTEC Control Department, announced the circular on the decision to punish the four enterprises. The circular said: In August 1993, the Shankou branch of the Dongmao Industrial Company in Shenyang singed a contract with the Zhuoxing Company in Hong Kong to export 6,200 dozen jeans shorts and 1,980 dozen knitted women's pajamas to Singapore. This batch of goods was processed and manufactured by the Fulong Garment Plant in Guangdong's Zhongshan, the Xiangjing Woolen Garment Plant in Shenyang, and the Warp Knitting Plant in Yingkou City. The goods were labeled "made in Fiji." In October and November last year, the goods were shipped in batches to Singapore and then re-exported to the United States. The goods were tracked down and seized by the U.S. Customs. The MOFTEC has decided to confiscate the income of the Dongmao Industrial Company derived from this business deal; to cancel all its textile product export quotas as well as its right to apply for a textile product export quota for 1994; and to order Shenyang City's Commission of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation to suspend all business activities of the Shankou branch of this company. The MOFTEC has suggested that the competent department mete out administrative punishment to those who are directly responsible for this matter. In June 1993, the Guangyu Shareholding Xiamen Company in Fujian signed a contract with Taiwan's Jianru [Chienju] Enterprise Company, Limited to export 8,500 towel coverlets to Taiwan. In accordance with the request of this Taiwan firm, the Guangyu Shareholding Xiamen Company attached labeles saying "made in Thailand," provided by the Taiwan firm, on the customs declaration, invoice, and packing list. In July of the same year Qingdao customs discovered the goods when the company submitted its customs declaration. The MOFTEC has decided to fine the company a sum of 20 percent of the value of the contract, suspend its textile product export right for two years, and correspondingly reduce Xiamen city's textile export quota for 1995. The two other companies receiving punishment are garment plants in Guangdong Province's Shantou City. One is Shantou city's Shifa Dress-Making Company, Limited. In the crevices of the "washable" labels of 1,560 cotton shorts it manufactured for export were stitched made in Hong Kong" labels. In September 1993, this batch of goods was discovered and seized by a product inspection organ. The company had been punished. The other was the Yongjia Garment Manufacturing Company, Limited in Shantou city. All 4,080 pair of cotton shorts it processed and manufactured for export were sewn with "made in Hong Kong" labels covered by offset printing paper printed with the words "made in China." In December 1993, this batch of goods was seized by a goods inspection organ, and the company had been punished. The penalties meted out to these two enterprises by the MOFTEC were: suspending the two companies' textile product export rights for two years; correspondingly reducting Guangdong's textile export quota for 1995; and suggesting that the competent department mete out administrative punishment to those directly responsible for the fraud. The circular urged the relevant foreign trade and economic cooperation commissions in the areas mentioned in the circular to concentrate on checking the textile product and garment processing enterprises in their respective areas to prevent recurrences of similar incidents, and asked customs not to handle export customs declarations for these few enterprises whose textile product export rights have been temporarily suspended.
