A special topic for discussion, he said, was the situation of various Asian countries, namely China, Thailand, and Japan, in encountering the protectionist trade measures imposed by the United States and European Union. Both Thailand and China have agreed with the concept of an Asia for Asia cooperation program. Under this program, Asian nations will join hands in developing the quality standards of their products, boosting the standard of living of their peoples, and coordinating the management of their natural resources in line with their cultural values so that they will not be dominated by western and U.S. influences. Bunchu said: "Prime Minister Chuan Likphai will bring up this issue for discussion and consultation with Japanese officials during his visit to Japan in April." Asked if the Asia for Asia program is a form of free trade cooperation, Bunchu replied that configuration has not been discussed. Further consultation must be held with all countries concerned to decide what can be done. Several countries will participate in this plan, which will include cultural cooperation. Bunchu also said that he will visit China at the invitation of the Chinese trade minister, and discuss with the Chinese side trade and investment cooperation among the four nations [Thailand, Laos, Burma, and China] under the Northern Quadrangle economic development program.
