The conference relayed the important instructions issued by the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee on strengthening judicial and public security work and the important speeches given by Comrades Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Ren Jianxin at the national public security and judicial conference. Cao Hongming, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and secretary of the provincial Commission on Politics and Law, delivered a work report. Yu Xingde, vice governor and deputy secretary of the provincial commission, chaired the conference. Cao Hongming began his report by analyzing the current situation on the province's judicial and public security front. He pointed out: At present, the province enjoys political and social stability, which has served as an important guarantee for the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and economic construction. However, closer attention must still be paid to problems in public order. A total of 69,846 criminal cases occurred in the province last year, an increase of 6.7 percent over the previous year. Of the total number, 22,257 involved major crimes. As new structures replace the old and as the volumes of personnel, monetary, and property exchanges expand, factors contributing to violations of law and crimes have also notably increased. In the current new situation of reform, opening up, and accelerated economic construction, we must bring into full play the role of judicial and public security work in safeguarding and serving our cause. Judicial and public security work must be strengthened; it must not be weakened. Cao Hongming pointed out: Our major public security and judicial tasks in 1994 are: Using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as guide, and taking into consideration the requirements for building a socialist market economic structure, we shall earnestly strengthen and reform judicial and public security work; augment the functions of the people's democratic dictatorship; resolutely crack down on the sabotage activities of hostile forces and elements as well as on serious criminal and economic offenses; implement measures for comprehensively tackling problems of public order in an all-around way; and strengthen the building of the public security and judicial ranks to effectively safeguard and serve, through the use of law, the construction and perfection of our socialist market economy and create a favorable social environment for the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of Jiangsu's economy. Cao Hongming stressed: We must continue to maintain the strong momentum of the struggle launched in various localities to sternly and expeditiously punish serious criminal elements in accordance with the law. We must direct the primary spearhead of the struggle at major criminals who have a very bad influence on society, such as murderers, robbers, hooligans, rapists, kidnappers who cruelly harm their hostages, and burglars; and at violent and organized crimes, particularly those committed by underworld figures, gangs, and local criminal forces, which pose serious threats to public security. We must resolve every prominent problem of public order as soon as it appears; we must not allow it to become uncontrollable. We must deepen the struggle against corruption by concentrating on major, high-profile cases. We must investigate all corruption cases through to the end, regardless of the persons involved. We must correctly deal with contradictions within the ranks of people in the new situation, deepen investigation and research, and carry out ideological-political work with a clear objective in mind. Cao Hongming pointed out: We must further mobilize all social forces, strengthen grass-roots work, and implement measures for comprehensively tackling problems of public order in an all-around way. We must strengthen population management with a clear objective in mind, intensify management and control of the social aspects of urban and rural activities, further improve crime prevention and control by the masses, strengthen traffic and fire prevention management, establish and perfect a leadership responsibility system to comprehensively tackle problems of public order, and earnestly implement the policy under which a leader is responsible for maintaining public order in areas under his jurisdiction. Cao Hongming urged principal responsible comrades of the party and government at various levels in the province to devote more energy to judicial and public security work. He said: Responsible leaders should attend to specific work to strengthen guidance and inspection. Other leading comrades in different work posts should also concern themselves with judicial and public security work. Vigorous efforts should be made to improve the overall standards and fighting capacity of our public security and judicial ranks. A general drive to educate public security and judicial cadres and police in the goal of serving the people and building a clean government, and in the legal system should be launched to truly raise their ideological-political standards. Dai Guangzhen, deputy director of the provincial party committee's Organization Department, gave a speech on implementing the leadership responsibility system to comprehensively tackle problems of public order. More than 200 people attended the conference, including members of the provincial party committee's Commission on Politics and Law and Committee for Comprehensive Management of Public Security; responsible comrades of city and county party committees in charge of judicial and public security work; and responsible comrades of other relevant provincial and city departments.
