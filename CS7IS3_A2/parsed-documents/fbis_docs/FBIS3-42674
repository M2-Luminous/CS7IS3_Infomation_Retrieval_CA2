The Will of the Imam "Success on the roads!" the nice-looking Lena Shmeleva regularly repeats in "Avtomig." The deeper meaning of this wish becomes clear in the cab of the ZIL on the Osh-Khorog route which links Kyrgyzstan to Gornyy Badakhshan. No formalities are needed with the Pamir drivers. The currency of independent Kyrgyzstan, the som, is less popular than Russian rubles and 10 or 20 thousand of them are "taken" from the drivers. Yet life in the disgraced Gornyy Badakhshan is hanging by the thread of this high mountain route: This is the only remaining relatively stable channel for bringing to the autonomous republic flour and oil from the "Fund of Agakhan" and fuel and cement for construction of the Pamir-1 hydroelectric power plant. The humanitarian aid of the "Fund of Agakhan" and the construction of the hydroelectric power plant today have become effective channels through which Dushanbe authorities can apply pressure on the Gornyy-Badakhshan autonomous region. "Unless Pamir-1 is started up in the winter there will be a catastrophe in Khorog," says the journalist G. Mamadloikov. Yet it is deliveries of cement and the supply of fuel that are regularly slowed up and cut off. Relations between the Dushanbe authorities and Badakhshan remain deadlocked. Official Khorog has formally distanced itself from the armed opposition and from the orientation of Badakhshan self-defense commanders, restricting itself to defense of only their own territory, without intervening in the civil war outside Pamir. But the sympathies of many residents of Badakhshan are with the opposition leaders: Kazikolon Turadzhonzod, Davlat, Khudonazarov, the mujahidin field commanders Rizvon and Dzhuma-Boy and the head of the "transition government in emigration" Mullah Abdullo Nuri--this is obvious. Nonetheless at a recent conference between Rizvon and the Badakhshan commanders it was decided that the Badakhshan troops would concentrate only on defending their own territory. A significant factor affected this decision. In October the deputy chairman of the Supreme Council of Tajikistan, Kazidavlat Koimdodov, met in Geneva with Karim Shakh al-Khuseyn and Imam Agakhan IV--the spiritual head of the Muslim Ismailites who constitute almost all of the population of Pamir. For several days Koimdodov travelled through the Badakhshan villages speaking about the meeting with the Imam and he repeated many times the Agakhan's demand to refrain from participation in the Tajik civil war. If this demand is not complied with, the Imam will stop the humanitarian aid. Agakhan is the unassailable authority for every Ismailite. Moreover, the humanitarian aid from the Fund of Agakhan is the only thing making it possible today for the population of 200,000 in Pamir to exist. The Imam's demand is the law, even if it is conveyed by the deputy of Emomali Rakhmonov. Who Is Defending Whom? Respect for the Imam is perhaps the only thing that unites Badakhshan society today. The civilian activists of Khorog, self-defense troops, and politicized refugees are consolidated around the executive committee of the oblast council headed by its chairman, Balkhiyer Zamirov. They are oriented toward expansion of the independence of Badakhshan, strengthening of its civic structures, and economic and administrative reforms. In a large region--Verkhniy Khorog--the influence of the Communist Party is traditionally strong. Here they are aspiring to reconciliation with Dushanbe and blame all of Pamir's problems on the opposition and local commandos. The mouthpiece of this tendency is the presidium of the oblast council headed by Gambsho Shakhbozov. The main political objective of the reformists is for Badakhshan to achieve the status of an autonomous republic. It has already been conferred without preliminary permission and has been recognized by the Tajik opposition. The Dushanbe government, avoiding a categorical refusal, is insisting on "postponing a decision on the problem until the situation stabilizes." Naturally, the political antagonism only aggravates the social problems. The fellow traveler of the blockade--the total deficit--is turning into impoverishment, black market speculation, and unrestrained mafia activity. Not every family has a garden and a ram, and the average wage of 10,000-15,000 rubles [R], paid as if by force, does not enable everyone to take advantage of the services of merchants who produce food, clothing, and consumer goods from Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan. Strikes are developing among workers of budget-financed organizations. "With this kind of poverty it is impossible to put an end to contraband drugs," states the former minister of foreign affairs of Tajikistan, General M. Navzhuvanov. Recently the fight against drug trafficking has been the main task of the Khorog border detachment. Officers of Russian border troops candidly admit that without help from Badakhshan self-defense forces, not only is it impossible to hope to close off the border, but one cannot even speak about elementary safety of the border guards. There have been no victims in the four seizures of hostages in recent months only because of intervention from the Badakhshan commanders, who each time went to the negotiations with their Afghan "colleagues" and achieved the release of the Russian military men. "It is not they who are protecting us but we are protecting them," said a Badakhshan commando. "But Kozyrev and Grachev keep this in mind in Moscow when they are helping Rakhmonov." The border guards did not respond. Tug of War The Kulyab nomenklatura-mafia clan, which won in the civil war in 1992, has extracted everything it could from the victory. Its representatives control all key posts in the organs of power. The Tajik army and other power structures are under its jurisdiction. It still has reliable military support--the Russian 201st Division. But still the path back has been cut off for it as has any possibility of compromise--the military crimes of the army of Sangak Safarov, in whose ranks practically all the "Kulyab leaders" fought, were too great. The Leninabad nomenklatura, whose 55-year rule was shaken by the May victory of the Democratic Islam opposition in 1992, recognized its mistake. The bureaucratic business of Leninabad-Khudzhand financed the organization and arming of the Sangak People's Front but the administrators and bosses of the Communist Party of Tajikistan (KPT) were crowded out of power by the Kulyab commando leaders. In order to protect themselves from armed attacks, residents of Leninabad even had to blow up the bridge that joins the oblast to the rest of Tajikistan and think seriously about becoming autonomous themselves--this is the soil on which the accelerated rapprochement between the Khudzhan and Khorog leaders appeared. In this arrangement it is instructive to look at the position of the Leninabad boss Sasafaral Kendzhayev, former chairman of the republic's Supreme Council, around whom the "Tajik knot" was tied in the spring of '92. An active participant in the war who in October '92 made a bloody attempt to seize Dushanbe, and an experienced political intriguer, after the "victory" Kendzhayev was pushed into the background by competitors from Kulyab. Left as merely the rayon procurator, he quickly went over to the opposition, retaining and reinforcing his own armed guard made up of ethnic Uzbeks from Gissar and began to cautiously explore the possibilities of joint actions...with the Democratic Islam opposition! He formulated a package of demands on the government clearly intended to support the opposition, especially those from Pamir: the resignation of all Kulyab leaders (true, Rakhmonov was a possible exception), redistribution among the regions of posts in the power structures, return to the refugees of real estate and other property seized from them, etc. A solid foundation for the "Leninabad revenge" is being prepared by the slowly but confidently unfolding processes of nomenklatura privatization: The monopolistic monolith of state industry remains unshakable and the distributors of state property, pumping funds into commercial structures, are opening light productions and trade enterprises. The interests of the nomenklatura bourgeoisie of a "Deng Xiaoping" bent are objectively coming into conflict with the "kimirsenov" solidity of the Kulyab commandos. On the other hand, the position of the ruling regime is made burdensome by the ideology of the KPT, which actually contradicts the interests of the Dushanbe elite. The KPT is a part of the SKP [United Communist Party]-CPSU, and the restoration of the USSR is the cornerstone of its program. This is not very inspiring to the heads of the regime who think that they are assured patronage from Tashkent and Moscow. On the soil of this contradiction arose the People's Party (NPT) headed by the first deputy chairman of the Supreme Council, A. Dostiyev, who is assigned the role of supporting the regime (like the Democratic Party of Turkmenistan under President S. Niyazov) and at the same time--acting as a weapon for Dostiyev in his struggle for power. As long as the tug of war is going on, the threat of the collapse of Tajikistan becomes more and more real. Expansion of the independence of Badakhshan can no longer be stopped even with force. Leninabad-Khudzhand, which is rich and closely linked to Tashkent, is quite capable of autonomy. Gissarskiy Rayon with its significant Uzbek population has long been drawn to Uzbekistan. Khatlon (a combination of Kulyab and Kurgan-Tyube Oblast) and the Garm group of rayons, where the influence of Islamic political forces is strong, are tied up in a war with one another which could ultimately compare to the land of Dushanbe... But, "we came with blood...." Party Committees and Mosques They understand all this in Badakhshan. They were clearly sympathetic to the appointment of Rizvon as minister of defense in the "transition government" of Abdullo Nuri. The line of the Kazikolon Turadzhonzod, which presupposes a political resolution to the conflict, is losing influence. Proponents of maximum consolidation of armed opposition and overthrow of the current Dushanbe regime by force are coming to the fore. "I personally think negotiations and a peaceful regulation are impossible," says Khadzhi Badakhshi, one of the military leaders of the opposition and coordinator of the Badakhshan mujahidin. "The current power must be unconditionally overthrown, and this will be done by the armed forces of the mujahidin who are supported by the Tajik people. Russian troops must be expelled from Tajikistan. This pertains both to the 201st Division and to the border guards. Our armed forces are quite capable of controlling their border themselves." "Among the mujahidin they are speaking more and more frequently about a jihad. Does this mean dissemination of the ideology of Islamic fundamentalism?" "No," Khadzhi answers resolutely. "A jihad today is not a war for Islam but an anticommunist liberation war. The war is also revenge against the murderers." Khadzhi Badakhshi emphasized that what he said is his own personal viewpoint. The "transition government" is still just developing its final position. But it very much seems that it will finally be formed in precisely these configurations. How is Russia to figure out its role and its interests in view of this quite real prospect? Russia ends up in the role of a helpless observer in the face of Afghan internal conflicts which affect its vital interests. Forcing General Dustum, a creature of the Uzbek neocommunist regime, from the scene, the fundamentalist Golboddin Hekmatyar and the moderate Islamist Ahmad Shah Masood, a more "Europeanized" figure and one who is oriented toward Islamic modernism, came together. The weakening of Dustum's position is objectively advantageous to Russia--which cannot be said, however, about the strengthening of Hekmatyar. The "contact" with Masood, the official minister of defense of the IGA [Islamic State of Afghanistan], who is popular in both Afghanistan and Tajikistan, "through the head" of the Hekmatyar leadership would help to stabilize Russian interests not only in Afghanistan itself but also with respect to the Tajik war. In the second place, the matter is actually proceeding to a point where Tajikistan, Russia's potential stronghold in Central Asia, is gradually entering the zone of Islamization. Pro-Islam sentiments are growing in Uzbekistan, especially in its southern regions (Fergana, Namangan). It cannot be ruled out that the sinking dictatorship will try to play the card of Islamization in Tajikistan next. "Everything is ready in Leninabad," said B. Zamirov in Khorog. "The union of party committees and mosques is becoming stronger there. They are just waiting for a signal. After all, portraits of Marx, Lenin, and Najibollah hung in Afghanistan too--and nobody even noticed when they were replaced with green flags." It is difficult to argue with this.
