The poll conducted at LA PRENSA's request by the Dichter and Neira/Lou Harris polling firm gave the following results: Ruben Blades, 40.2 percent; Ernesto Perez Balladares, 29 percent; Ruben Dario Carles, 18.9 percent; and Eduardo Vallarino, 4.9 percent. The question asked was: Regardless of your presidential preference, who do you think won the presidential debate? Seven percent of those polled did not answer the question or said they did not know who had won. The margin of error in this poll is plus or minus 5 percent. Of those polled, 32.2 percent said their answer was not based on their party preferences, while 57 percent admitted their answer was related to their preferences. Meanwhile, 10.8 percent said they did not know whether their answer was based on their party preference. Asked whether the presidential debate changed their opinion, 76.9 percent replied it did not, while 11.5 percent said it did. Another 11.6 percent said they did not know. Of those polled, 57 percent were women and 43 percent were men. As for their ages, 43.7 percent were between the ages of 18 and 35; 30.1 percent between 36 and 49; and 26.2 percent were 50 or older. A similar poll conducted by Dichter and Neira after the 11 April presidential debate showed Blades in the top spot, followed by Perez Balladares, Carles, and Vallarino. In the debate, which was organized by the Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies (ILDEA) and the Media Presidential Debate Committee, the candidates discussed general issues like the economy, culture, the Canal, population growth, the prison system, and the Constitution.
