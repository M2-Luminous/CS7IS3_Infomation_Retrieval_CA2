I have toured many places in Japan, and I have been able to see for myself where ROK-Japan relations are close and where they remain not close. There have been two big events of misfortune in relations between the countries -- the war of 1592-97 and the 36 years of colonial rule [1909-45]. It is regrettable that these unfortunate historical events are still having their effects. Historical events do not disappear completely but, given deep mutual understanding, they can in fact beget strong relations of friendship and cooperation. Last year, about 2.6 million people visited each other's country, and cultural exchanges are extensive. In the past, the ROK Government put restraints on such things as Japanese entertainment films and pop songs because it was thought that these would adversely affect Korean society. The new government has so far taken the position of opening up such types of popular culture step by step, in view of the past events concerning Japan. The question -- as it always has been -- is that of when [to open up completely]. Next year it will be 50 years since the ROK became independent, and 30 years since ROK-Japanese relations were normalized. Maybe the time has come to think specifically about the timing of lifting the bans, to enable the new governments of the two nations to solidify their friendly, cooperative relations. There are plans for the ROK-Japanese production of movies, and there are also plans to show Korean movies in Japan. Starting slow and then moving more quickly -- that is the way we should do it. It is important that in the meantime the people of both nations resolve, one by one, the issues that are impeding their cultural exchanges. Economic Relations The removal of the trade imbalance is a major pending issue. South Korea had a $8.4 billion trade deficit with Japan last year, and its accumulated deficit with Japan increased to $82.6 billion. As a way of remedying the problem, Korea called on Japan to implement "political considerations," for instance by removing tariff and nontariff barriers on Korean products and by making more technologies available to Korea. But such remedies lacked practicality and thus only helped to complicate the two countries' relations. Consequently, the new government is trying to review this problem from the viewpoint of "economic logic." There is also a desire to create an atmosphere which can attract Japanese companies possessing technology to invest in the country. What we want to do is to improve on the system so that the technologies of South Korea and Japan can be combined in promoting industries. Technical training carried out for small and medium enterprises based on the action plans that came out of the 1992 ROK-Japanese summit has been effective. But Japan needs to create conditions that will enable the Japanese market to import more Korean goods. Japan's tariffs on Korean products are very low. Thus, it can be said that the outer walls have been taken down but that the problem now lies with the inner walls. For instance, even if a Korean company wants to sell Korean-made vehicles to Japan, the former government officials who now lead Japanese industry would not accept them. The Japanese Government itself is making efforts to deal with the situation by implementing a complaint arbitration system, but the system is not working well. We will do some soul-searching on our part and will make efforts to increase our exports to Japan, but unless Japan takes action to take down the inner walls by easing controls on foreign products, the problem really cannot be solved. War Reparations Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remark specifically and clearly admitting an "act of aggression" [Japan's invasion of other countries in World War II] is considered refreshing and has been highly appreciated [in South Korea]. As for the issue of Army comfort women, President Kim Yong-sam takes the position of "not seeking financial compensation from Japan," and the [Korean] government is providing payments to aid the lives of these people. The ROK Government will not make any further requests with respect to this issue, but neither is Japan coming up with any specific measures to deal with the matter. Where the question of postwar reparations is concerned, there are many other pending issues, such as assistance to South Koreans left in Sakhalin and suits filed against the Japanese Government by South Korean residents in Japan who were wounded while serving in the Japanese Army. To resolve these, there is no other way but for the two countries to come together and tackle the issues sincerely and steadily within the framework of the ROK-Japanese treaty. It is important to learn from history if we do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past. It would be desirable to entrust private-sector specialists from the two countries with the work of preparing schools' history textbooks which are not biased and to encourage them to cooperate in studies otherwise. In an Independence Day speech, President Kim said something different from what past presidents had said. The president said, "We must not cling to the emotions of past days. The country must have confidence and pride in itself, and must cooperate and compete with Japan in an open and frank manner." What is demanded is a perspective on how Japan and South Korea, which have common values with respect to a free democracy and a market economy, should cooperate in contributing to the coexistence and coprosperity of East Asia and the world in the future. Japan is about to reach a big turning point in foreign relations, by wanting to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council, for example. In doing so, Japan must first of all make its connections with its nearest neighbor, South Korea, sturdier. Otherwise, Japan's dealings with the other nations of Asia will not go smoothly, either. Japan is asked to think clearly about the roles appropriate for it as a great nation. That will better enable Japan's neighbors to formulate a policy toward it. North Korean Nuclear Issue We are disappointed by the actions of North Korea (DPRK) on the nuclear issue. It is beneficial for that country itself and desirable for the peace and stability of East Asia for North Korea to clear up the nuclear issue and to behave as a responsible member of the international community. I think that the North -- which has so many issues on its plate, such as the problems of maintaining its political system and of reconstructing its economy -- is using the nuclear issue as a trump card. There is the question of how much longer the international community can put up with all of this. The situation is getting precarious. As far as South Korea is concerned, it has no other choice but to act according to strict principles. President Kim Yong-sam called for a South-North summit, in hoping to find a solution to the nuclear issue. If the summit becomes a reality, and if agreements made at the summit are implemented, mutual trust will grow, and this can develop into South-North exchanges and economic cooperation. For that to happen, it is important that the North actively tackle the task of fulfilling the matters that have been agreed on at the meetings of U.S.-DPRK senior officials. The North should recognize fully that if it plays games with the United States for too long, the latter's patience will wear out.
