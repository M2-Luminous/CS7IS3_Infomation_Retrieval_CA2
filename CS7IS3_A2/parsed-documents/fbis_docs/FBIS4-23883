FBIS4-23883 "drafr118_a_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-118 Daily Report 19 Jun 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda Red Cross Hospital Shelled Red Cross Hospital Shelled AB1906161594 Paris AFP in English 1558 GMT 19 Jun 94 AB1906161594 Paris AFP English BFN [By Annie Thomas] [Excerpt] Kigali, June 19 (AFP) -- A young Rwandan woman was killed and three others were injured when three shells fell on the Red Cross hospital in the centre of Kigali Sunday [19 June], as France continued preparations for sending an international intervention force to protect civilians from the conflict. Philippe Gaillard, head of the Kigali delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said one shell fell on a hospital building, another one near by and a third close to a wing where 50 orphans were sheltering. The hospital, the only medical centre in the government-held sector of the city, has around 600 patients -- "injured people who can't walk and can't be moved," Gaillard said. The Tutsi-led rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) intensified its shelling of the town centre Sunday, a UN spokesman said. The rebels had seized control of Mount Kigali, a hill overlooking the south-west of the town, he added. Wounded men, women and children lay helpless on stretchers or plastic sheets outside the hospital Sunday. The medical team of three Doctors and five nurses is running out of bandages and places to put their patients, Gaillard said. Gaillard said he had pleaded with the RPF to stop shelling the hospital but was rebuffed. The RPF told him the hospital is within the government-held zone and that government forces are in position in the hospital's immediate surrounds, he said. The rebels continued their advance in the rest of the country Sunday towards Butare in the south and Kibuye in the west. General Romeo Dallaire, commander of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda said he was "surprised" at the speed of the RPF's advance. The rebel movement seized the town of Gitarama, a former government hold-out situated between Kigali and Butare, a week earlier. In Kigali, the UN had attempted to persuade the warring factions to observe a truce for a few hours to allow the evacuation of civilian refugees from the Sainte-Famille church building. The evacuation of displaced persons in the rebel-held sector was set to occur simultaneously. On Saturday, the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) had stepped up its evacuation of civilians trapped in Kigali on either side of the front line, with six convoys from the Mille-Collines hotel in the government-held sector and from the King Faisal hospital in rebel territory. The Mille-Collines hotel is now empty and UNAMIR now plans to resume evacuations from the hospital as well as the Sainte-Famille church, UN spokesman Major Jean-Guy Plante said. [passage omitted]
