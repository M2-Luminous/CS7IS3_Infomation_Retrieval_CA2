The National Defense Ministry statement made it clear that air traffic regulations had been violated south of Limnos and the established practice to deal with them was followed. The issue has been given broad coverage in the Turkish press as it was linked to the underwater drilling being conducted near Thasos for the exploration of oil. But in an attempt to defuse the issue, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel admitted that the drilling is being conducted in Greek territorial waters. However, Demirel added that if the explorations extend beyond Greece's territorial waters there might be complications, since no agreement has been reached on the question of the Aegean continental shelf. The Turkish Foreign Ministry denied through its spokesman that Greece's underwater drilling east of Thasos causes tension in Greek-Turkish relations.
