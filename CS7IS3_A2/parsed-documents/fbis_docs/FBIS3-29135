The appeal came after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed at their summit in Washington Friday to resolve a dispute over "objective criteria" demanded by the United States to measure progress in reducing Japan's trade surplus. "They should continue their dialogue from a viewpoint that Japan-U.S. relations are the most important bilateral relationship for both countries," said Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren). Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), described the failure to reach agreement over "objective criteria" unavoidable. "This is because Japan has stuck to its policy of rejecting the U.S. managed trade-like approach. It's unavoidable," Hiraiwa said in a statement. Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, concerned about a possible U.S. move to take retaliatory action against Japan, expressed hope that the U.S. will use "good sense" in settling trade issues. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, meanwhile, praised the Japanese negotiators for refusing the U.S. demand that numerical targets be set to measure progress in the opening of Japan's auto and auto parts markets. In a statement, it expressed regret that Japan has failed to obtain U.S. understanding of the industry group's position. It also expressed the hope that the breakdown in the auto trade negotiations will not cause the U.S. to impose trade sanctions and take other unilateral action against Japan. Such action would contravene the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) for liberalizing world trade, the association said. Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corp., also expressed regret over the failure of the talks and promised continued efforts to promote overseas production of Japanese automobiles and expand auto imports.
