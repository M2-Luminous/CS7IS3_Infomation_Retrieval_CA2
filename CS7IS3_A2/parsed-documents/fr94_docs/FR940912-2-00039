FR940912-2-00039 FR940912-2-00032 Issuance of Decisions and Orders During the Week of July 4 Through July 8, 1994 During the week of July 4 through July 8, 1994, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with respect to applications for refund or other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy. The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. Refund Applications Texaco Inc./Canterbery's Texaco, 7/6/94, RR321&hyph;158 The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning Motion for Reconsideration that Jimmy Canterbery, the owner of Canterbery's Texaco, filed in the Texaco refund proceeding. Mr. Canterbery had previously filed an Application for Refund that was dismissed in July 1972 because of his failure to provide motor gasoline purchase information necessary to support his refund claim. In his reconsideration request, which was filed in June 1994, Mr. Canterbery included purchase information. However, this information was submitted more than three months after the final filing deadline in the Texaco proceeding and almost two years after the dismissal letter. Since Mr. Canterbery did not present any reason for the delay, the DOE determined that there was no compelling reason to reopen the refund proceeding to accept his claim. Accordingly, the Motion for Reconsideration was dismissed. Time Oil Co./California, National Helium Corp./California, Charter Co./California, 7/7/94, RQ334&hyph;589, RQ3&hyph;590, RM23&hyph;269 The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting two second-stage refund applications and a Motion for Modification filed by the State of California. In its applications and Motion for Modification, California requested a total of $1,273,646 of new Time Oil Co. and National Helium Corp. second-stage refund monies as well as approval to use $144,142 of previously allocated Charter Co. monies to fund four projects intended to reduce single-occupant motor vehicle travel, traffic congestion and fuel consumption. The DOE affirmed the timely restitutionary benefits of the state's plan for the funds, and identified the proposed recipients of those benefits (the people of California) as a substantial segment of injured consumers of refined petroleum products. The California plan was thus found to satisfy the criteria for a second-stage refund restitutionary program. Accordingly, California's Applications for Refund and Motion for Modification were granted.
