He stressed that for the first time the UN secretary general is clearly blaming the Turkish Cypriot side. Kasoulidhis also stressed that indirectly the report blames Turkey as it notes that the lack of political will is also found outside Cyprus. The main conclusion of the report, the spokesman said, is that for the first time it blames the Turkish side for its lack of political will and suggests the study of alternative ways to promote a solution to the Cyprus issue. Kasoulidhis added that when the report was released, President Glavkos Kliridhis repeated that he would be committed to accepting the 21 March document if the other side would do the same. Kasoulidhis stressed, however, that it is now time for alternative ways to be tried to promote the substance of the Cyprus issue. The government spokesman announced that the National Council will be convened at 0900 on Friday [3 June] morning to discuss our position.
