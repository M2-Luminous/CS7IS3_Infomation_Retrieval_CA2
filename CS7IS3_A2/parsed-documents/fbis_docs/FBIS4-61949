They were referring to press reports about criminal proceedings initiated by the Federal Counterintelligence Service against some high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The spokesmen said the federal service had indeed detained some officials, including the former official of the Directorate for Punitive Action of the Moscow region administration, a senior investigator and a lawyer. They were caught in the action while handing over a major sum of money in hard currency and later charged with an array of crimes. But this does not amount to a war between the ministry and the federal service, the spokesman said. Last year 359 criminal proceedings were initiated against security officials, mostly by the Interior Ministry. Twenty-two legal actions were brought jointly with the Federal Counterintelligence Service. This year 142 crimes were registered by the Interior Ministry. In eight cases, action was taken jointly with federal service agents.
