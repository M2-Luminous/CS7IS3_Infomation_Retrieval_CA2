ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule implements section 10(a) of the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area Act of 1975. The Act directs the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate rules and regulations deemed necessary to guide the use and development of private lands within the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area. This rule establishes the baseline standards of private land use and development that are compatible with the purposes of the Act and that, if not met, could result in the Secretary's use of the private land acquisition authority provided by the Act. The intended effect is to ensure that the values of the HCNRA will be protected and preserved, and as envisioned by the Act, that traditional ranching, grazing, farming, timber harvesting, and other uses can be perpetuated. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective June 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tom Lennon, Branch Chief, Special Designations, Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness Resources Staff, Forest Service, (202) 205&hyph;1423 or Ed Cole, Area Ranger, (503) 426&hyph;4978. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Congress established the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (HCNRA) by the Act of December 31, 1975 (the Act) in order to assure that the natural beauty, and historical and archaeological values of the Hells Canyon area are preserved for this and future generations, and that the recreational and ecologic values and public enjoyment of the area are thereby enhanced. Public Law 94&hyph;199, 89 Stat. 1117 at Sec. 1 (codified at 16 U.S.C. 460gg et seq.). Section 10 of the Act directs the Secretary to promulgate such rules and regulations as are deemed necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Act, including standards for the use and development of privately owned property within the HCNRA. Section 10 further provides that the Secretary may use the land acquisition authority in section 9 of the Act to implement the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to section 10. As for the Snake, Rapid, and Imnaha Wild and Scenic Rivers, the governing authority for land acquisition is found in section 6 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Both section 9 of the Act and section 6 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act restrict the Secretary's condemnation authority; i.e. acquiring land without the consent of the landowner. On December 14, 1993, the Forest Service published a proposed rule that would establish the standards for the use and development of private lands in the HCNRA (56 FR 65300). The purpose of the proposed regulations was to make clear those circumstances which would trigger possible use of the Secretary's condemnation authority. The proposed rule established categories of private land and standards for the use and development of private land within a given category. Compliance with the standards would generally be deemed consistent with the purposes for which the HCNRA was established. Violation of the standards would generally be deemed inconsistent with the purposes for which the HCNRA was established, and, thus the lands could become the subject of federal acquisition. Thus, the proposed rule sought to make clear to affected landowners those uses that could continue or be undertaken without risk of federal acquisition. Throughout its efforts to devise regulations applicable to private lands within the HCNRA, the Forest Service has sought to avoid direct regulation of private lands and their uses. Instead, the agency has sought to define those uses of private lands that are consistent with the purposes for which the HCNRA was established, to encourage retention of traditional and valid private land uses as established by the Act, and, thereby, to avoid having to exercise the condemnation authority granted the Secretary by the Act. Under the proposed rule, the Forest Service would not seek to regulate per se or enjoin proposed uses or developments on private land. Rather, the agency chose to set forth in the proposed rule standards for private land use and development, which establish the basis for using the secretary's land acquisition authority in the HCNRA. The proposed rule also established a mechanism by which a landowner could petition for a change in land category assignment and a mechanism by which a landowner could determine whether an existing or proposed land use or development was in compliance with the standards of the rule. The Forest Service may also initiate a noncompliance determination on its own without having first received a landowner request. Under the proposed rule, the Secretary would not acquire the subject land or interests therein unless it was with the consent of the landowner in those cases where a landowner was in compliance with the applicable standards. If, however, the landowner was not in compliance, the Secretary could acquire a fee simple or lesser interest in the subject land without the landowner's consent. The proposed rule also provided landowners and other interested parties an opportunity to appeal a compliance or noncompliance determination. Eight letters expressing a variety of viewpoints were received during the 60-day comment period on the proposed rule. These letters contained the views of a power company, a powerboat association, a preservation group, a local county government, another agency of the federal government, an ad hoc citizens river committee, a state agricultural organization, and a local chapter of the same organization. The comments contained in these letters have been carefully considered in the adoption of this final rule. The Department appreciates the time and energy the reviewers invested in preparing these letters and articulating their concerns on the proposed rule.
