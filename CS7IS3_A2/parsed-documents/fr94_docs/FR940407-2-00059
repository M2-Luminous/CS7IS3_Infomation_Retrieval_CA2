Take notice that on March 30, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) filed a limited application pursuant to section 4 of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. 717c (1988), and the Rules and Regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) promulgated thereunder to recover stranded Account No. 858 costs (Stranded Costs) incurred as a consequence of Texas Eastern's implementation of Order No. 636. Texas Eastern states that it is filing to recover Stranded Costs pursuant to section 15.2(D) of the General Terms and Conditions of Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume 1. Original Sheet No. 182 Original Sheet No. 183 Original Sheet No. 184 Original Sheet No. 185 Sheet Nos. 186&hyph;199 The proposed effective date of these tariff sheets is May 1, 1994. Texas Eastern states that by this filing it seeks to recover known and measurable Stranded Costs totalling $2,649,696.51 incurred from December 1, 1993 through February 28, 1994. Interest of $32,597.28 at the current FERC annual rate of 6.00%, net of deferred income tax impact, is included for the carrying charges from the date of payment of the costs to the projected date of payment by the Customers. Texas Eastern states that Stranded Costs shall be allocated to Texas Eastern's Customers under Rate Schedules CDS, FT&hyph;1, and SCT in accordance with the methodology specified in section 15.2(D) of the General Terms and Conditions. At each customer's individual option, payment of these Stranded Costs amounts may be amortized over as much as a twelve month period with carrying charges calculated on amounts uncollected, net of deferred taxes, pursuant to §154.305 of the Commission's Regulations. Texas Eastern states that if the commission approves without unacceptable modification or condition the global Settlement filed by Texas Eastern on January 31, 1994, in Docket Nos. RP85&hyph;177&hyph;119, et al., which covers, inter alia , recovery of stranded costs, this instant proceeding would be resolved, except with respect to Protesting Parties as defined in the Settlement. Accordingly, Texas Eastern requests that the Commission not establish any proceedings in the instant docket prior to acting on Texas Eastern's global Settlement. Texas Eastern states that copies of its filing have been served on all firm customers of Texas Eastern and applicable state regulatory agencies. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with §§385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before April 8, 1994. Protests will be considered to the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on a file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
