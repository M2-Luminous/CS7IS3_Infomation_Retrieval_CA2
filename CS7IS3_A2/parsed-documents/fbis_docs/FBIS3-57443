The recent changes in the government's composition were minor compared to those made last September, Shokhin, who recently replaced Yegor Gaydar as economics minister, told a news conference in Moscow on Monday. But he said certain amendments would nevertheless be made to the economic policy on the basis of recommendations by economists and politicians. He expressed readiness to cooperate with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin Bloc. He said use would also be made of work done by a team led by Academicians Leonid Abalkin and Nikolay Petrakov and a team led by Academician Stanislav Shatalin. As for Boris Fedorov, it was still unclear whether he would remain in the government, Shokhin said. He said President Boris Yeltsin on Monday did not accept Fedorov's resignation. The main economic problem facing the government today is "combining the line towards macroeconomic stabilization with a more careful microeconomic policy," Shokhin said. "That is what Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had in mind when he spoke about non- monetarist measures," he said. In particular, selective financing of economic sectors and tight control of taxation had to be introduced, with "budgetary revenues drastically increased by administrative methods." None of those measures contradicted the former financial policy, Shokhin said. He said the government should not be seen as consisting of "conservatives" and "reformers" and condemned "the campaign against the Chernomyrdin government, which is run by Mikhail Poltoranin," and is a "serious political game" aimed at "organizing a nationwide political strike in April or May, overthrowing the government and taking power."
