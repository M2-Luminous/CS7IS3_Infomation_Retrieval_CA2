The Germans see Asia as predominantly an export market and thus are not present in sufficient numbers there through direct investments, cooperative agreements, and the exchange of technology and know-how. This must change. At least that was the opinion of the German firms, associations, chambers of industry and trade, and representatives of the Bonn ministries taking part in the fifth Asia-Pacific Conference of the German Economy, held in the Thai capital of Bangkok. The conference participants are hoping to jointly develop strategies for a successful German course of action in this region, with its great prospects for growth, and to spark interest in the region. Due to its insufficient involvement up to now, the German economy is continuing to lose ground in East Asia, even more so than the United States and Japan. Deliveries and technology transfers from Germany currently make up only around one-tenth of the German foreign trade volume. No more than 3 to 4 percent of German foreign investments flow into the Asia-Pacific region. With an annual volume of German direct investments of 1.3 billion German marks [DM] going to Hong Kong and DM2 billion to the ASEAN states, the Federal Republic is lagging far behind Japan. This is because Japan operates much more offensively in the region. In 1993, DM19 billion flowed from Japan to Hong Kong alone, and another DM52 billion to the ASEAN states. For this reason the Federal Government has now granted Asian policy a position of importance. The government's Asia plan and the founding of the Asia-Pacific Committee of the German Economy are two important initiatives intended to heighten awareness in the political and economic arenas. Federal Minister of Economics Guenter Rexrodt, who opened the conference in Bangkok, promised German businesses increased political support. Rexrodt also came out in favor of a more intense dialogue between the Federal Government and governments in the Asia-Pacific region. Although the Federal Government is clearly opposed to direct export and investment subsidies, Rexrodt sees the German Hermes-instrument as providing an important contribution to the financial support of German direct investments. As is heard in Bangkok, however, much remains to be done. "This somehow does not agree with German involvement in Asia. The exotic business-romanticism idea is finally history. Thousands of German firms have not yet become aware of this; only now is it becoming clear to them that Asia is no longer the backyard of the world," criticizes Fritz Kleinstaeuber, director of the German-Indonesian Chamber of Industry and Trade in Jakarta. Among the weak points he has identified in German-East Asian trade are, in addition to marketing weaknesses which have long been a problem, an unsatisfactory distribution system and, not least, ineffective advertising. Kleinstaeuber also challenges that the German presence in Asia should not be limited to machinery and capital assets. German consumer goods should also reappear in Asian markets. "We see ourselves as partners in cooperation with the Asia-Pacific countries in a broad sense. What is needed is not so much exports from Europe to this region, but technology transfer and the expansion of local net product in the foreign markets," explains Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of the Asia-Pacific Committee of the German Economy. Von Pierer refers primarily to the great opportunity for German firms to become partners with Asian countries in gigantic infrastructure improvement projects and in environmental protection technologies. According to estimates, the volume of orders for infrastructure projects in this region will amount to several hundred billion dollars over the next few years. China, for example, plans to install around 75 million additional telephone connections by the year 2000.
