Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: The reckless arms buildup of the Kim Yong-sam group and its war preparations to invade the North are unpardonable treacheries to plunge the fellow countrymen into the scourge of a nuclear war, in confrontation with them as a war servant of outside forces. In stepping up arms buildup and war gambles under the pretext of "establishing a security posture" and carrying the situation on the Korean peninsula to a dangerous phase of war, the Kim Yong-sam group seeks to stay in power with the armed backing of the master, leaving South Korea under U.S. domination. The Kim Yong-sam group is a pack of bellicose elements who are racing headlong along the road of confrontation and war against fellow countrymen, in order to be "protected" by the U.S. military industrial complexes in reward for the fabulous profits ensured them which are trying to sell more weapons by increasing the tensions at any cost. Our fellow countrymen who hold dear the dignity of the nation and love peace will never pardon those who hold personal ease and interests of outside forces dearer than the interests and destiny of the nation and do not hesitate to impose the holocaust of nuclear war upon the nation. The Korean people and People's Army will sternly punish the South Korean puppets, if they attempt to do harm to fellow countrymen in league with foreign forces.
