Gen. Gordon yesterday spent several hours in Macedonia and visited American soldiers with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and two blue helmet observer positions. Before his departure from Skopje he said that he was very satisfied with UNPROFOR's mission on preserving stability in "this important region." The U.S. Army Chief of Staff ruled out the possibility of increasing the contingent of U.S. soldiers with UNPROFOR stationed in Macedonia. Asked what his opinion was about a possible NATO military intervention in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, he briefly said that he was a soldier, not a diplomat. Gen. Sullivan also had a meeting in Skopje with the chief of general staff of the Macedonian army, Colonel-General Dragoljub Bocinov.
