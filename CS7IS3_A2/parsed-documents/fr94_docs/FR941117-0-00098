FR941117-0-00098 FR941117-0-00011 §22.413 Developmental authorization of 72&hyph;76 MHz fixed transmitters. Because of the potential for interference with the reception by broadcast television sets and video recorders of full service TV stations transmitting on TV Channels 4 and 5, 72&hyph;76 MHz channels are assigned for use within 16 kilometers (10 miles) of the antenna of any full service TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 5 only under developmental authorizations subject to the requirements of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. (a) Carrier responsibility. Carriers so authorized shall operate the 72&hyph;76 MHz fixed station under developmental authority for a period of at least six months. During the developmental period, carriers must resolve any broadcast television receiver interference problems that may occur as a result of operation of the 72&hyph;76 MHz transmitter(s). (b) Exceptions. The FCC may grant a regular authorization in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service for a 72&hyph;76 MHz fixed station under the following circumstances: (1) After six months of operation under developmental authorization, and provided that broadcast TV interference complaints have been resolved by the carrier in a satisfactory manner, the FCC may grant a regular authorization. Licensees that hold a developmental authorization for a 72&hyph;76 MHz fixed station and wish to request a regular authorization must file an application (FCC Form 401) prior to the expiration of the developmental authorization. (2) In the case of the assignment of or a transfer of control of a regular authorization of a 72&hyph;76 MHz fixed station in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, the FCC may grant such assignment or consent to such transfer of control provided that the station has been in continuous operation providing service with no substantial interruptions. (3) If a proposed 72&hyph;76 MHz fixed transmitter antenna is to be located within 50 meters (164 feet) of the antenna of the full service TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 5, the FCC may grant a regular authorization instead of a developmental authorization. §22.415 Developmental authorization of 928&hyph;960 MHz fixed transmitters. Channels in the 928&hyph;929 MHz and 952&hyph;960 MHz ranges may be assigned under developmental authorizations to fixed transmitters in point-to-multipoint systems at locations that are short-spaced (i.e. do not meet the 113 kilometer (70 mile) separation requirement of §22.625), subject to the requirements of this section. (a) Carrier responsibility. Applications for developmental authorizations pursuant to this section must contain an engineering analysis that shows that no interference will be caused or received. Carriers so authorized shall operate the short-spaced transmitter for a period of one year. (b) Exceptions. The FCC may grant a regular authorization in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service for a short-spaced fixed station under the following circumstances: (1) After one year of operation under developmental authorization, and provided that no interference has been caused, the FCC may grant a regular authorization. Licensees that hold a developmental authorization and wish to request a regular authorization must file an application (FCC Form 401) prior to the expiration of the developmental authorization. (2) In the case of the assignment of or a transfer of control of a regular authorization of a short-spaced fixed station in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, the FCC may grant such assignment or consent to such transfer of control provided that the station has been in continuous operation providing service and no interference has been caused. §22.417 Developmental authorization of meteor burst systems. Because of the potential for interference to other 42&hyph;46 MHz operations, central office and rural subscriber stations in Alaska are authorized to use meteor burst propagation modes to provide rural radiotelephone service only under developmental authorizations subject to the requirements of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. See also §§22.725(c) and 22.729. (a) Carrier responsibility. Carriers and subscribers so authorized shall operate the station under developmental authority for a period of at least one year. (b) Exceptions. The FCC may grant a regular authorization in the Rural Radiotelephone Service for a central office or rural subscriber to use meteor burst propagation modes to provide rural radiotelephone service under the following circumstances: (1) After one year of operation under developmental authorization, and provided that no interference has been caused to other operations, the FCC may grant a regular authorization. Licensees that hold a developmental authorization to use meteor burst propagation modes to provide rural radiotelephone service and wish to request a regular authorization must file an application (FCC Form 401) prior to the expiration of the developmental authorization. (2) In the case of the assignment of or a transfer of control of a regular authorization of a central office or rural subscriber station authorizing the use of meteor burst propagation modes in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, the FCC may grant such assignment or consent to such transfer of control provided that the station has been in operation providing service with no substantial interruptions. Subpart E_Paging and Radiotelephone Service §22.501 Scope. The rules in this subpart govern the licensing and operation of public mobile paging and radiotelephone stations. The licensing and operation of these stations are also subject to rules elsewhere in this part that apply generally to the Public Mobile Services. However, in case of conflict, the rules in this subpart govern.
