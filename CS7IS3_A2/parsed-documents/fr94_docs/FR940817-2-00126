Had he participated, Commissioner Newquist would have made an affirmative determination. 3 Imports are currently classified under Harmonized Tariff Schedule item numbers 7304.10.1020, 7304.10.5020, 7304.31.6050, 7304.39.0016, 7304.39.0020, 7304.39.0024, 7304.39.0028, 7304.39.0032, 7304.51.5005, 7304.51.5060, 7304.59.6000, 7304.59.8010, 7304.59.8015, 7304.59.8020, and 7304.59.8025. Background On June 23, 1994, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by the Gulf States Tube Division of Quanex Corp., Rosenberg, TX, alleging that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports from Italy of certain seamless carbon and alloy standard, line, and pressure steel pipe that are alleged to be subsidized by the Government of Italy and by reason of LTFV imports from Argentina, Brazil, Germany, and Italy of such pipe. Accordingly, effective June 23, 1994, the Commission instituted countervailing duty investigation No. 701&hyph;TA&hyph;362 (Preliminary) and antidumping investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;707&hyph;710 (Preliminary).

The conference was held in Washington, DC, on July 14, 1994, and all persons who requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. The Commission transmitted its determinations in these investigations to the Secretary of Commerce on August 8, 1994.
