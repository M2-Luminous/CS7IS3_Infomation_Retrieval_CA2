The rate of increase for general operating expenditures will be 2.4 percent, compared to the original budget for fiscal 1993, representing the lowest growth rate in six years. However, all requests for allocations for public work projects were approved, showing consideration for the sluggish economy. In terms of taxation, the expansion of preferential treatment for land replacement, and the strengthening of taxation on corporate unaccounted expenditures and entertainment expenses have been decided upon. However, coordination within the government and among the ruling coalition parties on the income tax cut and the accompanying tax hike has been delayed until 7 February, and if a conclusion is not reached, this may seriously affect the schedule for the unofficial announcement of the MOF draft budget (originally set for 10 February).
