Classification This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. When this rule was proposed, the General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that this rule, if adopted as proposed, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for the reasons set forth in the RIR prepared by the Council. A copy of the RIR may be obtained from the Council (see ADDRESSES ). As a result, an IRFA was not prepared.
