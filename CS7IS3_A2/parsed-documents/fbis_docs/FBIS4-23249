Maj. Gen. Alli made the declaration in a lecture entitled "Defense Capabilities of the Armed Forces of Nigeria", which he delivered to the participants of the senior executive course 16 at the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), in Kuru, near Jos. He emphasised that Nigeria, like most developing countries in Africa, did not, as a matter of policy, seek to expand its territory nor acquire new ones. Nigeria, he said, did not also, seek to export any ideology adding that the Nigerian Armed Forces were meant primarily to safeguard the country's territorial integrity. The military forces, he said further, were also to defend the country from external aggression and provide support for the nation's foreign policy. However, he emphasised the need for improved defence funding to further boost Nigeria's defence capabilities, noting that high morale of troops, availability of weapons and their maintenance had positive effect on defence. Maj. Gen. Alli said that the preparedness of the nation's various services ranged between 30 to 60 per cent and noted that a fragile economy can hardly sustain the heavy pressure of war. He said that defence capabilities was affected mainly by funding, manpower development, morale and state of equipment without which a force cannot be credible. An Army statement also quoted Maj. Gen. Alli as advocating for a collective security system by which Nigeria should seek more alliances and security agreements in the West African sub-region.
