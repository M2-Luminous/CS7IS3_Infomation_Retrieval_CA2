Friends of dissident intellectual Zhou Duo, who staged a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square the day before the massacre, claimed he had been subjected to harassment by security forces. This is in spite of the fact that last month, Mr Zhou, a sociologist, had left the capital to set up a business in Tianjin. "Zhou is selling cosmetics and other consumer products with the help of a cousin," a friend said. "However, he is under constant surveillance by Tianjin police and his business prospects have been hurt." In March, Mr Zhou, and two other intellectuals, wrote a private letter to National People's Congress Chairman Qiao Shi pleading for a faster pace of reform and labour rights. One of the other petitioners has also been put under 24-hour police surveillance in spite of his having forsworn protest actions in the run-up to the fifth anniversary of the massacre. Meanwhile the associates of Beijing University law lecturer and labour activist Yuan Hongbing said they expected him to be charged and put on trial this year. With two other dissidents, Yuan was detained by police in early March for allegedly forming an underground labour organisation and for organising a petition demanding worker rights. The associates said his wife had been informed that Yuan had been "formally arrested" and that investigation into his case by state security agents would be completed at the end of June. Yuan's case would then be handed over to the procuratorate, which would determine when the judicial procedure would start. "The authorities have told me nothing about the nature of his `crime'," friends quoted Yuan's wife as saying. "They have not even told me where he is being held. I am not allowed to send him medicine and clothing." She added Yuan had stomach, skin and liver ailments, and she was frustrated by the news blackout. Sources in Beijing University said its famous law faculty had been subjected to tight surveillance owing to the radicalism of several young scholars. Graduate student Wang Jiaqi, who was detained with Yuan, fled the country last month. The sources said at least one other graduate student there had gone into hiding to escape detention. The student, who has not been seen since March, is believed to have returned to his native province.
