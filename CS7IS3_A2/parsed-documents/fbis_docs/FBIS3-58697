Addressing the opening session of the summit, Ciampi praised the "appropriate and timely" nature of the Partnerships for Peace initiative, but also stressed Italy's concern that it be accompanied by efforts to bring East European countries closer to the political and common security dimensions of the Maastricht Treaty. In this process, he said, it was imperative not to isolate but to involve Russia in "an ever closer dialogue" with the West, while responding to the security and stability needs of East Europe -- needs that can be met not only via the Partnership but also through closer ties with the EU [European Union], he said. In the other chief concern of his speech, Ciampi said "the time has come for the Atlantic Alliance to contribute more directly and systematically to the achievement of conditions of security and stability in the Mediterranean." Italy was thus proposing, he said, the creation of a high-level study group -- initially non-governmental -- of NATO and Mediterranean countries to lay the groundwork for a future regional security arrangement. Ciampi urged that these ideas, "which regard an area of vital interest, not only for Italy," should receive "understanding and support" from all NATO partners. On transatlantic relations -- in which he called for outstanding trade disputes to be settled in a spirit of "cooperation and solidarity" -- Ciampi stressed that the strengthening of pan-European security and defence structure will not weaken but reinforce the Atlantic Alliance. But the crucial element in the present phase, he reiterated, is NATO's ties with East Europe and with Russia in particular. The success of the Atlantic Alliance, he said "will depend largely on our ability to extend co-operation with the new democracies of Central and East Europe, responding to their needs for stability and security." The "uncertain" political situation in Russia, he said, had increased "feelings of insecurity" in East Europe, prompting desires for NATO membership. This situation called for "prudence and clear-sightedness," he said, rather than "premature alarm." No one can predict how the Russian situation will evolve, he went on: It will depend "partly on us" to avert the rise of nationalism and instability. But East European countries must also work to prevent the occurrence "of what they and all of us fear," he said. "In other words, the best way to prevent instability and a new imperialism in Russia is to try to help Moscow rid itself of its old complex of isolation and encirclement." Thus, dialogue with Russia must be increased as much as possible -- but "Russia must also understand that rash moves towards its neighbours would be seen as a return to the ambitions of old, and would call into question the entire philosophy that inspires our present attitude." He added that a significant contribution to these efforts would also come from the increased political importance that will be given to future meetings of the Group of Seven most industrialised nations. Ciampi ended his speech by speaking of another "important task" facing NATO: a new role in peacekeeping operations under the aegis of the United Nations or the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe. He voiced Italy's proposal for looking at the possibility of creating an international monitoring system that might use advanced technologies to quickly inform the international community of the violation of human rights, cease-fires, and other accords. Another Italian idea Ciampi aired is the the use of nonlethal weapons for peacekeeping missions.
