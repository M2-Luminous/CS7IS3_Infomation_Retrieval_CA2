The correspondent begins by asking Marchuk what measures are undertaken by the state to ensure the reliable and efficient operation of the Ukrainian Security Service, SBU. Yevhen Marchuk responds by acknowledging the difficult financial situation of all organizations financed by the state budget. This is evidenced by the SBU's budget for this year which will "be enough to keep our agency going only for seven months, and only to meet our very basic needs, such as payments for electricity, running water, heating and salaries for the employees." Marchuk explains that in a bid to improve its financial standing, the SBU sent letters to the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, Supreme Council, and the president requesting financial help and emphasizing its role in providing money for the state budget. For example, last year, the agency confiscated 211 billion karbovanets, 156,000 Deutschemarks, and $388 million during the investigation of criminal cases alone. Some $560 million were saved for the state budget as a result of the agency's efforts to prevent the conclusion of contracts that would be unprofitable for Ukraine. The SBU chief stresses that "this is a lot more than the organization's budget for the last year." Marchenko goes on to specify how much money was recovered by specific SBU oblast bureaus for the state budget. According to him, some of the best working bureaus are in Lvov, Donetsk, Kiev, Khmelnytsky, and Lutsk, all of which could earn money for themselves. Considering this substantial contribution to the state reserve, Marchuk says that his agency has asked the state for permission to receive 30 percent of the money confiscated as a result of investigations of criminal cases. This issue is currently being considered by the financial minister and acting prime minister. The SBU chief emphasizes that this is a temporary measure, intended to tide the agency over during the current crisis period. To corroborate this move, he recalls the recent abduction by a terrorist in Lugansk Oblast of a bus with children. The SBU agents had to collect all of the available gasoline reserves to capture the criminal. In addition, because of low salaries of SBU employees, Marchuk complains, "none of the Kiev university judiciary department graduates agreed to work with our organization." According to Marchuk, this example proves that the financing of special services, whose output can not always be expressed in money, should be executed on a different basis from that applied to all other institutions and enterprises. The correspondent then says that many people wonder whether the SBU needs to be financed so heftily at a time when Ukraine, and the SBU itself, no longer has enemies. Marchuk answers: "I heard about this opinion and can understand it. Outsiders simply are not aware of the magnitude and scope of the problems that the Ukrainian security service has to grapple with. There are no enemies in terms of the standoff of two hostile camps. However, at present, we see as many threats -- and not enemies or adversaries -- to Ukraine as when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. Socioeconomic threats are even more dangerous today. They threaten the civilian peace and stability of the state, although I hope we will not come to this. In addition, there are many issues that are not publicly discussed, such as activities of intelligence and counterintelligence. He continues: In economic terms, the world is a place for competition with its tough rules. The emergence of a new partner in a place where everything is carved up would never be welcomed. Ukraine is a serious partner, even though some may think that no one over there fears us. Nothing of the kind. I mean, in economic, not in military terms. No one is waiting to embrace Ukraine with its agricultural potential. Because it is clear that if we put our agriculture in order, we could flood Russia and all of Europe with our produce. But there, everything is settled and agreed upon. Strange as it may sound, this is just how it is. We have an immense industrial potential. Obsolete and run-down, it can be supported by our intellectual resources. We have highly skilled professionals. He goes on to say: But everything is divided in Europe in this field. So, from the professional point of view, intelligence is a normal thing in this situation. I mean, intelligence operations conducted by those countries -- and our country, too -- in order to know... What is intelligence? This is a state institution executing political or scientific tasks, only by special methods. Although we may not have the kind of enemies we used to have in the past, we have instead very serious competitors that can influence the shape of Ukraine. This applies not only to the policies of our state, but also to specific companies, concerns, and economic powerhouses. Those enterprises are closely watched so that Ukraine does not inflict any damage on them. And all of this involves intelligence, which calls for strong counterintelligence. Marchuk says: "The present situation in Ukraine facilitated the presence of other intelligence services here. We are gradually moving now to improve our work here. For example, you know that the legislature has recently adopted the law on state secrets, and the structure of our counterintelligence has been adapted to modern developments. So, we do not say that we have military enemies, but Ukraine will have economic and political competitors -- enough for our generation and some generations to come. This is the real world. It is highly competitive both economically and politically." Concluding the interview, the correspondent asks Yevhen Marchuk what topics will be discussed during following interviews with him -- soon to be featured on the "Independence" program. According to Marchuk, those topics include combating organized crime, especially in banking, protection of the national economy, protection of national statehood and integrity, military counterintelligence, and others.
