These plans were discussed during talks in Washington. Bonn believes that the security needs of Poland and the other neighbors might, for the time being, be satisfied by decreasing the distance to the West European Union [WEU]. Germany wants to present the East European states, which have already signed association treaties with the European Union [EU], with an offer of membership in the European Political Cooperation, in the system of diplomatic consultations of the EU, which, in line with the Maastricht Treaty, will be replaced by a joint foreign policy. In line with Chancellor Kohl's plans, Poland as well as other countries would take part in the meetings of political directors of foreign affairs ministries, and they would have the full right to express their opinions when joint policies on the most fundamental issues are established. At the same time, a process of shortening the distance to the WEU would be ongoing; it would be harmonized with the integration with EU structures. One could also hear in German diplomatic circles talk that, even though the entire "Partnership for Peace" proposal is still quite fuzzy, one thing, according to Bonn, must be made clear: Excluded from the "Partnership" will be any and all states making territorial claims on their neighbors.
