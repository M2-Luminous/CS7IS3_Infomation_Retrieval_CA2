The accord emerged at a meeting between SDP Diet affairs committee chairman Koken Nosaka and his LDP counterpart Sadatoshi Ozato. Nosaka proposed that the SDP and the LDP hold such a gathering now that the SDP became an opposition force again after eight months in the ruling coalition, Ozato told a news conference. While the LDP was in power for 38 years until last August, the SDP formed the core of the opposition camp. The SDP decided on Tuesday to quit the governing alliance to protest other coalition partners' formation of a unified parliamentary group, named Kaishin (innovation). The party was the largest contingent in the coalition. Nosaka and Ozato will meet again on Thursday morning to discuss how specifically the two parties can cooperate in handling political matters to be discussed in the current regular Diet session and beyond, Ozato said. Ozato added that the two men agreed to cooperate in order to resist "fascist" moves and protect parliamentary democracy. The LDP Diet Affairs Committee chairman also noted the two parties may ask new party Sakigake, which had earlier decided to leave the coalition, to join their policy talks. In a separate news conference, Nosaka said he and Ozato confirmed the need for "faith and trust" in their two parties' tie-up over Diet deliberations.
