European Commission president Jacques Delors urged foreign ministers to push the plan forward over the heads of finance ministers who were meeting separately and are balking at finding money for massive capital investments. Delors also objected to a German proposal that all EU legislation be reviewed by a panel of independent experts with a view to identifying and scrapping laws which hinder business activity and the creation of new jobs. Delors, the EU's chief executive, said he was in "total disagreement" with the proposal from German Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt because it would give outsiders power over EU decision-making. But British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, weighing in with the Germans, told journalists that Delors was the perfect illustration "of how a bureaucracy will not reform its own procedures." Germany and Britain remain in the forefront of countries which insist that the EU rely largely on the private sector to finance a 120 billion ECU (135 billion dollar) investment plan launched by EU leaders last December. They want to build an infrastructure of transportation, energy and telecommunication networks spanning Europe, in order to support business and put more people to work. German Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Ursula Seiler- Albring said that Bonn would not accept that the EU raise more money to finance these projects in addition to the lending capacity of the EU's European Investment Bank. Clarke agreed. "There are enormous amounts of private capital available across Europe," he said. But Delors insisted that some proposed projects might not be attractive to private investors because they were too environmentally-demanding or too long-term. The private sector was more interested in 10-year investments than projects which might take three decades to complete, he said. Earlier this year the commission proposed that the EU raise a six-year loan of 48 billion ECU (54 billion dollar) to finance some of the projects, which include highways, highspeed railways and a trans-Alpine rail crossing. In the face of general scepticism on the part of finance ministers, the EU executive has since dropped all public reference to the extent of financing needs. But Delors warned that the growth plan, which is supposed to be the centrepiece of an EU summit next June, would make little progress unless the EU showed quickly that it was ready to back its projects with public loans. Clarke said the EU was making little headway on the other major plank of the plan -- to lighten non-wage costs for European businessmen which include labour regulations and social charges to support welfare systems. Supporting the German proposition for an independent study of EU law, the British chancellor said: "You cannot make progress on deregulation if you leave it to your own bureaucracy." However, French Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery said he doubted the need for outside checks on the EU's work.
