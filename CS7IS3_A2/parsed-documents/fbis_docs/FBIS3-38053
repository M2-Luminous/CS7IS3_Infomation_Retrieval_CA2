"As far as I know CIA representatives are still in Russia. They have met heads of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service to discuss professional and technical issues. It seems the sides have managed to reach mutual understanding in some aspects," a veteran staffer of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service who used to work in the United States told CRIME PRESS on Friday. Commenting on the "Ames case" Russian intelligence officials remind that in similar situations Russians seldom make fuss. Last year twenty people were arrested in Russia on espionage charge, according to First Deputy Director of the Russian Counter-Intelligence Service Sergey Stepashin. However, there were no scandals, demarches or loud protesting, as professionals can control their emotions. Speaking to CRIME-PRESS on Friday, spokesman for Russian Federal Counter-Intelligence Service Aleksandr Mikhailov suggested an example of such sustained reaction the recent arrest of a major agent working for "a Western secret service" reported earlier this year by service Director Nikolay Golushko. As a result, attempts to recruit a number of high-ranking Russian officials have been prevented while the officials removed from their posts.
