He added that peace arrangements have to be made on all tracks, including the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. He proposed several mechanisms to solve some problems like setting up a border committee to demarcate the border and setting up a center for resolving disputes in the Middle East. In a lecture delivered at the Royal Armed Forces Institute for General Studies in London yesterday, he pointed out that the Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli working committee set up to examine issues that concern Jordan "could be upgraded to ministerial level." He said that "last year's events opened the door to peace in the Middle East, and mutual recognition between the PLO and Israel gave the region an unprecedented opportunity to resolve the Arab-Israeli dispute." He added that the historic agreement on Gaza and Jericho "is another step in the right direction." He went on: "We have reached the stage in which the concept of peace should be negotiated in detail." He pointed to the existence of "numerous issues which should be negotiated before reaching a comprehensive peace. And Jordan will be willing to reach a peace treaty when the questions included on the agenda we have reached with Israel have been discussed and resolved in a manner acceptable to all parties." He pointed out that among these issues are "the border, refugees, security, and water, which are the essence of peacemaking." He said that it is difficult to reach arrangements regarding these questions before the border and security questions have been resolved. Because it is illogical to talk about Jordanian and Israeli concerns and interests before determining what "Jordan" and "Israel" are. He described the settlements as a time bomb which the organizations opposed to peace and settlers can use to obstruct the peace process. He said that "peace cannot be achieved in these conditions." He pointed out that Jordan had made several proposals to tackle the border and security problems. They included setting up a border committee to try to demarcate the border in a bid to achieve a lasting regional peace. As for the refugees, "we are negotiating within the boundaries of international law." He said that the final status of Jerusalem is one of the issues attracting great interest and preoccupying the world as a whole. He urged "clear separation between the religious and the political" with respect to the city, because Jerusalem belongs to all religions, hence no single state should have full sovereignty over it. He added: "We have made detailed proposals on this separation, because we believe that a suitable solution to the Jerusalem issue is necessary in the search for peace." He added that Jordan has also implemented several confidence-building measures, including opening banks in the occupied Palestinian territories, signing an economic agreement with the Palestinians, training Palestinian police, and setting up a Jordanian-Israeli-U.S. committee to examine questions that concern Jordan. He called for drawing up a framework for cooperation and security in the Middle East along the lines of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, in order to achieve a lasting peace in the region. He added that that conference does not represent an alternative to the peace process but complements it. He called for establishing a free zone for trade in the Middle East allowing manpower, goods, capital, and services to move freely. He said that securing a Middle East free trade agreement (MEFTA) would give the region the opportunity to play a constructive role in the world economy. He also said that a program similar to the GATT in Europe might be the best way to handle the economic burdens of the Arab-Israeli dispute and to establish a sound trade and investment system. He stressed that "peace should be comprehensive and just, so that it will be a lasting peace. And everyone should be given the opportunity and the tools to play a role in building a new Middle East system." He said that the Arab-Israeli conflict has had an impact on the region as a whole and resulted in the accumulation of debts and demographic pressures on states with limited resources. However, he pointed out that Jordan will do its utmost to help the self-rule areas. Asked about economic integration and its threats to the Middle East region in view of the Israeli superiority, he said that, in view of the lack of a concept and a mechanism for these matters, they should be discussed in the framework of the multilateral talks concerning the Middle East. Answering a question put to him, he said that the dispute in Yemen reminds us of the strategic importance of the Red Sea.
