He said the world today is witnessing a new cycle in a series of Israeli crimes inside the occupied territories at a time when Rabin is taking no action. Instead, he encourages such massacres by not punishing the perpetrators. In a statement today, Qaddumi said that Rabin uses the pretext of protecting Israeli security to postpone the date of the withdrawal of his military forces from the occupied Palestinian territories. He allows no international force to enter the occupied territories to end the abuse by the Israeli settlers, which threatens the chances of peace and security in the region and prolongs the struggle. He noted that Yitzhaq Rabin, who insists on Israeli security, talks cold-bloodedly about these fierce and heinous massacres.
