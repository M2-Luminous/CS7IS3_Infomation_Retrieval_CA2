"Bulgaria and Iran have traditionally friendly relations," 'Ali Akbar Velayati told the press after the meeting. The ministers agreed to continue to promote bilateral relations in trade, economy and culture. "We firmly believe Bulgaria and Iran can further strengthen relations," the Iranian minister also said. Bulgarian Foreign Minister Daskalov said the sides paid special attention to economic relations, as lately bilateral trade and especially Bulgarian exports have seen a significant decline. Bulgaria reaffirmed interest in the construction of a transport corridor linking Burgas (on the Southern Bulgarian Black Sea coast), Poti (Georgia) and Iran. "We agreed on more intensive contacts between the economic ministries," said Daskalov. The Iranian delegation includes the first deputy minister of trade who will tomorrow hold meetings at the ministries of trade, finance, transport and at the Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. During Velayti's visit the sides are expected to sign a Bulgarian-Iranian trade and economic Accord. On Wednesday morning Daskalov and Velayati will sign a protocol on cooperation between the two foreign ministries. Daskalov denied a report in a Tehran newspaper that Velayti would raise the issue of announcements that Bulgaria violated the Yugoembargo. "We briefed the Iranian side on the Bulgarian stance on the Yugoconflict, which is well-known, on Bulgaria's relations with its neighbours and on Black Sea economic cooperation. The Iranian side reiterated their stand on the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and on relations within their region," said the Bulgarian foreign minister. The sides also discussed the killing in Sofia last December of four Iranians, two of whom illicit drugs dealars, who confronted the police. Two Bulgarian police were also killed. "We raised this issue and the two sides reaffirmed their interest in clarifying the case. I think, the investigation will make things clear," said Daskalov. In response to a question, Velayati reaffirmed the Islamic nations' stance in favour of a deployment in Yugoslavia of peacemaking troops under UN auspices. "This is our stance taken at the meeting in Pakistan, and we've been closely adhering to it," said the Iranian foreign minister. 'Ali Akbar Velayati tomorrow will be received by President Zhelyu Zhelev, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov.
