Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, has paid attention to the letters and asked relevant leaders and departments to handle them properly. Compared with letters in the past, this year's letters show greater concern on state affairs and people's livelihood, such as inflation, anti-corruption, social order, reducing peasants' burden, and the living standard of retired officials and workers. The letters this year also express the hope that NPC and its Standing Committee will accelerate economic legislation and strengthen supervision over law enforcement. The letters handling group of the current NPC session has classified the letters, sending those involving state affairs to top leaders, and asking relevant departments or localities to handle specific issues raised by the letters.
