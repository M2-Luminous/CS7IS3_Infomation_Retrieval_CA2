Speaking in Ulundi ahead of his summit meeting today with State President F.W. de Klerk, ANC President Nelson Mandela, and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, Dr. Buthelezi said he's always rejected violence, but warned of more bloodshed if the election proceeded as scheduled. Our political staff reports that the summit meeting is seen as a final attempt to avert a war between the IFP and the ANC in kwaZulu- Natal. Dr. Buthelezi said that advocates of a federal system in South Africa have been elbowed out of negotiations by the government and the ANC. The government and the ANC have both indicated that they intend to be accommodating of the Zulu king's position. Before the summit meeting begins, Mr. Mandela will hold separate talks with King Goodwill on the kwaZulu issue. Yesterday Mr. Mandela and President de Klerk held preparatory discussions. Various international leaders have expressed the hope that the talks will produce a settlement. It is not yet known where the summit meeting will take place.
