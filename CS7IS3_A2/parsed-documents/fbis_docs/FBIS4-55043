This, which testifies to the slowing down of the pace of privatization, has also prompted the present government to incorporate into its Policy Statement the preparation of the second wave of coupon privatization. For the sake of comparison, the offer for the first wave of coupon privatization consisted of more than 500 shareholding companies. The Ministry of Privatization report proposes that the registration of citizens and investment privatization funds take place from 1 September to 31 October 1994, the processing and assessment of registrations from 1 to 7 November 1994, the preliminary round -- the subscribing of points to investment privatization funds -- from 3 October to 16 December 1994, and the presentation of the list of shareholders and investment privatization funds from 19 December to 30 December 1994. Preliminary dates of individual rounds for placing orders: First Round: 2-25 January 1995 Second Round: 6-17 February 1995 Third Round: 6-17 March 1995 Fourth Round: 3-14 April 1995 Fifth Round: 2-12 May 1995 As the report states, the Ministry of Privatization has drawn up a preliminary list of property offered for the second wave of coupon privatization. Included in the list are 104 industrial enterprises with an aggregate book value of 152.9 billion Slovak korunas [Sk], of which Sk72.5 billion (47 percent) is earmarked for privatization by means of coupons; 43 agricultural enterprises with an aggregate book value of Sk10.6 billion, of which Sk4.8 billion (47 percent) is earmarked for coupon privatization; and 36 enterprises from the branches of transportation, tourism, retailing, and services with an aggregate value of Sk19.4 billion, of which Sk7.6 billion (39 percent) is earmarked for coupon privatization. In addition, some of the "unsold" shares from the first wave of coupon privatization, which are currently in the portfolio of the National Property Fund of the Slovak Republic, as well as shares which the National Property Fund acquired within the framework of increases in shareholding companies' capital stock for reason of reassessment of real estate value, should also be offered to coupon holders within the second wave of coupon privatization. "All together, it is thus possible to offer Sk100 to Sk105 billion worth of property within the second wave of coupon privatization," the report states. The Ministry of Privatization has recently intensified the preparatory work for the second wave of coupon privatization. A part of the ministry's staff is working at an outlying workplace out of Bratislava lest the increased work intensity be disrupted by the routine agenda and by dealing with inquiries.
