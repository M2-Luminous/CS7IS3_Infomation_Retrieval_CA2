He also expressed solidarity with the Polish nation, the neighbouring and, like Russians, a Slavic nation with whom "we have a lot in common and a lot to talk about." [sentence as received] Zhirinovskiy, invited to Poland by leader of the National Front "samoobrona" (self-defence) Janusz Bryczkowski, said he would come to Warsaw for two days in the company of two other officials of his party, Mr. Vengerovskiy and Zhebrovskiy. Referring to the common Slavic background of Poles and Russians, Zhirinovskiy said: "We have better relations with some Atua-Batua islands than with the brotherly Slavic (Polish) nation. There must be no misunderstanding or harmful hostility between us. We must have a correct image of ourselves and we must keep drawing the right conclusions." Zhirinovskiy denied having ever mentioned the acceptability of dividing Poland or sharing it between the Russian and German spheres of influence. "We are worried about the south but we have no problems in the west," he said adding: "We want our western borders to remain unchanged." Referring to the borders and to the city of Lvov, Zhirinovskiy said that the problem can be solved. "Do the Poles want Lvov? No. O.K. I see no problem. What I did say is that there are forces in Poland which claim that Lvov is a Polish town taken away from its country. But there are many border towns such as Trieste or Tyrol which are always disputable. My father was born in Lvov in the Russian empire. Lvov later was a Polish city. Then it became a Ukrainian and, finally, a Soviet city. In which country was my father born? Was it Russia, Poland, Ukraine, or the Soviet Union? I do not know but this cannot go on like this forever," he stressed. "Stability and clarity must prevail. History is full of disputable issues. So let us finish with mutual intimidating and digging in history. Time has come to calm down and stop creating uncertain and nervous situations," Zhirinovskiy emphasized. Janusz Bryczkowski who extended the invitation to Zhirinovskiy was on a private visit to Moscow on January 14-17 where he met with Zhirinovskiy last Saturday. Zhirinovskiy plans to pay an unofficial visit to Poland at the end of January.
