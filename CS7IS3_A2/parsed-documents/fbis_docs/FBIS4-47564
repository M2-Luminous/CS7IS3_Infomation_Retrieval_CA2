The Volga basin has two nuclear power plants. The Dunay basin, which had 10 in 1978, is expected to have 29 by the year 2000. The Dnepr basin has six such plants. The work reported here was performed in 1988 and involved studies of the two radionuclides that are the most ecologically significant -- [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]137[/] Cs -- in the hydrobionts of the Volga, Dunay, and Dnepr. The researchers found the following in terms of [.sup]90[/] Sr levels in the Volga: algae (Cladophora), 0.4-9.7 Bq/kg; higher water-plants, 0.4- 32.6 Bq/kr; mollusks, 2.3-28.1 Bq/kr; fish, 0.2-2.2 Bq/kg. Those figures for the Dunay were 3.9-30.1 (green filament algae), 0.2- 5.7, 3.5-64.0, and 1.4-2.3. For the Dnepr, they were 92.1-525.4 (green filament algae), 25.5-1165.5, 6.5-4144.0, and 5.9-120.6. Green filament algae had [.sup]137[/]Cs levels that were 9.3- 24.5 Bq/kg in the Volga, 8.9-69.6 in the Dunay, and 259.4-2479.0 in the Dnepr. Higher water-plants showed the following levels: 0.6- 58.5 Bq/kg (Volga), 2.6-93.6 (Dunay), and 10.1-5920.0 (Dnepr). Volga mollusks had levels of 0.9-35.6 Bq/kg, as opposed to 3.3-11.8 in the Dunay and 9.6-148.0 in the Dnepr. Fish had levels of 0.8-5.1 Bq/kg in the Volga, 10.7-17.0 in the Dunay, and 15.5-44400.0 in the Dnepr. References 11: 7 Russian, 4 Western.
