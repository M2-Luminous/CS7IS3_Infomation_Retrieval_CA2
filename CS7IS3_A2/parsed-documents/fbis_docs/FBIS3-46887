Telecoms is one of the four priority areas in ongoing bilateral trade framework talks. The negotiators are scheduled to wind up their discussions before February 11, when Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton meet to assess the entire talks. According to the sources, this week's discussions centered on how to determine objective criteria in the telecoms field to measure any progress. The U.S. asked Japan to use the average market share of foreign products in other developed nations as the objective criteria, but Japan did not agree, they said. They said the U.S. is looking for indicators which can be used to measure concrete progress, but Japan is concerned that such indicators would be regarded as targets to which it would be required to meet. If the working-level negotiators cannot come closer to agreement on the issue, the decision may have to be left to subcabinet-level talks, the sources said. They said the negotiators also discussed whether purchases by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. and other large organizations should be included in the category of the government procurement, but no agreement was reached on this point either.
