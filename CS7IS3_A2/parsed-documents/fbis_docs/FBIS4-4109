The meeting with the Dalai Lama by an official of any country means instigation and support to the separationist activities of the Dalai Lama and constitutes an interference in the internal affairs of China, Wu said. It will be met with resolute opposition from the Chinese people. Mr. Wu Jianmin made the statements when asked to comment on the report about U.S. President Clinton's meeting with the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama is not only a religious leader, but also a political exile, Mr. Wu said. He has long been engaging in activities designed to split the country and undermine the national unity. "All his activities have brought harm to the interests of all the Chinese people, including the Tibetan compatriots," Wu said. "We hope that the U.S. Government will keep to its commitment on the Tibetan issue and refrain from doing anything that will harm the Sino-U.S. relations," Wu said.
