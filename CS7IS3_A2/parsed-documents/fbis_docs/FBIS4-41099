Ivanchenko, deputy chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, by Valentin Maslennikov; place and date of interview not stated: "Will We Manage Without Party Distortions?"] [Text] The draft law on the basic guarantees of Russian Federation citizens' electoral rights has undergone approbation in the State Duma committees. Soon it will be submitted to a plenary session of parliament's lower chamber. What is its importance and topicality? This question is answered by A.V. Ivanchenko, deputy chairman of the Central Electoral Commission. [Ivanchenko] We are waiting impatiently for the draft to acquire the force of law. It is the first in a series of electoral laws which open up a new stage in the reform of the entire electoral system as a whole. On its basis the laws of the Federation components on elections of representative and executive organs of power and local self-management will be adopted. The precise demarcation of the powers of federal and regional legislators essentially begins with this draft. The hands of representatives of power locally are untied. And our law here will guarantee that no one can encroach on the very important right of the citizen to elect and be elected. The adoption of this law is awaited by the newly elected authorities in the Federation's components. When the law appears they will have a guarantee of the stability of their existence. [Maslennikov] Whose was the initiative to adopt this law? [Ivanchenko] It was the initiative of the State Duma committees for the affairs of the Federation and regional policy, for legislation and court and legal reform, and for questions of local self-management. It was they who were the first to voice their concern at the course of the elections in the regions. It was at their insistence that the Duma adopted the decree in which it suggested that the president prepare a draft of this law as a priority and submit it for its examination. To prepare the law a joint commission was created, which elaborated this draft. It included deputies of the State Duma and Federal Council, and representatives of the Central Electoral Commission and leading scientific institutions. The draft was discussed beforehand in local areas, in particular in Kaluga, Astrakhan, and Khabarovsk. It was approved at seminar-conferences which we have been holding. During this work changes and amplifications were made to it. A number of articles were radically reworked. In my view it is now in a high degree of readiness. [Maslennikov] Does the draft law really no longer contain any contradictions which could give rise to deputies' objections or disagreement? [Ivanchenko] That is something which probably never happens in lawmaking practice. Although the absolute majority of members of the conciliation commission support the completed draft law. We are embarrassed by considerations of a different order, to be more precise the very fierce party allegiances of some deputies. Thus, for instance, Deputy V. Sheynis (an active developer of this draft, incidentally) has recently started to encroach on the procedure for forming the electoral commissions proposed in the future law. The present version provides for equal participation in the appointment of the Central Electoral Commission chairman and his deputy and the commission's secretary and members by the president, Federation Council, State Duma, and components of the Federation. In particular the State Duma makes nominations put forward by the deputies' factions and groups. But Viktor Leonidovich Sheynis is inclined exclusively toward the party principle for forming commissions. I think he knows full well where this can lead, particularly locally. Instead of a precisely operating commission at best we shall get a debating club. In addition so far our multiparty system is making itself felt more in Moscow but by no means in outlying districts. There, with a party approach toward the formation of commissions, there will probably be organs incapable of working. Practice shows that electoral commissions locally have no taste for debates so they must unfailingly be built on a balance of interests of both representative and executive power. Artificially imposing a multiparty system from above is fraught with the danger of adverse consequences. The equal rights of the candidates will be cancelled out and the interests of voters in single-seat districts will be well and truly ignored. A distortion in the direction of a party bias will unfailingly result in an encroachment on the interests of independent voters and their candidates. The commissions created on the party principle will not be able to be objective. The legislator must create real and equal guarantees for the rights of voters and candidates and not resurrect the monopoly of any party. [Maslennikov] Voters have had many complaints against the electoral commissions which obviously delayed the summing up of election results.... [Ivanchenko] That is not their fault. Nor is it the fault of the Central Electoral Commission. The statute on the 1993 elections to the benefit of the capital's party interests excluded from the process of counting votes on party lists not only the rayon and city but also the oblast and kray levels of electoral commissions. And over 100,000 electoral commissions' protocols were taken to Moscow by couriers. Disrespect and distrust was shown toward the regions and the summing up of the results was delayed. In the new law we have striven to avoid blunders of this nature. [Maslennikov] Is there certainty that the law will be adopted immediately at the first reading? [Ivanchenko] The enormous volume of work done in advance in the Duma committees permits us to hope so. In addition both the president and the deputies themselves are interested in the law on basic guarantees of voters' rights beginning to operate as soon as possible.
