The project equally meets Turkey's and Ukraine's interests, as allowing both nations to maximally diversify their petroleum supply sources, and boost their prestige and economic influence on the European continent. Considering the project's political and economic significance Presidents Kravchuk of Ukraine and Demirel of Turkey gave it the green light at its early drafting stage and pledged their personal support for it. The merger project and its Turkish construction part were drafted by the Kiev-based Yugnipronefteprovod research institute. According to its experts, the project's pipe-line tracing, number of ramifications may be increased or altered, depending on the number of parties, which might be interested in its implementation. As tentative estimates suggest, the original version may cost 2,750 million U.S. dollars. The existent and under construction facilities of the transshipment terminal nearby Odessa (the Yuzhny port), which are supposed to be able to handle 40 million tons of petroleum a year, will allow Ukraine to not only fully meet its domestic petroleum requirements, including those of its oil refineries, but also pipe large amounts of crude petroleum to nations in East, Central and West Europe, which are, same as Ukraine, dependent on Russian fuel exports. Thus, this major alternative petroleum supply source is expected to lessen Ukraine's dependence on Russia both economically and politically. On March 11 President Kravchuk met in Kiev with Vetad Birlik, Turkish President Demirel's personal envoy and C.E.O. of the Birkan firm. The Turkish official stressed the Turkish pipe-line project's significance, while discussing bilateral business relations between the two Pontic nations, as well the importance of the two national pipe-line systems' merger. As Mr. Berlik disclosed, negotiations are underway aimed at establishment of a Ukrainian-Turkish joint venture, which will undertake the major pipe-line construction project. According to Mr. Berlik, the Turkish party intends to maximally rely on the Ukrainian experts' experience in laying pipe-lines (Ukrainian research and construction institutions used to take part in pipe- line construction across the former USSR and in many foreign countries). In January, 1994 a Ukrainian delegation met with Turkish President Demirel, and a tentative agreement was reached on cooperation and the President's personal support for the project. As Mr. Berlik further disclosed, Turkey has concluded an agreement with Iraq on future petroleum supplies for piping petroleum, extracted in the Middle East, to Ukraine and other nations in Europe. Eventually, other oil extracting nations may join the project, primarily Iran, as petroleum exporters. As the project's architects believe, their brainchild may attract many OPEC nations by its much simpler route for oil piping, in particular, those of them, who cannot reach an agreement among themselves, with European oil producers and with Russia on export quotas, all of which, taken together, may greatly contribute to the trend to lower petroleum prices on the petroleum and petroleum products.
