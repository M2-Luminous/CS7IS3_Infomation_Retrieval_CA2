Hosokawa made the call at a special government committee to discuss trade issues that require a cross-ministry approach. The committee is expected to decide on a new action program for making the government procurement process more transparent and fair at the next meeting on February 3, the officials said. The backbone of the measures will be the compiling of a manual for the procedures and creation of a database for bidding information, they said. Hosokawa will present the measures to U.S. President Bill Clinton when they meet on February 11. The latest steps will cover all the government's procurements of goods, but not services. The subcabinet-level committee, which held its first meeting in August 1985, was set up to handle trade issues that require cooperation and cordination among ministries and agencies.
