Calling for a complete reassessment of threat perceptions, to the country's security in the context of the unipolar world and the present unsettled international order, the report says that India would have to stand "firm to counter the pressures which may be sought to be placed on us." Asserting that a new dimension to the militancy problem had been added by the induction of foreign mercenaries with sophisticated weapons into Jammu and Kashmir, the report said that this had added to the terrorist depredations in the Valley. India, the report said was facing a "dark conspiracy" as the spurt in the level of militancy from across the border was being timed with raising the bogey of violations of human rights in international forums to put maximum pressure on the country. The report has revealed that Pakistan has been using the territory of some neighbouring countries to infiltrate trained militants, arms and ammunition and explosives into India. The report says that Pakistani governmental and non-governmental agencies had extended their anti-India campaign and were encouraging several anti-India groups within the country to work as new channels for the clandestine inflow of arms. The report said these groups were also being used to engineer communal violence like bomb blasts and other acts of arson and sabotage. While, India was taking measures to decimate the threat of militants, the country was also facing indirect international pressure in the shape of increased restraints being imposed by industrially advanced nations on transfer of defence technology. This, the report said was proving to be a major constraint on defence self reliance and thus called for a greater outlay on research and development in the coming years. Taking note of the increasing defence spending of Pakistan and its move to acquire highly sophisticated weapons which go far beyond its legitimate needs, the report said this was coupled with Pakistan's acquisition of the new M-11 missile system from China and the greater defence co-operation between the two countries. Along with this, the report says India also needed to take note of reported proliferation of missiles in Saudi Arabia and Iran. It also says that China has embarked upon an ambitious programme of modernisation of its armed forces and had purchased state of the art fighter aircraft from Russia. All these developments, the report said would compel India to adopt prudent measures to ensure its own security through a stronger defence system. On the Sino-Indian relations, the report says there has been a perceptible movement, with the signing of the historic agreement to maintain peace and tranquillity on the borders between the two countries. Under the agreement, the report says, the two sides would strictly respect and observe the line of control with neither side over-stepping it.
