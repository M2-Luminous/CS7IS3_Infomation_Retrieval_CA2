EFFECTIVE DATE: May 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Irene Darzenta or Shawn Thompson, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;6320, or (202) 482&hyph;3965, respectively. POSTPONEMENT: On April 26, 1994, AL Tech Specialty Steel Corp., Carpenter Technology Corp., Crucible Specialty Metals Division, Electralloy Corporation, Republic Engineered Steels, Slater Steels Corporation, Talley Metals Technology, Inc. and the United Steelworkers of America, AFL&hyph;CIO/CLC, petitioners in the above-referenced investigations, requested that the Department of Commerce (the Department) postpone its preliminary determinations until July 28, 1994. Petitioners made this request in order to permit further analysis of the respondents' questionnaire responses in the investigations of stainless steel bar from India, Italy and Spain. Furthermore, petitioners stated that postponements are necessary to permit them to determine whether the record contains evidence to support allegations that home market sales were made at prices below the cost of production in India and Italy. Finally, petitioners request that the investigations of stainless steel bar from Brazil and Japan be postponed in order to keep all five investigations on the same time table. In accordance with section 733(c)(1)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), (19 U.S.C. 1673b(c)(1)(A)) and 19 CFR 353.15(c), we find no compelling reason to deny the request and are, accordingly, postponing the date of all five preliminary determinations until July 28, 1994. This notice is published pursuant to section 733(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(d). Dated: May 9, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
