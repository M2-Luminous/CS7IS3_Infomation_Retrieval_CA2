FBIS4-7889 "dreeu067__a94008" FBIS-EEU-94-067-A Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria WEU Assembly Leader Cites `Enhanced Status' WEU Assembly Leader Cites `Enhanced Status' AU0504154394 Sofia BTA in English 1454 GMT 5 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0504154394 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Sofia, April 5 (BTA) -- Bulgaria will probably be granted the so-called "enhanced status" of a Western European Union (WEU) associate member at a meeting of the ministers of the WEU-member states, said Sir Dudley Smith, president of the WEU Assembly, at the Parliamentary Foreign Policy Committee today. Membership in the WEU for Bulgaria is comparable to membership in NATO, Sir Dudley Smith told MP's. The WEU is to a great extent a catalyst in NATO and UN activities, said Mr. Cameron, also member of the WEU delegation headed by Mr. Smith visiting this country since yesterday. The visit provides a chance for Bulgaria to defend its democratic image, Mr. Nikolay Slatinski, chairman of the Parliamentary National Security Committee, told BTA after a meeting of the WEU delegation with this committee. Bulgaria should convince the European states that it is neither economically not politically inferior to the states of the Visegrad group, Mr. Slatinski added. At present Bulgaria holds the status of a permanent observer in the WEU. We should not aim at the highest possible as regards Bulgaria's future status in the WEU; in this respect I am moderately optimistic, Ivan Gaytandzhiev MP told journalists. As an associate member Bulgaria will be able (possibly through a representation in Brussels) to take part in preliminary investigations and in the making and implementation of decision to be adopted by the full WEU members, Mr. Robins of the WEU delegation explained. It has also been provided for maintaining constant contacts between the defence ministries and other institutions of the countries of various statuses in the WEU. Central Europe should become an integral part of the WEU and the Union may therefore have to change its name, Sir Dudley Smith said at the meeting. As regards Russia, at present that country has too many unsolved problems to be accepted in the WEU, the president of the WEU Assembly added. Sir Dudley Smith described the decision of the UN Security Council to send Greek and Turkish blue helmets to Bosnia as inappropriate. Greece's stand on the Macedonian state is too extreme; Bulgaria is a leading force in the eastern part of the Balkans, Sir Dudley Smith told MP's of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Events similar to the ones in Bosnia may take place in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] as well and it is necessary to avert them. The WEU is fully aware of the role of a frontline state which Bulgaria has assumed in enforcing the Yugo-embargo, he added. The president of the WEU Assembly told MP's that it is important for the Bulgaria side to make out a good case of the issue of its embargo-related losses at the session of the WEU Assembly in June 1994. The potentials of the Bulgarian military industrial complex are interesting and deserve to be studied in greater detail, Mr. Cameron told MP's today in response to a question. The WEU Assembly has recommended the ministers of its member-states to allow the associated countries to take part in the work of the WEU Satellite Telecommunications Centre in Spain, Mr. Cameron recalled. There are ample opportunities for future cooperation between Bulgaria and the WEU in arms production through the so-called Western European Armaments Group, the WEU delegation believes.
