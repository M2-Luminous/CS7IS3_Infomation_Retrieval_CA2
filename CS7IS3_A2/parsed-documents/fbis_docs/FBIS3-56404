Nedosekina from Pskov; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] Pskov has become the first oblast in Russia where the Latvian Republic has opened its consulate. This is not accidental. The whole state border between Russia and Latvia goes through Pskov oblast. A lot is being expected from the new consulate. It will make it possible for people who have been suddenly divided by state borders to preserve kinship and friendly ties. In the past one had to travel from the border to St. Petersburg to get a visa. Strengthening economic contacts between Russia and Latvia is another important thing. Around 40 joint ventures are operating in Pskov oblast alone. Today's event is the first sign. Estonia's consulate and an office of the Russian Foreign Ministry are to be opened in Pskov in the future.
