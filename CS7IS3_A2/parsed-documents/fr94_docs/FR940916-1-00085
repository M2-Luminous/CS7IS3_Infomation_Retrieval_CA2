FR940916-1-00085 FR940916-1-00016 In the ANPRM (57 FR 62555), FRA requested comments from the industry on possible methods of providing information regarding the status of dynamic brakes to the engineer in the cab of the controlling locomotive. The only workable option presented to FRA in the comments received was the equipping of locomotives with a dynamic brake display. Although FRA recognizes that the technology for dynamic brake displays with the ability to provide the type of information sought by FRA is not readily available today, several commenters suggested that it is currently being developed. FRA believes that the benefits of such an indicator would be to alert engineers that they have diminished or excessive dynamic capabilities, thus permitting the engineer to control the braking of their train in the safest possible manner. However, in order to fully evaluate the viability of this proposal, FRA seeks comments from all interested parties regarding the following specific issues: (1) What is the status on the future availability of dynamic brake indicators capable of providing the information required by this proposal? (2) Are FRA's cost estimates regarding this proposal accurate? (3) What quantitative and/or qualitative operational or safety benefits can be derived from the use of these devices? (4) What alternative methods are available for providing the same information that a dynamic brake indicator would provide to a locomotive engineer? VII. Miscellaneous Issues A. Brake Pipe Reduction Present regulations require brake-pipe reductions of either 15 pounds, 20 pounds, or full service depending on which of the required train air brake test is being performed. 49 CFR 232.12, 232.13. In the ANPRM (57 FR 62556), FRA sought comments from interested parties to determine if it is feasible and beneficial for FRA to establish one standard brake-pipe reduction for all required train air brake tests. The AAR and several railroads recommended that some type of performance standard be established so that each railroad could determine the amount of reduction that best suits its operation. The AAR also suggested that if the reduction amounts were left in the discretion of the individual railroads, it would be receptive to a requirement that the railroad indicate what reduction rates it would use at different locations. Several railroads commented that one standard reduction should be required for all tests and inspections and that the standard should not require an increase to a full service reduction because such a practice could cause undesired releases. These commenters also noted that one standardized reduction for all tests would simplify air brake tests and make it easier for the railroads to train and instruct their employees. Most of the commenting railroads suggested a 20-psi reduction if a specific amount were established. Two commuter railroads stated that they are unable to comply with 49 CFR 232.12 as currently written because they are unable to make a service rate reduction on some of their equipment. Two labor organizations recommended that one standard reduction be established by FRA rather than allowing each individual railroad to determine their own reductions. This recommendation was based on the commenters' concern that varying reduction standards among the railroads would cause confusion for train crews since many railroads swap trains and operate crews over each other's lines. These commenters also felt that one standardized reduction would make training easier. FRA Conclusions. FRA agrees with many of the commenters that a standardized brake pipe reduction of 20 psi is sufficient for the performance of all required brake inspections and tests. FRA believes that the adoption of one standard reduction will simplify both the performance of the required inspections and the training of employees charged with performing these inspections. Under the proposal FRA would no longer require full service reductions for any of required inspections in order to avoid the possibility of undesired releases. FRA feels that the suggestion of several commenters to allow each railroad to determine its own brake pipe reduction is not viable. It is not uncommon to find train crews operating in several different locations or to find the train crew of one railroad operating the equipment belonging to another railroad or operating over the lines of another railroad. Thus, if various reductions were established by different railroads or by one railroad in different locations, it would merely cause further confusion in both the performance of the inspections and the training of personnel.
