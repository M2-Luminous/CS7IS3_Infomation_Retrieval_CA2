FBIS4-5982 "dreas074_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-074 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 North Korea ROK Rebuffs `National Conference' Proposal ROK Rebuffs `National Conference' Proposal SK1604110994 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1016 GMT 16 Apr 94 SK1604110994 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Dishonest and Rude Act"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities refused to take over our letter to the South Korean authorities, political parties, organizations and individual figures and overseas Koreans. Commenting on this unreasonable act of the South Korean authorities, a news analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says: If they had had a shred of patriotism and desire to achieve peace and peaceful reunification of the country, they should have positively responded to our fair proposal for the convocation of a national conference for seeking a way of great national unity. The South Korean authorities, however, refused to take over our letter, preposterously claiming that the proposal "ignores North- South dialogue" and it is not "conducive to improving North-South relations." This is, in every respect, an unreasonable, rude act and a challenge to the entire fellow countrymen desirous of reonciliation, unity and reunification. By turning down our proposal and balking the convocation of a national conference, the South Korean rulers are fully revealing their criminal nature as the very one who does not have dialogue for reunification but keeps others from having dialogue and seeks only confrontation, division and a war against the North. The South Korean authorities would be well advised to look squarely at the reality, act with discretion and stop such anti- national acts as obstructing the convocation of a national conference. The whole nation will keep tabs on their follow-up action.
