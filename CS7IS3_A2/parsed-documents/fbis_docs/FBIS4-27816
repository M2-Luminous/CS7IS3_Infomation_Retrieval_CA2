The government purchase price, or producers' price, will stay unchanged for the third consecutive year despite the government's desire to cut the price. Mutsuki Kato, minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, will refer the agreement to the rice price council at a meeting to be held later in the day, the sources said. The government had wanted to narrow the price gap between Japan and other countries. The price of domestic wheat is said five times higher than the price of imported grains. But the coalition parties, which were backed by wheat producers opposed to the price cut, claimed a cut would weaken production capacity. The wheat price was cut for six years in a row from 1986. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Social Democratic Party (SDP) were also opposed to the price cut for fiscal 1994. The council will apparently decide the wheat price on the advice of the ministry.
