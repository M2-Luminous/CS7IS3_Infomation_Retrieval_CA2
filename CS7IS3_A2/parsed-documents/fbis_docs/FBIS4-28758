On the Japan-U.S. framework talks, Garten declared: "We are not demanding numerical targets for market share and such." On whether the pledge to increase the number of sales outlets in Japan for foreign automobiles is equivalent to "numerical targets," he avoided a clear statement by saying: "Detailed discussion on negotiations is an issue for later," thus indicating that defining numerical targets remains to be done. Regarding Japan's official development assistance (ODA) projects, he remarked: "I understand that they are open to U.S. corporations, but I would like to see some effort being made on providing information on bidding and other complicated mechanisms." In praising the reopening of the framework talks as "having gotten off to a good start," Undersecretary Garten stated he "would like to work to reach an agreement as soon as possible." Regarding the outlook for an agreement, however, he expressed the view: "There is no particular time limit. We have just begun detailed discussions, so now is not an appropriate time to predict when we will have an agreement." Speaking about his intention -- expressed in an interview last week -- to demand expanded participation by U.S. corporations in Japanese ODA projects, Undersecretary Garten emphasized: "My statement has been a little misunderstood. I understand that ODA projects are open to foreign corporations." He then revealed his thinking: "What I mean is that I would like to see some effort made on providing information on bidding and other complicated mechanisms and to have it made easy for U.S. corporations to participate." The undersecretary also touched on cooperation with Japan in multimedia and other advanced technologies in the telecommunications field: "It will be an important topic for future Japan-U.S. relations." Furthermore, he stated: "It will be necessary for both our countries to lead the world in such areas as intellectual property rights and the standardization of machine standards. The Clinton administration is making an effort to help U.S. companies expand exports. Undersecretary Garten particularly expressed the ideas of strengthening the functions of the U.S. Export-Import Bank and backing exports by small and medium enterprises. He pointed out 10 countries that are expected to grow into promising export markets: South Korea, China, Indonesia, India, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Poland, and Turkey. Among those, he indicated that China and Indonesia "will become the highest-priority countries."
