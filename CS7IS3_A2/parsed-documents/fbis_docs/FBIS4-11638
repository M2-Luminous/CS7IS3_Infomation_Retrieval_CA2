At yesterday's session, the Cabinet asked the ministerial committee to meet again to prepare a new draft law on the audio and visual media. Following discussions, the committee prepared a specific program for amending Legislative Decree No. 4, and these amendments will be presented to the cabinet at its next session, which I believe will be held next Wednesday [6 April], so it can make the appropriate decision and refer the draft amendments to the Chamber of Deputies. Regarding the law on audio and visual media, which is being redrafted, the committee reviewed it in light of all recent developments. We again heard the views of the ministers. There was a general discussion of this issue and it became evident that it is necessary to completely redraft the entire law in a way that ensures the citizen's rights and protects public freedoms and the homeland's higher interests. Therefore, we have begun to prepare a new draft law. I believe that we will able to make progress at the next session in light of all the data that will be at the disposal of the committee at next week's session. [passage omitted]
