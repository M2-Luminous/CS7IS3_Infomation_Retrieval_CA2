FBIS4-55042 "dreeu090_d_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-090 Daily Report 10 May 1994 SLOVAKIA Country Seen as Prey to `Foreign Interests' Country Seen as Prey to `Foreign Interests' AU0905151694 AU0905151694 BFN [Editorial Report] Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 3 May on page 10, under the headline "New `Lessons From the Crisis-Ridden Development,'" carries a 4,500-word paper signed by Augustin Marian Huska, deputy chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), which analyzes the "ten most serious mistakes" in the HZDS's activity. The text is preceded by an introductory passage, which notes: "Materials of unclear and even dubious origin appear on our editorial desk from time to time. The one that we submit to you today carries the type-written signature of A.M. Huska, the architect of HZDS ideology. The style and ideas really indicate his authorship, or the authorship of someone who is his brilliant imitator." In the text itself, the author identifies the following "ten most serious mistakes" in the HZDS's activity -- underestimation of the influence of foreign interests in Slovakia; insufficient personnel work; priority given to "tactical improvisation over strategic concepts"; failure to tap the intellectual potential of the so-called HZDS professional clubs; complacency of the HZDS apparatus; failure to show that HZDS policies "follow up on the spiritual and cultural traditions of the nation"; ineffective cooperation with academics and researchers; lack of team work; failure to activate the young generation; and poor cooperation with the media. Speaking about the first point, the author says: "The complex geopolitical situation and the power vacuum in Central Europe have activated neighboring countries and the centers of world influence to assert their selfish interests. The manipulatory circles became active particularly when they discovered that Meciar's government wanted to consistently protect Slovak state interests. A power struggle is at play, designed to secure the dominance of foreign interests in the republic and testing citizens' resilience to this influence. The aim of these foreign interests is a weak government (that is, one that is `cooperative' and ready for `compromise'). It is necessary to get to know the foreign interests' lines of force and find abroad allies for preserving Slovakia's sovereignty. It is necessary to make use of the contradictory nature of foreign interests in order to mutually neutralize them. It is necessary to systematically explain the danger arising from domestic circles' links with these foreign interests. It is necessary to expose the opportunistic two-facedness of domestic political forces that profit in a parasitical way from the identity between their own and foreign interests. It is necessary to launch extensive propaganda so that the state interests of Slovakia become the framework for assessing the legitimacy of all other interests operating here." In Huska's opinion, the "foreign forces" make use of the doctrine of "cosmopolitism" as an "instrument to enforce their own dominance" and promote the "so-called civic society with the aim of halting the process of emancipation in Slovakia."
