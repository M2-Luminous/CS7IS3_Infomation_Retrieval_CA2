FBIS3-9038 "dreeu053__a94035" FBIS-EEU-94-053-A Document Type:Daily Report 17 Mar 1993 ANNEX Slovakia Parliament Approves Early Fall Elections AU1703163694 Prague CTK in English 1612 GMT 17 Mar 93 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1703163694 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava, March 17 (CTK) -- The Slovak parliament today unanimously passed a constitutional law providing for calling early elections on September 30-October 1. The law was approved by all the 149 deputies present. The parliament has 150 seats. The regular elections were to be held only in 1996. The early elections are expected by optimists to produce a more lasting solution to Slovakia's political instability. The government crisis was solved within five days since the parliament passed a vote of no confidence in former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, when the former opposition succeeded in forming a new cabinet under Jozef Moravcik. Uncertainty has characterized the situation in the country practically since the June 1992 elections because Meciar's victorious Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) has failed to ensure a parliamentary majority. Moreover political squabbling was absorbing forces necessary to solve the deteriorating economic and social situation. The autumn date was also supported by the new opposition led by ex-Prime Minister Meciar after their proposal to hold elections at the beginning of summer failed. The drive to collect a sufficient number of signatures to a petition on calling a referendum on holding elections without delay, on the mandates of "errant" parliamentary deputies and on the "purity" of the money used in privatization has also failed. The new government and the new coalition will have to face for more than half a year the deteriorating problems of the country and the harsh election campaign. This will be followed by a decision on Slovakia's further orientation and a verdict on a possible second "resurrection" of ex- Prime Minister Meciar who undoubtedly played the main role in the creation of independent Slovakia. It was the methods and results of his rule that unified the post- communist left, the right-orientated Christian democrats and the "dissidents" from Meciar's HZDS who are seeking their place in the middle of the political spectrum, and enlisted the former opposition's support of the Hungarian coalition -- Egyutteles and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH). In reaction to today's vote in parliament, Jan Slota, chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS) which had formed the ruling coalition with the HZDS, said "we had to support the date (for early elections as proposed by the new government coalition) because the president (Michal Kovac) marred the referendum." But he added that he thought that the president would prevent the referendum "even if we had 6,000 valid signatures." Olga Keltosova, former Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, said that "elections are the only democratic way of bringing somebody to power." She was apparently hinting to the way of creation of the new government which the present opposition deputies call illegitimate.
