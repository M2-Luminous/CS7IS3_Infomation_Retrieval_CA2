Japanese Ambassador to China Michihiko Kunihiro and Zie Zhenhua, director of China's State Environmental Protection Bureau, signed the treaty, while Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Chinese Premier Li Peng attended the signing ceremony. Under the treaty, Japan and China will boost exchanges between experts and exchange information to prevent acid rain, water and air pollution and disposal of noxious waste. The two nations will also hold joint seminars and meetings to discuss cooperation. The two sides will set up a joint committee to review the bilateral cooperation once a year. China relies on coal-fired power stations for more than 70 percent of its electricity. Burning of coal releases large amounts of sulfur dioxide believed to cause acid rain. The treaty will be good for two years.
