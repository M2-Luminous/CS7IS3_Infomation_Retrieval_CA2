The draft tries to combine in the new basic law the principles of territorial sovereignty on the basis of Russian federalism. The articles on freedoms of citizens are being amended to bring them in line with universally accepted norms. A program for implementing the law on the Komi republic's state languages caused debates. The majority of lawmakers regarded a list of posts that require the knowledge of two languages, Russian and Komi, as a limitation of civil rights. No agreement was reached on a list of the premises that should be equipped with systems for simultaneous translation at the expense of the budget. A decision was adopted on selling oil shares to people residing in oil-extracting regions on a preferential basis for money and vouchers. A strict provision on a procedure for holding competition for the right to use Komi natural resources was approved.
