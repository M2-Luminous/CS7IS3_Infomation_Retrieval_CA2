Lambeck: "Bonn Hesitates With Aid to Rwanda"] [Excerpt] Bonn/Paris -- In case of a French intervention in the African civil war country of Rwanda, the Federal Government will not provide logistical aid or become otherwise involved for the time being. Despite very early information by the French about the forthcoming intervention and despite a request for support, Bonn has refused. However, the Chancellor's Office, the Foreign Ministry, and the Defense Ministry in Bonn intend to permit humanitarian relief flights by the Air Force as soon as the Kigali airport is secured and is firmly held by the French. This would involve the supply of pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs. Any participation in a military action must, however, be renounced until the Federal Constitutional Court has ruled on the Bundeswehr's missions abroad. Such a ruling is expected this July. Among the political leadership of the Defense Ministry, it is said: "The ruling of the Constitutional Court has absolute priority for us." France had asked Germany, Italy, and Belgium to participate in the planned intervention. French Government officials had pointed to the strategic partnership between the two countries. However, both Bonn and Rome refused to participate. Italy's Defense Minister Cesare Previti said yesterday that Italy is not willing to send troops. [passage omitted]
