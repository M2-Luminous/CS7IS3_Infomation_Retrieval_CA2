No firm cease-fire has yet been signed. The two parties have, however, agreed to meet again and keep their guns under wraps for the time being. The government side is relatively satisfied with the outcome. Earlier, Christophe Boisbouvier spoke to Abderamane Izzo, the leader of the government delegation in Bangui. In spite of the absence of a cease-fire, he does not expect fighting to flare up again in the south of the country. [Begin recording] [Izzo] No, no, no. There will not be war. There will not be war for the simple reason that we have declared a unilateral cease-fire. On the other hand, there will not be war because, as everyone heard yesterday, the president of the CSNPD [Committee of National Revival for Peace and Democracy] solemnly declared that his troops would not attack the positions of the Chadian national army. [Boisbouvier] There nevertheless remains a major stumbling block with the issue of the referendum on federalism demanded by the rebels and, it seems, rejected by you. [Izza] Yes, listen, there is no way that having held just a meeting here in Bangui we can sign a document here with a minority, a tiny minority I would say, of the Chadian people on such an important issue. We expect them to examine their own consciences. [end recording] As you heard, the question of federalism was not solved in Bangui. Moise Tchiete, the leader of the southern rebel movement, is nevertheless satisfied that the issue was discussed: [Begin Tchiete recording] We are satisfied that the fundamental problems, which had always been fudged, were actually raised during these roundtable talks. I mean above all the problem of federalism. The fundamental problem in Chad is a above all a structural problem, a problem of cohabitation between the different groups that make up the Chadian population. You cannot forget the fact that we have been at war for 34 years, and we cannot carry on fighting like this. We are not closing the door to other groups, be they political, political-military, or other. We expect that these groups might also want to raise problems that are equally fundamental.
