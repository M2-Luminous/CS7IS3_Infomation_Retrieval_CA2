After his talks with visiting Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen, Kozyrev reminded reporters of "strongly negative estimation" of Bosnian Serb attacks on civilian facilities and, especially, a hospital in the Moslem-held town of Gorazde, noting that the international community has the right to work for termination of criminal actions. At the same time, the Russian minister pointed out, a military response of NATO "would not be the best choice." "Russia, the United States, the United Nations and the European Union should draw up a common approach to the Bosnian problem," Kozyrev said, describing this as "very important."
