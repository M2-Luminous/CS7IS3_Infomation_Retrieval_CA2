The successful bidding company will also have to invest $1 billion, within a five-year period, to install more than 1 million telephone lines in our country. [Begin unidentified official recording, in progress] ...whose bid totals $2,002,179,198. [end recording] In what represents an amazing world record for telecommunications privatization, the Telephone Company of Peru [Telefonica del Peru] consortium, headed by the Telephone Company of Spain [Telefonica de Espana], bid $2,002,179,198 for 35 percent of CPT shares and 35 percent of Entelperu shares, thus quadrupling the base price, estimated at $535 million. The bid greatly surpassed the two bids presented by other two consortia: Peruvian Telecommunications Company [Telecomunicaciones del Peru], headed by the U.S. company GTE, which offered to pay $803 million; and Peruvian Telecommunications Holding Limited, which offered to pay $857,142,857. [Begin recording] [Telephone Company of Spain representative Jorge Santillana] The first variable that we have introduced is to bet on Peru as a country with a telecommunications development potential that is part of Peru's economic development. This was one of the basic variables. According to these basic variables, we belong to an international group that nowadays has established itself in Venezuela, Argentina, Chile, Puerto Rico, and Colombia. For us, our investment in Peru, to a certain extent, complements a market that we have. We have bet on the development potential. [CPT President Antonio Paucar] We never dreamed of such a quantity of money entering. I believe Peru never dreamed... [pauses] Never before in Peruvian history has such a quantity of money been received for investment in private companies. [Unidentified reporter] When will the successful bidding company be finally paying the quantity...? [Paucar, interrupting] It should be paying in about 30 days. [end recording] During the five-year period during which it will hold a monopoly on the (?Sifa) telephone system and the long distance service, the Spanish consortium, along with the Peruvian companies Brewery Backus and Johnston, Inc., Wiese Bank, and Granda y Montero, will install 1 million telephone lines, involving an investment of $1.5 billion [as heard]. [Begin Santillana recording] We will fulfill our promise. We will meet the terms established in the bidding conditions. [end recording] CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] President Jaime Yoshiyama, who attended the ceremony, emphasized the transaction's amount. [Begin Yoshiyama recording] In addition to this amount, the $2 billion that the company will pay, $1 billion will be invested to install the new telephones. This represents about $3 billion that are entering Peru. I believe this represents a success for which the public must be grateful to the Privatizations Committee. [end recording] For his part, after expressing his total satisfaction over the success of the Telecommunications Company's auction, President Alberto Fujimori pointed out that, with this amount, the (?balance) will be guaranteed. He said about $1.4 billion from CPT's and Entelperu's sale will be allocated for the enhancement of social programs. [Begin Fujimori recording] This is good news because it is not merely a circumstantial investment, a so-called speculative capital. It actually is a long-term investment, based on our country's established legal stability for foreign investors. Now then, in a nutshell, in order to... [pauses] [words indistinct]. This represents a very clear sign that the privatization process, our economy's modernization, is working. Therefore, their telephone company will arrive in Peru. It is clearly specified on the contract: 1,453 towns that did not have telephone lines will have one in the period established by the contract. In this regard, I am satisfied with the fact that this privatization has been such an overwhelming success. In fact, this will guarantee our balance. Of this amount, $610 million will be invested in the purchase of new [word indistinct] for (?microwaves) and the total purchase amount, namely $1.391 billion [as heard], will go directly to the treasury. This obviously will allow us to enhance all our social programs. [end recording]
