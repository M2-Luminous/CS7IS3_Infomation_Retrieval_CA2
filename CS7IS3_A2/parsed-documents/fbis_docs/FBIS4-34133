[Begin Endara recording] I wish to bring to the attention of the appropriate heads of state a topic that I believe is of great importance and fairness for Panama and the Panamanian people. I am referring to the readmission of Panama as a full member of the permanent group for political dialogue and unity, better known as the Rio Group. In February 1988, when Dictator Noriega overthrew the makeshift civilian president, right here in Cartagena, the Group of Eight suspended Panama from the group disclosing before the whole world the real anti-democratic form of government ruling my country at that time. I am taking this opportunity, this very important meeting, to express my wishes because it is my most heartfelt desire to see my people completely incorporated within Latin America before I leave office. Today, having consolidated democracy, we have the moral authority to request that we be rightfully readmitted to a group that is very important. This will contribute to strengthening our integrating capacity for South and Central America, this latter region that, after many sacrifices, deserves the greatest praise. [end recording]
