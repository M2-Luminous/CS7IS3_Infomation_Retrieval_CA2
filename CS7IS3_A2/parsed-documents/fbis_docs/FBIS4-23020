The possibility of also using it to detect the causative agents of dangerous infectious diseases has also been demonstrated in principle (V.S. Rybkin, 1983; G.M. Orlova et al., 1986; Yu.A. Belaya, 1987; T.M. Grizhebovskiy, et al., 1987; O.V. Sivkova, 1988). Our industry does not produce the respective diagnosticums, however. Such preparations are also needed to detect and identify isolated cultures and conduct accelerated analyses, especially under field conditions, in emergencies, and during mass studies. This communication is devoted to the development of plague tularemia, cholera, glanders, and melioidosis dry coagglutinating diagnosticums and to the study of their use in different stages of bacteriologic investigation. Vaccine and virulent strains of bacteria of the respective species were used to prepare the antigens in the experiments, and strains of various heterologous microorganisms were used to study the resultant preparations' specificity. The optimum schemes of producing rabbit immune sera were selected for each diagnosticum. Dry commercial staphylococcal reagent (produced by the Leningrad Epidemiology and Microbiology Scientific Research Institute imeni Pasteur) were sensitized by using native sera in accordance with recommendations. The amount of sensitizing agent and duration of sensitization were selected individually for each diagnosticum. For a working dilution, researchers used a dilution equal to half the maximum resulting in a preparation efficiently agglutinating homologous antigens. The liquid diagnosticums were lyophilized in a saccharose-gelatin medium. Equipment produced by Friger (Czechosolvakia) was used. When setting up the reaction, researchers applied a drop of prepared microbial suspension onto clean degreased glass, added a drop of dissolved preparation, mixed it, and examined it against a dark background. They checked for the absence of spontaneous agglutination of the diagnosticum and suspension of study cultures. The result was calculated over 5 minutes; a response to 4+ and 3+ was considered positive. Three versions of plague diagnosticums were developed on the basis of different sera, i.e., diagnosticums to whole live microbial cells of the vaccine strain EV 1290, to the somatic antigen (fraction V) of the acapsular atoxic version of the same strain, and to fraction I of Yersinia pestis. The specific activity of these preparations was studied in experiments on 80 capsular and 14 acapsular strains of plague microbe grown at 28 and 37�C. The first preparation agglutinated bacteria of the homologous type of typical and atypical acapsular strains in a concentration of 10[.sup]7[/] microbe cells/ml and higher. The activity of the second preparation was on the same level; however, the formation of finer agglutinate with incomplete clarification of the fluid was frequently observed. The third preparation detected only capsular versions of plague causative agent. The reaction was clearer with bacteria grown at 37�C, and its sensitivity reached 10[.sup]6[/] microbe cells/ml with selected strains. Only the third preparation possessed strict species specificity, whereas the first and second preparations also reacted with selected strains of pseudotuberculosis causative agent. Several versions of group-specific cholera diagnosticums with various characteristics in relation to Vibrio cholerae 01 and non-01 were prepared. The rabbits were immunized by intravenous injection of suspensions of daily cultures of different strains of V. cholerae 01 subjected to prolonged boiling. Conditions to produce a highly specific preparation were selected. Reaction sensitivity ranged from 10[.sup]6[/] to 10[.sup]8[/] microbe cells/ml depending on the strain. Coagglutination was not observed with V. cholerae non-01. The diagnosticum's high specificity during identification of cultures isolated during the 1990 cholera outbreak was demonstrated. To obtain a tularemia diagnosticum, animals were immunized with a 3x intravenous suspension of formalin-killed Francisella tularensis of the vaccine strain 15. In a study of five series of preparation using 96 strains of tularemia causative agent, including freshly isolated agent, the sensitivity of reaction with formalin-treated suspensions ranged from 10 to 10[.sup]-1[/] units based on standard turbidity and from 10 to 10[.sup]-2[/] units with boiling. With heterologous strains of different species of bacteria, no positive reaction was noted. The antigen relationship of the causative agents of glanders and melioidosis and their serological cross-reactions make identification and differentiation of these bacteria difficult. Immune sera obtained to corpuscular antigens of each of the species agglutinated bacteria of both species. Cross-reactions were successfully eliminated by adsorbing melioidosis serum with glanders antigen, whereas depletion of glanders serum by melioidosis bacteria resulted in a loss of its activity. The melioidosis diagnosticum thus acquired strict species specificity, whereas the glanders diagnosticum agglutinated bacteria of both homologous strains and most strains of melioidosis causative agent. The reaction's sensitivity ranged from 10[.sup]7[/] to 10[.sup]9[/] microbe cells/ml. Simultaneous use of the two diagnosticums during serologic identification of the causative agents of melioidosis and glanders makes it possible to differentiate the species. In a study of the reaction of coagglutination of individual colonies grown on dense culture media or elective colonies with seeding of pure or mixed cultures, the diagnosticums clearly detected the respective colonies, which permitted rapid serologic identification and a reduction in analysis time. In a study of coagglutination reactions, the biological material of animals containing tularemia causative agent were subjected to boiling and centrifugation. This eliminated nonspecific reactions, and in all cases, tularemia antigen was detected in a suspension of the organs of animals that had died after infection. The tularemia diagnosticum was used in studying field material during epizooty of this infection. The positive results in the coagglutination reaction were always confirmed by isolating cultures. No false-positive reactions were observed. The possibility of detecting cholera vibrios in feces and the possibility of detecting the causative agents of glanders and melioidosis in mixed cultures after enrichment of the material on elective media were demonstrated under experimental conditions. The set of dry coagglutinating diagnosticums consisting of plague, tularemia, cholera, glanders, and melioidosis preparations that was developed may be recommended for identifying cultures, screening colonies, and detecting causative agents in biological material and in an external medium during an accelerated analysis process, as well as in quick analysis.
