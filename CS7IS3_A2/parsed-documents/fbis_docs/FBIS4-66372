Latest statistics show that Daqing, China's largest oilfield, pumped 13.86 million tons in the period from January through March--100,000 tons more than in the same period last year. Daqing, whose output accounts for 40 percent of China's total, will maintain annual production at more than 56 million tons at least until 1995, and 50 million tons through the year 2000. Chinese onshore oilfields produced 139 million tons of oil last year. In the first quarter of this year, the onshore oilfields produced 34.33 million tons, up 0.58 percent over the same period last year. Output of the Liaohe, Xinjiang and Dagang oilfields during the first quarter were, respectively, 3.6 million tons, up 5.4 percent; 1.95 million tons, up 10.4 percent; and 1.04 million tons, up 4.1 percent. However, production at some other major oilfields dropped as expected. Most of the country's oilfields, concentrated in Northeast and Central China, have been exploited for decades. A senior official from the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) says he is confident production at the old oilfields can be maintained. Onshore oil production for this year is expected to be 140 million tons. The official said measures will be taken to stabilize or even increase production. CNPC, the country's largest oil firm, intends to beef up investment and technology development in East China, with approval from the central government. Old oilfields in this region are expected to be the pillar of the country's petroleum industry until at least the year 2000. CNPC's goal is to keep annual production in the East at more than 124 million tons, the official said. East China reports progress in discovering new oil reserves and working out techniques to exploit heavy-oil reserves and oilfields where geological conditions are used to limit production. In addition, equipment and expertise to develop shallow offshore waters on the continental shelf have been worked out. While trying every means to stabilize production in the old oilfields, CNPC will accelerate exploration and development in the Tarim, Turpan-Hami and Junggar basins in West China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Billions of tons of oil reserves in the region are expected to benefit by the national economy in the next century.
