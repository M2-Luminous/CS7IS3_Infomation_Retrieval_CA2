He strongly defended the government bill on pharmaceutical patents, emphasizing that its implementation will not provoke a rise in medicine prices. Cavallo said the government bill contemplates the possibility of importing medicines from other countries if prices go up "excessively." Cavallo said the government's eagerness to approve a patents law "is not due to the possibility of economic sanctions by the United States, but to the need to encourage investment and permit our scientific and technological development." Cavallo participated in the Senate public hearing, before representatives of all interested committees, to explain the government position with respect to the controversial patents law, an initiative that the U.S. Government tenaciously wants approved. Cavallo spoke for over two and a half hours. During this time he answered innumerable questions from legislators and directors of the different entities interested in the issue of medicines manufacturing and trading. The finance minister's visit to the Senate was within the framework of a round of hearings organized by the Industry Committee, presided over by Senator Jose Genoud of the Radical Civic Union. The patents bill, however, is also being analyzed by the Science and Technology Committee, the Health Committee, and the Commerce and Penal Affairs Committee. During the long session Cavallo did not mention the possibility of submitting a new draft bill replacing the one currently under discussion in the Senate. The executive branch sent the bill to Congress in March 1993. Cavallo said that senators will introduce all the necessary changes into the original bill. The economy minister said the protection of intellectual property rights in general, and particularly the protection of intellectual rights in the field of pharmaceuticals, is "essential for investment in research and development." He made clear he was talking about "large investments, because efforts to discover new products and find solutions to health problems demand very large amounts of money and a lot of knowledge." Cavallo said that in order to achieve those objectives "you need to risk capital, and those who risk it want to have certain guarantees that the product resulting from their investment in research and development will not lose value because it is easy to copy." The minister said he was convinced that "Argentina will be able to receive risk capital only if intellectual properties are well protected." "The reason why the executive branch presented this project on patents was because it wanted the country to offer the best possible conditions for strong investment in research and development," Cavallo said. The minister said that a country capable of organizing teams of good scientists and technicians involved in research and development "can also create the conditions for national capital to take advantage of the good climate for the application of human knowledge to invest in research and development in the country." Cavallo emphasized that the protection of intellectual property rights through a patents regime "is part of a policy that aims at encouraging investments in Argentina, and above all forms of investment that are very important for the future growth of the nation." The minister explained that this was why the Carlos Menem administration supported the establishment of a minimum level of protection for intellectual property rights in the GATT talks. The economy minister said that the idea of approving a patents law in exchange for the elimination of agricultural subsidies by developed countries "is a very weak argument, because anyone with a good understanding of the way the world economy and national economies function knows that a country that does not provide protection for intellectual rights will pay for it in the long run, because it will be forced to remain on the sidelines of the flow of investments." "It is not very convincing to threaten to do something that will end up hurting your country," Cavallo said, in justifying the scarce benefits developing countries obtained through the GATT talks. During the long negotiations, which lasted almost eight years, the poorest countries argued with little success that they could protect intellectual property rights only if they obtained concessions in the agricultural field. Cavallo said he was convinced developing countries will be able to remove the industrialized countries' distorting policies "when each one of our countries has obtained the degree of economic power capable of transforming us into relevant negotiators on a world scale." The minister said: "In order to achieve this objective we must create the best conditions for investment, but particularly for investments that yield the greatest return, such as investments in research and development, well directed and intelligently administered." Cavallo reiterated that the eagerness of the executive branch to give protection to intellectual rights "is part of a policy that wants to encourage investment and growth in Argentina." Referring to the possibility that the bill protecting intellectual rights could hurt the population by provoking a rise in medicine prices, Cavallo said: "The argument is deceitful and has a minimum degree of truth." "When you speak about satisfying the needs of the people, you cannot only think of the act of production in a factory, once you have finished your research and you have something new. Because it is more important to have the capacity and the means to discover something than the ability to take a product to the market." "The more we encourage investment, the more we will have the competitive ability to develop new products, new medicines, and new solutions to health problems," Cavallo said. The minister said that the supply of a determined drug or medicine "in the medium and long term, which is what matters, depends essentially on the amount of investment by the different laboratories in finding solutions to unsolved problems." "Nothing can guarantee you that those who copy a medicine and introduce it into the market will be able to sell it cheaper," Cavallo said. He said there are cases of copied medicines that are more expensive than the original products. Cavallo, however, did not give details about brands or laboratories. "It is very important for medicines to have reasonable prices. There is no reason why we should not encourage competition through prices, always giving, of course, the best possible information about the product," Cavallo said. "I do not believe national or foreign laboratories when they say that they can supply the market at lower prices. I think Argentina's and the world's experience is that the pharmaceutical industry tends to charge the highest possible prices," the minister said. He said the solution to the problem of high prices "must be faced, on one hand, by encouraging investment, so that each laboratory makes the maximum research effort and generates more competition; and second, by the implementation of general rules used by countries to make sure that prices are not excessive." Cavallo defended the application of the law of competition in the case of medicines, recalling that the official project on pharmaceutical patents includes a clause permitting the importation of products if there are excessive price increases. This clause permits the importation of medicines, but from countries with patent laws that recognize intellectual property rights. Cavallo said the executive branch bill recognizes research efforts, and protects the population by guaranteeing reasonable prices. "It is not true that the patents law will provoke price increases," the minister said.
