FBIS4-50254 "drchi095_b_94007" FBIS-CHI-94-095 Daily Report 13 May 1994 United States & Canada XINHUA Cites U.S. Congressional Report on MFN Issue XINHUA Cites U.S. Congressional Report on MFN Issue OW1305160494 Beijing XINHUA in English 1521 GMT 13 May 94 OW1305160494 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Washington, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Disruption in U.S.-China trade relations would cost American consumers more than 10 billion dollars annually and deal a serious financial blow to several key U.S. industries, a study by the Congressional Research Service warns. The study, requested by the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and released by Senator Mark Hatfield here Wednesday [11 May], also concludes that possible retaliation by China would have profound economic and employment consequences for those states which now rank among the highest in exports to China, including Washington, California, Texas, Florida and Louisiana. The report takes no position on the renewal of MFN [most-favored nation] status for China, but Hatfield, a ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said the document "offers an authoritative appraisal of the economic implications of that question." "China will experience phenomenal economic growth in the coming years and that will be true regardless of its trading status with the United States. This fact cannot be ignored during the upcoming debate on MFN renewal. "The findings of this report only heighten my doubt that most favored nation status is the right tool to use to promote democracy in China," Hatfield said. The study, entitled "China-U.S. Economic Relations: The Costs to the U.S. of Withdrawing Most Favored Nation Tariff Treatment and Other Questions", is the first to provide a comprehensive analysis, by economic sector and by state, of the potential impact of disruption in U.S.-China trade relations. It also contains these findings: -- Termination of China's MFN status would not only mean a loss of that market for certain U.S. industries, but would have a domino effect by reducing the competitiveness of those industries in other global markets. -- Annual review of China's MFN status has posed a continuing risk for U.S. companies doing business in China not faced by other foreign firms in China. -- From 1990 to 1993 U.S. exports to China increased by over 82 percent while exports to Japan and the European Union fell. China went from being the 12th largest purchaser of U.S. transportation equipment to the 3rd, an increase of nearly 200 percent compared with only a 3 percent increase from the rest of the world. -- China is the United States' number one market for fertilizer and a top market for road vehicles, telecommunications equipment and various types of specialized machinery. The release of the study, three weeks before U.S. President Bill Clinton has to decide whether or not to renew China's MFN, is seen as an increase of pressure on the White House to handle the matter in a way that best serves the interests of American consumers and businesses.
