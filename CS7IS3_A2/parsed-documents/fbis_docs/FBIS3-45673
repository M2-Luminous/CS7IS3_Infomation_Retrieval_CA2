Addressing a meeting Thursday [20 January], Zhang Baifa, an executive deputy mayor of Beijing, said that the reform of personnel management is one of the most crucial measures to be taken this year to promote economic development and bring the potential of civil servants in the municipal organizations into full play. The capital's personnel management system reform aims at restructuring government organizations, putting the civil service system into practice and speeding up the wage system reform in government organizations, the deputy mayor said. The municipal government will work hard to achieve a healthy development of the city's center where talented people can seek new and suitable jobs. The capital will also speed up the social insurance system reform in municipal government organizations so as to maintain social stability and guarantee personnel management reform. In addition, effective measures will be taken to enable large and medium-sized state-run enterprises and the rural areas of the capital to stem the brain drain, Zhang said.
