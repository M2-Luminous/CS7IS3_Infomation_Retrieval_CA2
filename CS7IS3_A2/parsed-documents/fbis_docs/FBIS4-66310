This is a most important task to be achieved at the propaganda and ideology front. The effects of accurate guidance of public opinion are huge. Accurate guidance of public opinion will consolidate popular feelings and enhance popular spirit. Faulty guidance of public opinion will result in slackening of morale, which will have serious consequences. Historical experiences tell us that it has never been possible to achieve glorious victories, be it in revolution or in construction, without accurate guidance of public opinion. During the past 15 years of reform and opening up, accurate guidance of public opinion has been extremely effective. It has been effective in the "liberation of minds," in renovating concepts, in unifying thought and action of the entire party and of all people throughout the nation, in preserving a secure and united social and political situation, in arousing and manifesting the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the masses, and in promoting the smooth progress of reform, of opening up, and of all modernization projects. The exemplary strength displayed by Jiao Yulu [3542 5940 4389], when secretary of the county party committee, is up to this day an inspiration for all the many cadres and for the masses. The pioneering spirit of the people of Linxian County has the effect of a huge motivating force for all the people of the province to work hard toward bringing prosperity to Henan Province. The great "liberation of the mind" discussion, that has been organized these last one, two years, has promoted a renovation of concepts among all cadres and the masses throughout the province. The systematic reportage on "The Upsurge of Reform in the Mid-China Plains" strengthened the confidence of all the people throughout the province in deepening the reform and in promoting economic development. The heroic feats of Xu Honggang [1776 3163 0474] and Zhang Huanli [1728 3883 4409], their readiness to fight for a just cause, is just now encouraging millions of young men and women of the central plain to fight courageously against evil and wickedness and to promote and develop a healthy atmosphere. The many advanced models that have emerged on all our battle fronts have already become examples to be emulated by all the people of the entire province... We must review the experiences in these various quarters and draw lessons from them, in order to enhance the effectiveness of our guidance of public opinion. Correct guidance of public opinion requires of us that we firmly persist in preserving unity and stability, that we evoke enthusiasm, that we pursue a policy of positive propaganda, and that we give prominence to the main theme of reform, opening up, and economic development. We must propagate most thoroughly the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, of the Third Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and of the Eighth Session of the Fifth Provincial Party Congress, namely to maintain continuity and stability in our basic propagandistic themes. We must comprehensively and correctly propagate the political line, principles, and policies of the party. We must persist in dialectical materialism and avoid one-sidedness, and we must also observe propagandistic discipline. We must profusely propagate the achievements of reform and opening up, and must concentrate attention on economic construction as focal point and main battle ground. We must effectively deal with the various relationships. We must accurately guide, effectively protect, and effectively bring into play the enthusiasm of the masses and of every sector of society. We must encourage and stimulate the unswerving confidence of the masses, and have them energetically forge ahead as of one heart and one mind, while taking the interests of the whole into consideration, in order to have the various reform plans smoothly presented and implemented and creating an excellent social environment in the area of public opinion. We must predominantly propagate those positive ideas and actions that will encourage, inspire, and enlighten the people as to the struggle for the purpose of achieving a prosperous and strong state, the welfare of the people, and an advanced society. We must regularly and without respite propagate various advanced exemplary cases of topical characteristics, review and disseminate the advanced experiences created by cadres and masses in every locality, and have their advanced ideas and experiences become the common wealth shared by the entire province. Correct guidance of public opinion requires more propaganda among the masses. We must enthusiastically propagate advanced personalities as such are found among workers, peasants, intellectuals, and soldiers, who at their ordinary posts show unselfish dedication. We must more effectively guide the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses toward the grand undertaking of our modernization projects. We must create throughout the entire society an excellent custom of striving for healthy progress and active forging-ahead. In the opposite case, if we were to pander to the tastes of some people and unrestrainedly publicize the stars, people of financial prominence, and the abnormal consumption of those who spend money like water, our guidance would be misdirected, would lead to a slackening of morale, and to a collapse of fighting spirit. This year is extremely critical for the deepening of reform and for progress in economic development, a year in which a series of new important reform measures will continuously be initiated, and in which, as a consequence, some new contradictions and new problems will prop up. This will require of all who are engaged in propagandistic and ideological work to familiarize themselves well with the overall situation, to effectively handle, in the course of ongoing work, the relationship between reform, economic development, and social stability. It requires close coordination with the general and particular policies of the party, deep penetration of the basic levels, and strengthening of investigation and research in public sentiment and in the mentality of the masses. It requires fullest propagation of the enormous achievements of reform and opening up during the past 15 years, and active propaganda of the excellent state of reform, opening up, and economic development, informing of good examples and good experiences in all reform measures seen in actual practice. It requires opening up ideological channels deep into sentiments and reasoning, with convincing arguments and in forms that are appreciated by the masses, concerning those problems that impact social stability, it requires resolving contradictions, straightening out moods and sentiments, and converting negative into positive factors. Correct guidance of public opinion also requires effective supervision of public opinion. Through supervision of public opinion we shall be able to oppose bureaucratism, to rectify unhealthy tendencies, to overcome various negative and decadent phenomena, and to strengthen the people's confidence in progress. Supervision of public opinion must pay attention to commending the good and to criticizing all shortcomings. It must appropriately deal with disturbing elements, it must support whoever favors reform, it must encourage exploratory activities, must educate those that have gone astray, must penalize the corrupt, and must prosecute those who lodge false accusations. In short, supervision of public opinion must definitely overcome the tendency to merely and purely strive for "sensational effects." Our attention must be directed toward achieving beneficial social results. We must firmly adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts in order to create a great environment in which solid work will be performed and new achievements will be attained.
