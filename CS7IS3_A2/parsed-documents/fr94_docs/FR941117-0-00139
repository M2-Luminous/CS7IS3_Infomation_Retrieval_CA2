FR941117-0-00139 FR941117-0-00011 §22.727 Power limits for conventional rural radiotelephone transmitters. The transmitting power of transmitters operating on the channels listed in §22.725 must not exceed the limits in this section. (a) Maximum ERP. The effective radiated power (ERP) of central office and rural subscriber station transmitters must not exceed the applicable limits in this paragraph under any circumstances. ␣ 1Frequency range (MHz) 1Maximum ERP (watts) 152&hyph;153 1400 157&hyph;159 150 454&hyph;455 3500 459&hyph;460 150 (b) Basic power limit. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the ERP of central office station transmitters must not exceed 500 Watts. (c) Height-power limits. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the ERP of central office station transmitters must not exceed the amount that would result in an average distance to the ``service contour'' of 41.6 kilometers (26 miles) for VHF channels or 30.7 kilometers (19 miles) for UHF channels. The average distance to the ``service contour'' is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the distances determined using the procedures specified in §22.567 for the eight cardinal radial directions, excluding cardinal radial directions for which 90% or more of the distance so calculated is over water. (d) Encompassed interfering contour areas. Central office station transmitters are exempt from the basic power and height-power limits of this section if the area within their interfering contours is totally encompassed by the interfering contours of operating co-channel central office station transmitters controlled by the same licensee. For the purpose of this paragraph, operating transmitters are authorized transmitters that are providing service to subscribers. (e) Adjacent channel protection. The ERP of central office station transmitters must not exceed 500 Watts if they transmit on channel 454.025 MHz and are located less than 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) from any Private Radio Services station receiving on adjacent channel 454.000 MHz. (f) Meteor burst stations. The transmitter output power for stations using meteor burst propagation modes must not exceed 2000 Watts for central office stations and 500 Watts for rural subscriber stations. §22.729 Meteor burst propagation modes. The rules in this section govern stations in this service that use meteor burst propagation modes to provide rural radiotelephone service in Alaska. (a) Channel assignments. The channels 42.40 and 44.10 MHz may be assigned to central office stations and rural subscriber stations, respectively, on a primary basis. The channels 44.20 and 45.90 MHz may be assigned to central office and rural subscriber stations, respectively, on a secondary basis to Private Radio services stations using meteor burst propagation modes. (b) Transmitting power. The transmitter output power must not exceed 2000 Watts for central office stations and 500 Watts for rural subscriber stations. (c) Station locations. Co-channel central office stations of different licensees must be at least 241 kilometers (150 miles) apart. A rural subscriber station and a central office station of different licensees must be at least 241 kilometers (150 miles) apart if the rural subscriber stations of the different licensees operate on the same channel. The FCC may waive the requirements of this paragraph if the affected users agree to a cooperative sharing arrangement. (d) Emission type. Only type F1D emission is authorized. (e) Bandwidth. The authorized bandwidth is 20 kHz. (f) Station identification. Station identification is required only for the central office station. (g) Interference. Stations authorized under the provisions of this section must not cause harmful interference to the service of stations in other radio services. (h) Developmental authorization. Meteor burst communications systems may be authorized under developmental authorizations pursuant to §22.419. §22.731 Emission limitations. Upon application for multichannel operation, the FCC may authorize emission bandwidths wider than those specified in §22.357, provided that spectrum utilization is equal to or better than that achieved by single channel operation. §22.733 Priority of service. Within the Rural Radiotelephone Service, the channels listed in §22.725 are intended primarily for use in rendition of public message service between rural subscriber and central office stations and to provide radio trunking facilities between central offices. The channels may also be used, however, for the rendition of private leased-line communication service provided that such usage would not reduce or impair the extent or quality of communication service that would be available, in the absence of private leased-line service, to the general public receiving or subsequently requesting public message service from a central office.
