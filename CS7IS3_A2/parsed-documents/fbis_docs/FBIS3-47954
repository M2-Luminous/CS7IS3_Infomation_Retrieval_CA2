Satsuki Eda, its leader and currently state minister in charge of the Science and Technology Agency, Shogo Abe, party secretary general, and Yanosuke Narasaki will join the group as early as next week after dissolving a parliamentary link with the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], they said. The USDP, which was formed in March 1978, splitting the SDP, will decide to put an end to its 16-year history next Monday at a meeting, they said. The other USDP lower house member, Naoto Kan, has already joined the parliamentary group. Abe told a party meeting in early January that his party's historical duty to seek power change is over. Eda has said that the USDP's dissolution would be a first step toward political realignment. The USDP, which has also one seat in the House of Councillors, joined six other parties last August to form the seven-party coalition government ousting the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from a 38-year grip on power following the general elections one month before. The JNP is led by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, while Sakigake is led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.
