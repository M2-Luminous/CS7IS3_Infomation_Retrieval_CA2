All indications showed that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho was to begin on the date which the two sides had agreed on. This deadline was set for 13 April. However, everything changed suddenly after the horrific Hebron massacre. The venue of the negotiations stopped being of any consequence, be it Washington, Cairo, or Taba where Egypt was providing all possible support for the progress of the talks. What is important now is that the talks must focus on providing international protection for the Palestinian people and on taking the necessary measures to guarantee that the Israeli aggressors do not attack the peace-loving Palestinian people.
