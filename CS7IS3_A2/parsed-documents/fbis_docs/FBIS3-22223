Skillius said that 103 states have already prohibited importing dangerous waste, among others Hungary, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. Head of Estonian Green Movement Baltic Sea Bureau Valdur Lahtvee said that as Estonia has no such law, problems with dangerous waste being imported with uncertain aims have already risen, quoting an incident two years ago when Asian Trade Gmbh and its Estonian partner United Products imported great numbers of used tyres which for an unclear reason caught fire. He also said that at present a cooperation project with Finnish Kemira to produce water purification coagulate was under way, in the course of which dangerous titanium oxyde waste is to be imported.
