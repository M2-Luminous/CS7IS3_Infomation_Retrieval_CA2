[passage omitted] Today is 12 Farvardin [1 April]. In fact, 16 years have passed since the victory of the revolution. [passage omitted] I presume that the form of our Islamic government is still unfamiliar to the world. Whenever the world refers to the Islamic Republic -- its decisions, organizations, officials, and responsibilities -- one senses that the world has not properly understood the formation of our government. [passage omitted] When the word, republic, comes to mind, people think it is like other republics. Yes, they do. The majority of the people voted for it; that is, 98.2 percent of all Iranians who could vote said yes to the Islamic Republic, and this system relies on the public vote. Its decisions take shape through by voting. Majles representatives are elected by voting. Members of the Experts Assembly are elected by the people. People use the ballot in many other cases. [passage omitted] Our people use the ballot to ensure that the government respects religious laws in employment and in the execution of government affairs. They voted that women should respect Islamic norms once they accept responsibility in organizations of the system. The republic has voted for the sovereignty of Islam. All people have called for the sovereignty of Islam. In some cases, it is true, votes are cast but they are not in contradiction with the principles of Islam. There is a supervisory body -- the honored Guardian Council which reviews approved bills and rejects things that contradict the constitution and the religious laws. Anyway, Islam is sovereign. The world has not understood the form of the Islamic rule. They sometimes ask: Who is the first person of the system? They see that in other systems the head of the executive is the first person. Then they see that the Islamic system is different, where the first person is the supreme jurisconsult and has the honored position of the leadership, presently his eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, may God preserve his noble shadow, [crowd chants in approval]. And he is responsible for determining the general plan of the country's management. In truth, the legitimacy of the other officials of the system is formed and actualized in their relationship to him. Of course, here I do not want to discuss the form of Islamic government which includes legitimacy, the measures of legitimacy, the method of activity, and the limits of activity. This is an extensive debate that must be discussed in its place. But I want to say that some officials in some countries speak, and one understands them to be thinking that republic in this system is the same as republic in some Arab or European country. Then they realize that the systems are not compatible in some issues and therefore ask: what are we to do? You should inform yourselves better. Improve your knowledge. You should understand our system, our people, our system of government and the rights and duties of each official. Take for example, as you know, the judiciary. In places I have visited during my term of office, or in various countries of the world which I have studied, the highest person responsible for the judiciary is in fact supervised by the executive and even in many places he is appointed by the president. Even in systems managed by councils, a number of the council members are appointed by the president. But our system is different. In our system, the official responsible for the judiciary is directly appointed by the esteemed leader. Naturally then there are many differences in terms of laws, rights, and manifestations. In fact, the independence of the three powers is relatively greater in Islamic government than the systems existing in the world today. Anyway, in the Islamic republic, where the republic has called for Islam and where all the officials of the system work on the basis of Islam, there is a particular system with its particular methods, manifestations and consequences. [passage omitted] There are a few other minor issues. Concerning the issue of the pilgrimage, I will voice my own view: First of all, I wish to point out to high-ranking officials that bilateral or multilateral issues cannot be resolved on a unilateral basis. One should never lose sight of this fact and try to resolve the issue on a unilateral basis. Whenever there is a bilateral or multilateral issue, we must accept the face that it should be resolved on a bilateral or multilateral basis. This is the terminology being used by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A unilateral solution is either no solution at all or, even if it is a solution, it is only a temporary solution and may have other consequences. Therefore, on the pilgrimage issue, one should accept that the problem is a bilateral problem. In order to resolve this problem, one should act in a bilateral way and, God willing, get to the root of the problem. In this connection, of course, if there are any words of advice or caution, any facts, one should bring these to the notice of the Saudi Government. One should remind them of the issues, inform them of the facts, and explain the situation of the Islamic Republics compared with other countries. When they say that there is no difference between this country and another country, one should tell them that there is a difference and there are reasons for the difference, and so on. One should explain the issues to them so that a correct solution can be found and the issue resolved on a fundamental basis. This is one point, that one cannot solve these problems from a unilateral point of view. Of course, you know that the responsible officials have been trying to have discussions, they are discussing it, and I do not have any specific information about the outcome of these talks. One should not make a promise from this podium unless it is clearly based on facts and is definite; and as I do not have any specific information I will not make any promises. The second issue - again I'm giving you my own opinion: It seems to me that we should clarify the issue and appoint someone with full powers. He should be told: Go and pursue the matter until a solution is found. This is the way to solve the problem. When every day we have a situation in which a certain newspaper of our country writes a certain article, a certain Saudi newspaper writes another article and a newspaper in a third country -- which has nothing to do with the Islamic Republic or with Saudi Arabia -- writes something else -- this newspaper is a famous newspaper. These are all examples, each one of them have to be discussed. If a newspaper has written a certain article, what has that got to do with the fate of two countries? If a newspaper has published something, what has that got to do with the fate of a country? Newspapers are free; each one of them publishes articles according to their taste. The issues of a country cannot be given to a couple of journalists to play with. A journalist's job is to do this. He looks at the issues and increases the size of his headline or reduces it. Or he might write something catchy for his headline and when you look at the article you do not see that much. I know a number of newspapers will not like what I am saying, but I have examples for everything I say. All I am saying is that someone should be given the responsibility by the higher authorities of the country -- with full powers and taking into account all the realities in our country, in the other country and in the world of Islam -- to solve this problem fundamentally and once and for all; and far from the fears and discussions created by newspapers, especially the media and newspapers of other countries, who are waiting for such opportunities to say something or other. The problem should be solved once and for all. The third issue -- again, this is my opinion: Regarding the hajj, I don't know if this decision was made by our esteemed deputy minister of culture and Islamic guidance or the minister of guidance or both. However, I say this: How many times should we experience one issue? If we experienced something and we were not successful, we should not go through it again. We should not repeat the act since we experienced defeat. When I see that it is officially announced that if someone were to have a passport and the passport holder had the visa to visit that country and we said: We will not give you an exit visa. I ask the honorable minister, and the esteemed deputy minister: Are you in a position to ban anyone from travelling abroad? Is leaving the country in your hands? What is the legal basis of your decision? You did this once, and you saw that certain people, even those held in high esteem by you, with passports at hand entered Saudi Arabia via other countries during the hajj. And you saw them there and they said to you: Hello, how are you! Why did you do this and create problems for us and yourselves? You did not achieve anything. My first point is legal and the political point is secondary. I say that the Hajj Organization or the Guidance Ministry -- because I do not know who made this decision.... [pauses] If someone has a passport, that means it does not matter. If someone has a visa, it means it does not matter. With a passport and a visa, why do you say: We will not let you go? You cannot say this. It is not within your jurisdiction to ban someone from travel abroad. What is this! How many people are there in the country who can do this? How many people can leave the country to go to hajj and be honored in this way? Let us pay a bit more attention to reality. In other words, limit the people to the extent that is called for, and by taking into account all the issues. [passage omitted] Palestine -- and about yesterday's agreement in Cairo -- and Mr. Clinton's remarks -- I really don't know; we must really ask the American President: who gave you the right -- you, who are on the other side of the world -- and on the basis of what criteria? Even if we look at it on the basis of common law -- on the basis of what criteria do you say that Quds [Jerusalem] belongs to Israel? On the basis of what criteria? You are the President of the United States. That is fine. The people of the United States voted for you. What right does this give you to interfere in the country of Palestine -- or Israel, as it stands? These remarks do not have any legal or judicial basis, even on the basis of common law. That is the first point. Secondly, let me say this to you: Palestine, the people of Palestine and Quds, all these agreements, remarks, signatures, and talks, as you have seen in practice, Palestinian jihadi groups are unanimously opposed to them. There are strikes every day. There are clashes every day. There are killings every day. The pure blood of the martyrs of the shrine of Abraham in al-Khalil [Hebron] has not even dried yet. The blood of the martyrs of the incident which took place a few days ago has not dried yet. Do you think that by just gathering together in a country such as Egypt, for example, or elsewhere and signing a piece of paper you can solve everything? You can do away with past promises? The people of Palestine are the true owners of Palestine. Quds is the permanent and eternal capital of Palestine and Palestine belongs to the Palestinian people. [crowd chants in support] They commit the worst crime. The entire world says that it was the ugliest crime to massacre people while they were kneeling in prayer in a mosque. Then they say that it was done by an extremist group; it had nothing to do with the government. A few days later, they kill a number of other people. Then they say, yes, it was such and such a group and it had nothing to do with the government. They use trickery and wear different clothes, then they massacre Palestinian youths, and then they give some other explanation for the incident. Let me tell you this: apart from military and war issues, the killers of the Palestinian Muslims in the Hebron mosque must definitely be brought before an international penal court sooner or later; whoever they may be. You say they are an extremist group, we say it was the government itself under the guise of an extremist group, and others say the order came from even higher up: from the United States or wherever else. What I am saying is this: an international penal court must definitely examine and try this crime and punish the perpetrators. [crowd chants in support] We hope the Armenian Government responds to the Foreign Ministry statement as soon as possible. Procrastinating and saying we have not officially received a report yet, or that it has been rushed, and so forth, will not suffice. In any case, an incident has occurred and the plane carrying a number of innocent people has crashed. The Foreign Ministry has investigated the matter and announced the results. A reply must be made. About our Afghan brothers, I do not know how to say it. Do they, themselves, know that there have recently been whispers in the world of appointing a guardian, of a partition, and so forth. Do you know what the outcome of the continuation of these wars and domestic clashes will be? For God's sake, for Islam's sake, leave these power struggles aside, stop these civil wars; put an end to the matter; do not break your recent cease fire; come and sit together and solve the problem and preserve Islam; do not ruin any further this ruined country. Otherwise one of oppressors or infidels who ruled your country for many years would come from the other side of the world, under the pretext that you cannot manage yourselves, and lay their hands on the country, and you will once again be enslaved by another power. Come and put an end to the matter. We hope that your cease-fire will have a happy ending. [passage omitted]
