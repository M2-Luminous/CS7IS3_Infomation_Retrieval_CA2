(Good) Yakudu! (Good) -- An Account of a Midnight Meeting Among Minority People's Deputies"] [Text] Beijing, 8 Mar (XINHUA) -- This was a spontaneous gathering. This is a vivid portrayal of great national unity. At 2300 [1400 GMT] on 7 March, a happy atmosphere filled the hall on the first floor of the Jingxi Hotel. A dozen people's deputies dressed in minority costumes gathered in the hall, singing happily, laughing heartily, and exchanging views on the old days and new happenings. Although they were of different nationalities and had language problems, they shook hands warmly; they shared the same views; their smiles were full of warmth; they exchanged greetings.... After arriving in Beijing, the minority deputies of the delegation representing the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region were very happy to learn that the delegation from Tibet Autonomous Region was also staying in the same hotel. Someone contacted the Tibet delegation. By now the Tibet delegation, which had just arrived in Beijing after a tiring journey, was well rested. Upon learning that the fraternal deputies from the Xinjiang delegation wished to meet them, members of the Tibet delegation joyfully jumped out of bed, dressed in their best national costumes, and rushed downstairs to meet the deputies of the Xinjiang delegation. Some deputies of the Tibet and Xinjiang delegations knew each other while some met for the first time. However, when the deputies of Uygur and Kirgiz nationalities from Xinjiang, who were wearing little flower hats and white felt hats, met with the Tibetan deputies wearing Tibetan costumes, it was especially warm like relatives meeting one another. "Zhaxidele!" (Tibetan for may your wishes come true) "Jiakexi!" (Kirgiz for how are you) Laughter, greetings, and chats continued, and the deputies were very excited. The atmosphere was very warm. In groups of three or five, they talked about the past, discussing reform and changes. Speaking most enthusiastically were [Ashanbaike Tuerdi], head of the Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture, and [Luosangjiangchun], head of the Nagu Prefectural Administrative Office. As they came from a pastoral area, they talked ceaselessly about reform and economic development in their respective areas. Deputy [Luosangjiangchun] said: "In the past few years, as a result of carrying out reform in Tibet's pastoral areas, animal husbandry has developed rapidly, thus raising herdsmen's living standard by a big margin. In 1993, per-capita income of Tibet's herdsmen topped 700 yuan, and each herdsman owned an average of 50 head of livestock. This situation means the people feel secure; there is social stability; there is national unity; and there is economic development." After hearing this story, Deputy [Ashanbaike Tuerdi] said: "Good! Good!" Continuing speaking, he said: "There are more than 100,000 Kirgiz people in our prefecture. Although our development is not as rapid as yours, the people's living conditions have improved tremendously in recent years. Taking advantage of geographical position, we have increased our income considerably by developing border trade and enlivening the market." [Luosangjiangchun] said happily: "All of us have witnessed changes. It is really good!" They continued talking, but no words could describe their joy and happiness. They agreed they should learn from each other, advance together, strengthen unity, and prosper together. These words by Amudun Niyaz, Uygur nationality deputy from Xinjiang, reflected the common desire of the deputies of various nationalities: "National unity, social stability, and economic development -- this constitutes the foundation for the prosperity of the Chinese nation. If we can do this, the living conditions of minority nationalities will, like the rest of the country, improve year by year, and the days ahead will become sweeter and sweeter!"
