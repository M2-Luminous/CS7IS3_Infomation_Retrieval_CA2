"When Shanxi people eat fish, they never take their hands off it" -- this used to an oft-used expression to described people in Shanxi who did not know how to cook and eat fish. There was virtually no fish farming in the province before 1980. However, that has changed. Figures show that during the past few years, fish production grew at 7 percent to 15 percent annually. All over the province, reservoirs, lakes and rivers, plus newly-dug ponds, have been used for fish farming. Ponds were dug along major river banks of the province, including the Yellow River, the Fenhe River and the Huotuo River, and at all possible areas around major cities and mines to raise fish. Large reservoirs became fish ponds as well. New techniques like small "net-cage culture", which was imported from the United States, were spread from only 70 cubic meters of water to over 800 cubic meters. New species of pond fish and fresh water butterfish were developed. So far, among all the province's 111 counties, 108 have established their own fishery industry. Annual total fish catch has grown from only 650 tons before 1980 to 14,000 tons last year.
