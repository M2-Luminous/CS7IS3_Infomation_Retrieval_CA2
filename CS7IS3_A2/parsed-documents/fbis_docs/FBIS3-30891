A union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina would consist of three republics in which one of the three constituent nations would be in the majority. Minority rights in each of the republics in the union would be guaranteed and supervised by the international community. In areas where they make up a compact body, the minorities could be organized in areas with a certain degree of autonomy. In case the union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina disintegrates, each republic would have to guarantee the same minority rights as is envisaged for the union. The Croatian view is identical to the EU proposal, known as the Kinkel-Juppe plan. Croatia again reiterated its proposal that the international community should supervise the border between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and carry out inspection of military formations. Of course, all hostilities must first cease. [passage omitted]
