The government work report mentioned that this year's plan fixed the growth rate of the gross domestic product at 9 percent. This was a realistic, positive, and feasible arrangement. It seems that the 9 percent growth rate is somewhat lower than the 13 percent growth rate in the previous two years, but it will remain a rather high growth rate in the process of China's economic development and a rarely-seen high growth rate as compared with Hong Kong, Taiwan, and some Southeast Asian countries and regions where the economic growth rates were high in world terms. If China can continue to maintain its economic growth rate around 8-9 percent for a number of years, it will be able to realize its second-step strategic objective of quadrupling its GNP three years ahead of the schedule, and this will be a remarkable achievement. Through the practice of reform, opening, and modernization over many years, more and more people have come to accept this point of view: China is facing a rare historical opportunity, which must be used to accelerate China's economic development; but development must follow a new course and must not follow the old course of unrealistically seeking a high growth rate of output value and expanding the size of investment. The government work report stressed: "All localities should proceed from their own conditions when deciding a reasonable development speed, and should not compare themselves with each other in an improper way and unrealistically seek higher output value." This guided all quarters in society to make solid efforts rather than doing something ineffective; to consistently focus efforts on achieving good economic results and seeking a solidly high growth rate rather than unrealistically creating some exaggerated statistics. In China, the development of the national economy is determined by two key factors: One is the vast countryside in which the overwhelming majority of the population is living; and the other is the more than 10,000 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises which form the backbone of the national economy. Successfully invigorating and developing these two economic sectors is of decisive significance for ensuring the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. Therefore, Premier Li Peng stressed in his report the need to adopt various measures for strengthening the position of agriculture and resolving prominent contradictions and problems in the rural areas. He said that it is necessary to make the rural economy prosper by every possible means, to increase peasant income, and especially to help the 80 million people in poor areas to obtain sufficient food and clothing within the last seven years of this century. The government work report also pointed out the need to improve production and management in the manufacturing and transport industries, especially in large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. All local governments and all departments should give priority to the work of improving large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in their work schedules, and should adopt measures to create a benign external environment for these enterprises and help them stop losses and increase profits in their business operation. The government work report realistically analyzed the prominent contradictions and difficulties in this year's work, and put forward pertinent countermeasures. Among other problems, the excessive size of investment in fixed assets is the toughest problem which causes great risks. The government has paid serious attention to this problem, and demanded that the size of investment this year be kept from further expanding. Even in the fields of basic industries and infrastructural construction, investment should also be made according to the actual capability. Financial and material resources should first be used to meet the needs of key projects in the fields of transportation, telecommunications, and major raw material production as well as projects for harnessing major rivers. Coastal areas are encouraged to make investment in the central and western regions of the country. This year, the government will not approve establishment of any new development zones, and new capital construction projects will not be started if funds are not guaranteed. The practice of using working funds for the purpose of capital investment will be banned. At the same time, through the in-depth reform of the investment structure, mechanisms for regulating and controlling investment will be established, and macro-control over investment will be improved. This will reduce blindness in investment and will curb investment swelling. Strengthening agriculture, improving operation of the large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, resolving contradictions, and overcoming difficulties will all rely on reform. Reform is the key link and is also the motive force. Without carrying out reform or without taking substantial reform steps, China may just lose the opportunity and fail to effect further development. Therefore, it is certain that this year will be a reform year in China. The government work report mentioned the contents, steps, and noticeable points of financial and taxation reform, banking reform, the reform of the state-owned enterprises, price reform, and institutional reform. The reform measures will profoundly touch a wide scope of vested interests, and their implementation will encounter great difficulties and will also have a profound impact. The Chinese Government is determined to lead the people throughout the country to make breakthroughs in key points and to make advances across the board by overcoming one difficulty after another. Because of the reforms are being carried out intensively against great difficulties, all localities throughout the country are required to create a benign condition, which is social stability. Without stability, it is impossible to carry out any reform measures no matter how good they are. At present, law and order in some localities is not good, and corruption exists among a small number of government personnel. These are unstable factors, which must be effectively overcome according to the government work report's requirement for preventing corruption and taking comprehensive measures for maintaining law and order. Reform is conditioned by stability, and stability should also be promoted by reform. The two things complement each other, and cannot be separated from one another.
