This topic has appeared rather unexpectedly, and, according to our habits acquired in the post-November era, it has become a political topic. Its real content has evaporated, and a completely wrong and misleading political viewpoint has been created instead: Whoever is in favor of full convertibility is a liberal--that is, a proreformist politician--and whoever is asking what is the proper moment and manner of the introduction of full convertibility and who warns against simplification is a politician who has abandoned his liberal faith and has become someone who is curbing the progress. I would like to show that the convertibility problem is not so simple. I am not going to present delicate textbook definitions regarding the convertibility of currency. Neither am I going to deal with the problem that is irrelevant to our discussion today--that is, should the yearly limit on foreign currency purchases by Czech citizens be increased or lifted altogether? This is a completely different matter. I believe that no one who has been engaged in this discussion is questioning the fact that it is economically advantageous to have: --an independent and autonomous monetary policy that respects economic objectives; --a fixed currency exchange rate, which is a starting point for making our economy strong and that is also a comprehensible signal to all domestic and foreign economic entities as regards our economic policy in the future; --a liberal flow of international capital (that is, the koruna's full convertibility), which would complete our integration into the world economy, and which is a transformation step to follow after the koruna's "internal convertibility" was introduced and foreign trade flows liberalized on 1 January 1991. It is not a problem to achieve one of the three goals--or two at a time-- but the problem is to achieve all three simultaneously. M. Goldstein and J.A. Frenkel said in their influential article in 1988: "The best thing to do is to achieve two of the three objectives. When there is a debate about monetary reform, the issue always is which of the two objectives should be opted for." I would be very happy if we discussed this problem rationally in our country right now. From my viewpoint, I would like to say the following on this subject: There are countries whose specific situation makes them indifferent toward the loss of the autonomy of their monetary policy. They are countries that are not undergoing any specific moment in their economic development. They are sorting out only "current and normal" problems, and, because of that, they can take the same course of action as their neighbors or their main economic partners. It is a paradox that not only countries of this type are willing to accept the loss of independence of their monetary policy, but also some politically unstable countries that do not have the courage to push for a tough and much-needed economic policy are willing to accept this loss. They believe that it is all right if the rest of the world, or an important neighboring country, gives discipline and toughness to their policy. (Certain countries participating in the European Monetary System could serve as an example.) I am fully convinced that the Czech Republic does not need to give up the autonomy of its monetary policy. The unique economic transformation in our country is based on the koruna's fixed conversion rate and pinning all the price-affecting factors to a fixed exchange rate (while the prices are still oscillating toward final values). The consequence of our economic transformation is a fundamental restructuring of our entire economy and a significant movement of prices toward more balanced levels (for 40 years, prices have been kept at irrationally established and completely erroneous levels). To give up the fixed exchange rate would be unwise and unnecessary at the moment. The disadvantages would outweigh the advantages. I would like to add one more thing. In Western countries, domestic prices are very rigid (that is, inflexible). There are various reasons for that (the oligopoly structure, excessive state interventionism, and faulty social policy). The flexibility of the currency exchange rate is a mechanism reducing the inflexibility of the domestic price structures. In our country, we do not have to do anything like that because our domestic prices are still in the adjustment phase and are still flexible enough. On the contrary, because their movement is dependent on many conditions, they need a fixed point, such as the exchange rate. Despite the fact that our objective is to continue liberalizing external economic relations, proceed with the deregulation of the financial flows, and attain a higher degree of external convertibility (according to the definitions of the International Monetary Fund Charter, we will be able to achieve the lower degree of "full" convertibility--that is, full convertibility of the current account of the balance of payment), it seems advantageous for the time being to opt for the first two of the three hardly compatible objectives and make them a short-term (or medium-term) priority.
