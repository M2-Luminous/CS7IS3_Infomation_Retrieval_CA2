"Time will tell whom Moscow is going to deal with in the future, Umar Avturkhanov told Interfax on Wednesday, but at the moment political or economic support for the Chechen opposition by Russia is out of the question." He also denied reports that Ruslan Khasbulatov is the shadow leader of the opposition and described them as groundless inventions. "We ask him for advice in one way or other, because he is also worried about the future of his people", Avturkhanov said. According to him, the delegation of the opposition began talks with Russia with the hope of working out a draft bilateral treaty and resolving several economic problems. "We would want Russian federal government bodies to take the Chechen question seriously, we want every official to know that deciding about Chechen matters he decides about the Russian state system", Avturkhanov said.
