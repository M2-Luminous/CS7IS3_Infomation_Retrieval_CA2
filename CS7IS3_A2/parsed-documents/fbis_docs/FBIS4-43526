The highlight of a short meeting with [Chancellor Franz] Vranitzky was Peres' statement: "We have no problems at all with Austria, relations could not be any better." It was not always like that, and it might become different with Italy. However, regarding questions in this connection Peres said that Prime Minister Berlusconi and Foreign Minister Martino were great friends of Israel. As far as the neofascist government members are concerned, one would have to wait and see. Peres appeared to be as optimistic as ever about the progress in the peace process, even though a severe controversy about Jerusalem flared up in the past few days. [passage omitted]
