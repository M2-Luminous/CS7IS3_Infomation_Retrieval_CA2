Senior government sources point to over 40 settlements that the government will probably have no choice but to evacuate. In the meantime, it seems that the tendency to leave voluntarily is growing among the settlers. Over 1,000 settlers have so far appealed to the Construction and Housing Ministry to leave and Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer admits that contrary to the law, he approved rental aid for the center of the country. Roni Daniyel and 'Imanu'el Rosen report: [Begin recording] [Daniyel] This is the picture that says it all. In the heart of Hebron's casbah the white roofed houses belong to the Jewish settlement in the town. There are about 400 Jews in Tall al-Rumaythah, Bet Hadasa, Bet Romano, and the Avraham Avinu market among 120,000 Arabs. That is what threatens to ignite a big fire. [Ben-Eli'ezer] That obliges us and the entire public to say to them: Despite all the pain and sorrow we feel, you are being evacuated from Qiryat Arba. Period. [passage omitted] The Ministerial Committee on National Security Affairs discussed the fate of those houses this week. Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer and Shulamit Aloni demanded the immediate evacuation of the Jews from Hebron. The prime minister listened but did not respond. Many ministers believe that he will order their evacuation, but not now, not before the Declaration of Principles is implemented. 'Uzi Bar'am promises to raise the issue at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. [Bar'am] I think that only a few ministers have declared their opposition therefore there is still a silent group, including the foreign minister, and it is very important to hear their opinions on the matter. [Rosen] What is the prime minister's stand on the Hebron issue, as far as you know. [Bar'am] I think that the prime minister does not want to touch the Hebron issue because he wants to continue with the position that we do not evacuate settlements at this stage. I do not think he agrees with the settlement inside Hebron, he simply thinks it does not pay to concentrate all the forces on that issue now. [Daniyel] But Hebron is only a small example of a much larger problem. This is Karmel which does not have Arab neighbors or in fact any neighbors. It is a Jewish settlement, 30 families, on the slopes of the Hebron Hills, with a narrow road and almost no traffic, a clear example of an isolated settlement. [passage omitted] Karmel is also only one example. The government ministries and the defense establishment have already prepared the lists. Over 40 settlements are defined as isolated settlements in the heart of Arab areas. Put another way, it is Netzarim repeated 40 times. When autonomy is implemented, approaches to each of these settlements, for example Psagot, will become a military operation. [passage omitted] [Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur] I believe we will want to set up coherent blocs of as many settlements as possible. We will have to find solutions for isolated settlements. I already know this will not be easy. Travel to them is very unpleasant, they pass through or nearby Arab villages. Topographically, it is very easy to set up ambushes there. [Rosen] Not for attribution, we were told that the General Staff, the government, and the prime minister believe that the future of these settlements, or at least these, will be decided on in the near future, long before the permanent arrangement is discussed.
