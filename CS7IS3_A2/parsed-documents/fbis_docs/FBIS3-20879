What is known, however, is that the subsequent candidacy is being considered. Among those who may have a chance to be finance minister is Leslaw Paga, chairman of the Securities Commission. Several other names have been mentioned to date, as well, among them: Henryk Chmielak, lreneusz Sekula, and Wladyslaw Baka. Leslaw Paga got on the list of potential ministers right after the decision of Adam Tanski, the current chief of the State Treasury's Agency for Farm Property and former minister of agriculture, who told RZECZPOSPOLITA that he was forced to refuse the proposition of taking over the Finance Ministry for "purely personal, family reasons." SLD (Democratic Left Alliance) leader Aleksander Kwasniewski claims that one should not expect a fast decision on a nomination. Final decisions will come only after the budget is passed by the Sejm. Leslaw Paga holds a Ph.D. in economics. He began his professional career as an assistant at the Maria Sklodowska Curie University in Lublin. He was chief of the Center for Social Research at the Lublin regional Solidarity office. From 1989 to 1991, he served as adviser to the minister of finance. Later, he was in charge of the Securities Commission at the Ministry of Ownership Transformations [aka Privatization]. After the commission became independent of the ministry in 1991, Paga was named its chairman.
