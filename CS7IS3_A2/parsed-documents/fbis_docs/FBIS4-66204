It was a year of further liberation of minds, seeking truth from facts, seizing opportunities, and accelerating developments. As the economy developed rapidly, attention was paid to strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control and to creatively launch new undertakings. The entire province experienced economic development, accelerating reform, as well as political stability and social progress. This year the growth rate of main economic indices was the fastest since the initiation of reform and opening to the outside world, and continued to be higher than the national average. Total national output value of the province was 68.6 billion yuan, which amounted to an increase, computed at comparable prices, of 15.8 percent over the preceding year. This increase was composed of 4.5 percent in the primary industries, 31.2 percent in the secondary industries, and 12.5 percent in the tertiary industries. The total national output value per capita reached 1,742 yuan, which was a net increase of 307 yuan over the figure in the preceding year. The total industrial and agricultural output for the first time exceeded the 100 billion yuan mark as it reached 122.1 billion yuan, an increase of 27.5 percent over the preceding year, while the total amount of retail sales of social commodities reached 27.9 billion yuan, an increase of 21.2 percent over the preceding year. Fiscal revenue was 6.56 billion yuan, an increase of 30.8 percent. The rate of natural population increase had been controlled to within plan figures. Main norms in the 1993 economic and social development plan for Jiangxi Province, as approved at the First Session of the Eighth Provincial People's Congress, have been essentially fulfilled and in some cases overfulfilled. Agriculture has overcome the effects of various natural calamities and has again achieved an abundant harvest, thanks to the preceding four consecutive years of steady development. Total agricultural output value for the entire province was 33.8 billion yuan, an increase of 5.1 percent over the preceding year. Grain production was 15.17 billion kg, which was 670 million kg above the assigned norm of the state plan, cotton production was 156,000 tons, an increase of 5.1 percent, and fairly large increases were also achieved in the production of edible oils, cured tobacco, fruit, and other products. Animal husbandry and the aquatic products industry experienced continuous development. Total production of meat was 1.575 million tons, an increase of 11.7 percent, while production of aquatic products was 490,000 tons, an increase of 18.6 percent. The rural economy experienced all-round developments, with the total output value of village and township enterprises throughout the province reaching 57.94 billion yuan, an increase of 92.2 percent over the preceding year. New progress was made in the structural adjustment of the rural economy: the proportion of industrial crops in the total agricultural output value was raised by almost 3 percentage points, and the output value of nonagricultural production in the rural areas for the first time exceeded total agricultural output value, as its proportion reached 58.8 percent of rural total social output value, an almost 10 percentage points increase over the preceding year. Industry overcame the difficulties in energy sources, communications, and stringency in capital funds and maintained its speedy growth. Total industrial output value of the entire province was 88.3 billion yuan, 24.7 billion yuan more than in the preceding year, an increase of 38.8 percent. Output value of the secondary industries for the first time exceeded that of the primary industries, its proportion in the national output value showing an increase of 3.4 percentage points. Economic returns improved further. The production-sales ratio for industrial products manufactured at the village and higher than village levels throughout the province reached 96.5 percent, an increase of 2.4 percentage points over the preceding year. Sales income from budgeted industrial enterprises increased 40.7 percent, creating 46 percent more profits and taxes. Large increases were registered in the production of main industrial products, especially in investment-type products and well-selling high-quality products, compared with the preceding year. Village and township industrial production achieved a value of 38.15 billion yuan, an increase of 90.2 percent. The new increases in village and township industrial output value accounted for 73 percent of the newly added industrial output value of the entire province, and has become a major sector of increase in the fast economic growth throughout the province. It was a year of record investments in fixed assets and of the completion of a record number of projects, the investment structure was continuously improved, and key constructions were further strengthened. According to initial statistics, society-wide investments in fixed assets were completed to the amount of 17.85 billion yuan, an increase of 42.2 percent over the preceding year, and of these 12.32 billion yuan were investments by state-owned units, an increase of 49.7 percent, which was a record for the last five years. In the investments of the state-owned units, capital constructions accounted for 6.3 billion yuan and technological transformations for 4.5 billion yuan, increases of 41.6 and 48.2 percent, respectively, over the preceding year. Fixed asset investments further tended to be directed toward infrastructure, key industries, and technological transformations. The proportion of investments in projects of the electric power, transportation, and communication industries, and in agriculture in relation to the total key project investments of all state-owned units was 7.4 percentage points higher than in the preceding year. Investments in key construction projects were substantially strengthened, and the completion of such constructions proceeded smoothly. The whole length of the Jiangxi sector of the Beijing-Jiulong Railway is under construction, and last year a section involving an investment of 1.89 billion yuan was completed. This had comprised completion of one bridge and 18 tunnels on the Ji'an-Ganzhou-Dingnan section, completion of work on the Xiangwu-Jian section, about to be opened to traffic, while double-tracking of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway is being speeded up. There, a length of 89 km on the Jiangxi side has been completed. On the Hengfeng-Nanchang railway, work has started on the Shangrao section and on a railway station at Shangrao. Two sets of 125,000 kilowatt generators of the Pingxiang power plant and four sets of 3,200 kw generators of the Jinggangchong power station have been linked up with the network and are generating electricity. The large bridge at Nanchang and the Nanchang-Jiao section of the Nanchang-Jiujiang expressway have been completed. The Qingyun Waterworks in Nanchang have gone into operation and are supplying water. The new building of the provincial library has also been officially completed last year. Construction of other projects, such as the Xinyu power plant, the Jingdezhen power plant, the Huangjin airfield at Ganzhou, the Luojia airfield at Jindezhen, the Mahuiling airfield at Jiujiang, the large chemical fertilizer project at Jiujiang, the paper factory at Yichun, the epoxy-propane projects at the Jiujiang chemical plant, and the Jiangxi salt mine, are being energetically pursued. The 45 priority technological transformation projects listed in the plan have progressed as required. Among these, 18 projects, among them the long fiber polyester production line at the Jiangxi chemical fiber and chemical engineering plant, the Jiangxi Hongmei architectural ceramics production line, the vaccine production line at the Jiangxi pharmaceutical plant, and the Jiangxi traditional Chinese medicine plant, have all been completed and started production, construction of all the other projects is smoothly progressing. There is brisk buying and selling in urban and rural markets, and the living standard of the people is continuously rising. All through 1993, there was a brisk and flourishing trade in urban and rural markets, and the growth of total retail sales of social commodities accelerated month after month. For the entire province, total retail sales of social commodities achieved the amount of 27.9 billion yuan, an increase of 21.2 percent over the preceding year. Commodity retail prices increased 11.1 percent. Sales in rural markets looked better month after month, retail sales of commodities in counties and their subordinate administrative entities increased 22.5 percent over the preceding year, and were by 1.3 percentage points higher than the growth rate of total social commodity retail sales. Sales of means of production continued brisk, and aggregate sales of the materials system throughout the year amounted to 9.37 billion yuan, an increase of 54.8 percent over the preceding year. Following the economic upswing, incomes of urban and rural residents continued to go up. Average per capita net income of peasants reached 870 yuan, a 102 yuan increase over the preceding year, which amounted to a real, inflation factor discounted, increase of 4.6 percent. The living expenditure income of city and town residents was 1,800 yuan, an increase of 380 yuan, or 26 percent, showing a real, inflation discounted, income increase of around 10 percent, and making this the year of the fastest increase since the initiation of reform and opening to the outside world. The average per capita salary and wages of staff and workers was 2,450 yuan, a 296 yuan, or 13.7 percent, increase. Savings deposits of surplus money by urban and rural residents amounted to 32.165 billion yuan, of which 8.385 billion had been newly added during the year, making this also a record year for new deposits in Jiangxi. The average per capita savings deposit was 811 yuan, an increase of 205 yuan over the preceding year. Exports continued to increase, and efforts were intensified to attract merchants and capital. During the first half of 1993, exports were affected by the adverse situation in the international and domestic markets and declined for a time. However, after May, the provincial government took effective measures which again improved exports month after month. Total provincial exports amounted to $883 million, an increase of 14 percent over the preceding year. Last year the government held trade talks in Hong Kong, Singapore, and other places to attract merchants and capital to Jiangxi, and did so with evident success. During the year, 1,293 new "three-capital" enterprises were approved, and contracts involving $1 billion of capital funds were signed. The amount of foreign capital actually used was $343 million, an increase of 72 percent over the preceding year. In this amount, $135 million were loans from foreign governments or international monetary organizations, while $208 million were direct investments by foreign enterprises. Continued development in various social fields. Smooth progress was made in the application of science and technology to promote agriculture and enterprises, also in priority undertakings and in "torch plan" projects. Throughout the year, a total of 420 achievements were gained in scientific and technological fields. Development of the high-tech production and development zone at Nanchang made good progress. Construction and reforms at the Nanchang University made smooth progress, and the university was granted authority to confer doctoral degrees, which put an end to the long history of Jiangxi being without any institution authorized to grant doctoral degrees. The institutions of higher learning and secondary professional training colleges throughout the province enrolled 46,800 students from higher and middle technical schools, an increase of 8,000 over the preceding year, and newly added several much needed undergraduate and technical college-level schools, also appropriately expanded the admission ratio of officially assigned and self-paying students. Planned parenthood work is continuously strengthened; the natural growth rate of the population throughout the province was 13.33 per thousand. Fresh developments were also registered in all such social affairs as cultural activities, public health, sports, broadcasting, television, information services, and publishing. Delegates, the above-stated circumstances indicate that implementation of last year's economic and social development plan has in general been satisfactory. An excellent foundation was laid for the fulfillment five years ahead of time of the quadrupling of national production output value decided upon by the provincial party committee and the provincial government. This is the result of party committees and governments at all levels throughout the province firmly adhering to the fundamental line of "one central task and two basic points" [economic development plus adherence to the four cardinal principles and implementation of reform and the open policy]. It is also the result of conscientiously implementing all general and specific policies of the CPC Central Committee and of the State Council, and the result of the solidarity, struggle, and common effort of all the people of the province. However, we must also realize that new contradictions and problems exist in our economic processes: First, the very conspicuous contradiction in the capital supply-demand situation; second, the uneven way in which economic profitability has been restored, many state enterprises are still incurring losses; third, the excessively high rate of the commodity price inflation during the second half of the year, which is having a painful effect on the livelihood of the lower-paid part of the population; fourth, the weakness of agriculture in its ability to withstand natural calamities. We shall in the future adopt effective measures and make a conscientious effort to resolve all these contradictions and problems.
