Kozyrev announced that Russia intends to sign the Partnership for Peace initiative, but has not yet determined the appropriate date. "We are interested in a much more serious approach, not in just discussing some framework document. We also have proposals worked out by the Russian Foreign and Defence Ministries, but we are interested in much more serious relations, which would rule out surprises and unilateral measures, especially military ones, in those areas where we should be cooperating most closely", the foreign minister said. "It seems that my last conversations with the American secretary of state and the British foreign secretary, and especially today's talk with French Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe, allow us to hope that both sides will learn their lessons from the recent events", Kozyrev said. "And we really are thinking over a more serious and substantial format for relations with NATO". The Russian foreign minister was speaking on Thursday at a briefing for foreign and Russian journalists on the results of talks with Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who is now in Moscow on an official visit.
