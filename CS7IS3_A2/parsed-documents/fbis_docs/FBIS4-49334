The panel listened to their opinions and suggestions on the current political structure in Hong Kong and on the work of the committee. Xiao Weiyun, head of the Chinese (mainland) side at the panel, told the press after the talks that the panel will make in-depth study of their opinions and suggestions. He noted that the current three-tier political structure in Hong Kong will be terminated and re-organized after July 1, 1997. These are two different matters and there is no way that one tier needs re-organization while two others need not, he said. He said the SAR government and the first SAR Legislative Council will be set up after 1997 according to the Basic Law and relevant regulations of the Chinese National People's Congress so as to ensure a smooth transfer of power and maintain social stability and economic prosperity in Hong Kong. "It is just in line with this spirit that our panel is holding discussions on various kinds of work," Xiao said. Although the Sino-British talks on the political structure have broke down, Xiao said, the Chinese side hopes to continue cooperation with Britain in the fields of economy, culture and education. He stressed that the guarantee for the smooth transition and maintenance of prosperity and stability is the Basic Law and Hong Kong residents' wish for such a transition. Xiao said his panel will strive to implement the spirit of the Basic Law. The two political organizations wished the preliminary committee strengthen communication with Hong Kong residents, Xiao said. "We deem this opinion is right and will hand it over to the committee for discussion," he added.
