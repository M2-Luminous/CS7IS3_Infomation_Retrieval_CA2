The three-judge panel said it could not find reason to necessitate the cancellation of the permission by the minister of international trade and industry. The court acted on the suit filed in 1979 by a group of 282 residents who questioned the safety of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant, which was built by Tokyo Electric Power Co. The plaintiffs demanded the annulment of the permission, citing a geologists' report that they had discovered an enlarging fracture of the surface of the land that consists of layers of sandstone and mudstone. The crustal fracture is known among geologists as the terao fault. While the court case dragged on over 15 years, Tokyo Electric Power completed the installation of five nuclear reactors in the complex. Four of the five are now in operation and construction of two more reactors is under way. If the additional two are completed, the complex would rank among the world's largest nuclear power plants by having an aggregate power-generating capability of 8,210 megawatts. Presiding Judge Yukio Ota said in the ruling, "there is no sufficient evidence that would substantiate a hypothesis that the terao fault resulted from some problems in the geological structure." The ruling went on to say, "there are no serious mistakes in the judgment of the government which concluded that the firmness of the ground supporting the power plant cannot be eroded by a possible movement of the earth's crust." The plaintiffs also argued that the power company has not taken sufficient safety measures to prevent a possible calamity like the 1986 reactor meltdown in Chernobyl, then in the Soviet Union, or the 1979 accident at the Three-Mile Island power plant in the United States. The judge said the government's recognition of the safety of the design of the Kashiwazaki plant cannot be questioned, as the nuclear disasters in Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island stemmed from mistakes in operation management or defective design of the nuclear reactors. The ruling, however, recognized the plaintiffs' assertion that the government's safety standard was too lenient. The safety standard at the time stipulated that the tolerable dosage of exposure of residents to radiation from the nuclear plant was 0.5 roentgen equivalent man (rem) per year. In 1989 the standard was tightened to 0.1 rem. The ruling said, "at present, the court questions the rationale of the tolerable radiation exposure figure of 0.5 rem for the public, which was used by the government in examining the safety of the plant in this case." Yoki Kawada, director general of the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, said, "the ruling that recognized the assertions of the government on this case was appropriate and the government will continue to expedite the development and use of nuclear power plants."
