The search for ways to settle the Karabakh problem, which is one of the important regional problems, is the reason for my visit to Armenia, Bank said. Asked by an ARMENPRES correspondent if a new Iranian-Russian mediation initiative could be expected following his visit that came in the aftermath of the recent visit to Iran and Azerbaijan by Russian Special Ambassador Kazimirov, Morteza Bank said: Naturally, the countries in the region could play a big part in the solution of that problem. Iran and Russia, which are the largest countries in the region, could engage in effective activity both with a separate and a joint initiative. Mr. Kazimirov's visit pursued such an aim. We have agreed to cooperate and positive developments have already taken place. Of course, this does not mean that our activity would not be coordinated with the efforts of the CSCE. I think that there are reasons for optimism that the will to attain peace is gaining ground. In touching upon Armenian-Iranian economic and cultural relations, Bank noted that they are underlined by the principles and traditions of mutual interest, good-neigborliness, and centuries old friendship between the two countries, and these ties should develop normally.
