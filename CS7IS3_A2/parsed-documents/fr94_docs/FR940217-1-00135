FR940217-1-00135 FR940217-1-00016 The Coast Guard received 48 comments in response to the notice of petition for rulemaking. Forty-three responses, mostly from mooring masters and shipping companies, offered strong support for the safety zone expansion. Opposition to the proposal came from CONOCO, MMS, and three oil exploration companies. MMS suggested that if CONOCO or other lessees are denied access to potential oil and gas resources, restitution should be provided by either LOOP or the Coast Guard. Neither the Coast Guard nor the DOT is prepared to provide restitution to CONOCO for loss of potential revenues or costs already incurred in conjunction with oil or gas exploration. To resolve the conflicting use problems in the excursion zones, LOOP has agreed to purchase from CONOCO the oil and gas leases for Grand Isle Blocks 53, 58, 59, and 65. LOOP would then relinquish these blocks to MMS. LOOP would not seek further expansion of the safety zone or oppose any exploration and production activity outside or adjacent to the expanded safety zone. On November 2, 1993, in a letter to the Department of Transportation, the MMS stated that it supports the agreement between CONOCO and LOOP. MMS stated that it is prepared to prohibit surface occupancy of offshore oil and gas facilities in the proposed safety zone. However, MMS stated that it may be economically and technically feasible to develop the resources lying beneath the safety zone by directional drilling. MMS would not preclude subseabed access provided that any surface facilities are located outside the safety zone. Such subseabed activity within the safety zone would not interfere with vessel activity in the safety zone. Under the Deepwater Port Act of 1974, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1509(d)(1)), the Secretary of Transportation is required to consult with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Commerce prior to issuing the safety zone around any deepwater port for the purposes of navigational safety. The Coast Guard has informed the noted Departments of the proposed safety zone. Discussion of Proposed Amendment Appendix A, Annex A, section (a) of 33 CFR part 150 is amended to expand the boundaries of the deepwater port safety zone at LOOP. This is being done at the request of LOOP, Inc. to enlarge the approach to the terminal portion and provide more maneuvering area for tank vessels arriving or departing from the deepwater port. It does not amend the Areas to be Avoided or the Anchorage Area listed in sections (b) and (c), respectively, in Annex A to Appendix A of 33 CFR part 150. Regulatory Assessment This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(F)(1) of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735; October 4, 1993) and it does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It is not a significant regulation under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic consequences of this rulemaking to be minimal. Potential economic effects include impacts on mineral extraction and the commercial fishing industry. The proposed expansion is relatively insignificant, comprising an approximate 15 percent increase in the size of the safety zone. When the original safety zone was established, it was not expected that there would be significant interference with mineral extraction or navigation. Due to the relative size of the expansion, no impacts on mineral extraction or navigation are expected in this case either. Access is available via alternative methods such as directional drilling. The economic consequences of the proposed rulemaking are expected to primarily impact commercial vessels, including commercial fishing vessels. Commercial fishing vessels are permitted restricted use of portions of the safety zone as provided in 33 CFR Table 150.345(a). Therefore, the impact on fishing activities would be negligible due to the small additional area involved. No opposition to the notice of petition for rulemaking was received from the commercial fishing industry. In addition, this proposed rulemaking will result in permanent safety benefits. Providing additional maneuvering area minimizes the likelihood of a catastrophic pollution incident resulting from a vessel colliding with any portion of the LOOP facility. Therefore, it is expected that expansion of the safety zone will reduce the environmental hazard.
