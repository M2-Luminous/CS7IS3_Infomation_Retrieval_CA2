[Beilin] It is true, such a request was presented. There had been a tendency, even a decision to send the preliminary group on 3 April, but they asked to put it off to 10 April. We do not know yet whether their demand reflects a desire to change the parameters of our participation. We will only know it when the preliminary delegation arrives there. If it transpires that they want to change the parameters -- namely, to limit our participation or deny media attendance, we will insist that the Oman encounter be identical to the other multilateral forums in every sense. We are definitely not going to agree to any change of the talks' parameters. [passage omitted]
