FR940203-2-00097 FR940203-2-00058 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;33533; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;5] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Relating to Application Fees for New Members January 27, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on January 21, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD has designated this proposal as one establishing or changing a fee under section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, which renders the rule effective upon the Commission's receipt of this filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The NASD is proposing a rule change to Schedule A to the By-Laws to amend the amount of new application fees assessed against firms other than self-clearing or introduction firms, from $1,500 to $3,000. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and the basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change Article VI of the By-Laws of the NASD requires new members to pay an application fee based on reasonable expenses incurred in carrying out the work of processing new membership applications. Pursuant to Schedule A, Section 2 to the By-Laws, the NASD currently assesses a new application fee of $5,000 for self-clearing firms, $3,000 for introducing firms and $1,500 for all firms other than self-clearing or introducing firms (``other'' firms). 1 The average cost of processing new applications for other firms exceeds the revenue generated by the fee for such applications. Currently, the NASD subsidizes the revenue shortfall for other firms from other fees and assessments. 1 NASD Manual, Schedule A to the By-Laws, Sec. 2, (CCH) Â¶ 1753. Because there is no reasonable justification for subsidizing the initial entry of other firms into the industry, the NASD is proposing to amend the application fee assessed against other firms to reflect more closely the actual costs incurred in processing such applications. The average cost for processing new applications for other firms is approximately the same as that for introducing firms. Therefore, the NASD is proposing to amend the amount of the new application fee assessed against other firms in Schedule A, Section 2(i)(iii), which is currently $1,500, to $3,000. The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Act, 2 which require that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among members in that the proposed rule change equitably adjusts the initial application fee so that all new members are assessed their approximate entry costs. 2 15 U.S.C. 78 o &hyph;3 (1988). (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others Written comments were neither solicited nor received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change has become effective upon filing pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and Rule 19b&hyph;4 promulgated thereunder in that it constitutes a due, fee, or other charge. At any time within 60 days of the filing of a rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate the rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(C) of the Act if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NASD.
