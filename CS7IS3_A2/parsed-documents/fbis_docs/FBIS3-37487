The defense ministers signed a joint communique. Four joint working groups were formed, Kannik said. They will be dealing with communications, control of airspace and borders, weapon standardization, and preparations for the joint peacekeeping battalion. According to Kannik, the key aim in setting up a working group for weapon standardization is to discuss matters first with the other two Baltic countries -- should one of the Baltic states want to purchase weapons in the future -- or decide what kind of ammunition to use. It was agreed that the working groups must have a first meeting before 15 March and draft their basic positions before 15 May. At the beginning of (?April), a meeting of Nordic and Baltic defense ministers will take place in [word indistinct], the defense minister said. The Baltic defense ministers acknowledge in their joint communique the need to train and exchange military attaches between the three countries. Kannik said that an Estonian proposal for participation in the Partnership For Peace program is being coordinated by the Foreign Ministry. During the course of March it should become clear what shape the proposal will take. According to Kannik, this will depend on political and financial constraints. He thinks that so far, the biggest interest in the formation of a Baltic peacekeeping battalion has been displayed by the Nordic countries and Britain. They have also offered help. [passage omitted]
