One of the things he did not like was that instead of the planned signing of papers on the creation of an inter-state economics committee to coordinate economic development in the CIS states, an "amorphous" body was set up at the Coordinative-Consultative Committee -- an economic integration commission with purely consultative functions. Kebich argues that without an inter-state economic committee the CIS Economic Union will never work. He told Interfax that a number of Commonwealth states had wished to follow the example of Russia and Belarus and join the ruble zone. According to him, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and possibly Armenia are virtually ready for that. In his opinion, other Commonwealth countries would like to join but are put off by the need to follow the Belarus example of "harmonizing their legislations with Russian laws." Belarus has taken two years for that, he added.
