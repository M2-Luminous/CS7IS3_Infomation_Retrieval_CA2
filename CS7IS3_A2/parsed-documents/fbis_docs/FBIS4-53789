FBIS4-53789 "dreas098_d_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-098 Daily Report 19 May 1994 South Korea Trade Agency Files Complaint Against Goodyear Trade Agency Files Complaint Against Goodyear SK1905080094 Seoul YONHAP in English 0732 GMT 19 May 94 SK1905080094 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- The Fair Trade Commission is investigating a Korean sales agency's complaint of unfair business practices against the U.S.-based multinational rubber and tire firm, Goodyear. The government agency under the Economic Planning Board, whose ruling carries binding force, will announce a decision by the end of this month. Pusan-based Daeyang Corp. filed a complaint against Goodyear Korea last February, charging the American company with ceasing to supply goods after the former refused to pay a large honorarium and unilaterally breaking off their contract. According to Daeyang's statement, Goodyear Korea demanded 50 million won for letting the provincial company open sales outlets in Pusan and South Kyongsan Province. When it refused, Goodyear stopped supplying products and terminated its contract with Daeyang. Goodyear Korea flatly denied Daeyang's charges, saying the demand for an honorarium concerned just one of its salesmen who has already been sacked over the matter. It explained that Daeyang had failed to submit orders and present a business blueprint, a requirement under the contract, as reasons for breaking ties. The rights and wrongs will be determined by the Fair Trade Commission later in the month, but industry observers say the case sends a warning to Korean businesses vying to sell foreign brands.
