And he hinted that he would be prepared to postpone a decision if it avoided putting a candidate unacceptable to Britain into the Brussels driving seat. "I think it is important to get the right result -- whether that will be here or not I am not sure. Everyone would hope so," said the Prime Minister, after flying in for dinner with the other EU [European Union] leaders, Russian president Boris Yeltsin and the government leaders of Austria, Norway, Finland and Sweden, whose countries are due to join the Union next year. Mr. Major gave little away about the hand he will play at the negotiating table in Corfu tomorrow night. That is when the real argument begins over the choice of the new Commission president. Mr. Major was asked what was so wrong with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, whose candidacy has upset Tory Euro sceptics. "I think we had better wait and see what happens in the discussion. I have nothing to say about that until we have had it." The Prime Minister may even veto Mr. Dehaene's chances in what must be a unanimous decision by the 12 leaders. If he did so, he would be embroiled in a major row with France and Germany who have championed the Belgian's cause. His chief rival for the job, Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, has refused to withdraw despite the fact that Mr. Dehaene already has the support of about half a dozen member states.
