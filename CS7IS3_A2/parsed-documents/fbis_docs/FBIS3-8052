[Kunsch] [passage omitted] Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu commented on the signing of agreements: [Vacaroiu in Romanian fading into Slovak report read by Kunsch] We have continued in Bratislava today what we started during Prime Minister's Meciar's visit in Bucharest last year. It is especially good that we are discussing all problems openly and sincerely, but, at the same time, we very strictly oversee that all of what we have agreed to becomes reality. Today, more than seven months since Prime Minister's Meciar's visit to Bucharest, we can say that we have made progress in all aspects. However, the most important fact is that we have almost completed the legislative framework needed to get bilateral relations between traders on a higher level. We envisage that several meetings will be held at both governmental and parliamentary levels this year. Slovakia is the second country with which Romania signed a memorandum on trade liberalization. [Kunsch] So much for the Romanian prime minister's comment on the signed agreements. Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar also talked about this important event. He said Romania and Slovakia had completed the part of contractual obligations that were necessary for trade cooperation of a simple type. Talks on the transition to free trade have started already today, and the drafting of agreements will begin shortly. It is a matter for the teams of experts and a question of how soon they will prepare the conditions. The political will is to have this as soon as possible. The Romanian prime minister was also received by Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of parliament, and Slovak President Michal Kovac. Nicolae Vacaroiu left Bratislava shortly before "Radiozurnal" [this news bulletin] went on the air.
