Last week the Decree of the Council of Ministers On Measures To Resolve Commercial Disputes Arising in Conjunction With the Export of Russian Goods was signed, which gave the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations the right to establish quotas and introduce licensing for the export of goods in regard to which the threat of the introduction of antidumping or other restrictive measures exists. Therefore, on the eve of Boris Yeltsin's visit to Brussels, Russia demonstrated its readiness to comply with the European Union rules of the game and the GATT antidumping code. However, in the opinion of the Russian side, this readiness will not solve all problems of the world market related to so-called "sensitive commodities" (a term of the European Communities Commission), of which aluminum is one. The way out of the existing situation is elsewhere--while continuing negotiations with the European Union, to attempt to come to an agreement on measures to regulate the market directly with the producers and exporters of aluminum. Russia outlined its position at a meeting of representatives of the Governments of Australia, Canada, Norway, Russia, the United States, and the European Community held on 1-2 December of this year. Russia in Search of Leeway In addition to official personalities, representatives of the industries of these countries, jointly with the International Primary Aluminum Institute (IPAI), took part in the first stage of proceedings of the multilateral meeting. Those attending the meeting thought that the simultaneous participation of officials and producers was caused by a unique concurrence of events on the world aluminum market. Against the background of an overall recession in the world economy, a massive discharge of aluminum on the world market occurred in the early 1990's, and prices for the metal declined to the level of eight years ago. Now, overproduction (including reserves) of primary aluminum in the world comes to 1.5 to 2 million tonnes annually. Although the conference was not crowned with the signing of any agreement, the participants in it laid down their common position and submitted this document to their governments: Everybody is responsible for the overproduction, and, accordingly, cutbacks in production should also be made by quite a number of countries. The representatives of Russia did not manage to obtain what they were counting on--the lifting of sanctions. However, there is still hope: The final document includes a thesis on the need to facilitate the transformation of the aluminum industry of Russia and CIS countries into a sector with full market orientation, as well as continuation of access to Western markets for considerable volumes of aluminum from CIS countries. The Alyuminiy Concern: European Communities Commission Sanctions Are Bad Medicine KOMMERSANT approached Igor Prokopov, president of the Alyuminiy Joint-Stock Company, with a request to comment on current events; he had participated in the conference in Washington, representing the interests of Russian producers and exporters. In his words, the position of the Russian side is based on real facts. They are as follows. In the last 10 years aluminum production in the world has increased by 4.3 million tonnes. During the same period, Russia increased its output by only 200,000 tonnes. The difficult situation on the world aluminum market has been caused not only by the concentrated unloading of aluminum by CIS countries but also by the virtually unhindered penetration of inexpensive aluminum from Brazil, Venezuela, Australia, and Canada which has become possible in view of the active participation of a number of European and Japanese companies in investing in aluminum plants in these countries. This was precisely where the bulk of the increment in aluminum production occurred (see tables 1-3). Mr. Prokopov said: "We categorically disagree with protectionist attempts to solve the problem of the world aluminum market solely at the expense of Russia, as the European Communities Commission is trying to do. First, responsibility for the poor market should be shared by all who had something to do with its condition, including West European companies. Second, this decision in itself is erroneous, unpromising, and harmful primarily for metal producers. The decision has not brought about an increase in prices, nor will it: This decision, like poor medicine, neglects the sickness of the aluminum market even more. Prices are continuing to decline, export streams are changing: All of us are wasting additional funds for transportation and other services. Third, it is impossible in principle to solve the common problem solely at the expense of Russia because in this case the operation of its aluminum industry should be shut down virtually in its entirety. For our part, we are ready for constructive work: Aluminum-producing capacity in the amount of 600,000 tonnes has already been shut down in the CIS this year, of which a volume of 300,000 tonnes is in Russia. We are prepared to consider opportunities for further restriction of production by an acceptable margin on the condition that all the major producers do the same. As far as Russian exports are concerned, as a chart shows, the volume of direct exports will come to 0.5-0.6 million tonnes out of a total production volume of 1.6-1.7 million tonnes. The rest will be delivered toward so-called tolling operations. Tolling, which amounts to processing the raw materials of the customer, makes it possible for Russian enterprises on one hand to utilize the available capacity, while on the other, to obtain the necessary working capital, because it is carried out on prepaid terms. Under the existing rules for world trade, sanctions for the growth of the volume of exports which has brought about falling prices are instituted against the producer country anyway, even if a foreign company acts as the customer. However, Mr. Prokopov believes this to be debatable: Since it is the property of the customer, the product of raw material processing is subsequently returned to him, and for this reason should not be considered part of Russian exports at all, as Mr. Prokopov sees it. In the words of the president of the Alyuminiy Concern, Russia likewise cannot accept the accusations concerning the existence of some preferential conditions created for the aluminum industry in order to artificially make it competitive. The Russian aluminum industry has been integrated with the world to a considerable degree: More than 60 percent of alumina and a large amount of carbon raw materials are purchased on the free market (in 1993 about $1 billion will be spent for these purposes); in the process, outlays on the transportation of raw materials are quite high. The second factor of price reductions--cheap labor--virtually does not influence the cost of the metal because its cost accounts for only 5-8 percent of total production outlays. Finally, the president of the concern considers the main accusations (the artificial understatement of prices for metal due to lower electricity rates) to be likewise groundless. In his words, electricity rates for metal producers in the Urals and Central Russia are equal to those in Europe. On average Siberians pay more for electricity than Canadian producers (in that country, special coefficients for rate reductions on electricity for the aluminum industry exist), although less than in Europe and the United States. The latter is due to the fact that 80 percent of the aluminum in Russia is now manufactured using electricity from large hydropower stations, which is inexpensive in terms of self-cost. In the words of Mr. Prokopov, the state does not provide any financial support for aluminum enterprises and does not regulate or control their operations in ways other than the standard--taxes, quotas, and the issuance of licenses. Domestic Consumption as a Way To Solve External Problems Specialists attribute the actual augmentation of the export of aluminum of Russian provenance, which is indeed causing stress on the world market, primarily to reductions in the domestic consumption of metal in Russia. Even in better times for the economy such consumption was not in line with the level of development of the aluminum industry. On top of this, recently it has been falling steadily: The main consumer of aluminum, the military-industrial complex, is facing a crisis. If the downward trend in domestic consumption were successfully reversed, many export problems would take care of themselves. Igor Prokopov directly ties the growth of domestic aluminum consumption to the volume of foreign investment which may be channeled to this industry. He notes that the aluminum industry is virtually the only sector that is already prepared to absorb such investment: "We are the only ones to not simply avoid falling apart in these years of perestroykas and periods of transitions but to maintain production at a stable level." Speaking in Washington, the president of the concern noted that if funds were available, some of the capacity in the industry would be shut down for upgrading; thus, the volume of output would unavoidably decline. Investment could be marshalled to establish new metal-consuming production facilities, which would also facilitate reductions in the volume of exports. According to available calculations, the establishment of container, packaging, and construction elements production could boost domestic consumption by 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes a year. This approach was received with understanding at the conference in Washington, where it was ultimately agreed that the overall strategy at this stage should also include reconstruction of the Russian aluminum industry and incentives for domestic demand for aluminum products in Russia, in addition to regulation of production volumes (by all) and access to market information. If Only We Could Endure a Year and Hang on for Two In Mr. Prokopov's opinion, resolving to substantially restrict the world output of aluminum for the year or two to come is a mandatory condition for a real improvement in the situation on the aluminum market. Such a decision may only be made within the framework of a multilateral agreement with the participation of all the main countries producing this metal. He stated: "At any rate, we will vigorously defend our place in the market as one of the largest producers of aluminum. At the same time, with the consent of the government, we are prepared to embark on developing measures aimed at the temporary self-restriction of aluminum production." In the process, the need for coordination will persist in the future, when the issue of recommissioning the laid-off capacity arises after the accumulated commodity surplus has been absorbed. However, the market itself will then be able to act as the principal regulator of production; producers of metal whose costs are the highest will still have to restrict their output. For now, the main hopes are attached to the final round of the multilateral conference on aluminum which will be held on 18-19 January 1994 in Brussels.
