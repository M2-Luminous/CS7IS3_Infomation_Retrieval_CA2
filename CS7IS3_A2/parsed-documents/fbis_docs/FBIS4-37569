But two points are still under discussion: - Determining the the legal and political status of the new formation, whether it is "a unionist extension" of the party, whose leadership is in southern governorates (Aden and Hadhramaut) at present, or whether it is a new organization completely separate from the Socialist Party with its known shape and formations. - Whether the new formation is going to rise structurally and organizationally from central committee level to political bureau level. This is in addition to the issue of selecting an alternative leadership to the leadership present in the south, whom Sanaa accuses of "secessionism and rebellion." There is a heated debate among the party's members in Sanaa over their position toward 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the secretary general, and other leaders in general. Some middle-ranking cadres of northern origin are urging the speedy selection of an alternative leadership in a clear expression of the desire to seize the favorable opportunity to achieve personal ambitions. Meanwhile, high-ranking leaders of southern origin who happened to be in Sanaa when the war broke out are calling for patience. It seems that a decision in this connection will be delayed for some time pending the outcome of the ongoing fighting between northern and southern forces, the attempts to secure a cease-fire, and the resumption of the dialogue between the two warring parties (the General People's Congress and Yemeni Reform Grouping, on one hand, and the Yemeni Socialist Party, on the other) The situation will be determined in the light of an agreement on a new shape for unity. Then the new formation would become part of the process of rebuilding the party or a perpetuation of the secession between the north and the south, hence a separate party raising the banner of reachieving unity, thus becoming a tool in Sanaa's hand to shake the southern regime in the future. This raises an important question about the position of numerous high-ranking leaders of southern origin who are in Sanaa at present and whether their current convictions "stem from the state of emergency" and could change when conditions change.
