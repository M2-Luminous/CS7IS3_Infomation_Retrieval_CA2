Commenting on the statement issued by the spokesman of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the Chinese State Council Tuesday [25 January] this week on the Hong Kong new airport issue, sit Fung Shen, member of the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) and a professor of the Hong Kong University, said the Chinese side has shown the utmost tolerance toward the British side on this subject. The British and Hong Kong authorities time and again asked the Finance Committee of the Legislative Council to approve additional funds for individual airport projects before an overall financial plan on the airport construction was reached between the Chinese and British Governments, he said. Echoed Sit's voice, another PAA member Shiu Sin-por said that now it's not a question of appropriation of funds for individual projects, but lacks an overall financial plan. The Hong Kong Government failed to put forward a new plan since the third financial plan was turned down by the Chinese side. The delay of raising a new plan made it difficult to re-open another round of Sino-British talks on the airport issue, he said. Legislator Tam Yiu-chung said, the Chinese side and future Special Administrative Region (SAR) of Hong Kong should not honor the contracts approved by the Hong Kong Government under the circumstance of no overall financial plan. Fong Wong Dut-man, head of the Economic Group of the Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the SAR, urged the Hong Kong Government to explain why the loans borrowed or lend by the PAA did not belong to the government loans as declared by the Hong Kong Government a few days ago, since the PAA is an organ entirely funded by the government. In view of the funds recently sought by the PAA for works on government airport key projects, Fong said, the debt borrowed by the PAA and to be left over to the future government of SAR has exceeded 5 billion H.K. dollars (641 million U.S. dollars). This runs counter to the stipulation provided in the memorandum of understanding, she added.
