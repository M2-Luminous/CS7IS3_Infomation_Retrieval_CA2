[passage omitted] We interviewed Gyula Horn, the party's candidate for prime minister. [Horn] The important thing for me is that the MSZP is primarily the party of those living off their labor. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] If we look at the 209 deputies who got into parliament under MSZP colors, almost 90 percent of them are former members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party [MSZMP]. [Horn] This is the first time I have heard the figures in this light. To the best of my knowledge about half of the 209 newly elected deputies were members of the MSZMP, although I would not swear to it. [passage omitted] How can you draw a parallel between this party and the old nomenclature, when the vast majority of our deputies are in the 30- to 40-year-old age group? Even if they wanted to, they could not have filled any leading positions in the MSZMP. This kind of issue is not worth bothering about. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] What will happen if there is no coalition? [Horn] It is not an impossibility. The MSZP received support from 54 percent of Hungarian society, so it is obvious we will use it. [passage omitted] What is not clear is the new government's freedom of action. We do not know about the obligations made by the previous government. Prime Minister Peter Boross told me at our latest consultation that financial obligations pledged by the government regarding various transactions amount to some 200 billion forints. I suppose he was informed thus by the Finance Ministry. However, according to my information, very tough obligations amounting to several hundreds of billions forints will put pressure on the new government. And what can it do? It has to take on the obligations previously undertaken by the government. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] At one of the lastest rallies you said that the PESTI HIRLAP and UJ MAGYARORSZAG, which at the moment can still be considered as government papers, will be closed down. A report said this morning that the PESTI HIRLAP will not appear next Monday and the editor in chief of the paper was dismissed during the week. What is your view on this? [Horn] I find it very strange that while almost all of the written press has been privatized, a few papers enjoy support to the tune of several tens of millions forints so that they can follow a certain political line. No one can accuse PESTI HIRLAP or UJ MAGYARORSZAG of criticizing the outgoing government and praising the opposition. They worked along a rather one-sided political line. [Correspondent] Will there be an opposition paper? [Horn] [passage omitted] To my mind, real journalism can only take the form of opposition. I do not know of any serious, quality government-party journalism existing in the world, excerpt perhaps in dictatorships.
