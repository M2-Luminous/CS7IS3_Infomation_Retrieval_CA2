The letter mentions a statement by Stipe Mesic, the speaker of the Croatian Assembly, about the killing of the Serb Zec family (Mihajlo, Mirjana, and their 12-year-old daughter, Aleksandra) in Zagreb in 1991. In his statement, which was published in the FERAL TRIBUNE weekly in Split, the letter goes on to say, Mesic said that members of the Internal Affairs Ministry of the Republic of Croatia were suspected of having killed the Zec family, but were acquitted at a secret trial in Zagreb. This statement by Mesic is a confirmation of the terror by the Croatian state over the Serb population between 1991 and 1994, the letter stresses, calling on the consular and diplomatic missions in Belgrade to propose to their governments that his issue be raised in the UN bodies. The letter says that over 300,000 Serbs were evicted from Croatia, which is the largest-scale and the first ethnic cleansing carried out in the former Yugoslavia. The letter also notes that approximately 14,000 Serbs, including complete families, were killed by the Internal Affairs Ministry of the Republic of Croatia. The UN Security Council Commission for War Crimes, the letter goes on to say, was informed about 87 mass graves in Croatia, where the 14,000 innocent members of the Serb nation are buried. "Unfortunately, the Security Council has decided that this commission should cease work on 30 April 1994 (allegedly because of a lack of money), even though nothing has been done about the exhumation of these 87 graves, the identification of victims, and the handing over of the perpetrators to the International War Crimes Court," the letter says, making the appeal: "Please do everything to prevent these crimes in Croatia from being hushed up."
