FR941005-0-00013 FR941005-0-00006 40 CFR Part 51 [FRL&hyph;5082&hyph;2] Air Quality: Revision to Definition of Volatile Organic Compounds_Exclusion of Volatile Methyl Siloxanes and Parachlorobenzotrifluoride AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action revises EPA's definition of volatile organic compounds (VOC) for purposes of preparing State implementation plans (SIP's) to attain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone under title I of the Clean Air Act (Act) and for the Federal implementation plan (FIP) for the Chicago ozone nonattainment area. This revision adds parachlorobenzotrifluoride (PCBTF) and volatile methyl siloxanes (VMS) to the list of compounds excluded from the definition of VOC on the basis that these compounds have negligible contribution to tropospheric ozone formation. EFFECTIVE DATES: This final action will be effective on December 5, 1994 unless notice is received by November 4, 1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments or request a public hearing. If the effective date is delayed for this action due to the need to provide for public comment, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in duplicate (if possible) to: Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center (6102), Attention: Docket No. A&hyph;93&hyph;47, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460. Comments should be strictly limited to the subject matter of this rule, the scope of which is discussed below. Public Hearing: If anyone contacts EPA requesting a public hearing, it will be held at Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. Persons wishing to request a public hearing, wanting to attend the hearing or wishing to present oral testimony should notify Mr. William Johnson, Air Quality Management Division (MD&hyph;15), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, telephone (919) 541&hyph;5245. The EPA will publish notice of a hearing, if a hearing is requested, in the Federal Register . Any hearing will be strictly limited to the subject matter of the rule, the scope of which is discussed below. This action is subject to the procedural requirements of section 307(d)(1)(B), (J), and (U) of the Act, and 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(1)(B), (J), and (U). Therefore, EPA has established a public docket for this action, A&hyph;93&hyph;47, which is available for public inspection and copying between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, at EPA's Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, Room M&hyph;1500, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460. A reasonable fee may be charged for copying. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Johnson, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Air Quality Management Division (MD&hyph;15), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, phone (919) 541&hyph;5245. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On September 28, 1992, the Occidental Chemical Corporation (also known as OxyChem) petitioned EPA to take all necessary and appropriate action to exclude parachlorobenzotrifluoride (also known as 4-chlorobenzotrifluoride, PCBTF, C 7 H 4 F 3 Cl (CAS number 98&hyph;56&hyph;6)) from regulation as a precursor to tropospheric ozone. In support of their petition, Occidental Chemical Company submitted two reports: ``Loss Processes for 4&hyph;Chlorobenzotrifluoride Under Atmospheric Conditions,'' by Roger Atkinson, Sara M. Aschmann, Arthur M. Winer and James N. Pitts, Jr., University of California at Riverside, October 1984; and ``Tropospheric Lifetime Estimates for Several Aromatic Compounds,'' by David Nelson and Robert Brown, Aerodyne Research, Inc., May 1992. In addition, Occidental Chemical Company submitted a copy of an October 18, 1985 Federal Register notice (50 FR 42216) which announced a decision by EPA not to require further testing of parachlorobenzotrifluoride for health effects, environmental effects, and chemical fate under the Toxic Substances Control Act. On December 11, 1992, Dow Corning Corporation petitioned EPA to take several actions that would have the effect of exempting VMS under the Act as precursors to tropospheric ozone. The VMS are organic compounds whose basic molecular structure is built on a backbone of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms, formed into either a ring or linear chain containing from two to seven silicon atoms. Methyl groups (and no other functional groups, as defined here) are attached to this central backbone, their numbers varying with the size and shape of the molecule. Compounds covered by the designation VMS in this proposal are cyclic, branched, or linear, completely methylated siloxanes, including the compounds listed in Table 1. Symbols shown in the table, such as MM and D 4 , are commonly accepted abbreviations for the longer chemical name shown beside each.
