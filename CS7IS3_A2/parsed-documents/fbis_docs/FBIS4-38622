FBIS4-38622 "drsov105_a_94023" FBIS-SOV-94-105 Daily Report 27 May 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Adamishin: India Remains `Strategic Partner' Adamishin: India Remains `Strategic Partner' LD2705181394 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1354 GMT 27 May 94 LD2705181394 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] [Text] The first deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation, who visited India as well, reported that at the request of the Indian party the visit of the Indian Prime Minister Naramsimha Rao earlier scheduled for June 14-15 had been postponed for late June - early July. Interfax interlocutor found it difficult to say what documents would be signed during Rao's visit to Moscow. "We are preparing both political documents and serious agreements on bilateral cooperation. For example, we have a protocol on space cooperation, there are interesting initiatives in the field of military-technical cooperation which, in particular, provide for a joint servicing of the MIG aircraft not only in India but, possibly, in other countries as well. Now it is still now clear what we shall manage to achieve," he noted. Adamishin underlined that "filling up the Russian-Indian cooperation with a real contents, which is based on pragmatism and takes into consideration common positions of the parties (they always dominate) and discrepancies (they also exist, say, on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation)" is the main aim of Rao's visit to Moscow. In Adamishin's words, "the relations within the triangle Pakistan-India-Russia are rather interesting." "India is our strategic partner. This was our strategic choice during the period of confrontation which preserves its significance in the period of cooperation as well. Earlier we could say against whom we are. Now we are on friendly terms. This change opens new opportunities for the Russian-Indian cooperation," he said. Adamishin specially stressed that "having such a reliable partner as India in the Southern Asia and in the global scale, Russia should not loose opportunities which improving of its relations with Pakistan grants." When asked about Russia's position with respect to the dispute between India and Pakistan on Kashmir, Adamishin answered: "We believe that India and Pakistan should solve this problem on a bilateral basis. If they are interested in Russia's mediation let them address us with a joint request. In other words, we support a bilateral method to solve any problems and do not refuse to render our assistance." Adamishin reported that when he was in Islamabad, the Pakistanis said that it would be easier for them to reach an agreement with the Indians under the Russian mediation. "It's natural that I said about this to the Indians but there was no reaction. However, the Indians declared that they approve our dialogue with Pakistan, at least they do not show any jealousy with respect to it," he said. In Adamishin's words, "under the new situation when a more serious confrontation and such crises as, say, the Middle Eastern one, do not block it, the Kashmir conflict acquires a sharper coloring." "Usually somebody else wins thanks to the protracted confrontation between two parties. It is necessary that both Pakistan and India understand this," he underlined.
