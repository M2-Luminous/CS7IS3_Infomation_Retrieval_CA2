The meeting was attended by Danish Ambassador Christian Faber-Rod, Norwegian Ambassador Oyvind Nordsletten, Finnish Ambassador Erik Ulfstedt, and Swedish Ambassador Martin Halquist. The Swedish ambassador presented the Ukrainian legislative speaker with a letter reporting on a 25-26 February meeting of foreign ministers from Scandinavia and Iceland in Stockholm. The ministers discussed a number of issues, including European security. In the communique adopted on the results of the conference, the ministers hailed the tripartite Ukrainian-Russian-U.S. declaration signed on 14 January 1994 and the appendix to the declaration stipulating the dismantling of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal. The ministers pointed out that the implementation of these documents will significantly contribute to strengthening European security and the nonproliferation of nuclear arms. The ambassadors were instructed to inform the Ukrainian legislative chairman about that declaration and the unanimous support for the tripartite accord on the part of the governments of their states and Iceland. The governments also hope that the accord will be implemented soon. It was underlined that Ukraine should sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the immediate future. In his turn, Ivan Plyushch provided an in-depth analysis of Ukraine's current economic and political situation, pointing out: [Begin Plyushch recording] Ukraine has been facing three global problems -- Chernobyl, conversion of the Army and the military-industrial complex, and the structural reshaping of the economy. [end recording] The Supreme Council chairman answered his interlocutors' questions regarding, in particular, dates of practical implementation of the agreements reached with Russia and the United States. Ivan Plyushch emphasized that it is vital for Ukraine that the provisions of the declaration and its appendix be observed by all sides. This would correspond with the spirit of every document adopted in Moscow. [Begin Plyushch recording] For me, the problem is: When will we begin receiving practical compensation? Thus far, we have not received a cent; thus far, these documents are just pieces of paper and simple discussions. [end recording] At the end of the meeting, the Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Swedish ambassadors expressed hope that Ukraine's nonnuclear course will remain unchanged and asserted that their governments are ready to grant Ukraine multifold support.
