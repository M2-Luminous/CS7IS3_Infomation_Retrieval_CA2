FBIS4-6083 "dreas074_a_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Disagreement Over Hosokawa Successor Continues Disagreement Over Hosokawa Successor Continues Coalition Moving To Choose Hata OW1804043894 Tokyo KYODO in English 0429 GMT 18 Apr 94 OW1804043894 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- The ruling coalition was moving Monday [17 April] toward selecting Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as the successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, political sources said. Representatives of the coalition will agree Monday afternoon on a policy platform for the formation of a new government and coalition chiefs are likely to sign the accord the same day, coalition sources said. Veteran politician Michio Watanabe, 70, of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who expressed his intention Sunday to leave the party in a bid for the premiership, hoping to gain the backing of the ruling coalition, will make a final decision on the proposed move Monday, faction sources said. LDP President Yohei Kono Will meet Watanabe again at 1:30 P.M. [0430 GMT] Monday to attempt to dissuade him from leaving the party, LDP sources said. Kono, who has himself vowed to run in the Diet election as his party's official candidate, urged Watanabe on Friday to drop his ambitions for the premiership in order to maintain party unity but met with no success. Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan], the largest party in the seven-party coalition, said Monday he opposes nominating Watanabe as the coalition's candidate for premiership, party officials said. He made the remark at a meeting with Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, the officials said. Murayama also expressed opposition to Watanabe being invited to join the next cabinet in a position such as deputy prime minister, they said. A senior member of the Watanabe faction in the House of Councillors said Watanabe may not quit the party. Watanabe said Sunday, "I have a conviction that a cabinet of national salvation should be formed to overcome the present difficult situation." "I could not become (prime minister) only with LDP support. As I have to ask for the support of many people, I will naturally renounce my party membership," he said. But so far, only some 20 LDP members are expected to quit the party to follow Watanabe if he decides to make the break. Meanwhile, five LDP House of Representatives members who support Watanabe's bid for the premiership quit the party Monday. They are Seiichi Ota, Taku Yamamoto, Shizuo Sato, Koji Kakizawa and Shokei Arai. They are members of a suprafactional study group in the LDP called the "liberals." Another LDP lower house member, Kenji Kosaka, quit the party Monday. He said he will join Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key party in the coalition. Five other LDP lower house members who quit the party Friday, led by Michihiko Kano, former director general of the Management and Coordination Agency, formed a new party Monday called New Party Mirai (Future). Fumihiko Igarashi, a lower house member of Hosokawa's Japan New Party, told reporters he and two other members will quit the party and act as independents. Kano hinted that the new five-legislator party may throw its parliamentary weight behind a prime ministerial candidate who is backed by the ruling coalition. Kano expressed his party's willingness to take part in the ongoing policy-making discussions now under way among the seven coalition parties. The talks, which began last Saturday, are aimed at reconciling coalition members' differences in key areas of policy. "If we and the ruling coalition could reach an agreement to share the same policies, then we could cast our ballots to nominate as the next prime minister a candidate recommended by the coalition side," he said. Kano also called on other LDP legislators to join his new party. "I call on people who once tried to accomplish political reform, together with us, to be courageous and take actions in order to bring about a realignment of the political community," he said. Kano said he "has given high marks to both" Hata and Watanabe as able politicians. He said, "although Mr. Watanabe expressed views different from ours regarding political reform, I commend him for his intention" to break with the LDP. New Party Mirai will advocate as its tenets an emphasis on the wishes of the public, compliance with public promises, contributions to U.N.-led peace-building efforts, expansion of the social infrastructure and transfer of the central government's administrative authority to local governments, party officials said.
