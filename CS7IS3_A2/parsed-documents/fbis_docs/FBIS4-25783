Envoy Optimistic Over Yemen Mission OW1406220394 Beijing XINHUA in English 2119 GMT 14 Jun 94 OW1406220394 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Abu Dhabi, June 14 (XINHUA) -- U.N. Envoy to Yemen Lakhdar Ibrahimi said here today that there has been "positive and encouraging progress" on the Yemen issue. Before leaving the UAE capital for Doha, Qatar, Ibrahimi said there are some progress since both Sanaa and Aden have agreed to resume the former joint military committee and add new members to it. The U.N. envoy was on a visit to Yemen and other Gulf and Arab countries for implementing the U.N. Security Council Resolution 924 for ending the five-week long Yemeni fighting. The U.N. envoy said Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has accepted Aden's suggestion of keeping foreign members and increasing new members in the committee. Ibrahimi said U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali today reappealed to the rival forces in Yemen to abide by the Security [Council] resolution of truce. Commenting on his meeting with leaders of the southern part of Yemen in Mukalla on Monday, Ibrahimi said both Sanaa and Aden had accepted the cease fire suggestion, but it was regrettable that there was no truce, though the intensity of fighting has decreased. Both Sanaa and Aden accepted the idea of dialogue, but both of them had their conditions, he added. Ibrahimi denied the information reported by some news agencies that he planted in Mukalla a suggestion of settling up a Yemen federation or confederation, saying that to discuss the matter is too early. Today, Ibrahimi also met with UAE President Zayed Bin-Sultan Al Nahayyan. The envoy arrived here Monday night and left here today for Qatar. Latest reports reaching here from Doha said Qatari Amir Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani received this evening the U.N. envoy in Doha.
