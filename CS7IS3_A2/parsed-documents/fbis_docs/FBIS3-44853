Clinging obstinately to his course, he promoted the sale of his "constitutional reform package" in the past year or so regardless of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the agreements and understanding reached between China and Britain, as if whoever opposes his "constitutional reform package" opposes democracy. Thus, Chris Patten suddenly transformed himself from a colonial dictator into a fighter for "democracy." Such a practice on the part of Chris Patten is incomprehensible to many people: There has never been a tiny bit of democracy in Hong Kong, which has been under British rule for over 150 years; "royal instructions" are followed in all [government] affairs there; and the Hong Kong governor alone is in control of all the powers. What makes him think of giving democracy to the Hong Kong people just before British colonial rule is about to end? Even Mr. Sharp [name as received], former chairman of the Britain-China Trade Association, also said that he could not understand why Chris Patten was in such a hurry to promote democratization in Hong Kong. China has repeatedly declared that the focal point of our differences with Britain is not a question of whether democracy should be implemented but rather a question of whether one's promise should be kept. Democracy is an important mark of social progress. The Chinese Government has all along been for the implementation of democratic reform in Hong Kong, and it was China that was the first of the two countries to propose the implementation of democracy in Hong Kong and the democratic rights of a "high degree of autonomy" for the Hong Kong people under "one country, two systems" during the Sino-British talks back in 1982. Then, China spent as long as four years and eight months formulating the "Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC" and putting forward the principle of proceeding in an orderly way and step by step for the implementation of democratic reform in Hong Kong. The "democracy" hastily bestowed by Chris Patten as a favor obviously violates the law of development. All matters in the world have their own law of development. Like many matters, the democratic system has a process of coming into being, development, and taking shape. It is not accomplished in one step. The process of the development of the modern democratic system explains this point. The transition from feudal dictatorship to the capitalist democratic system of our time took several hundred years. For example, passing from the bourgeois democratic revolution in 1688 to the establishment of the one-person, one-vote election system in 1948 took Britain nearly 300 years; and the United States took 200 years to go from the formulation of its Constitution and the beginning of the implementation of democratic reforms in 1787 to the exercise of one-person, one-vote rights in general elections by 18- year-old citizens in the 1980's. Very obviously, Hong Kong's democracy cannot be accomplished overnight. Accelerating the democratization process by force in violation of the law of development will inevitably result in drastic social turmoil and chaos, affect social stability, and, furthermore, have an impact on Hong Kong's investment environment. The broad masses of Hong Kong compatriots do not want to see such things happen. On account of the aforementioned consideration, the "Basic Law" states that Hong Kong will have both direct elections and indirect elections in the first 10 years after 1997 and that the transition to general elections will be achieved according to the procedures prescribed by law by the year 2007. The 10-year transitional period, compared with 200 to 300 years in Britain and the United States, is actually very, very short. Therefore, it should be said that the process of democratic reform stipulated by the "Basic Law" not only takes into consideration the aspirations of the people of Hong Kong but also conforms to the law governing the development of democracy itself. In the process of drafting the "Basic Law," China has extensively solicited the opinions of the people of all walks of life and social strata in Hong Kong and has taken into full account their 40 to 50 proposals concerning Hong Kong's political system. When it was promulgated, the "Basic Law" was well received by the Chinese people, including the compatriots in Hong Kong, and by the people of the world. They universally held that the "Basic Law" not only embodies the Hong Kong people's aspirations but also conforms to the interests of economic development in Hong Kong and to the requirements for its stability. Even the British Government has spoken highly of the "Basic Law." In Britain, both the prime minister(s) and ministers have expressed their satisfaction with the "Basic Law" on many occasions, and the British side has repeatedly promised to converge with it. However, at a time when the "Basic Law" needs to be further publicized, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten dished out his "political reform program" in an attempt to "expand democracy" in Hong Kong. This is an openly perfidious act. People cannot but ask: Why does Patten want to go against the objective law and ignore Hong Kong's safety? People who know the history of colonial rule can see the real purpose of the Hong Kong Government: It is vainly attempting to help, through so-called democratic elections, a group of pro-British persons gain power, especially those who dare to challenge the central government, so as to make the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] powerless after 1997. In doing so, Britain can attain its goal of ruling Hong Kong without Britons -- continuing its colonial rule over Hong Kong in another form. When he met with Geoffrey Howe on 31 July 1984, Deng Xiaoping said: "I hope that the Hong Kong Government will not form a leading body of its own during the transitional period and then impose it on the government of the Hong Kong SAR." Today, his prediction with profound insight has been proved accurate. History has shown that before withdrawing from its colonies, Britain would invariably pursue a policy of division and create contradictions and confrontations to facilitate its manipulation and control in an attempt to maintain its political and economic interests in its former colonies. The same shameful tricks of this old-brand imperialist have been employed in many of its colonies in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Not only were they not successful, but they were condemned as shameful tricks by the people of the world. Therefore, what Britain is doing with regard to the Hong Kong issue is obviously a replaying of the same old tricks. The masses of compatriots in Hong Kong are able to see through these tricks. What the Hong Kong Government did more than 20 years ago can help us see through its shameful tricks. In the 1970's, Britain applied two international human rights conventions to Hong Kong, but it omitted the portions on democratic elections so that those would not be practiced in Hong Kong. In displaying the big banner of "democracy" at a time just before its withdrawal, is it not clear now as to what its ulterior motives are? In sharp contrast to this situation, the Chinese side included democracy in the "Basic Law" when there was not an iota of democracy in Hong Kong. Faced with iron-clad facts, a slight change seems to have taken place in the tune of "democracy" sung by Chris Patten. He claimed in a high-sounding manner that his arrangements on direct elections are "open, just, and accepted by the Hong Kong people." This new argument seems beautiful, but is actually pale and weak. It is known to all that during the five years of drafting the "Basic Law," China had carried out a very open and democratic way of discussions on all issues, both primary and secondary ones, especially on the method of selecting the chief executive of the government of the Hong Kong SAR and the forming of the Legislative Council. Members of the drafting committee could say what they wanted to say and could express their views freely. Every article and every annex of the "Basic Law" was passed with a two-thirds majority by all members of the drafting committee in a secret ballot. Members of the drafting committee visited Hong Kong many times to solicit the opinions of the people from all walks of life regarding the method of selecting the chief executive and the method of forming legislative organs. Many revisions were made regarding this question. The processing of drafting the "Basic Law" was highly transparent: A news communique was published after each meeting. In four years, nearly 100 news conferences were held by the Political Group. Therefore, only the method of selecting the chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR and the method of forming the Legislative Council prescribed by the "Basic Law" are open and just. Moreover, the masses of people in Hong Kong are satisfied with them. In contrast, Chris Patten's "political reform program" is not open and democratic. He arrived in Hong Kong in June 1992, and in September he dished out his "political reform program." Except for his premeditations with the British Government in concocting this program, he had no prior consultations with anyone, nor did he solicit the opinions of the people of Hong Kong. It can be said that Chris Patten dished out his "political reform program" without an iota of democracy at all. The essence of democracy is that the people enjoy the rights to their own interests and happiness. The biggest interest of the Hong Kong people is the maintenance of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Only the "Basic Law" can satisfy the wishes and demands of the masses of compatriots in Hong Kong; only the "Basic Law" can bring about true and real democracy in Hong Kong; and only the "Basic Law" can guarantee the most important interest of the Hong Kong people. This has become the consensus of many people. "Democracy" under Chris Patten's signboard is not only very deceptive but also extremely dangerous. Just imagine -- what good does it do the economy of Hong Kong if Chris Patten leaves behind a legislature that divides the Hong Kong people and challenges the future SAR government? What consequences will such a situation bring to investors in Hong Kong? The masses of compatriots in Hong Kong are very patriotic. We are convinced that in the transitional period before 1997, more and more Hong Kong people will see through the real purpose of the British authorities in Hong Kong and work jointly with the people from the motherland to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Hong Kong -- the brilliant pearl of the East -- will certainly be able to return smoothly to the embrace of the motherland!
