Built in 1954, the 2,728-kilometer highway starts from Xining City, capital of Qinghai Province, and runs to Shache [as received] in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The renewal will be jointly undertaken by the departments of communication and transportation in Qinghai and Xinjiang. Lu Junhan, a project engineer, said that it would improve the transportation conditions between Qinghai and Xinjiang and contribute to the opening up of the resources of minerals, oil and asbestos in the Qaidam Basin. According the plan for the project approved by the Ministry of Communications, in the second half of this year, Qinghai will first reconstruct the highway from Ulan County to Delingha in the Mongolian-Tibetan autonomous prefecture of Haixi. The total investment in this 177 kilometer highway section is about 150 million yuan and the project is expected to be completed in 1997.
