Venizelos was referring to press reports which, he said, imply that Greek policy on Skopje and the dialogue is changing. The name is not up for negotiation, the government spokesman said. He noted that Skopje must believe that it is to its benefit to change the name. The name is not subject to negotiation, but becomes an issue of dialogue so that the Greek side can expand on its position.

The government spokesman pointed out that there has been no move from the government's positions and repeated that no country will be recognized with the name Macedonia or its derivatives. He added that the government expects tangible and practical signs from Skopje that would diminish its intransigence and provocation. Replying to other questions, he said Greece agreed to Skopje's application to join the United Nations as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which came up during the New Democracy's term in power. Asked about the level of dialogue with Skopje, Venizelos said it is too early to say anything and added that the process is still pending at the United Nations. It is within that framework that Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias sent a letter. The government spokesman noted that the previous government was characterized by double talk, while this government tells everyone the same things.
