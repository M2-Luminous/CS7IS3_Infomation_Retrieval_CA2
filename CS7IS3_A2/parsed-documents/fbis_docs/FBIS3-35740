Speaking at a press conference in Bishkek on Thursday [27 January], the president emphasized that the arrival of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and the visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin planned for February "would assist with settlement of the issues concerning support of Kyrgyz industrial enterprises which directly depend on economic relations with Russia." "If we break these relations, there is a risk for the Kyrgyz to go back to their traditional nomadic life of cattle breeders," the president pointed out. For the time being, it is impossible to resolve the current economic issues, like supplies of equipment and fuel material and lubricants, without the assistance provided by Russia. This also threatens the future of agriculture. In connection with this, the president emphasized that dual citizenship would conform with the interests in preserving the economic potential of Kyrgyzstan, since this would help to maintain the working potential of plants where most workers were Russians. He refuted the assertion that this might lead to destabilization of inter-ethnic relations. Commenting on the changes in the Russian government, the Kyrgyz president said that the situation should not be exaggerated. "The reforms in Russia will continue since now they are irreversible," Akayev pointed out. In his opinion, Chernomyrdin was the man who could carry out the policy of economic reforms in Russia. Akayev said that if he won the January 30 referendum on confidence in him he would take resolute steps to make the reforms more rapid. "Kyrgyzstan can't afford to waste any time, because it has huge debts which could go on snowballing," he said. He said the referendum, called on his own initiative, had three goals to pursue: first, to confirm the authority of the head of state, who, under the new constitution, must be guarantee of stability and of a balance between the three branches of government; second, to confirm the policy of reform; and, third, to stabilize the political situation in the republic. The president said he would never dissolve parliament, for it had been elected by the people, although under the former regime. "Only the people themselves can determine the future of parliament," he said. Akayev said that, during his trips within Kyrgyzstan, he had come to the conclusion that the population supported the reform policy but was dissatisfied with the form privatization was taking. For this reason, he was going to take measures to set up bodies for combatting corruption and strengthening the republic's economic security, he said. The same day, Akayev addressed the nation on television and radio. He said the main objective of his policy was to reach ethnic conciliation in the republic and that he would "step up his efforts to establish civil peace in Kyrgyzstan." He said that, as head of state, he had been doing his best to mitigate the effects of the economic crisis and the social and political shocks experienced by the republic. "My conscience is clear," he said. He said economic problems that had been taking shape for decades could not be solved within a few months. Today "all citizens of the country, all political parties and movements, both left-wing and right-wing ones, both communists and centrists, stand for market economics, for freedom for the powerful and support for the weak," Akayev said. He said the disagreements were over how rapid the reforms should be and over their social aspect. There was a need for compromise, he said. Akayev said the mechanism to control the economic situation was being put into operation "slowly but surely." He said that, by introducing its own currency, Kyrgyzstan had evaded many economic upheavals. The country had also managed to restore its economic ties with other former Soviet republics, in particular Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the first step towards which was the lifting of customs barriers, the president said. "We are in the process of forming a single economic area with Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan," he said. Akayev said that, if he won the referendum, he would take immediate measures to strengthen discipline, give an impulse to the agrarian reform, solve energy and transport problems, support medium-sized and small businesses, create an atmosphere of social partnership between the government, business and trade unions, and improve the position of the pensioners.
