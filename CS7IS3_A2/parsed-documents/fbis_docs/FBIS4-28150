A report on the first agenda item was delivered by Choe Yong-hae, chairman of the Central Committee of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea. The reporter said the letter of congratulations sent by the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song to the participants in the congress is a bright torch more brightly illumining the road ahead of the Children's Union members advancing toward a hopeful future under the leadership of the party and a great programme of the chuche-inspired children's movement. He reviewed the proud path of struggle covered by the Korean children's movement. He said: Generalissimo Kim Il-song who set out on the road of revolution in his early years formed the Saenal Juvenile Union, the first communistic children's revolutionary organization in Korea, thus giving glorious origin to the Korean children's movement. The great leader closely rallied a great many children under the flag of the anti-Japanese children's corps and brought them up into child revolutionaries during the glorious period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, and in the post-liberation days formed the Korean Children's Union and set forth for the KCU the militant slogan "Let Us Always Study and Prepare Ourselves for a New Democratic Korea!" In the postwar period, he changed the slogan into "Let Us Always Prepare Ourselves To Be the Reserve Force for the Building of Communism!" to meet the new requirements of socialist construction. Now, the Korean communist children's movement and the work of the KCU are further developing unremittingly under the correct guidance of respected General Kim Chong-il. General Kim Chong-il expounded the idea of continuously carrying on the vigorous movement for learning from the glorious childhood and youth of the great leader as the keypoint of the work of the KCU. He has seen to it that all the work of the KCU is aimed at rearing all its members to be reliable heirs to the revolutionary cause of chuche, unfailingly loyal to the leader. It is the greatest achievement in the work of the KCU that it has closely united its members in the same thought and purpose around Generalissimo Kim Il-song and General Kim Chong-il by rearing them to be true sons and daughters of the party who have a good knowledge of their leader and always follow him from their early years. Dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said: "The organizations of the Korean children's union must set it as their most important task to rear all its members to be sons and daughters unfailingly loyal to the leader and unite them closely around the party." The KCU organizations have vigorously carried on the movement for learning from the glorious childhood and youth of Generalissimo Kim Il-song and General Kim Chong-il among the union members and organized in various forms and ways education in the principles of the chuche idea and the revolutionary traditions, class education and education in socialist patriotism and communist morality. The hearts of the members of the KCU are now filled with pure loyalty to trust and follow only Generalissimo Kim Il-song and General Kim Chong-il like sunflowers. Strenuous efforts have been made to prepare the members of the KCU to be future builders of socialism with ample knowledge, high morality and strong body, with the result that there have appeared throughout the country more than 1,800 model classes that won "the July 15 honor prize," more than 2,400 winners of "the 'our classroom' literary prize," talented little artistes and promising sportsmen. Through brisk socio-political activities and do-good-things movement, the members of the KCU have created over 1,127,000 hectares of "the Children's Union forest in recent years." Today the KCU has grown to be a powerful organization of children the 3 million members of which move as one, united closely around respected General Kim Chong-il, and fulfil the tasks set forth by the party in time with strong spirit of organization and discipline.
