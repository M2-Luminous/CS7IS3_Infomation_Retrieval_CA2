Peng Peiyun, state councillor and chairman of the State Council's Committee for Women and Children's Work, asked the committee to carry out two major tasks and concentrate on several major issues to produce greater results in women and children's work. She said: The first major task is to comprehensively implement the "Outline of Development Plans for Chinese Children in the Nineties." This outline constitutes a commitment to China's vast numbers of children and to the international community made by Premier Li Peng on behalf of the Chinese Government. All units should enhance their sense of mission and urgency, spell out the yearly targets on the basis of established overall goals, and institute a system of target management to ensure fulfillment of each goal set forth in the outline. She said: The second major task is to complete the draft of the "Outline of Development Plans for Chinese Women in the Nineties." The outline is intended to regulate, guide, and promote the development of Chinese women, safeguard their rights and interests, raise their standards, and enable them to participate more successfully in promoting equality, development, and peace and play a role worthy of the "other half" in China's modernization. The outline is also designed to help achieve the goals set for in the "Nairobi Strategy" and to greet the opening of the Fourth World Women's Congress in 1995. Peng Peiyun also called for continuous efforts to publicize and implement laws and regulations on children and women, safeguard women's rights and interests in child-bearing and labor, launch targeted struggles against kidnapping and prostitution, and conduct experiments in the "three quality projects" [quality birth, upbringing, and education]. Liu Hairong, director of the general office of the State Council's Committee for Women and Children's Work and vice president of the All-China Women's Federation, gave a report on the committee's work in 1993 and its plan for 1994. Committee members and representatives from various units discussed ways to further promote women and children's work. It was learned that the State Council's Committee for Women and Children's Work made progress in safeguarding women and children's rights and interests and promoting women and children's causes last year. The committee coordinated and organized activities to publicize and implement the law on safeguarding women's rights and interests. After an investigation into implementation of the law in seven provinces, it presented its views and suggestions on existing problems and future work and urged departments concerned to adopt measures for resolving the problems. Today, two-thirds of the governments at the provincial level in China have established agencies for protecting women and children. Last year, together with the Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of Public Security, and based on the experience of the last two years in the struggle against kidnapping and prostitution, the State Council's Committee for Women and Children's Work put forward requirements for carrying out the struggle in the next stage. This has helped deepened the struggle. In addition, the committee also worked actively to implement the "Outline of Development Plans for Chinese Children in the Nineties," made good preparations for enacting the "Outline of Development Plans for Chinese Women in the Nineties," and presented specific proposals on making overall arrangements for society to bear the burden of child-bearing expenses for women workers.
