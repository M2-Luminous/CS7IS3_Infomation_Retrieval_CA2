But we do not have the intention to meet an unjustifiable demand under continued pressure and cannot tolerate our sovereignty encroached upon, declares NODONG SINMUN today. The analyst says: The United States these days is orchestrating an anti-DPRK pressure campaign over the core refueling operation at its experimental atomic power plant, crying for "UN sanctions," "multinational sanctions" and "preemptive strike" at its peaceful nuclear facilities. This indicates that the United States is opting the strong arm, throwing away even the veil of DPRK-U.S. talks. In this connection we declared that our nuclear activities will go over to the next process and we will have no alternative but to expand our independent nuclear power industry by the present method and that, in case the United States says the foundation of its talks with the DPRK has been destroyed, the foundation of the temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the [Nuclear] Non-Proliferation Treaty will also collapse. When things take this course, neither the United States nor the International Atomic Energy Agency can blame us. Because such situation has been caused by them. The United States is not interested in the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula but seeks only to stifle our socialist system. Our core refueling operation is taking place on condition that the non-divergence of nuclear fuel to the military purpose is firmly guaranteed and technical possibility is preserved for an ad hoc inspection of the fuel rods when the unique status of the DPRK is removed. The campaign to stifle the DPRK over its core refueling cannot be justified in any respect. Since some quarters of the Secretariat of the agency "concluded" that the possibility of later measurement of fuel rods is lost, we do not intend to beg for measurement, if the Secretariat refuses it. The United States must stop acting rashly, pondering over the grave consequences to be entailed by its policy of stifling the DPRK. If "sanctions" are taken against us, not only the parties participating in them but also those backing them will have to bear responsibility.
