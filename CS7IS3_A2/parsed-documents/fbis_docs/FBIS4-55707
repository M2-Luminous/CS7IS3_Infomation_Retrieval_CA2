Protection Force (UNPROFOR) should once again adopt an impartial position in performing its peacekeeping mission on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. During talks with UNPROFOR director for civil affairs, Serge de Melle, and with the coordinator for civil affairs at the Belgrade headquarters of the "blue helmets", Vladislam Gerasev, Simic said that UNPROFOR should do everything possible to inform the U.N. and world public opinion in a timely manner about the real situation in war-torn regions. By so doing UNPROFOR will restore the credibility it needs to take part in appeasing tension and establish lasting peace in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said. The Yugoslav Ministry of Information announced that the representatives of UNPROFOR informed simic about the implementation of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in the region of Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in the east of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H] in which war has been raging between local Serbs, Croats and Moslems for over two years. The agreement was signed here on April 22 by representatives of the U.N. and the Bosnian Serb republic, a state of Bosnian Serbs. Simic told UNPROFOR representatives that the civil war in B-H should not be viewed only from the angle of certain hotbeds, such as Gorazde, since there are other areas, such as Brcko (in the north-east of B-H) which, he said, are potentially more dangerous and which are directly provoked by the Moslem side whose political and military acts are often kept secret and hushed up. Simic pointed out that Bosnian Serbs have objective reasons for dissastifaction and caution towards UNPROFOR due to certain indiscretions committed by the "blue helmets". He cited as an example the direct participation of the Nordic battalion of UNPROFOR on the side of Moslems in clashes in the region of Tuzla (north-east B-H), last week. Simic stressed that the Yugoslav Government will continue to extend its help to UNPROFOR to stabilize the situation in B-H in order to create pre-conditions to continue talks for finding a lasting political solution to the conflict, in accordance with the foreign policy of the country. Finally, Simic expressed his gratitude to UNPROFOR representatives and to the special envoy of U.N. secretary general, Yasushi Akashi, for their efforts to overcome the crisis in B-H.
