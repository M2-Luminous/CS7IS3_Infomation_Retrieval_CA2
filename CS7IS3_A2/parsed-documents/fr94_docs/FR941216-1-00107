Protects against simultaneous detonation of ammunition on adjacent aircraft, but does not prevent serious damage to aircraft and possible propagation of detonation due to fragments, debris, or fire. 4_Use appropriate intraline distance. 5_Use Appendix P to Subpart F of this part distances for mass-detonating items and appropriate public traffic route distances for nonmass-detonating items. 6_Use Appendix P to Subpart F of this part distances for DoD Component aircraft parking areas, and appropriate inhabited building distance for non-DoD Component aircraft parking areas. 7_Use appropriate public traffic route distances for locations in the open where passengers enplane and deplane; use appropriate inhabited building distance if a structure is included where passengers assemble, such as a passenger terminal building. 8_No distance required to recreational areas that are used exclusively for alert personnel manning the combat-loaded aircraft. Other recreational areas where people are in the open shall be at appropriate public traffic route distance. When structures, including bleacher stands, are a part of such area, appropriate inhabited building distance shall be used. 9_Recreational areas, where people are in the open, shall be at appropriate public traffic route distance. When structures, including bleacher stands are part of such area, appropriate inhabited building distance shall be used. 10_Within these areas of airfields, heliports, and seadromes exclusively used by DoD Components, the separation of aircraft parking areas from combat aircraft parking areas and their ready ammunition storage facilities and ammunition and explosives cargo areas are considered to be a command function. At joint DoD/non-DoD use airfields, heliports, and seadromes, the combat aircraft parking areas and its ready ammunition storage facilities and ammunition and explosives cargo area shall be separated from non-DoD aircraft as specified in item 6., above. 11_Use 18W 1/3 distances from side or rear of standard earth-cover magazine containing mass-detonating items to taxiway; use appropriate public traffic route distance from side or rear of standard earth-covered magazine containing nonmass-detonating items to taxiway; use appropriate public traffic route distance from front of standard earth-covered magazines, and from any other storage location containing mass-detonating or nonmass-detonating items to runway.
