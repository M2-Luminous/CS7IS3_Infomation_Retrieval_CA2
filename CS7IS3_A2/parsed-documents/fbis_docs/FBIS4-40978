This was stated today by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev before his departure by air for Brussels. In the Belgian capital he intends to meet and have talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. "This meeting," the head of Russian diplomacy noted, "is being held on the instructions of the two presidents to examine the Korean problem and to agree a common approach in the UN Security Council." As yet, he added, we do not have sufficiently complete information as to what specifically former U.S. President Jimmy Carter managed to achieve as a result of his trip to the DPRK. A. Kozyrev voiced the hope that his meeting with the secretary of state will help shed light on this question. At the same time, he stated, Moscow cannot be satisfied just with the assessments of the U.S. side, but intends to be guided primarily by its own understanding of the situation, since the problem which has arisen has a direct bearing on the sphere of Russia's national interests, indeed geographically the Korean Peninsula is located much nearer to Russia than to the United States. In the course of his visit to the Belgian capital the head of the Russian Federation's foreign policy department also plans to sign the framework document of NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program and the "Russia-NATO" protocol to the eponymous bilateral cooperation program. This protocol determines, the minister continued, that Russia and NATO will cooperate in the military-political and military-technical sphere on the main elements of the program which has already been submitted to Brussels by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. Concerning the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, A. Kozyrev stated that this question will also be discussed at the meeting with W. Christopher. He announced that in Geneva in the near future there might be a second ministerial meeting which would be primarily devoted to liaison with the warring sides.
