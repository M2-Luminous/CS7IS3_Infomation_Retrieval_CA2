FR940429-0-00068 FR940429-0-00010 The Secretary appreciates the suggestion to develop a protocol for information sharing. As this suggestion relates to the Secretary's management of a regulatory provision, however, it does not need to be addressed in regulation. The Secretary intends to work with agencies to develop an appropriate protocol for information sharing, which will address the concerns raised about both the types of information releasable under a FOIA request and a central point of contact within the Department for the exchange of information. The Secretary acknowledges the difficulties in requiring accrediting agencies to report ``fraud'' or ``suspected fraud.'' As the statutory provision for information sharing specifically refers to fraud and abuse, however, the Secretary has added a provision to §602.4 that requires agencies to notify the Secretary if they have reason to believe that an institution may be engaged in fraud or abuse. The Secretary has also added a provision requiring agencies to notify the Secretary if they have reason to believe an institution or program is not meeting its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities. The Secretary acknowledges the importance of sharing with accrediting agencies information about Federal actions against accredited institutions but believes that information sharing goes beyond the cases identified by commenters to include notification to agencies when an accredited institution is referred for review under the State Postsecondary Review Program. The Secretary also acknowledges the importance of having the State postsecondary review entity notify accrediting agencies of the results of its reviews but believes this requirement is more appropriately placed in 34 CFR Part 667 rather than 34 CFR Part 602. The Secretary notes that an accrediting agency's responsibility for notifying State postsecondary review entities about its decisions is discussed in §602.29 of these regulations. Changes : Section 602.4(e) has been revised to indicate that any agency must comply with the Secretary's request for information that is related to the institution's or program's compliance with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities, including its eligibility to participate in Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary has removed the limitation on an agency's duty to share information only in those situations where it does not conflict with accrediting agencies' policies on confidentiality. A requirement has been added that an accrediting agency must notify the Secretary if the agency has reason to believe an institution or program is not meeting its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities or is engaged in fraud and abuse. A new section (§602.5) has been added outlining the Secretary's responsibilities for notifying accrediting agencies of Federal actions against accredited institutions or programs or referral of institutions to States under the State Postsecondary Review Program. Subpart B_Recognition and Termination Procedures Section 602.10␣Application for Recognition. Comments : The Secretary received many comments that the statute only allows the Secretary access to an accrediting agency's records, personnel, and facilities, on an announced or unannounced basis, during the application and review process, not during the entire recognition period. Some commenters described the Secretary's access as so broad that it constituted unwarranted search and seizure without probable cause. Some commenters were especially concerned about the possible release under a FOIA request of an agency's confidential materials that Department personnel examined as part of the Secretary's evaluation of an agency's application for recognition. With regard to the provision for unannounced visits by the Secretary, the Secretary received suggestions both to limit and not limit the use of these visits. The Secretary received a number of comments that the application process and related recordkeeping requirements were particularly burdensome on accrediting agencies and that the burden reported in the Federal Register grossly underestimated the burden imposed by the regulations. Other commenters, however, believed that the application and recordkeeping requirements were not in any way burdensome and that the Secretary was requesting only the minimum amount of information needed to determine whether an agency was a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training provided by the institutions or programs it accredited. With regard to the suggestion in the NPRM that the Secretary was considering allowing agencies to provide a simple statement of assurance that they complied with the requirements for recognition so as to reduce the burden on agencies applying for recognition, there was mixed reaction. Some commenters welcomed the simplification as a reduction in burden, but others thought it invited abuse and provided no protection of the public interest. Still others felt that the first review of an agency under the new regulations should be extremely thorough, but thereafter the simple assurance approach was reasonable.
