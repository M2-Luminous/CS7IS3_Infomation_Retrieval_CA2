FR940606-1-00049 FR940606-1-00008 In addition, the EPA determined that a small portion of the aircraft cannot be stripped with blasting methods. For example, some areas of the aircraft are masked to prevent intrusion of the blast media. The edge of the masking will often cover coated areas and, thus, prevent the blasting media from removing the coating from these areas. This coating must then be removed (referred to as spot stripping), usually with an organic HAP-containing chemical stripper. Another example of spot stripping is the removal of coatings from a small area of the outer surface of the aircraft in order to perform testing and inspection of the bare metal. Also, blasting methods may have difficulty removing some decals. Consequently, organic HAP solvents may be used to soften or remove these decals. For these reasons, exemptions for spot stripping and decal removal are necessary in order to allow the use of blast depainting methods to meet the proposed standards. The EPA did, however, seek to limit the amount of organic HAP-containing chemical strippers used for radome, parts and spot stripping and decal removal. Data provided in the section 114 questionnaire responses were used to establish the amount of stripper used for these operations. Data were not available for radome and parts depainting; however, usage of chemical strippers for spot stripping and decal removal was available from commercial airlines for a limited number of aircraft types. Since information was not available for all aircraft types, the stripper usage for the largest commercial aircraft was used as the basis for the usage exemption. The usage information was, however, limited to commercial aircraft. Military sources within the aerospace industry provided additional data to the EPA that established a technical justification for a higher usage limitation for military aircraft. This information was used as the basis for the usage limitation for spot stripping and decal removal for military aircraft. The section 114 questionnaire responses showed that all facilities (7 respondents) that use media blasting to depaint use either dry particulate filters or baghouses to control particulate emissions from blast depainting methods. While electrostatic precipitators were identified as a possible control technology, the cost of the precipitators was believed to be considerably higher than the filtration methods already in use. Therefore, particulate filters and baghouses were used as the basis for developing the MACT floor for operations that use media blasting. 4. Chemical Milling Maskant Application Operation Not all aerospace facilities perform chemical milling maskant operations. Of those responding to the section 114 request, twelve reported chemical milling operations. To identify the best performing twelve percent of the sources, the emission rate for each source was calculated by dividing the organic HAP emissions by the total usage of chemical milling maskants to obtain pounds of organic HAP emitted per gallon of chemical milling maskant (less water) as applied. The emissions value took into account control measures such as carbon adsorbers or waterborne chemical milling maskants. The sources were then ranked from the lowest emission rate to the highest. For this operation, the best performing 12 percent of the sources is represented by the two sources with the lowest emission rates. One of these sources utilized a carbon adsorber to abate the emissions from a solvent-based chemical milling maskant. The other source utilized a waterborne chemical milling maskant with no abatement. Each of these two facilities had the same organic HAP emission rate of 1.3 lb/gal. Therefore, this was selected to represent the MACT floor. 5. Handling and Storage of Waste Based on the section 114 questionnaire responses, 181 non-wastewater waste streams were reported. Every stream was controlled by housekeeping measures such as keeping the waste material in closed drums. Thus, housekeeping measures were established as the MACT floor for handling and storage of waste.
