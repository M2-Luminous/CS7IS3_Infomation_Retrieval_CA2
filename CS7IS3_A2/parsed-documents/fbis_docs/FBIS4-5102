However, it has no money to tap these treasures. Will your government accept foreign investment and on what conditions? Kaysone: Our government is ready to cooperate in economic development with all countries on the principle of equity and posing no threat to our independence. CHATURAT: What is the top priority on the list of your government's economic development plan? Kaysone: We will turn our country into an industrial nation based on agriculture and forestry. Norman Pegam, special reporter of CHATURAT magazine, asked these two questions to Kaysone Phomvihan, former president of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] and former head of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party [LPRP], 18 years ago. The answers were nothing but a plan which would take decades for its materialization. The promulgation of the "New Economic Mechanism" or "Restructuring" policy was the first sign of the plan being materialized. Kaysone Phomvihan proposed the policy during the fourth party congress in 1986 to lay the foundation for decentralized economic development. During the fifth congress in 1991, the LPRP announced the national socioeconomic development plan for the period from 1993 to 2000. The plan encourages the application of capitalism rules but refuses to let the country plunge into the orbit of capitalism. However, the official opening of the bridge [linking Vientiane capital with Thailand's Nong Khai Province] this month will attach Laos to capitalism. Although Laos' centralized economic system has been shifted to Lao-style capitalism, its political system remains "Lao-style" democracy or centralized democracy. It is apparent that the centralized power is in the hands of the group of "party leaders from southern Laos." The Road of Power Stretches to the South [Subhead] After the death of Kaysone Phomvihan in 1992, Nouhak Phoumsavan was named the new president of the LPDR while General Khamtai Siphandon became chairman of the LPRP. The appointments of Kaysone Phomvihan's close comrades in arms to the highest posts to administer the country and party brought an abrupt end to the anticipation of a massive reshuffle of the power holders. The allocation of important posts in the National Assembly, Council of Ministers, and party indicates an attempt to keep the power well balanced at a certain level. President Nouhak Phoumsavan has the power to appoint or dismiss the prime minister while Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon, in his capacity as chairman of the party, also has the power to propose to the National Assembly the appointment or dismissal of the president. It should be noted that Nouhak Phoumsavan, a native of Savannakhet Province, is classified as a member of the political group of former President Kaysone Phomvihan; Phoun Sipaseut, deputy prime minister in charge of foreign affairs; and Phao Bounnaphon, minister attached to the Prime Minister's Office. Meanwhile, General Khamtai Siphandon, a native of Khon District in Champassak Province, belongs to the Champassak power group. Defense Minister Lieutenant Choummali Sai-gnason and National Assembly President Saman Vi-gnaket also come from this group. Gen. Khamtai belongs to the Lao Thoeng ethnic group. Other personalities belonging to this ethnic group include renowned economist Khamphoui Keoboualapha, deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs and member of the Commission for Planning and Cooperation with Foreign Countries. The commission, in coordination with the other four economic agencies -- namely the Finance Ministry, Trade Ministry, Foreign Ministry, and the State Bank -- is fully responsible for the control and promotion of foreign investment. Glancing at the list of members of the party's Political Bureau appointed by the fifth party congress, it appears that more than half of them are southerners, namely Nouhak Phoumsavan (No. 2), Gen. Khamtai Siphandon (No. 3), Phoun Sipaseut (No. 4), Saman Vi-gnaket (No. 6) Lieutenant General Choummali Sai-ngason (No. 8), and Kamphoui Keoboualapha (No. 10), as well as the late Kaysone Phomvihan (No. 1), and the late Somlat Chanthamat (No. 9). Maichantan Sengmani (No. 5), Oudom Khatthi-gna (No. 7), and Thongsing Thammavong (No. 11) are the three northerners appointed to the present Political Bureau. The photos from the signing ceremony of the agreement on developing the Khon Phapheng Resort (Liphi Waterfall) between Khamphoui Keoboualapha on behalf of the Commission for Planning and Foreign Cooperation and Khun Somphop Piya-ui of T.U. Company Ltd tells the inside story of Laos' politics and economy. Everyone knows that the area to be developed is the home town of General Khamtai Siphandon. Khong District of the Kha ethnic group has a long record of struggling for national liberation. The Kha people under the command of their chieftain Kommadan rose up against French colonialist rule and later the chieftain's son, Sithon Kommadan, led his people to join other minority groups in the struggle for national liberation. General Khamtai Siphandon was born in a farming family in Houa Khong village. Like other youths in those days, he joined the revolutionary movement in Champassak Province by becoming a member of the Indochina Party (the first Marxist-Leninist Communist Party established by Ho Chi Minh in the region) and later shifted to the LPRP. During the war against the U.S. imperialists, the name of Khamtai Siphandon was always mentioned after those of Kaysone Phomvihan and Nouhak Phoumsavan. Immediately after the formation of the first government of the LPDR, Gen. Khamtai Siphandon was appointed deputy prime minister, defense minister, and supreme commander of the Lao Armed Forces. Afterwards, he fully controlled power in the Lao People's Army until recently handing this power to Lieutenant General Choummali Sai-gnason. Gen. Khamtai Siphandon took up the presidency during a time when Laos is being bombarded by the strong currents of capitalism. The party leader, a competent warrior on any battlefield, realizes the fact that "economic war is different from bloody political war." So he prudently rearranged his Army by posing "new-headed youths" as his front commanders to fight on the globalization battlefield. In so doing, he appointed Somsavat Lengsavat, an international relations graduate from the United States, as the foreign minister of his government. Khamsai Souphanouvong, a son of the revolutionary prince who was an economics graduate who studied in France, was named finance minister. Sompadit Vorasan, an economist who studied in France, was appointed to be trade minister; and Butsabong Suvannavong, a finance and banking expert from England, became governor of the State Bank. Political observers in Laos anticipate that a cabinet reshuffle will take place soon. President Nouhak Phoumsavan, 78, will retire from politics and be replaced by Gen. Khamtai Siphandon, 66. It is generally believed Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Choummali Sai- gnason will become the new prime minister and the post of defense minister will be given to General Sisavat Keobounphan, who was not appointed to the party's Political Bureau by the fifth party congress. However, this speculation is based on the compromise between the northerners and southerners which is designed to keep the national economic development scheme moving ahead in line with the principle of "daring to accept capitalism, but not be enslaved by capitalism." The directions of Laos' politics and economy from now on will be controlled by Gen. Khamtai Siphandon and his six southern compatriots in the party's Political Bureau. This is the Lao People's Democratic Republic under the rule of "southerners."
