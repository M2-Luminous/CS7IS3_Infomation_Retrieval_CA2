Commenting on the results of his trip, Churkin told TASS that these meeting had concentrated on Bosnian settlement, specifically the possibility of disengaging Croatian and Muslim forces. As for Bosnia's territorial division and state arrangement, these issues need to be thoroughly examined, the Russian envoy noted. He is going to discuss them during Monday's meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Speaking about the Russian peacekeeping battalion deployed in Sarajevo, Churkin said neither the Muslim side nor the regional command of peacekeeping forces had any claims to it. The battalion is to be shortly reinforced with about one hundred extra fighters expected to arrive in Sarajevo in late March. As for the current situation in the Bosnian capital, Churkin believes it has notably changed for the better. "For the first time over the past year, the situation here is close to normal. Moreover, Krajisnik has told me that Serbs and Muslim reached agreement on movement of civilians in Sarajevo and around it. This is a very important decision", Churkin stressed.
