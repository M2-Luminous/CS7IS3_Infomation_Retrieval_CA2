FBIS4-15968 "drsov071_c_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Federal Assembly Duma Drafts Statement on Balkans Conflict Duma Drafts Statement on Balkans Conflict LD1204145394 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1300 GMT 12 Apr 94 LD1204145394 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] If the State Duma does not support the draft statement on the latest events in former Yugoslavia, this document will be published on behalf of the factions of the Liberal-Democratic, Communist, Agrarian and Democratic parties, and possibly of the Party of Russian Unity and Concord and the New Regional Policy group, Chairman of the State Duma's Committee for Geopolitics Viktor Ustinov (the LDPR) told Interfax. He said that on commission from the State Duma Council, his committee had drafted a statement which says that "the signs of settlement in the Balkans have been brought to naught" and that the conflict was assuming a dangerous character, while the U.S. began to play the role of world gendarme. It also says that the U.S. is disregarding Russia and its interests. The draft statement demands that the UN Security Council's resolution on the use of NATO forces in the Balkans be suspended and that the Security Council urgently discuss the situation in former Yugoslavia. "We must give a worthy response to the U.S. which does not take Russia's opinion into account," said Ustinov. He said that the four parliamentary committees--for geopolitics, security, CIS affairs and industry--"are categorically against Russia's participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program." If Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signs the framework agreement on the program on April 21, "the confidence in the Russian leadership and government will drop by several percentage points," said Ustinov.
