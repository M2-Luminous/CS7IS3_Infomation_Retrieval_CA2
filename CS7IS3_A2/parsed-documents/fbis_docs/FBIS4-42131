He told a press conference today that Turkey did not need U.S. ultimatums to practice human rights and implement democratic freedoms. Evaluating the House's Wednesday decision which also asked Turkey to review its human rights practices and improve the situation regarding Cyprus, Karayalcin said that the government was spending efforts to establish human rights and freedoms in Turkey and a recent democratization package aimed to improve these in Turkey. `Turkey does not need another country's ultimatum to defend human rights in the country and it is capable of improving such issues within its own dynamics,' Karayalcin said. `These kinds of preconditions draw angry reactions,' he said.
