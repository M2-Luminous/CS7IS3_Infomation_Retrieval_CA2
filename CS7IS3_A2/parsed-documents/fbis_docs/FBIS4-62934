However, perhaps, in connection with the beginning of work of the new parliament, his visit had been postponed, and the team of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense was headed by Deputy Minister Colonel General Ivan Bizhan. On 10 May, two aircraft with the commission on board touched down at the military airfield in Ivano-Frankivsk. It was met by Major General Anatoliy Kalashnykov, commander of the formation; Colonel Mykola Moroz, military commissioner of the oblast; Zinoviy Shkutyak, first deputy chairman of the Oblast State Administration; and Yaroslav Taylikh, chairman of the Ivano-Frankivsk City Council and of the Executive Committee. "It is an ordinary working trip," pointed out I. Bizhan answering the journalists' question about the purpose of the visit. True, the representatives of the Defense Ministry arrived here to inspect the troops and check the work of the Oblast Military Commissariat, following which some of its recruitment resources may be mobilized. However, after all, such measures are implemented once every six to 10 years. Besides, it is not so often that top officials of Ukraine's Defense Ministry visit our oblast. An improvised news conference was held at the airfield, and the deputy defense minister answered the journalists' questions. In particular, touching upon the situation in the Crimea, I. Bizhan pointed out that the Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine. However, the negotiations on the division of the Black Sea Fleet in which I. Bizhan has been taking part for two years proceed with great difficulty. The colonel general openly stated that he would like to talk about professional military matters, rather than politics. However, how can these two be separated? For example, questions arise on why the Ukrainian Army does not stand up to a comparison with the Russian Army. It is a matter of material provision for the armed forces, remuneration of the work of its officers, and everything that has to do with raising the prestige of the military service in society. "You should not forget that the Ukrainian Army is being created in a blank space," pointed out the general. "Whereas the Russian Army used the structure of the former Soviet Army. In Russia, there have remained both the General Staff and the military academies. Of course, we would like our officers to get higher salaries. However, we understand that the state allocates as much funds for the armed forces as it presently can." I. Bizhan told the audience that a new program "Serving the People of Ukraine" will soon be started by the Ukrainian Television at the initiative of the defense minister in order to popularize the military service and to acquaint the public with army problems and daily life.
