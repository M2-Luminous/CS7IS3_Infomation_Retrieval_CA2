The agreement, concluded on June 22, on large-scale cooperation between Russia and NATO "opens up new possibilities for Norway's close cooperation with its nearest neighbour -- Russia", Kosmo said. Norway is convinced, the minister said, that "it is possible to develop and strengthen Norwegian-Russian contacts in the field of defence and security in the best way under the Partnership-for-Peace programme". "We are interested in adding specific programmes to the Russia-NATO agreement, which could contribute to further strengthening goodneigbourly relations between Norway and Russia. "Russia -- a great power with a huge population -- possesses an economic potential, nuclear weapons and military might. Considering these factors, there is no need for Russia to ask for a special place within the framework of cooperation with NATO. Russia already holds it due to these circumstances. "Your country does not need to sign a special document to specify its special role. Without any special agreements, Russia can exert a great influence on the development of the Partnership-for-Peace programme and on the political situation in Europe as a whole. "It remains for Russia only to act as befits a great power," the Norwegian defence minister emphasised.
