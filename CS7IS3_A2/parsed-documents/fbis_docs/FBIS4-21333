A section in charge for supervision over the cases on illegal circulation of narcotics and psychotropic substances is being created in the republic's prosecutor's office "to observe legislation with respect to fighting drugs." The republic's customs department has been commissioned to create services to prevent transit of drugs through the border. The decree stresses that the difficult social-economic situation in Georgia, aggravation of the criminal situation, weakening of border control have facilitated the spread of drug addiction in Georgia. Spreading of drug addiction among young people arouses special concern. In addition, the drug mafia is showing an interest in Georgia as a country which is convenient for drug transit.
