Speaking near Ulundi, he said this would depend on the outcome of a summit meeting with the government, the ANC, and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini next week. [Begin Buthelezi recording] If the negotiations, or rather the discussions, that are taking place next week between the state president, Mr. Mandela, the president of the ANC, his majesty the king, and myself, do not come up with something that can make it possible for us to participate in the elections even at this late hour, then of course we'll continue to play the role of being opposed to the status quo. [end recording] Dr. Buthelezi said though the declaration of a state of emergency in kwaZulu-Natal was not conducive to good negotiations.
