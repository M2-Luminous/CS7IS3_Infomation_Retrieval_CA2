FR940916-0-00009 FR940916-0-00003 PART 1468_WOOL AND MOHAIR 1. The authority citation for 7 CFR part 1468 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 1781&hyph;1787; 15 U.S.C. 714b and 714c. 2. Section 1468.3 is amended to add ``commission,'' ``coring,'' ``deductible marketing charges,'' ``grading,'' ``gross proceeds,'' ``net proceeds,'' ``net proceeds for payment purposes,'' ``nondeductible marketing charges,'' and ``nonmarketing charges'' definitions to read as follows: §1468.3 Definitions. * * * * * Commission means fees or charges incurred to market shorn wool or mohair on behalf of the producer. Examples of commissions include charges for overhead charges, operating expenses, in and out charges, insurance, advertising, association dues, or assessments. Coring means obtaining a sample representative of a lot of grease wool or mohair. The sample is tested for yield, diameter, and vegetable matter content. The core sample may also be used to measure clean color. * * * * * Deductible marketing charges means service fees or charges paid by or for the account of the producer that are directly related to marketing of shorn wool or mohair, such as, but not limited to, transportation (freight), scouring, and carbonizing and are deducted from a producer's gross proceeds to determine price support payments. * * * * * Grading (sorting and classing) means the grouping of like fleeces by measurable characteristics, such as fineness, yield, vegetable matter type and content, length, strength, and color. Skirting is not considered to be part of the grading process. * * * * * Gross proceeds means the amount computed for the seller on a grease basis before any marketing or nonmarketing charges have been subtracted. * * * * * Net proceeds means the amount paid to the seller after all marketing and nonmarketing charges have been subtracted. Net proceeds for payment purposes means proceeds that are determined by subtracting from the gross proceeds of the wool or mohair all deductible marketing charges and any amount of nondeductible marketing charges that exceeds the combined total nondeductible marketing charges for price support payment established by CCC. This figure is also used in establishing national payment rates and individual producer payments. Nondeductible marketing charges means service fees or charges paid by or for the account of the producer for commission, grading, and coring, and are not deducted from a producer's gross proceeds to determine price support payments. CCC shall determine the combined total charges for commission, grading, and coring on which price support payments will be made. Nonmarketing charges means charges paid by or for the account of the producer that are not directly related to improving the marketability of the shorn wool or mohair, such as, but not limited to, storage, bags, advances, interest on advances, shearing, and association dues, and are not deducted from the producer's gross proceeds to determine price support payments. * * * * * 3. Section 1468.4 is amended by: A. Revising paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4), and B. Adding paragraph (c)(5) to read as follows: §1468.4 Eligibility for payments. * * * * * (c) * * * (3) $150,000 for the 1993 marketing year; (4) $125,000 for the 1994 marketing year; and (5) $100,000 for the 1995 marketing year. * * * * * 4. Section 1468.5 is amended by revising paragraphs (b) and (d) to read as follows: §1468.5 Bona fide marketing within a specified marketing year. * * * * * (b) The price utilized for the purpose of computing net proceeds for payment purposes under the provisions of §1468.8 shall not exceed the fair market value of the wool or mohair as determined by CCC. * * * * * (d) The exchange of wool or mohair for merchandise or services of a nature other than wool or mohair or wool or mohair products will be considered as a bona fide marketing if a definite price for the wool or mohair is established by the parties prior to the exchange. Such price, or whatever other price CCC determines is the fair market value for such wool or mohair, whichever is lower, shall be used for the purpose of computing the net proceeds for payment purpose under the provisions of §1468.8. * * * * * 5. Section 1468.6 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(5) and (b)(6) to read as follows: §1468.6 Contents of sales documents.
