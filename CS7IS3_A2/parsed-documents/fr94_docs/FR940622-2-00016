ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice is to announce that the Secretary of Commerce has approved the withdrawal of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 71, Advanced Data Communication Control Procedures (ADCCP) and FIPS 78, Guideline for Implementing Advanced Data Communication Control Procedures (ADCCP). On November 16, 1993, notice was published in the Federal Register (58 FR 60425) proposing withdrawal of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 71, because the technical specifications that they adopt are obsolete and are no longer supported by industry. NIST also stated that if FIPS 71 were withdrawn, FIPS 78 would be withdrawn as well. The written comments submitted by interested parties and other material available to the Department relevant to this standard was reviewed by NIST. On the basis of this review, NIST recommended that the Secretary approved the withdrawal of FIPS 71 and 78, and prepared a detailed justification document for the Secretary's review in support of that recommendation. The detailed justification document which was presented to the Secretary is part of the public record and is available for inspection and copying in the Department's Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, Room 6020, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, NW., Washington, DC 20230. EFFECTIVE DATE: This withdrawal is effective on June 22, 1994.
