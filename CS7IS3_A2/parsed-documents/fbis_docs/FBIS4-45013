That was a clear reference to the military confrontation, currently in its third successive week, between forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, and other forces loyal to 'Ali Salim al-Bid and leaders of the Yemeni Socialist Party whom Sanaa regards as insurrectionists against legitimate authority. Mosque preachers, in their Friday sermons, did not consider it inconceivable that "the current war would continue for a few more days or even for months" since, in their opinion, it takes patience and wisdom to overpower and defeat enemy strongholds. They noted that the mujahidin, as they called them, waged a fierce battle at Mihwar al-Hind, some 60 km from Aden where, they pointed out, most concrete fortifications exceed two meters in thickness. And yet, they said the lightly armed mujahidin charged them and secured them with a minimum of losses compared to enemy casualties. That claim is consistent with communiques issued by Sanaa, which continues to claim control of the base despite Aden's assertions to the contrary. The preachers asserted that groups of Yemeni civilians have volunteered in what they called the "jihad for God's sake" and joined the ranks of regular forces that are engaged in fierce fighting in order to achieve their mission. They added that the volunteers have joined various divisions in solidarity with their warring brethren and in order that "they all may celebrate clear victory," as the preachers put it. In a related development, an informed source in Sanaa shrugged off the impact of the "volunteer mujahidin" who include groups of Arab Afghans as well as militias of the Yemeni Reform Grouping. He opined that they could have no stronger impact on the battle than either the "deluded" Socialist Party militias or those whom 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his supporters dispatched to the mountains of al-Dali', Radfan, etc., in order to regain lost territories by engaging regular troops in guerrilla warfare. Asked whether the war, or military confrontation, between well-trained and fully equipped armed forces regulars threatens to become guerrilla warfare or war among groups of volunteers spread beyond the military fronts, the Sanaa source said that "it is unlikely that things will reach this level of complexity and foreboding that some people dread. The reason, he emphasized, is that both warring parties in Sanaa and Aden know full well that it would undermine their interests to allow their conflict to escalate to that extent, since both of them are keen on remaining in power one way or another." Should the war continue or expand, both parties to the confrontation could forfeit their positions by losing the initiative, especially in the event of a prolonged military confrontation, which the source deemed to be "unlikely." Both Sanaa and Aden acknowledged in their military communiques that a number of "intrepid citizens" from various parts of Yemen are involved in the military confrontations and are engaged with the regular forces "in achieving military victories and vanquishing the enemy." Some observers regard this with a degree of uneasiness and trepidation. They believe that the development, and the openness with which it is discussed in military communiques and mosque sermons, does not forebode a quick conclusion and may indeed escalate the military confrontation into a civil war where each of the parties may be forced to deploy its civilian supporters into militias or tribal forces, thereby driving the battle beyond the fronts into various parts of Yemen. That, should it happen, would take a long time and tremendous effort to quell. Those observers also view the semantic use of "jihad" to describe current skirmishes in certain sections of Sanaa between the forces of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the forces of his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid, as something that undermines President Salih's position and his justifications for his war with al-Bid's forces. President Salih, having won the support of a comfortable majority of northern members of the Yemeni Chamber of Deputies, claims that "al-Bid and his supporters are insurgents against the constitutional authority" and must therefore be "pursued, apprehended, and made to stand trial." The debate on jihad, while it seems to rebut President Salih's claims, is consistent with al-Bid's statements on the confrontation between the southern forces and the forces of President Salih and his fundamentalist supporters who, in his view, "want to regress the country to the way things were centuries ago." Some observers believe that by recently relinquishing the word "terrorists" in favor of the term "Sanaa-supported fundamentalists," especially since the military confrontation began, al-Bid and his supporters are seeking to gain the support of Arab and Western countries that are apprehensive about the potential of the religious movement in Yemen rising to power. Observers therefore expect President Salih and his supporters to be alert to some of the caveats for which the West is closely watching, and he may deal with those caveats in an unexpected manner. President Salih has assured the West, and particularly the United States, that once he resolves the conflict with al-Bid and his supporters, his immediate focus will be on "making up for the mistakes of the past and on building a new Yemen on a foundation of unity, democracy, political plurality, respect for human rights, comprehensive development, social progress, and the administrative and fiscal decentralization of local governance." Those assurances notwithstanding, the Western countries are not satisfied with mere "promises" and are relying primarily on their sources for reports, information, and supported figures to determine the extent to which those promises have been translated into pragmatic measures and actual realities. Observers fear that President Salih may not be able to maintain his control of the religious movement in the Yemeni Reform Grouping with which he is currently allied in his drive to eliminate the leaders of the Socialist Party. This may prove even more difficult should they actually succeed in achieving their mutual objective and emerge victorious from this confrontation. This is something that President Salih must consider with great care in his quest for the West's trust and for better treatment by it. Not only that, he must also consolidate his rapprochement with countries of the Gulf and with other nations that view the "problem of fundamentalism" with great trepidation.
