FR940830-2-00079 FR940830-2-00047 The goals of this program address the themes of the Secretary of HHS: fostering independence through empowering people served; preventing future problems; and improving services to customers through modern management approaches. Demonstration Site applicants will develop, implement, and evaluate an intervention with the goal of improving competitive employment. This multisite, cooperative agreement will also develop a common study protocol. After grantees are selected for funding, grantees and CMHS staff will identify issues and study questions which can be examined by utilizing the data elements in common across the Demonstration Sites. The utilization of agreed-upon measures which are in common across Demonstration Sites provides the opportunity to compare intervention effects for different populations in different geographic locations, thereby enhancing the generalizability of results, and allows for statistical analyses that assess the effects of multiple factors on employment status outcomes. Progress in employment is often characterized by episodes of productive employment followed by unemployment. Therefore, a long-term perspective is needed to appropriately assess outcomes of an intervention. Successful applicants for this program of study will include data collection over a period of at least 2 years, and a longer time interval for data collection is encouraged. The primary goal of this RFA is the determination of the effectiveness of interventions. However, information on costs will be valuable in informing policy decisions for resource allocations. Effectiveness is defined as the improvement of positive outcomes and the reduction of adverse outcomes, regardless of costs. An important component in studying the value of an intervention is the determination of the costs of the intervention. Because this is an initial exploration of costs, the focus will be limited to actual direct expenditures for employment intervention programs and employment site activities. Costs unique to the evaluation component will not be included in the analyses. Cost information from this demonstration program may provide the basis for future studies of cost effectiveness that would likely be expanded to incorporate financial costs, indirect costs, and lost-opportunity costs. Structure and Phases of the MultiSite Program: The study will involve the cooperation of personnel from (1) a Coordinating Center, (2) the Demonstration Sites, and (3) the CMHS staff. Awards will be made for a project period of up to 5 years. For planning and budgeting purposes, the study can be envisioned as proceeding in the following three phases. Phase I: Development of a collaborative study plan (common protocol); development, refinement, and pilot testing of common methodological procedures and instruments (baseline and outcome); training in the common field procedures; examination of validity of proposed instruments and development of a centralized database and coordinating structure, intervention start up (months 1&hyph;6); Phase II: Full implementation of service programs, identification and enrollment of clients; ongoing data collection and evaluation activities; interim data analyses (months 6&hyph;30); Phase III: Phase-down of intervention programs; end enrollment of clients in the study; complete follow-up data collection for enrolled clients; conduct data analyses and produce reports and publications (months 30&hyph;60). Role of Demonstration Sites: Each Demonstration Site grantee, in collaboration with the Federal staff and the Coordinating Center, will have responsibility at their own site for service program planning and implementation, client enrollment and follow up, data collection, preliminary and final data analysis and interpretation, quality control, and preparation of reports and publications. In addition, each Demonstration Site grantee will participate in the development and activities of the common protocol including providing data to the Coordinating Center. Role of the Coordinating Center: For the common protocol which will be developed in the planning phase, the Coordinating Center will provide overall study coordination, including data management and analysis, training in common procedures, distribution of common materials to all study sites, monitoring of data quality and analysis of cost data collected by the Demonstration Sites. The Coordinating Center will also coordinate the pilot testing of the common core instruments, as agreed upon in the planning phase. CMHS staff will work with and monitor the Coordinating Center. The Coordinating Center will develop and maintain a common data repository, containing those data elements collected by each Demonstration Site which will be used in the common protocol. Role of CMHS Staff: CMHS staff will be active participants in all aspects of the cooperative agreements and will serve as collaborators with project directors from the Demonstration Sites and the Coordinating Center. CMHS staff have overall responsibility for monitoring the conduct and progress of this program and will make recommendations regarding continuance of the program. CMHS staff will provide substantial input, in collaboration with the grantees, both in the planning and conduct of this program. Role of the Steering Committee: The Steering Committee will be composed of the project director of the Coordinating Center, the project directors from each of the Demonstration Sites, and CMHS staff. In addition, for Demonstration Sites where the State mental health authority is not the direct applicant, the State mental health authority will be invited to be a participant as a voting member of the committee. All participating grantees will agree to abide by the common protocol study design and policy recommendations developed by the Steering Committee and any required CMHS approvals set forth in the terms and conditions of this cooperative agreement.
