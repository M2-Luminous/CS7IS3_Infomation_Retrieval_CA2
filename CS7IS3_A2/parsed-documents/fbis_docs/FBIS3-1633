Founded in the early 1970s, the company has developed into the ninth key industrial enterprise of its type in the country, with an annual sales volume exceeding six billion yuan-worth. Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji has called on enterprises across the country to learn from the Shanghai Petrochemicals Co., Ltd., which has put on a fresh look by introducing the joint stock system. And the State Planning Commission has just held a national seminar at the company on deepening the reform of large key state enterprises. In September 1992 the company was designated by the central government to try out the joint stock system and sell its stocks overseas. "It was a huge project for a large state enterprise with 600,000 employees and several billion yuan-worth of fixed assets to transform into a joint stock company," said Wang Jiming, chairman of the board of directors and general manager of the company. "We know that before the coming into effect the corporate law in July this year a registered Chinese enterprise, which plans to sell stocks internationally, must do good preparation work strictly in line with the international and standardized requirements," he said. It took the company more than half a year to make an inventory of its stockpiles and capital. In July 1993 it issued 1.68 billion h-shares abroad, marking the first time that a registered Chinese enterprise had issued stocks overseas. A survey shows that the company collected a sum of 320 million U.S. dollars and 1.62 billion yuan (one dollar equals about 8.7 yuan) by issuing stocks, thus reinforcing its capacity for self-development. Since then, it has received streams of foreign investors and telegrams of inquiry. "Everyone has noticed that the image of the company, China's first one to list stocks in New York and Hong Kong, reflects not only the company itself but all Chinese enterprises," Wang said. The company's staff and workers have purchased an average of 1,950 stocks per capita. "We are now masters of our company, and we work harder and pay more attention to the company's production and management," said Wang Ziqiu, a worker in the company's acrylic fiber mill. In addition, the Shanghai Petrochemicals Co., Ltd. has shifted its operational mechanism by adjusting its product structure to produce items with additional value. It has cut its administrative organizations from 55 to 19 and reduced its staff members from 1,270 to 417. According to Wang, the joint stock system has promoted not only the development of the Shanghai Petrochemicals Company but also the income of its employees. Last year saw the company generate record profits totaling 1.8 billion yuan, and its employees' incomes increase by at least 30 percent. Ye Guozhen, a worker at the company's heat and power plant, said happily that his wage rose from 434 yuan per month in February last year, just before the company began its reform, to 780 yuan last month. According to Carol Ruth, chairman of the board of directors of Dewe Rogerson Company, an agent of the Shanghai Petrochemicals Co., Ltd. in the United States, people engaged in international securities transactions agreed that the rise of 120 percent in the price of stocks issued by the company ltd. "fully reflects the rosy view of China of the international capital market, and the quality of the key Chinese enterprises." Following suit, 65 out of 600 key state enterprises have been listed on stock markets.
