The Senate agreed to modify Article 41 of the Constitution to promote greater independence of electoral bodies and to broaden citizen participation in the electoral process with an eye on federal elections scheduled for next August. The decision closed three days of special sessions called by the Permanent Commission, which is operating during the congressional recess between late December and 15 April, to examine and, as the case may be, approve electoral reforms. On 23 March the Chamber of Deputies approved a bill to amend the electoral law that calls for a new structure for the electoral bodies and establishes new electoral crimes and stronger punishments for such crimes. The amendments will go into effect after their publication in DIARIO OFICIAL and will be applied during the 21 August elections in which about 42 million Mexicans will elect a president and federal legislators.
