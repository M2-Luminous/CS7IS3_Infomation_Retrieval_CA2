"Too much NATO-centrism," he replied. Coming from the man most closely identified with the prowestern thrust of the first two years of Russia's post-Soviet foreign policy, the remark was revealing. If Russia's most ardent "westernisers" are becoming more critical of the West, it is a significant shift. It may be tempting to see the new Moscow line as a reaction to the upsurge of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the far-right leader. But it has been evolving over a period of months, as Russia's military and political decisionmakers begin to recover from the shock of the Soviet Union's collapse and work out a new conception of their country's place in the world. If it is a reaction to anything, it is to what is seen as the West's disappointing attitude to Russia. Gorbachev's perestroika was founded on the notion that if Russia changed its behaviour in eastern Europe and towards the West, the rest of the continent would adjust its negative image of Russia. As the successors to Gorbachev, the leaders of the new post-Soviet Russia went further. They hoped they would be welcomed into the western club with open arms, while also being recognised as a country with legitimate interests. It did not happen. Even before Zhirinovskiy, Russia's efforts to withdraw from the Baltics in an orderly fashion were attacked in the West as foot-dragging, or even as a barely-disguised effort to hold on to imperial positions. Its exclusively diplomatic moves to defend the civil rights and linguistic interests of Russian settlers in the Baltics were criticised as interference. Its military moves in Tajikistan, even though they had the support of the Commonwealth of Independent States, were depicted as interventionism. A strange dichotomy emerged in the West. Almost anything President Yeltsin did at home was applauded blindly. Almost anything he did outside Russia in areas of previous Soviet influence was condemned as the stirrings of imperialism. It is not surprising that eastern Europeans should harbour ill-will towards Russia. They suffered under Stalinist occupation for more than 40 years. Polish suspicions go back for two centuries before that. Partly genuinely, but with a good deal of calculation, they have seized on the Zhirinovskiy card to try to drum their way into NATO. Clinton has done well to resist their pressure, sensing that to move NATO's frontier eastward will incite Russian anxieties. As Kozyrev put it as long ago as last March: "We don't understand the discussions to the effect that NATO must give security guarantees to the countries of central Europe and in the long term accept them as members. How are these countries threatened and by whom?" But Clinton is only partly guided by good reasons. As Kozyrev's "NATO-centric" comment implied, the West is still mesmerised by NATO's alleged achievements. The tag-line "the most successful alliance in history" does not survive close scrutiny, nor does its subtheme that nuclear deterrence was the key ingredient. The West's monopoly of nuclear weapons, which Truman proudly announced to Stalin at Potsdam in 1945, did not stop the Soviet take-over of central Europe or roll back its annexation of the Baltic states. The formation of NATO four years later did nothing to prevent new assertions of Russian-inspired control in East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. If Moscow did not move further westwards, it was not because of NATO but because the Kremlin by 1949 had no interest in further European conquest. By then the possessor of its own nuclear weapons, it was like all other nuclear powers since Nagasaki "self-deterred." The very awesomeness of their destructive force has always restrained responsible leaders, as Eisenhower admitted in his memoirs over Korea and Nixon did over Vietnam. Brezhnev and Andropov were the same. What makes Zhirinovskiy terrifying is that he breaks the mould for the first time. He sounds irresponsible enough to press the button. By the same token, however, traditional defences do not work. No amount of security guarantees by NATO can defend Poland, Hungary, or Lithuania from such a man. The only defence is to prevent him coming to power. He must be deprived of any chance of turning his fragile 23 per cent vote into a majority. Not moving NATO's borders just west of St. Petersburg is one way to do that. Russians also have their paranoia, and the notion of the world's most powerful military machine, with the modernised bases and airfields which would inevitably go with it, planting itself in Poland and Slovakia, let alone inside the former Soviet Union, is not wanted by anyone in Russia. The subtext of Kozyrev's crack at "NATO-centrism" is that western countries, as well as the states of central and eastern Europe, must abandon the "block [as published] mentality." For a few months after he came to power, Yeltsin toyed with joining NATO. It was partly meant as a dramatic sign that this was a new and democratic Russia. But it was also a device for expanding NATO so enormously that it ceased to be NATO. More recently, Russia has gone back to an old Gorbachev idea, the notion of merging NATO with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). As Kozyrev put it in his brief TV interview this week: "Maybe Russia will join NATO. Maybe there will be another scenario. NATO will change into some kind of all-European system." Vyacheslav Kostikov, Yeltsin's spokesman, has made the same point. "The Russian President is concerned by the tendency to expand the block [as published] system. Encouraging it would contradict the declared intentions of building relations on principles of trust, partnership and equilibrium," he said. The speed with which the Zhirinovskiy factor has been used in the West, and not just in central and eastern Europe, to whip up old nightmares about the Russian bear has upset many people in Moscow. Eastern Europe's emotions are understandable, though their recourse to old-fashioned remedies will not help. What matters more to Russians is what the major western leaders feel. This is the umpteenth U.S.-Russian summit since the cold war wound down, but it is the first time that Moscow's decision-makers have not seen their American visitor as a man who could help them. In a funny way, the new attitude restores some of the status Russia lost when it ceased to be a superpower. The Russian elite will be happy if they can give this new and apparently more receptive American president something themselves. If Clinton leaves here having learnt something about Russian complexities and with the conviction that NATO should not expand geographically but re-think its entire rationale, Russians will treat his visit as a success.
