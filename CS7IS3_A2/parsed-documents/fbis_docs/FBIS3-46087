Preferential policies will be granted to short-term firms which mainly employ ex-convicts, according to a senior official of the Labor Ministry. Those enterprises will be entitled to priorities and government support in terms of loans, sites, bidding, as well as leasing of other firms, said Zhang Xiaojian, director of the ministry's Employment Department, in an exclusive interview with XINHUA here today. The move highlights China's bid to care for ex-convicts -- in work and living conditions -- and it will also help to maintain social stability. The Chinese Government has always urged that ex- convicts should be provided equal opportunities in employment. Zhang stressed that on no account should any enterprise discriminate against ex-convicts in employment, adding that those which violate the regulations will be prosecuted. According to Zhang, China has established a unified and coordinated system in creating jobs for ex-convicts, including job- training and unemployment insurance provided for them. China has already achieved marked results in this endeavor, said the official. On average, over 90 percent of the ex-convicts in Beijing are employed every year. In the cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou, the employment rates of ex-convicts are 64 percent and 72 percent respectively.
