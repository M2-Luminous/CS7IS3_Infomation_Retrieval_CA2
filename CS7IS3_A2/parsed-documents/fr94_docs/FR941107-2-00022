FR941107-2-00022 FR941107-2-00007 In each of the two proceedings, seven companies indicated that they were related to companies that had provided information as to whether or not they had made U.S. sales. Fifteen companies in the pure magnesium proceeding and 14 companies in the alloy magnesium proceeding provided either no response or an inadequate response. The Department received no response from the following 13 companies in both proceedings: Derek Raphael & Co., Ltd.; Marco Trading; Wogen Group Ltd.; Alex; Mages; and 8 companies that cannot be named in this notice because their identities are deemed business proprietary information. We have designated these 8 companies as companies ``A'' through ``H'' in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice, below. We will, however, identify them to the Customs Service for enforcement of these determinations. Additionally, both F&S (pure only) and W&O Bergmann (both pure and alloy) indicated that they had made POI sales of subject merchandise to the United States, but otherwise ignored our requests for information. Finally, surveys sent to six companies were returned as undeliverable. On August 8, 1994, the Department postponed its preliminary determinations until October 27, 1994 (59 FR 42200, August 17, 1994). On August 10, 1994, the Department provided interested parties with the opportunity to submit published, publicly-available information for the Department to consider when valuing the factor inputs. Petitioners and respondents submitted information on September 7, 1994. From July through October 1994, the Department received responses to questionnaire sections A and C for pure magnesium from AIOC, Gerald Metals, HDM, Interlink, MG Metals, Razno and SMW. (Note that SMW's trial sale of pure magnesium were not considered by the Department because these sales represent an insignificant portion of the total volume of U.S. sales. Therefore, for the preliminary determination, the Department has not considered SMW to be an exporter of pure magnesium and did not calculate a margin for SMW's trial sales of pure magnesium.) For alloy magnesium the Department received responses to Sections A and C from Gerald Metals and SMW. The Department received responses to sections A and D from the following manufacturers: Berezniki Titanium and Magnesium Works (Avisma) and SMW. On September 12, 1994, Avisma and SMW requested that the Russian Federation be reclassified as a market economy country. They also contended that, if the Department did not revoke the Russian Federation's non-market economy (NME) designation, the Department should determine that the magnesium industry in the Russian Federation is a market-oriented industry (MOI). (See the ``Foreign Market Value'' section of this notice, below.) During September and October 1994, the Department requested clarifications of the submitted questionnaire responses from AIOC, Avisma, Gerald Metals, HDM, Interlink, MG, Razno, and SMW. Avisma, Interlink, MG, Razno, and SMW submitted additional response information. Gerald Metals' and HDM's responses to this supplemental information request are not due until after the deadline for these preliminary determinations. On October 10, 1994, petitioners alleged that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of alloy magnesium from the Russian Federation. The Department accepted this allegation and requested that Gerald Metals and SMW provide historical information on shipments of alloy magnesium. Postponement of Final Determinations Pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act, on October 24, 1994, Gerald Metals, a reseller accounting for a significant proportion of the merchandise in these proceedings, requested that, in the event of affirmative preliminary determinations in these investigations, the Department postpone the final determinations to 135 days after the date of publication of the affirmative preliminary determinations. Avisma and SMW, producers accounting for a significant proportion of merchandise in these proceedings, made a similar request on October 27, 1994. Therefore, we are postponing the final determinations until the 135th day after the publication of this notice in the Federal Register .
