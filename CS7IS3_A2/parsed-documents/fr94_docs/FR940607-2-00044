SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) published on May 16, 1994 (59 FR 25532) contained two errors that are being corrected in this notice. The first correction concerns the amount of funding available. The total amount listed as available, $14,881,000, is corrected to read $18,481,000. The additional $3.6 million reflects the determination that $2 million to be used for the second year of two-year FY 1993 Private Enforcement Initiative awards, and $1.6 million to be used for the second year of two-year FY 1993 Fair Housing Organizations Initiative awards, will be funded out of FY 1995 funds. This is because the second year of funding is subject to not only the availability of funds, but to an annual performance review. The amounts of funding under these two Initiatives are corrected accordingly. In addition, the sequence of eligible activities under the Private Enforcement Initiative is also corrected. Accordingly, the following corrections are made in FR Doc. 94&hyph;11762 to the NOFA titled, ``NOFA for Fair Housing Initiatives Program; FY 1994 Competitive Solicitation'', published on May 16, 1994 (59 FR 25532): 1.

In the body of this document is information concerning the purpose of the NOFA, eligibility, available amounts, selection criteria, how to apply for funding, and how selections will be made. 2.
