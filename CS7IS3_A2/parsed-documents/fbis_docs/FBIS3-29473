He believes it is settled and should not be brought up again. He also said that if Indonesia made offensive moves, as Portugal has done, it would create the impression that the East Timor problem was important when, in fact, the problem is a trivial one. He clarified that Indonesia has adopted a wait-and-see attitude and only issues statements as necessary. Meanwhile, several offensive actions have been carried out against Indonesia with regard to its foreign policy and the East Timor problem, including the production of a book, criticisms against Indonesia, and the friendly [as heard] visit to Dili by a European Parliament delegation.
