FBIS4-57343 "drlat096_m_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-096 Daily Report 16 May 1994 Brazil Defeated PMDB Candidate Supports Lula Defeated PMDB Candidate Supports Lula PY1605224294 Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 16 May 94 p 7 PY1605224294 Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO Portuguese BFN [Text] Curitiba -- In the wake of his defeat at the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] primaries, former Parana Governor Roberto Requiao yesterday announced that he will endorse Workers Party [PT] candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. Requiao said he is convinced Lula will win the elections in the first round. Requiao conceded defeat to Quercia yesterday morning in a speech he delivered before PMDB delegates at the Legislative Assembly in Curitiba. Requiao said: Lula will win because the other parties are increasingly demoralized. At the PMDB convention, we run the risk of internally promoting the rehabilitation of Deputies Genabaldo Correa, Ibsen Pinheiro, and Manuel Moreira, who were charged by the Budget CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee]. Without directly attacking Quercia, Requiao reaffirmed that he will not participate in the PMDB campaign. Requiao said: I said I would do without with Quercia's support for my candidacy and I hope he will do the same. I support Lula. No one can prevent me from seeking a Senate seat. Requiao made it clear that he will not hold the PMDB rank and file responsible for the outcome of the elections. Requiao said: PMDB members cannot be held responsible; that lies with the slow, weak leaders who adopted an ostrich-like policy in Congress by sticking their heads in the sand. He stated that he will continue within the PMDB.
