He added that these officials, who were members of the [Joint] Liaison Committee with Israel which observes security in the autonomy areas of Jericho and the Gaza Strip, were not authorized to sign. After seven tense hours, 287 prisoners were handed over to the Palestinian police in Jericho last week. Israel says that the Cairo agreement on autonomy allows it to insist that the prisoners handed over to the Palestinians should remain in the autonomy areas. Faysal al-Husayni, the most senior PLO official in the West Bank, has stated that the person who signed the agreement had no authority to sign, and that is why a decision was issued to replace the Palestinian Security Committee with another committee. Al-Husayni left for Jordan yesterday, Tuesday, and is expected to travel to Tunis for a meeting with 'Arafat. [passage omitted]
