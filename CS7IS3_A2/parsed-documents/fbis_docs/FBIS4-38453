The national holiday will be marked on May 28. In the opinion of the Azeri state head, there is much in common between today and a period from 1918 through 1920, the time of the first Azeri Democratic Republic. "Same as in 1918-1920, Azerbaijan is under powerful pressure of outer forces, its territory has been subjected to an aggression, complicated political processes are underway to weaken statehood," said Aliyev. Many events of the Azeri history, including the Soviet period, should have an objective estimation, said the president. In his opinion, the Soviet period was a "significant historical time for Azerbaijan which did not lose its statehood being part of the Soviet Union and losing its independence". The republic managed to create a huge economic, cultural, social and intellectual potential. The current path taken by Azerbaijan aims to build an independent, democratic and law-governed state to guarantee all rights and freedoms of citizens, their equality regardless nationality or religion, said Aliyev. The republic remains adherent to the market reforms which aim to ensure high living standards of the population. In the foreign political sphere Azerbaijan stands for equal mutually beneficial relations with all states. Speaking of the Armenian-Azeri conflict, the president stressed that Azerbaijan wants a peaceful settlement within the framework of international organizations and in cooperation with the leading nations, including Russia. At the same time, Azeri conditions remain unchanged -- provision of territorial integrity and inviolability of Azeri borders, liberation of all the occupied lands of Azerbaijan, and the return of refugees to places of their permanent residence. The problem can be solved on condition of observation of these fundamental principles. The president stressed the intention to continue the peace talks, but said that the national army should be ready to protect the Azeri borders and territory.
