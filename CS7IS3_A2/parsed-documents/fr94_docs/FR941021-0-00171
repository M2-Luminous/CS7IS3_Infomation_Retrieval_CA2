FR941021-0-00171 FR941021-0-00022 127. Several MSS applicants also state that, to afford new MSS systems flexibility in how they protect ARNS/RNSS, the Commission should modify proposed rule §25.213(c)(1), which, in addition to the uplink limits contained in RR 731F, requires all MSS operations in the 1.6 GHz band to be coordinated with systems operating pursuant to RR 732. Motorola argues that rules embodied in the International Radio Regulations are adequate for ensuring coordination with and protection of other services. 162 Constellation contends that footnote RR 731E establishes the only enforceable interference criteria ( i.e., a maximum e.i.r.p. density of ^15 dB (W/4kHz) from MSS transmitters) that can be incorporated into the Commission's rules at this time. Motorola, in contrast, suggests that the e.i.r.p. value set forth in §25.213(c)(1) be interpreted as a coordination trigger rather than an absolute limit. 163 LQP states that the proposed rule requires MSS systems to protect GLONASS beyond the limits specified in RR 731E. 164 162 Motorola Reply Comments at 47. 163 Motorola Comments at 55. 164 LQP Comments at 66&hyph;67. 128. We do not believe it is necessary to protect GLONASS operations beyond the provisions of RR 731E and the obligation to coordinate MSS systems under current International Telecommunications Union (ITU) procedures. RR 731E states clearly that MSS stations shall not cause interference to, nor claim protection from ARNS stations operating in accordance with RR 732. In addition, under ITU Resolution 46, Big LEO licensees would be subject to whatever limits or conditions agreed upon during the coordination process. GLONASS would likely be part of the coordination negotiations. Accordingly, we reject the aviation community's requests that additional limits be placed on MSS operations pending a GLONASS move, particularly absent definitive technical characteristics and requirements of a future GNSS system, and a definitive statement as to GLONASS's role in the GNSS. 165 Further, imposing additional constraints on Big LEO use of the 1610&hyph;1616 MHz band could jeopardize the applicants' ability to implement their systems. This could deprive the United States and those countries who choose to participate in offering services the potential benefits that Big LEOs could bring. Conversely, we do not believe the limits in RR 731E should be relaxed, as Motorola suggests. It is clear ^15 dB(W/4kHz) is a limit and not a threshold for coordination. Therefore, we adopt the e.i.r.p. limits embodied in RR 731E in Section 25.213(c)(1) with the requirement that coordination of MSS mobile earth terminals must be undertaken according to the provisions of Resolution 46 (WARC&hyph;92). 165 LQP notes that the FAA has suggested that it is still studying how GLONASS ``best fits'' a GNSS. LQP Reply at 62. 129. We also adopt our proposed rule that prohibits operation of Big LEO terminals on-board civil aircraft unless the terminal has a direct connection to the aircraft's Cabin Communication System. However, we agree with Constellation and others that this is a transceiver operating provision and is not necessarily a sharing requirement. Therefore, since this provision is contained in §25.136(a) of our rules, it need not be repeated in §25.213. Consequently, we do not adopt proposed rule §25.213(c)(2) and refer licensees to §25.136(a). b. Out-of-band interference to ARNS/RNSS in the 1559&hyph;1610 MHz band. 130. Protection of GPS from out-of-band emissions from primary uplinks in the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band. The Committee concluded that out-of-band emissions by MSS uplinks in the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band could potentially interfere with GPS operations near 1575 MHz. The Committee found, however, that sharing is possible if appropriate limits are put on out-of-band emissions from MSS user transceivers. 166 The Committee recommended, and we proposed, that MSS user transceivers limit out-of-band emissions (for broadband noise emissions) so as not to exceed an e.i.r.p. density of ^70 dBW/1MHz averaged over any 20 millisecond (ms) period in any portion of the 1574.397&hyph;1576.443 MHz band. For any discrete spurious emissions in the same band ( i.e., bandwidth less than 600 Hz), the user transceiver e.i.r.p. density is not to exceed ^80 dbW. 167 166 See Committee Report, note 23, supra, at para. 5.2.2.7. 167 See proposed §25.213(b).
