However, the extent to which this process of alliance can go is still questionable. In certain circumstances, Bela Csepe, former head of the parliamentary group of the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], can envisage a fusion with the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. However, KDNP Deputy Chairman Laszlo Varga opposes the idea. We asked KDNP Deputy Chairman Szilagyi Terezia Csaszar first about this controversy. [Szilagyi] The national, Christian-conservative parties will find it extremely difficult to obtain results in the local government elections separately. These parties should therefore seriously consider the possibility of having common candidates or dividing up the mandates among themselves, as the KDNP and the MDF did in 1990. I do not yet regard fusion as a current issue. In the long run, however, the right wing should also create a people's party-grouping which, in my opinion, starting from the integrating force of the KDNP, will also be able to bring the other three similar parties into a close alliance or even a political union. [Jezso] You mentioned three parties. [Szilagyi] In addition to the MDF and the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP], I also mean here the United Smallholders Party. [Jezso] You are the KDNP deputy chairman in charge of organizational matters. In your view, what should the organizational setup of the new KDNP be like? [Szilagyi] We must renew the party's statute, as well as its organizational and operational rules. The party members' obligations, sphere of authority, and their calling to account are not yet clearly outlined. This is why there was no discipline in the party. I think it is useless to renew the ideological debates, because the KDNP has firm and deep spiritual and moral roots. I would like our party to become a well-organized, modern, European people's party, a party open to social issues. [Jezso] In a recent television program, Laszlo Kover, the acting parliamentary group head of the Federation of Young Democrats, said regarding the possibility of a common stand of the four opposition parties that this should be limited to a common solution of technical issues. In his view, an opposition coalition would curtail precisely the variety of opposition possibilities and, therefore, he does not think this is a desirable way. What is your opinion? [Szilagyi] Our party has repeatedly declared that it would like to work as a constructive opposition party. I see opportunities for the four opposition parties to create a uniform stand on specific issues. Otherwise, the opposition will have a very tough time alongside a two-thirds coalition majority.
