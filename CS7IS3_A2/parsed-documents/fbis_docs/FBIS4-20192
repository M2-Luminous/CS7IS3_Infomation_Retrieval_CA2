Venizelos said that this letter reminds him of the letter from Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi that asked the United Nations to condemn Greece as a terrorist state because of the incident at Ano Episkopi and its friendship with the Serbs. The spokesman added that, in view of the 3 May meeting in Zurich between Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Serreqi, the Greek Government wants to be cautious about its statements since Greek positions are understood by the international community.
