FR941031-2-00110 FR941031-2-00080 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration [Docket No. 27955] Policy for Letter of Intent Approvals Under the Airport Improvement Program AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of policy; request for comments. SUMMARY: The FAA is clarifying its policies on reviewing and analyzing requests for Letters of Intent (LOIs) under the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) or successor programs. The FAA will consider three factors in reviewing requests for LOIs: the project's effect on overall national air transportation system capacity; project benefit and cost; and the airport sponsor's financial commitment, including project timing. The FAA also solicits comments on the new policy. Following review of the comments, the FAA may revise this policy. DATES: The comment closing date is November 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed or delivered in duplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Airport Planning and Programming, Attn: Mr. Stan Lou (APP&hyph;520), room 614, 800 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20591. Comments must be marked: Policy for Letter of Intent Approvals Under Airport Improvement Program. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: Contact Stan Lou, FAA, Programming Branch, APP&hyph;520, room 614, 800 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20591, telephone (202) 267&hyph;8809. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for Comments Comments are invited on this notice of policy and all communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered by the FAA. FAA may subsequently issue a change to this policy after considering the comments. Background In 1987, legislation was enacted authorizing the issuance of LOI's. The Codification of Certain U.S. Transportation Laws as Title 49, United States Code, Public Law No. 103&hyph;272, (July 5, 1994), section 47110(e)(2)(C) states: The provisions of this subsection applies to a project the Secretary decides will enhance system-wide airport capacity significantly and meets the criteria of section 47115(d) of this title. Section 47115(d) states: In selecting a project for a grant to preserve and enhance capacity as described in subsection (c)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall consider_(1) the effect the project will have on the overall national air transportation system capacity; (2) the project benefit and cost; and (3) the financial commitment from non-United States Government sources to preserve or enhance airport capacity. General The FAA is authorized to issue an LOI for certain airport development projects when current obligating authority is not timely or adequate to meet a sponsor's desired timing for a project. Under this provision, a sponsor may notify the FAA of an intention to carry out a project without Federal funds and request that the FAA issue an LOI. The FAA evaluates the proposal and, if approved, issues a letter stating that reimbursement will be made according to a given schedule, as funds become available. A sponsor who has received an LOI, therefore, may proceed with a project without waiting for an AIP grant, is assured that all allowable costs related to the approved project remain eligible for reimbursement, and may receive more favorable financing to pay related costs on the basis of announced Federal support for the project. Discussion Since FY 1987, the FAA has issued 48 LOI's (43 at primary airports and 5 at reliever airports). The total payments contemplated in these LOI's total nearly $2 billion ($1.5 billion of discretionary and $0.5 billion of entitlements). Of this, $0.9 billion has been granted to airports. The balance of $1.1 billion would be granted to airports through the year 2005. These LOIs include $0.8 billion discretionary and $0.3 billion entitlements. The following chart summarizes this information.
