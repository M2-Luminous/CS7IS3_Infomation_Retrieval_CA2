FR940114-2-00057 FR940114-2-00032 FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION Determination of Insufficiency of Assets To Satisfy All Claims of Certain Financial Institutions in Receivership AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In accordance with the authorities contained in 12 U.S.C. 1821(c), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was duly appointed receiver for each of the financial institutions specified in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION . The FDIC has determined that the proceeds which can be realized from the liquidation of the assets of these receivership estates are insufficient to satisfy all classes of claims, asserted or unasserted against the receivership estate. Therefore, upon satisfaction of secured claims, depositor claims and claims which have priority over depositors under applicable state law, no amount will remain or will be recovered sufficient to allow a dividend, distribution or payment to any other creditor and therefore the claim of any such creditor is worthless.
