The council's main objective is to review the 1976 "National Defense Program Outline [NDPO]," Japan's defense policy guideline, for the first time in 18 years. To compile a new guideline of national defense in the post-Cold War period, it is necessary to promote nationwide debates. The council may become the starting point of public debates. To say nothing of the international situation, the Hosokawa administration's future is becoming uncertain. Under such circumstances, it is questionable if the prime minister can afford to really devote himself to this issue. Yet, review of the NDPO has been a major pending issue since the conclusion of the Cold War five years ago. However, the issue has been left untouched by two Liberal Democratic Party prime ministers -- Toshiki Kaifu and Kiichi Miyazawa. So, we would like to frankly welcome Prime Minister Hosokawa's initiative. Nine council members, led by Asahi Breweries Chairman Kotaro Higuchi, are expected to promote wide-ranging discussions. They should provide answers on questions on such subjects as Japan's perception of the post-Cold War period, a new direction for security policy and the Self-Defense Forces' [SDF] position, and roles in UN peace activities as well as the defense alliance with the United States. The council should deal with varied and deep questions. If the final report should be prepared "by summer," as Prime Minister Hosokawa once noted, the members would have to carry on very intensive debates. Meanwhile, we are anxious about the Defense Agency's [DA] attitude on this issue. From the beginning, the agency has been voicing its frustration with Prime Minister's decision to advance the review of the NDPO by a year. Also, the agency is wary of the prime minister's remarks on possibilities of arms reduction. To reflect its opinions in the council, the DA has established a special study group. Also, the agency reportedly has great expectations for former Joint Staff Council Chairman Hajime Sakuma's participation in the Defense Policy Council. It is natural that the defense authorities have an interest in debates on the foundation of the nation's defense policy, and it is necessary for them to offer opinions as experts. However, the policy review would lose its significance if they take actions to prevent any scaledown of the SDF. Therefore, the council must promote discussions from a free standpoint. Another concern is the fact that some defense officials still say the policy review is unnecessary. They say that the NDPO is appropriate even in the post-Cold War period because it was compiled during detente between the United States and the Soviet Union, and that it is unnecessary to revise its basic concept of "the minimum defense force in peace." The NDPO's basic concept is also called "basic defense concept." This aims at maintaining the capability to conduct adequate security missions and cope with limited and small-scale invasion without support from foreign forces. However, we should not forget the "basic" defense force is designed to prepare for "smooth expansion" in case of emergency. In other words, the basic concept has no consideration for the limitation of defense buildup or rationalization of effective strength. In quantity, Japan's defense force has already reached the level advocated in the NDPO. Defense expenditures are currently emphasizing improvement of the SDF's equipment quality. Why do we have to keep building up defense forces for "exclusively defense only" while possibilities of direct invasion against Japan have become much lower? The defense policy review should start with this question. There are great gaps among coalition parties concerning the concept of national defense, the SDF's legal position, and the Japan-U.S. alliance. The Defense Policy Council must not be used as a tool for a power struggle among them.
