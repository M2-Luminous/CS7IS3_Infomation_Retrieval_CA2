FR940127-1-00005 FR940127-1-00003 Discussion On March 1, 1989, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued telegraphic airworthiness directive (AD) T89&hyph;05&hyph;52, applicable to Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines, which requires repetitive ultrasonic inspections for cracks in the combustion chamber outer case (CCOC). In addition, that telegraphic AD allowed operators who did not have ultrasonic inspection capability to perform visual inspections and fluorescent magnetic penetrant inspections (FMPI) of CCOC's. That action was prompted by reports of two CCOC's, both part number (P/N) 796761, which were found in service with severe cracking and distress at the weld which joins the forward case detail to the rear flange detail. These cracks initiated from an area of incomplete weld created during the manufacturing process and were not detected during the final inspection process. Another CCOC, P/N 806675, is manufactured using a similar process and has the same potential for incomplete welds, but to date have not been found cracked. That condition, if not corrected, could result in rupture of the CCOC, which could result in fire, engine cowl release, or aircraft damage. Since the issuance of that telegraphic AD, the FAA has received reports that most operators now have the capability to perform ultrasonic inspections, which provides a more definitive means of discovering cracks than either visual inspections or FMPI. In telegraphic AD T89&hyph;05&hyph;52, reinspection of all CCOC's is required, including reinspection of those CCOC's that exhibited minimal ultrasonic indications during initial inspection. The FAA has determined analytically that CCOC's that exhibit maximum signal amplitudes of less than 40 percent are not life limited at the defined weld area. Therefore, CCOC's that meet this signal criteria for two consecutive ultrasonic inspections may be marked with a new P/N, provided the second ultrasonic inspection is accomplished at least 2,500 cycles in service (CIS) after the first inspection and the second inspection is performed in accordance with Appendix C of PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 5842, Revision 3, dated October 10, 1990. Finally, the FAA has determined that certain CCOC's, P/N 806675, were ultrasonically inspected by PW during the manufacturing process, and therefore do not need to be inspected again until they are accessible in the shop. The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of PW ASB No. 5842, Revision 3, dated October 10, 1990, that describes procedures for repetitive ultrasonic inspections of CCOC's for cracks. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other engines of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede telegraphic AD T89&hyph;05&hyph;52 to require repetitive ultrasonic inspections of CCOC's for cracks. The proposed AD would also allow CCOC's that meet certain signal criteria for two consecutive ultrasonic inspections to be marked with a new P/N. Once remarked, those CCOC's would not need to meet the repetitive ultrasonic inspection requirements of this AD. Finally, the proposed AD would require ultrasonic inspections on certain CCOC's, P/N 806675, identified by serial number, that were ultrasonically inspected by PW during the manufacturing process, when they are accessible in the shop. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. The FAA estimates that 1,000 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $110,000. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
