Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] Chairman Vladimir Meciar, who did not exercise his mandate as a deputy in view of holding the post of Slovak prime minister, is likely to be the first to return to the parliamentary benches. He will replace Anna Korduliakova from Cadca, who, together with deputy Milan Mrenko, set up the HZDS National Social Democratic Faction. The Cadca HZDS District Presidium did not accept this initiative. [Justice Minister] Katarina Tothova, [Labor and Social Affairs Minister] Olga Keltosova, [Deputy Prime Minister] Jozef Prokes, and [Deputy Prime Minister] Marian Andel also did not exercise their mandates as deputies while executing their [government] posts. Vladimir Mikulka from Ruzomberok, Blazena Pavlovicova from Skalica, Miroslav Rybansky from Piestany, and Milan Janicina from Bratislava, who subsequently joined Ludovit Cernak's National Democratic Club, had been co-opted into the NRSR in their stead. At the start of the 10th electoral term [in June 1992], the HZDS had 74 deputies in the NRSR, the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] 29, the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] 18, the Slovak National Party [SNS] 15, and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement/Coexistence [MKDH/Coexistence] coalition 14. In the course of parliament's 10th electoral term, 19 deputies have left the HZDS Deputies' Club, one has left the SDL Deputies' Club, and seven have left the SNS Deputies' Club. The KDH and MKDH/Coexistence clubs have remained unchanged. Until the NRSR meeting started, the correlation of votes between the HZDS/SNS government coalition on the one hand and opposition parties and independent deputies on the other was 74:76. In the course of the 27th NRSR meeting, Imrich Mori announced that he was leaving the HZDS, and eight signatories of the Alternative of Political Realism [platform within the HZDS] announced that they were leaving the HZDS Deputies' Club. This new balance of forces apparently decided on the passage of the no-confidence vote in the prime minister. After the [former] Slovak Government members regain their mandates as NRSR deputies, the HZDS will have 52 seats in parliament and the SNS nine. The previously two independent deputies--Ivan Hudec and Peter Brnak--have been joined by others, following the departures from the HZDS and the SNS. Hence, the correlation of votes should be 65:85 in favor of independent deputies and political parties that will try, in the coming days, to form a government with a limited term of office, until early parliamentary elections.
