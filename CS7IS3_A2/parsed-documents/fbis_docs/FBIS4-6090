FBIS4-6090 "dreas074__a94026" FBIS-EAS-94-074-A Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Chip Makers To Boost Microcontroller Production Chip Makers To Boost Microcontroller Production OW1704145494 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 17 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1704145494 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] All major semiconductor makers will increase their production of microcontrollers for home electric appliances because there is a sign that the slump in sales of home electric appliances in Japan has hit bottom. While Toshiba Corporation plans to increase its monthly production of microcontrollers -- especially 8-bit products for which demand is high in the home appliance industry -- by 20 percent by September, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation plans to increase monthly production by 14 percent. The production of microcontrollers is a leading indicator for predicting shipments of home electric appliances three or six months ahead. Their plans to increase production are noteworthy because they indicate that semiconductor makers have concluded that business in the home appliance industry will be on the full-fledged track for recovery as early as this fall. Toshiba is currently producing a total of 15 million units of 4- bit, 8-bit, and 16-bit microcontrollers monthly at both its Oita Plant (located in Oita City) and its subsidiary Iwate Toshiba Electronics (located in Kitakami City, with Yasuhiro Sumitomo as its president). By September it plans to increase production by 3 million units to a total of 18 million units. Of the 3 million units, 2 million units are 8-bit microcontrollers. The company will shift some production lines for 4-bit microcontrollers at Oita Plant to Iwate company to increase production of 8-bit microcontrollers at the Oita Plant. Most of the 8-bit microcontrollers will be exported to subsidiaries of Japanese home appliance makers in Southeast Asia. This is because the subsidiaries have increased their production "due to active demand for home electric appliances for export to the United States, as well as due to an increase in exports to Japan" (according to Toshiba). Mitsubishi is producing a total of 22 million microcontrollers -- centering on 4-bit and 8-bit products -- monthly both at Kumamoto Corporation (located in Nishigoshi-machi, Kumamoto Prefecture) and its Saijo plant (located in Saijo City, Ehime Prefecture). It will increase production from the current 22 million units to 25 million units. Some production lines for memory products at the Saijo Plant will be diverted for microcontroller lines. NEC Corporation also plans to increase its monthly production of microcontrollers by 10 percent by September from the present 34 million units to 37.5 million units. While Hitachi Ltd. will increase production by 25 percent this summer from 16 million units to 20 million units, Fujitsu Ltd. will increase production by 11 percent by the end of this year from 9 million units to 10 million units. On the home electric appliance market, the domestic shipment of VTR's [video tape recorders] in February registered an increase over the same period of the previous year for the fourth month in a row. Moreover, there is a sharp increase in imports of television sets and VTR's from Southeast Asia in response to a growing demand among consumers for low price products.
