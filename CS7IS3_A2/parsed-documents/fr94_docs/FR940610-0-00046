Background On November 2, 1992, the IRS published in the Federal Register proposed amendments to the income tax regulations (26 CFR part 1) under sections 170, 642, 664, and 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), and to the estate and gift tax regulations (26 CFR part 20 and part 25) under sections 2031, 2512, and 7520 of the Code. Conforming changes were proposed for regulations under other sections of the Code. On February 3, 1993, the IRS published in the Federal Register certain corrections to the proposed regulations. This project finalizes those amendments. Written comments responding to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking were received. No public hearing was requested, and none was held. After consideration of all of the comments received regarding the proposed regulations, those amendments are adopted by this Treasury decision with revisions in response to those comments. A summary of the principal comments received and revisions made in the final regulations in response to those comments is provided below. Explanation of Provisions The notice of proposed rulemaking included estate tax regulations that described the implementation of the new valuation standard, including an explanation of the general effective date of May 1, 1989 (§20.7520&hyph;1), an explanation of the special elections for charitable interests (§20.7520&hyph;2), a listing of Code provisions that are not subject to section 7520 (§20.7520&hyph;3), and a description of transitional rules for income, estate, and gift tax valuations (§20.7520&hyph;4). In the final regulations, the substance of §§20.7520&hyph;1 through 20.7520&hyph;4 has been incorporated into analogous provisions for the Income Tax Regulations (§§1.7520&hyph;1 through 1.7520&hyph;4) and the Gift Tax Regulations (§§25.7520&hyph;1 through 25.7520&hyph;4).
