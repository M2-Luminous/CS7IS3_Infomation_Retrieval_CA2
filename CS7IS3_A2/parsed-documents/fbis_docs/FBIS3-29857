A cabinet reshuffle specifically designed to remove certain cabinet ministers would shake the foundation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet, Ouchi told a news conference. He was alluding to the campaign by Hosokawa, Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa and others in the ruling coalition to get rid of Takemura, the government's top spokesman. The premier and the others have differed with Takemura over Hosokawa's plan to introduce a so-called "national welfare tax" to replace the consumption tax, the future of Japanese politics and other key issues, political sources say. The Social Democratic Party, the largest force in the seven-party coalition government, has also expressed reservations about an early reshuffling of the cabinet, which Hosokawa and his backers say may come later this month.
