The narcotic and psychotropic substances destroyed included heroin, mandrax, hashish, opium and ganja. The drugs were destroyed after following the special procedure laid down by the NDPS [expansion not given] Act. It has to be followed since the courts have as yet not delivered judgment in the various cases filed by the police. To preserve the evidence, representative samples and photographs of the drug seized are taken in the presence of metropolitan magistrate. The specially-constituted NDPS courts have to be then approached for permission to destroy the drugs. The Act provides for their pre-trial destruction since there is always a fear that they might be stolen or substituted. Besides, a lot of space has to be provided for storage.
