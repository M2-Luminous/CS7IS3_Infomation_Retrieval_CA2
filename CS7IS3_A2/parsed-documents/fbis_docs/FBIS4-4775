Even though the United States plans to deploy Patriot missiles to the U.S. Forces stationed in the ROK in April, questions are being raised regarding the capability of effectively destroying North Korea's ground-to-ground missiles. As if he had sensed the anxiety, Minister of National Defense Yi Pyong-tae gave a relatively detailed explanation on countermeasures against a Scud and Nodong No. 1 attack to the Standing Committee of the National Assembly on 23 March. Minister Yi explained that once the Scud is launched, its camouflaged camp would be exposed. It would take more than two and a half hours to move to another camp and prepare for a second launching. Therefore, the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces could locate the launcher through its surveillance system and immediately attack the launcher with Air Force fire power, special combat units, and guided missiles. Minister Yi admitted there is a limit to this strategy because after the first Scud or Nodong No. 1 is launched, only a passive defense using the Patriot is possible and a preemptive attack is not possible. The Scud launcher loaded on a big vehicle must be moved to another place once it launches a missile to prevent an attack by its opponent. Therefore, the only way for the ROK and U.S. Forces to repulse the first Scud attack is to identify its location using the U.S. ultra-red ray detective intelligence satellite right after the launching and intercept the missile with a Patriot. After the first Scud launching, the hide-and-seek game between the Scud launcher vehicle and the ROK-U.S. Combined Force's Scud-hunting vehicle begins. While the Scud launcher is moved and preparing for the second attack, the ROK-U.S. Forces will begin the search using the U.S. intelligence satellite and various kinds of aerial surveillance devices, including the E8 and E3C, which are able to detect the movement of ground vehicles from the air. The weakest point of the Scud is that it requires more than two and a half hours to refuel and prepare for the second launching. Military officials believe that considering the ROK-U.S. Forces' intelligence capability, it will be possible to discover the launcher before the second launching. It is easy to destroy the Scud launcher once it is discovered. An air attack by fighter-bombers and Apache helicopters, or bombing by infiltrated special units are possible. The "Scud hunting system" was designed during the Gulf war in 1991. The United States had overlooked the threat of Iraqi Scuds and later had difficulties destroying them after civilian damage had increased. Considering North Korea's hilly terrain, which provides more cover than deserts, most specialists view that the Scud hunting will be more difficult than during the Gulf war. Military officials stressed that although the Scud and Nodong No. 1 pose a great threat, militarily, they are less a threat than multiple rockets and fighter-bombers. The Scud has low accuracy -- sometimes it lands 1 km away from the target -- and its warhead weighs only 660 kg -- less than the total weight of bombs carried by one average fighter-bomber. Considering that ground-to-ground missiles such as the Scud had substantial effect in actual combat, including the psychological effect by attacks on big cities, some military officials pointed out that better full-scale countermeasures against the Scud should be developed in case North Korea attacks Seoul.
