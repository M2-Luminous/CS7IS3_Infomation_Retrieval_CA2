"I have already obtained the government's backing to my idea of slightly correcting the functions of the Economics Ministry," the minister said. In Shokhin's opinion, the Economics Ministry should be turned into a federal body, which would analyse all the economic, social, and political aspects of the reforms, should issue recommendations to other agencies, to the government, and even to the president, should advise them on the actions that should be taken at the given juncture. "The ministry should discharge less functions linked with the duties of the former 'State Planning Committee', that is with the distribution of resources," Shokhin stressed. However, he noted that for the time being it would be necessary to combine both functions and to draw up proposals for the government's crediting commission. As to relations with the International Monetary Fund, the minister said: "We would like to get from it not standard recommendations on financial stabilisation, but a programme drawn up on the basis of concrete scenarios and versions, taking into account the actual state of the Russian economy".
