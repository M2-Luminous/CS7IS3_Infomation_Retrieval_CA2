China has its own opinion and we live according to our own opinion." [Correspondent] What do you think about the IAEA adopting the resolution? [Yun Ho-chin] We are finished with the IAEA. We cannot accept the IAEA's conduct in which it is distorting the truth in accordance with the direction and theory of the United States. [Correspondent] Then will you withdraw from the IAEA? [Yun] No. However, the resolution has the same meaning as telling us to withdraw. [Correspondent] What will happen if you do not receive any technological assistance? [Yun] In reality, it has been suspended since last year. If an objective third party studies and assesses our proposal on the discharge and measurement of the fuel rods, all the technological problems will be solved. [Correspondent] What will you do now? [Yun] We will take strong countermeasures. If someone tries to kill us we must defend ourselves. [Correspondent] What do you mean by a strong countermeasure? [Yun] That will be decided upon by Pyongyang. [Correspondent] Will you reprocess plutonium in three months time from the replaced fuel rods? [Yun] I am not in the position to talk about this matter, but if necessary it will be carried out. Even if reprocessing work is carried out, we will not notify the IAEA [chaechorirul hadorado iaeae tongbohal gosunopta].
