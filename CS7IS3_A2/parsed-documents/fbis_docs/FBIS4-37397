Several rockets slammed into the Al-Qahirah and al-Mansurah areas in the north of the city and another six hit nearby hillsides, said injured civilians at Al-Jumhuriyah hospital. The northern and southern forces were also trading artillery fire along the war fronts some 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Aden, while shells hit the city airport throwing up clouds of dust and sand. Hospital officials said almost 90 people have been killed since northern forces loyal to President 'Ali Abdallah Salih began a systematic bombardment of this southern bastion on Thursday. Terrified townspeople have said they are praying for their lives, as there are few places in bomb shelters for the city's 500,000 inhabitants. Southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid broadcast an appeal on television late Monday for the United Nations, the Arab League and the rest of the international community to "stop the savage bombardments on Aden and its vital installations, which have killed and wounded hundreds". He also asked Arab and friendly countries to recognise the breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic (YDR), declared by the south on May 21 but not yet recognised by any country. Al-Bid's appeal followed the failure of UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to broker a ceasefire in the war. Brahimi left Cairo on Monday after the collapse of talks with northern and southern delegations there on Sunday. Al-Bid pleaded for a "total (northern) retreat from the international frontiers of the YDR and demanded "damages from the Sanaa regime for destruction caused by its aggression". He also asked for direct international food and medical aid for people living in parts of south Yemen occupied by northern troops. The southern chief, who is based in the eastern port of al-Mukalla, also published a decree on Tuesday announcing compensation for families of the victims. Relatives of those killed would receive 50,000 riyals while wounded would be given 25,000. A dollar is officially worth 12 riyals, but trades on the black market at almost 80 riyals. War broke out between northern and southern forces on May 5 after four years of troubled union between the former North and South Yemens.
