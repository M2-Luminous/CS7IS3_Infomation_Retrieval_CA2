The current National People's Congress (NPC) is the most rudderless since the messy sessions of the Cultural Revolution, when the Great Helmsman went berserk. Instead of sketching a bold tableau for the Asia-Pacific Century cadres addressing the rubber stamp parliament have displayed a talent for obfuscation, doublespeak and trompe-l'oeil. President Jiang Zemin and Executive Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji made much of the fact that reform had reached "the critical stage of breaching the fortresses". However, reports delivered to the Congress by leaders including Premier Li Peng had more to do with the high-wire act of "striking a balance between reform, development and stability". This is a tattered euphemism for soft-pedalling market reform to keep the workers and farmers from hitting the streets. A central plank of Mr Li's strategy for re-imposing central -- particularly fiscal --- discipline on the nation is to fix a growth rate of nine per cent for 1994. Both the premier and Mr Jiang, however, have qualified themselves by pointing out there is some leeway in this, particularly for regions whose speedy growth is anchored upon rising productivity. As State Planning Minister Chen Jinhua put it: "The national economy must at the same time maintain the trend of fast-paced growth and pay attention to the possibility of the blind pursuit of an excessively high speed." Mr Li's opinion on price reform -- deemed the sine qua non for liberalisation -- is a study in calculated ambiguity. "Defreezing prices does not mean doing away with macro-level adjustments and controls," said the premier, who last week slapped price controls back on 20 "essential commodities". Provincial leaders attending the Congress have been speaking with forked tongues. Former party chief of Jiangsu Shen Daren, who lost his job last autumn for sabotaging Mr Zhu's austerity programme, surprised observers by the fervency of his protestation of loyalty. "Jiangsu will resolutely safeguard the authority of the Party Centre everything (in the province) will be done from the point of view of the overall situation of the country," Mr Shen said. Apparently invoking the "whateverism" of former party chairman Hua Guofeng ("whatever Chairman Mao said was correct"), Shanghai party boss Wu Bangguo had this to say about toeing the central line: "Whatever the Party Centre has made clear, Shanghai will carry out resolutely." Mr Shen's subtle irony is that his "obedience" is predicated upon there being a central authority worth defending. Mr Wu's diabolical cunning consists in the fact that since the central Government has so far failed to clarify itself on a host of major policies, Shanghai need carry out none of them. Beijing's tragedy is that mired in New Helmsman Deng Xiaoping's dictum of "crossing the river while feeling out for the boulders", the central authorities have been hedging and waffling all the way. Take the "dual tax system," the centrepiece of Beijing's bid to boost its share of national revenue to 60 per cent. The game plan -- whereby Beijing arrogates the most lucrative of the tax bases and leaves the less profitable ones to the localities -- is supposed to have started on January. However, in the past week, top officials have sounded wishy-washy on the controversial fiscal regime. Vice Premier Zhu was uncharacteristically duplicitous about when the new system would begin. When pressed by delegates for a timetable, Mr Zhu said: "We'll spend the first year familiarising ourselves with the main points (of the levy). The mechanism should be rendered stable the following year. Mature implementation should be reached the third year." Deputy tax chief Jin Xin was no less murky on the dual-tax syndrome. Last Sunday, he mumbled something about synthesising the goal of "no direct interference in the vested interests of localities" on the one hand, and "localities taking care of the national interest" on the other. Mr Jin proved himself a past master of newspeak when he tackled the issue of the capital gains tax for real estate. "China implements a unified tax system and it will not do (for localities) to go their own ways," he said with reference to the levy. "Yet there will be a rational division of power between the centre and the regions, so that the latter will have considerable jurisdiction over parts of their taxes." The leadership's policy towards large- and medium-sized enterprises is a case of mind-boggling prevarication. No clear-cut indication has been given on whether Beijing is ready to sunder its umbilical cord to the dinosaurs. Premier Li asked local governments to continue "creating a favourable external environment" for public sector units. Vice-Premier Zhu, an advocate of radical surgery, said on Monday that Beijing would still "take concrete measures to solve the historical baggage of government-owned concerns". These cryptic remarks give no clue as to for how long Beijing will continue underwriting the losses of state firms. Vice-Governor Zhou Zhengqing of the People's Bank of China, which is supposed to keep a tight rein on spending, played fast and loose with the fiscal conservatism that is supposed to be a leitmotif of this NPC. When asked to explain why he had released new loans on Monday for the three depressed sectors of coal, metallurgy and electricity, Mr Zhou said: "Controlling the total volume of credit does not mean a tight-money policy. We must provide support for major parts (of the economy)". He did not explain what was so "major" about these sunset industries. The artful representation of the truth reached an acme Tuesday night when two of Mr Deng's daughters, Deng Nan and Deng Rong, volunteered information about their father's "excellent" health. "My dad walks at least three kilometres every day," said Ms Deng Nan. "He likes to swim in the open seas." Premier Li, then, must be saluted for his singular devotion to nothing but the truth when he told NPC delegates last Thursday that "the responsibility for the breakdown of the (Sino-British) talks lies with the Chinese side ... the British side." As former Vice-Minister Ying Ruocheng surmised, Mr Li had not taken up the dramatic arts. So long as the New Helmsman's survival seems dependent on his 30-odd medical team, the major players in Chinese politics are too consumed with the deathwatch as to do anything more meaningful than acting and dissembling.
