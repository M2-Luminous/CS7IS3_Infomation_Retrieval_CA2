The article notes: What is most important in abolishing the old international order and establishing a new fair one is to set up a new international political order. What is important here is to make the international community democratic and totally reject the policy of strength. To this end, it is particularly important for all countries to respect each other's sovereignty. To force one's idea and system upon others is an undisguised violation of sovereignty and a wanton interference in internal affairs. All the countries and nations must never allow such attempt to maintain the order of domination and subordination. Today the policy of strength finds its manifestation in the fact that arms buildup is stepped up behind the screen of "detente" and "disarmament" and military intervention openly committed in other countries under the pretext of "settlement of disputes". Highhanded and arbitrary practices should be stopped in the international arena and, to this end, it is imperative to observe the principle of equality, justice and fairness in dealing with international matters. In order to abolish the old international order and establish a new one, it is necessary to build a new order in the economic sector. What is important in establishing a new international economic order is to reshape the irrational international financial and monetary system, the unequal trading relations including non-equivalent exchange and the system of one- sided international division of labour and rationally settle the problem of foreign debt so as to create favourable circumstances for the development and progress of the developing countries. To this end the North-South dialogue should be realized and further promoted and developed and, at the same time, the developed countries should adopt a position to fairly resolve pending international economic matters on the principle of mutual benefit and equality. In order to establish a new international order, all the countries interested in it should strengthen unity and cooperation. It is a consistent stand of the government of our Republic to struggle for the abolition of the old international order and the establishment of a new fair one. The government of the Republic will as ever wage an active struggle to remove all manner of unequal relations in the international area and establish a new fair international order.
