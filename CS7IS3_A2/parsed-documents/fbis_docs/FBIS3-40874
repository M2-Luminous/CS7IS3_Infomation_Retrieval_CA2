Business ethics can be upheld if anticorruption legislation and the oath of office are really upheld by firm and strict sanctions. This is a summary of the opinions expressed by Michael V. Haribowo, vice president of the Modern Group, and by Priasmoro Prawiroardjo, deputy president director of Lippo Indonesia's BNP [expansion not given], when they were contacted separately yesterday in Jakarta, in response to Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad's statement that a stop must be put to the degradation of business morals (KOMPAS, Wednesday 22 December). At the same time, Prof. Dr. Sri-Edi Swasono, general chairman of the Indonesian Cooperative Board (DEKOPIN), believes that the gap in control over the economy makes for a very shaky harmony in Indonesia. Michael thinks that although the business ethics of big businesses are not noticeably fading away, in a real sense we are feeling this. "We don't notice them caring about giving smaller or even midsized companies room for business opportunities," he said. In fact, what we're seeing is greed and a constant struggle for opportunities, and these attitudes are more in the forefront than those of wanting to provide others with the same opportunities. As a result, every area of business activity which should provide the smaller members of the business world with business opportunities is now closed off or obscure. Little by little the businesses which have become big because they were given the chance by the government have taken over all the opportunities. The warning suddenly expressed by the minister of finance, said Michael, appears to be a signal about this situation. At the very least his words reflect the government's wish to ask the conglomerates to slow down and to give some of the opportunities to medium and small businesses. Depends on the "Conductor" However, said Michael, it is up to the "master conductor" to change the rhythm of what was playing. Whether or not the situation can be changed depends on the capabilities of the maestro. "The problem is that we must realize that changing the rhythm is not an easy task. But to do so requires perseverance and a firm attitude". On the other hand, he said, the conglomerates themselves must begin to realize themselves that the opportunities which they have been given and which have made them grow can be used to help others. At the very least they must move forward and open up access to a wider market while the small-scale domestic market can be given over to small and medium businesses. However, the excuses given up to now--the need for consolidation and the lack of antimonopoly legislation--have just been self-serving. "The only question now is whether all the parties concerned, including the minister of finance, are capable of giving a warning, without needing to damage all of the parties concerned, but by appealing to the innermost self that all human beings possess to help and to give all parties an opportunity," he said. Upholding the Oath of Office Priasmoro believes that we can put a stop to the moral degradation of the business community and office holders, which is now raging through society, by implementing anticorruption legislation and by upholding the oath of office. Upholding morality can also be accelerated by the political will and firm discipline of the parties holding the keys to government office. If we don't start from that line, urging people to uphold morality will only be laughed at by the business community. He thinks that the minister of finance's statement about the need to put a stop to the moral degradation of the business community is well based. "That statement comes from someone who certainly has a lot of experience with corruption, especially since he once was the director general of taxation, which is also a problem area for corruption," he said. Priasmoro said that there must be a core of bureaucrats who are prepared to begin to uphold those ethical principles. "The minister of finance himself, who has dealt with a lot of agencies which had corruption problems, can first put those initiatives into effect within the Department of Finance. If upholding ethical principles goes well over there, it will automatically become an example for other agencies," he said. Economic Harmony Is Shaky In a separate statement, Sri-Edi Swasono thinks that it is everyone's duty to create a connection between big and small business communities so as to narrow the present gap between them and, at the same time, guarantee business harmony. He revealed these thoughts yesterday in a conversation with a reporter in Ceper, Klaten. Edi Swasono is in Central Java to attend the ceremony transferring the liquidity credit facilities of the Bank of Indonesia (KLBI) to the 11 members of the Batur Jaya Cooperative via the Universal Bank. Abdul Rachman Ramly, chairman of the board of Astra International, accompanied by Palgunadi T. Setiawan, chairman of the Astra Yayasan Dharma Bhakti [Charity Foundation] (YDBA), explained that Astra is committed to involving small and medium businesses in its activities. "We have planned and been committed to those steps since 1980," Ramly affirmed. To implement that commitment, every year Astra sets aside 2 percent of its net profits to help small and medium businesses. "Giving money to the partnership is not enough. We also help with management, apprenticeships and education. All of Astra's facilities are open for study to the businesses that enter Astra's partnership program," Ramly said. Palgunadi, who is also the managing director of Astra Mitra Ventura, added that besides setting aside that 2 percent, which is spent on helping small and medium businesses, Astra also sets aside 2 percent of its net profits for venture capital. These funds are provided for helping with the capitalization of those small and medium businesses which are considered suitable, and Astra's participation in this cooperation is limited to a maximum of 10 years. Up to the present time, Palgunadi said, Astra Mitra Ventura has about 7.5 billion rupiahs in funds. Only about 1.4 billion rupiahs of those funds have been used so far. "We hope that the small and medium businesses getting that funding are not limited to the nine companies getting it now. However, choosing the proper companies for the program is not a simple matter," Palgunadi explained. Edi Swasono thinks that the steps taken by Astra International Inc to set aside some of its profits for fostering cooperatives and small industries are positive steps. He does not see many big businesses which have the kind of program that Astra has for fostering other companies. Big businesses often believe that it is enough to give small businesses and cooperatives something material, such as stock.
