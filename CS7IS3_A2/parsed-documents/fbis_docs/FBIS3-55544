The first sessions of the chambers will be held on 11 January. They will sit separately because the Constitution does not provide for a ceremony of a joint opening session of the two parliamentary chambers. The chambers may sit together to hear messages from the president and the Constitutional Court and speeches of the leaders of foreign states, as well as on the occasions when the president of the country takes the oath of allegiance. [passage omitted] In accordance with the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the Russian president is to open the first session of the upper chamber of the parliament. The ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from well-informed sources in the Kremlin that there are no plans for a "big opening speech" by the president in connection with the beginning of the parliament's work. It will most probably be just a message to the elected deputies, wishing them success. According to the same source, Boris Yeltsin is planning a long program speech at a joint session of the two parliamentary chambers a little later, shortly after the Federal Assembly begins its work. It has been revealed that economic, political and social aspects of reform in Russia will be touched upon in that speech. At the moment it is still unknown in what form the president is going to convey it to the deputies; that is, whether it will be a message or whether he will deliver the speech in person.
