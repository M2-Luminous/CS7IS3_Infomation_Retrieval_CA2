A few days before stepping down from office, Chilean President Patricio Aylwin launched a thrust against his party, which has already been hit badly by the crumbling of the Italian Christian Democratic Party, which it has mirrored for a quarter of a century. In an unexpected interview granted at the beginning of the month to MENSAJE, a magazine belonging to the Society of Jesus, Aylwin said that over the last few years the DC -- of which he is a founding member -- has lost its values, that its members' moral standards are lacking in fortitude, and that they are weak in stemming the world tide of corruption and individualism. He moreover said that his party runs the risk of transforming itself into a mere machine to assign power shares. He further stated that there are card-carrying members of the DC who have joined the party not prompted by the eagerness to serve others, but rather because they see the ruling party as "a springboard" for access to highly remunerative government posts or to consolidate a political career for their personal benefit. During an interview with the daily EL MERCURIO on 27 February, Senator Adolfo Zaldivar, one of the budding leaders of the DC, responded to Aylwin, commenting that he "was very much hurt" by the head of state's utterance. Quite ironically, Zaldivar has harshly criticized his fellow party members. In the course of a speech given at a party meeting last July that was expressly released to the public, Zaldivar warned about "certain black storm clouds" looming largely in the party's future. He disparaged what he termed certain people's individualistic "political careers," and warned against "some persons'" intentions of coming to "power for the sake of power." Now, commenting on Aylwin's remarks, Zaldivar asserted: "I do not share his opinions in the least. They are unfair, and hurt us because of the person who has uttered them. I believe that he did so with the best of intentions (...), but the DC is not going through a crisis. He speaks about a loss of moral strength as motivation for the party's political action, and I do not share his views." Notwithstanding this, Zaldivar -- one of the incumbent vice presidents of the DC -- once again acknowledges that there is "a certain trend toward building a political career for oneself. This tendency of power for power's sake must be overcome by another trend through which people seek to go into politics to serve others. Support should be withdrawn from those who want to have access to government posts for their own benefit." Zaldivar believes that all Chilean political parties have their "technocratic and elitist caste" because it has managed to "infiltrate Chilean society." He even warns that unless this state of affairs changes, "social upheavals" may take place as in the city of Santiago del Estero in Argentina or in the Mexican state of Chiapas. He pointed out: "We live in a continent that is already bleeding. This is why political leaders ought never to lose their sensitivity. And yet our feelings are hurt when they tell us that political parties only give out quotas of power. This is not so." Zaldivar is nonetheless optimistic, and in the face of these "black storm clouds that blur the DC's path," he adds that "our values are extant. Their origin is to be found in the church's social doctrine. This constitutes a concept of the human being, of solidarity that derives from the Gospels (...) The values of Christianity and humanism are permanent in the history of mankind."
