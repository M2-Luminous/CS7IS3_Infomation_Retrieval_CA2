FR940419-2-00126 FR940419-2-00070 The rule change now under consideration provides that the Executive Committee will be comprised of at least seven floor governors. This change allows the Vice Chairman, with Board approval, to expand the number of governors serving on the Executive Committee. While the Commission believes that the Exchange should be able to expand the number of Governors serving on the Committee if such expansion is necessary for the efficient administration of Exchange business, the Commission expects the Exchange to maintain the relative representation of the various geographic groups on the Committee and would be concerned if the Committee was dominated by a particular group ( e.g., floor members). The CHX has represented that it will continue to support diversity in the Executive Committee. Specifically, the CHX has indicated that the Vice Chairman will appoint additional governors, should the number be increased from seven, in a manner which will continue fair representation of public Governors, ``upstairs'' member Governors, and floor member Governors as required by the CHX's Constitution. 21 The Commission therefore believes that the proposal is consistent with section 6(b)(3) of the Act. 21 Telephone conversation between Craig Long, Foley & Lardner, and Katherine Simmons, Division of Market Regulation, SEC (January 26, 1994). For the reasons discussed below, the Commission also is approving changes to the Exchange's Executive Committee, Finance Committee, Committee on Organization and Governance, and Compensation Committee. The Commission notes that although there is no provision in the CHX's Constitution specifically directing geographic diversity in the Governors appointed to committees other than the Executive Committee, 22 Section 6(b)(3) of the Act requires that the rules of an exchange assure a fair representation of its members in the administration of its affairs. The Commission believes that the fair representation provision of Section 6(b)(3) requires the Exchange to ensure that all of its committees have a diversity of governors ( i.e., public Governors, ``upstairs'' member Governors, and floor member Governors). 22 See Art. V., Sec. 4 of the CHX's Constitution and text accompanying note 14, supra . Preliminarily, the Commission believes the rule change to Article VI, Sections 2 (Chairman) and 4 (President) to provide that the Chairman and President are ex-officio members of all Executive Committees (except those specified in the provisions) without the right to vote unless ``otherwise designated in the Constitution or the Rules'' is consistent with the Act. The rule change allows the Exchange to indicate if the Chairman or President has the right to vote on a particular Committee in the Section or Rule pertaining to each Committee. The Commission believes that giving the President full voting powers on the Executive Committee is consistent with the President's voting powers on the Board. The Commission notes that the Executive Committee has full Board authority to act between Board meetings on most issues. In addition, because the Exchange's Constitution requires that the president not be a member of the Exchange or affiliated in any way with a member organization during his incumbency, 23 granting the President voting powers does not change the presentation on the Executive Committee of any particular group. Therefore, this rule change is consistent with sections 6(b) (1) and (3) of the Act. See article IV, Section 4 of the CHX's Constitution. The Commission also believes that the Exchange's proposal to allow the Vice Chairman, with Board Approval, to expand the number of Governors serving on the Finance Committee is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(1) of the Act because the rule change is designed to enhance the governance process of the Exchange. The Finance Committee reviews annual profit plans and budgets for the Exchange and its subsidiaries, reviews the financial condition of the Exchange and its subsidiaries, reviews the performance of Exchange investments, formulates investment policy, and makes recommendations to the management or Board. Because this Committee has an important function involving a wide range of financial issues, the Commission believes it is reasonable that the Exchange may decide that additional Governors are necessary for the Committee to fulfill its duties. Additionally, the Commission believes that the rule change to give the Chairman full voting rights as a member of the Compensation Committee and the Committee on Organization and Governance is consistent with Sections 6(b) (1) and (3) of the Act. The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing the compensation of the President and for coordinating with the President to determine a comprehensive corporate compensation and benefits policy. 24 The Committee on Organization and Governance is responsible for periodically reviewing the organization and governance structure of the Exchange and its subsidiaries, and for making recommendations to the Board of Governors with respect thereto. 25 The Chairman is appointed by the Board of Governors from among the 24 Governors, and may accordingly be an ``up-stairs'' member, a floor member, or a public governor. Granting the Chairman voting rights on the Compensation Committee and the Committee on Organization and Governance, therefore, may change the relative representation of one of these constituencies. The Commission expects that the Exchange will ensure fair representation on these Committees consistent with section 6(b)(3) of the Act. 24 See Article IV, Rule 7 of the CHX's Rules. 25 See Article IV, Rule 9 of the CHX's Rules.
