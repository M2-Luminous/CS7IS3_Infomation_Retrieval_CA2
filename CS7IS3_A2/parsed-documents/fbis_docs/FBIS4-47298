Conventional conductive cooling is ensured by solid contacts between mirror and heat extractor. The design procedure is based on a thorough experimental study on 53 mm long cylindrical mirrors 45 mm in diameter cut from blanks of cast polycrystalline silicon. Two radial holes 2 mm apart and as deep as the mirror radius were drilled one on the reflecting side and one on the dark side, for insertion of two Cu-constantan thermocouples. The reflecting surface was totally covered by a solid disk of grade-OOb copper under a heater coil with power regulation enabling it to act as an adjustable heat load simulator, large temperature differences across the interface thus also being attainable for measurement of its thermal resistance. Its thermal resistance was minimized by insertion of an indium foil between copper disk and silicon mirror, and by pressing onto the disk a copper plunger of special shape 15 mm in diameter at the contact. The plunger was wrapped in a sleeve of special thermal insulation and to its free other end was soldered-on a 150 mm long heat extracting conductor with a 4 mm large effective diameter. From the results of measurements has been determined the dependence of mirror temperatures, of temperature differences across critical contact zones, and of thermal resistances along the heat path on the length of cooling time. On the basis of these experimental data supplementing the appropriate mathematical model have been developed three versions of a Si-cryomirror cooling system: one with a single heat extracting conductor, one with four such conductors, and one with a copper hoop around the lateral mirror surface.
