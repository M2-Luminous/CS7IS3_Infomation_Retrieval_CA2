On the eve of today's local elections, he announced that the Tory leadership had taken a strategic decision to mount a popular Euro-campaign concentrating on "bread and butter issues" to rebuild public confidence in the European Union. A letter sent last night by Mr Hurd to the Conservative Political Centre, and obtained by The Daily Telegraph, said jobs and economic recovery would be the priority of a "distinctive and positive" Tory manifesto. "With Britain's performance outstripping that of our partners on growth, inflation and jobs, we have a good tale to tell," said Mr Hurd. Other key themes include the importance of free trade; completion of the single market; the drive for competitiveness and deregulation; avoidance of unnecessary costs through the Social Chapter; and initiatives against red tape, defrauding of the EC budget and international crime. Mr Hurd's letter disclosed that the tone of the Tory campaign will be in marked contrast to the last Euro-elections in 1989, when Mrs Thatcher was accused of fighting a "negative" campaign, with posters warning people against a "diet of Brussels" and attacking the EC Commission. His letter will be seen as a further attempt by the Tory leadership to quash demands from the party's Euro-sceptics for Britain to consider withdrawing from the EC if there are further moves towards creating a federal State. The European elections on June 9 will be a crucial mid-term test for Mr Major's Government in the wake of today's local council elections . With the Tories running 21 points behind Labour in the opinion polls, they fear many disillusioned supporters will stay at home, so the party is braced for setbacks. The closing stages of the Tory local elections campaign have been over-shadowed by renewed party infighting over the Government's stance towards a European single currency. In his letter, Mr Hurd confirmed the manifesto -- due to be published in two weeks' time -- will restate the agreed Cabinet line that it will be for a future British Parliament to decide on a single currency "when and if that decision has ever to be taken". Three times in the seven-page letter Mr Hurd emphasised the need to fight a positive campaign. He added: "We have taken a strategic decision to do just that. Our supporters will only turn out and vote if we persuade them that these elections matter because the European Union matters to Britain and because the decisions of the European Parliament affect us directly." Mr Hurd has been in charge of efforts to draw up a manifesto which will unite the party after the damaging divisions over Maastricht. He said the Government's objective was to get to an open, free trading, decentralised and popular European Union which did not undermine the nation state.
