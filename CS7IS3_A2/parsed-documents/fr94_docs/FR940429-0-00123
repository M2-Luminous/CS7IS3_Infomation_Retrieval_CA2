FR940429-0-00123 FR940429-0-00012 Other commenters suggested that, except where fraud is suspected, the Secretary require a SPRE to provide notice to a referred institution before conducting a review of that institution. The commenters argued that advance notice of a SPRE review would enable the institution to prepare adequately for the review, including having required records and personnel at the institution during the review. Discussion: In general, the Secretary believes strongly that a SPRE is in the best position to determine the actions it should take in carrying out its review responsibilities. If the SPRE determines that an unannounced review of any referred institution is necessary, the SPRE may conduct that review. Change: None. Comments: Several commenters suggested that a SPRE be allowed to determine, based on the referral criteria or based on a preliminary review of the institution, whether to conduct a comprehensive review of the institution under all of the State's standards or conduct a more limited review designed to identify and correct certain problems at the institution. The commenters argued that this would provide for efficient use of SPRE resources and reduce the burden on referred institutions. Discussion: Section 494C(d) of the HEA requires a SPRE, in conducting its review of a referred institution, to determine the institution's compliance with all of the State's standards. The Secretary believes, however, that a SPRE may devise review procedures under which the SPRE decides the manner or level of review required to determine an institution's compliance with each of the State's standards. Changes: None. Comments: A few commenters suggested a change in the amount of time a SPRE should have to issue an initial report of its findings to an institution. Some commenters suggested increasing the time from 45 days to 60 days; other commenters suggested decreasing the time to 30 days. Another commenter asked the Secretary to clarify what constitutes the completion of a review and recommended that a SPRE issue its initial report no later than 45 days after it has completed its review of the institutions under all of the State's standards and has received a report from the relevant accrediting agency or peer review system. Discussion: The Secretary believes that 45 days provides a SPRE with sufficient time to prepare a report of findings. The Secretary considers the 45-day period to begin at the time a SPRE has completed its review of all of the documentation and information it needs in order to prepare the report, including information provided by an accrediting agency or peer review system. The Secretary notes, however, that this does not preclude a SPRE from issuing a partial report of its findings to an institution, if, for example, the SPRE determines that the institution must, or should, take immediate actions in response to the SPRE's findings. Changes: None. Comments: Several commenters took issue with the proposal that a SPRE may prescribe a course of action a referred institution must follow to correct a violation of the State's standards. One of the commenters believed that a SPRE should be allowed to recommend, but not prescribe, the course by which an institution brings itself into compliance with State standards. The commenter argued that allowing a SPRE to prescribe a course of action would constitute an inappropriate interference with normal institutional governance and management. Some commenters were concerned that the Secretary set the wrong tone in the NPRM by suggesting that a SPRE take actions to effect the termination of an institution only when the SPRE finds that the institution ``continuously or egregiously violated the State's standards.'' The commenters believed that SPREs will not be the overzealous terminators that institutions and many others fear; more likely, SPREs will generally be disinclined to take forceful actions against institutions in their State for fear of litigation and other repercussions that would result from those actions. The commenters urged the Secretary to change the regulations to make clear that in all cases where a referred institution fails to meet a State standard, the SPRE would be required to prescribe a course of action the institution would need follow to correct the violation. The commenters further believed that a SPRE should be required to initiate a proceeding under ยง667.25 to effect the termination of an institution, if the institution did not bring itself into compliance with the State standards within a time specified in regulations unless the SPRE extended that time for good cause. Discussion: The Secretary disagrees strongly with the first series of comments because a SPRE would not be able to enforce the State's standards if it could not require an institution to take the corrective action it determined the institution needed to take to bring the institution into compliance with its standards. While the Secretary agrees strongly with the commenters that SPREs take consistent and appropriate actions against institutions that fail to comply with the State's standards, the Secretary does not believe that it is necessary or prudent to require a SPRE, on an absolute basis, to prescribe a course of action an institution must follow to correct a violation and bring itself into compliance with State standards, particularly with the State's quantified standards. An institution's compliance with acceptable percentages established for those standards is not inviolate; the acceptable percentage reflects, or should reflect, whether the institution is successfully providing its educational programs, rather than whether the institution should be terminated because it failed to satisfy that percentage. In the NPRM, the Secretary acknowledged that developing such standards will be difficult, and in fairness to institutions, proposed that a SPRE provide an institution the opportunity to present compelling evidence that would demonstrate to the SPRE that its failure to meet a State standard would not warrant any further action by the SPRE. Thus, in ยง667.23(c), the Secretary permits the SPRE to determine whether to prescribe a course of action and the nature of that action. Changes: Section 667.23(d) is revised to make clear that a SPRE must provide an institution the opportunity to present compelling evidence that its failure to satisfy a State standard does not warrant any further action by the SPRE. Comments: One commenter suggested that the Secretary initiate an emergency action proceeding against an institution based on a SPRE's report of serious problems at an institution. Discussion: Certainly, the Secretary will examine the findings contained in the SPRE's report and may investigate the matter further to determine whether an emergency action is warranted. If the Secretary determines that an emergency action is warranted, the Secretary initiates that action under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G.
