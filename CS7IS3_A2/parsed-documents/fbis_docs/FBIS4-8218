By committing the unannounced, treacherous April act, NATO has sided with the Muslims in the civil war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, a statement by the SPS main committee says, and adds that NATO forces directly helped the Muslim offensive by military means and clearly declared their support to the forces that favor war. The SPS believes that this action instigates and encourages the militancy of the Muslim side, and hardens their unrealistic aspirations, which could put in jeopardy the peace process by strengthening those who advocate the war option in solving the Bosnian drama. This action threatens all constructive approaches to find a just solution through political negotiations and in a peaceful manner and resumes the policy of pressure, which places the sides in the conflict on an unequal footing, the statement says. The SPS warns that this brutal act also represents a basis for preserving and maintaining permanent instability in the Balkans and that pressure, saber rattling, frequent border provocations, and bombing are all integral parts of a scenario for the escalation of the war in the area. By giving cover to NATO for this act of aggression, the United Nations is losing its credibility in the peace mission in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, the SPS main committee says and concludes that by covering up and falsifying the facts, by concealing the Muslim offensive, smuggling weapons to the Muslim side, by making a decision to deploy Turkish forces in Bosnia, and now by bombing the Serb positions -- the United Nations has confirmed that it is a mere instrument in the hands of those countries that want to achieve their interests and aspirations in the Balkans by prolonging the war. The SPS believes that the way out of this situation must be sought through the prompt reaching of a truce in order to create conditions for the resumption of negotiations, the SPS says. The statement says that political negotiations are the only way to reach a just and lasting solution to the conflict in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and appeals to those circles in the international community who want peace in the Balkans to support such efforts.
