The letters, within the context of the bloody and fateful subversive war that bled our country for more than 13 years, could lead to a new stage filled with grave and daunting consequences. One of the clandestine or confidential documents is signed -- in the way pamphlets, pronouncements, or declaration are usually done -- by the "Prisoners of war of the Canto Grande Luminous Combat Trench [LTC]." The other document is a letter addressed by the captured Edmundo Daniel Cox Beuzeville (sentenced to life imprisonment) to a colonel. Both documents stress "the ironclad and unconditional subordination to the party leadership" undoubtedly represented by Abimael Guzman Reynoso, whom they call "President Gonzalo." The letters also express their indubitable support to the letters signed by "President Gonzalo" and "Comrade Miriam" and their request to President Alberto Fujimori for "a peace agreement." The new and worrying aspect of these two letters is that together with the deceiving call for a "peace agreement" there is a call for a Shining Path "second congress." In other words, the terrorist organization does not lay down its arms or surrender. It accepts talks or negotiations with the government leading to "a peace agreement" and conspires while getting reorganized through a call for a new congress. There is another new element in these documents, the implications of which, without a doubt, deserve a broad national debate in light of official reports: The Canto Grande inmates and Cox Beuzeville at no time mention the much publicized "internal war between Shining Path followers." (There is no separation of responsibilities with "Comrade Feliciano"). The fourth paragraph of the Canto Grande document, moreover, mentions a "black campaign by opportunists and revisionists," followed by threatening remarks. The Shining Path has usually used these adjectives to refer to leftist political parties, labor organizations, and even to nongovernmental organizations (ONG). But what is worse, they have not only characterized them as opportunists and revisionists and threatened them. They also have used this type of verbal virulence to justify their cowardly and absurd crimes against these organizations' leaders and social workers. There are, therefore, many answers and many explanations behind this disturbing and grim strategy of letters. One of the explanations, for instance, must refer in very concrete terms to the revelation made by Cox Beuzeville that he has been allowed to leave prison, where he is serving a life sentence, to carry out "works" on behalf of pacification. [First letter] "Struggle for a peace agreement and establishment of the basis for the second congress. "We, the fighting Communists and the masses of the Canto Grande Luminous Combat Trench, undeclinably accepting President Gonzalo's leadership in this historic and great test, reiterate our decision not to take a single step without President Gonzalo's personal approval for we are fully convinced that he is the greatest Marxist-Leninist-Maoist living on earth, and just as he lead us in the past he will lead us again today, tomorrow, and forever until we reach our objective, the much coveted Communism." "It is convenient to stop for a minute in this paragraph. It is an organic statement, a statement of ideological ratification. It is an act of subordination to Abimael's personal leadership. "We also salute and support the new strategic course established by him, unshakably sure that the proletarian leadership is decisive for victory. Even more so in these circumstances of new, complex, and difficult problems for our party, the people's war, the Peruvian revolution, and the world proletarian revolution." This is a new course for Peruvian revolution. "The fighting Communists and masses, closing ranks with President Gonzalo and the Central Leadership, firmly, decisively, and tenaciously support the call made by our leadership and Comrade Miriam to struggle for a peace agreement and establish the basis for the Second Congress, putting into practice the unavoidable task of Assuming and Struggle for the New Great Decision and Definition as Communists, Maoists, and soldiers of the proletariat, with deep revolutionary happiness and optimism, and committing ourselves to make Canto Grande a forward station of this new stage." Establish the basis for the Second Shining Path Congress. "With the deepest class hate, we totally and resolutely repudiate and condemn the sinister black campaign against President Gonzalo and Comrade Miriam, the essence of which is to cunningly oppose the Peace Agreement. Those who always attacked us furiously have once more unleashed their infamy with even more audaciousness. Today more than ever they are moved by egotist electoral ambitions and political appetites. They are the usual opportunists, revisionists, and lackeys who again show their persistent opposition to the true interests of the deep masses and the people." It is not against the traditional parties, the legal left, labor leaders, or the ONG's. "Assume with firmness and accelerated willingness this New Great Decision and Definition because it serves the interests of proletarians and the people, hoisting as high as possible the always red flags of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and Gonzalo's thoughts, our specific and main weapon." "Close lines around President Gonzalo and the Central Leadership!" "Raise the flag of the New Great Decision and Definition!" "Struggle for a Peace Agreement and establish the basis for the Second Congress!" "Glory to Marxism-Leninism-Maoism!" "Lima, December 1993." "Prisoners of War of the Campo Grande LTC." [Second Letter] "Colonel Savino Cayahuanca Farro" "Director of E.P.R.E.M.C.C." [expansion unknown] "Request of personal audience with the director." "Mister Director." "I come to you Mr. Colonel director of this EPREMCC to request a personal audience, which I have repeatedly asked through the official authorities of diverse services as of 10 December 1993, the date I returned from my latest exit from this prison, as you know. The purpose of the audience will be to discuss directly with you some necessary and important questions referring to what we agreed upon in other instances on the development of the works and meetings in favor of a successful end of the negotiation for a peace agreement. It is true, Mr. Colonel, that these tasks are not easy or simple. The struggle for a peace agreement is complex, difficult, and risky, and involves the difficulties proper of something new!" "Ever since the first time you were so kind to receive me I clearly told you, sharply and explicitly, my firm and decisive agreement, voluntary support, conscious identification, and full adherence to President Gonzalo and Comrade Miriam's letters, published and disseminated by President Alberto Fujimori. My commitment is, therefore, full, total, unconditional, public, decisive, and defined for the course of realizing what today has become a need for all: the Peace Agreement. In this way, `Peace, everyone's task,' as you rightfully ordered painted at the entrance, should be the slogan permitting everyone to cooperate in this praiseworthy objective. This cooperation should have necessary flexibility, within current laws, regulations, and discipline in effect in this prison, which is an undeniable fact that is part of this government's success and your personal merit." "I reiterate to you, sir, my willingness to discuss all problems that might come up and solve them favorably and in accordance with the Peace Agreement. This is a norm of behavior I adopted ever since I entered this prison, within the framework of mutual respect, and in an attempt to serve the objective of our national reconciliation without winners or losers: making more visible and comfortable our relations between authorities and inmates." "I beg of you Mr. Director, to attend to this request and agree to it." "EPREMCC, 3 January 1994" "Edmundo Daniel Cox Beuzeville"
