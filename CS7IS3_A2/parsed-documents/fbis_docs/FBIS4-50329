Tang and Sofia Wu] [Text] Geneva, May 17 (CNA) -- Taiwan hopes to become a founding member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Taiwan's Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng said here Tuesday [17 May]. "So we hope we can be admitted to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) by the end of this year," Sheu stressed at the opening session of the fifth meeting of the GATT working party screening Taiwan's membership application. The Geneva-based world trade regulatory body is scheduled to be superceded by the WTO early next year. In preparation for joining GATT, Sheu said, Taiwan is ready to open its merchandise and service markets. "We are also determined to abide by the GATT-initiated trips (trade related-aspects of intellectual property rights) regulations," he added. Sheu continued that Taiwan has adjusted its trade regime to meet GATT requirements. In addition to slashing tariff rates for a number of industrial and agricultural products, Taiwan will also gradually open its telecommunications, tourism, construction and financial markets to foreign companies. "We'll also revise our copyrights, trademark and patent laws to comply with trips provisions," Sheu said. He further promised that Taiwan will begin consultations with GATT contracting parties on the signing of agreements on government procurement soon after it joins the organization. By signing such accords, Taiwan will allow foreign companies to bid for its public construction and government procurement projects, valued at more than US$20 billion annually. Taiwan originally planned to sign such accords one year after its accession to GATT. Pressured by many GATT members, Taiwan has decided to start such negotiations upon its entry, but it will follow the South Korean example requiring those accords not to take effect until 1997. Sheu also presented a written statement detailing Taiwan's plan to overhaul its decades-old wine and tobacco monopoly system in accordance with GATT requirements. Sheu asked GATT contracting parties to submit lists of products for which they want Taiwan to cut tariffs and lists of services they hope Taiwan will open to foreign investment before the end of July to speed up Taiwan's GATT entry. Sheu said Taiwan hopes to begin discussion on the protocol defining Taiwan's GATT accession in the next meeting of the working party. "We hope the sixth meeting of the working party can be held in late July," he added. In a meeting with GATT Deputy Director-General Warren Lavorel, sheu said GATT should give Taiwan a 10-year adjustment period before it fully opens its rice market now that South Korea, a GATT member, has that grace period. Sheu is heading a 33-member delegation to the fifth multilateral meeting on Taiwan's GATT bid, which will last through Thursday. In addition to multilateral discussions, the Taiwan delegation will also hold formal or informal bilateral tariff concession talks with several GATT members, including Japan, the European Union, Switzerland, Colombia, Mexico and South Korea, during its stay here.
