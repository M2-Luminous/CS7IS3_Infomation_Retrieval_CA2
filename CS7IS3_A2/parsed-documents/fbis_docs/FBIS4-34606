At approximately 1730 on Thursday, 16 June, Dr. Andres Pastrana and Dr. Luis Alberto Moreno paid a visit to the president and minister of defense and presented them with a tape containing three telephone conversations. The first two conversations were allegedly between journalist Alberto Giraldo and Mr. Miguel Orejuela and the third conversation was between Giraldo and Mr. Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela. Dr. Pastrana said he received the tape in the city of Cali, the day before from people who did not identify themselves. Early on 17 June, the minister of defense, at the request of the president of the Republic, ordered the military forces general command and the police general directorate to confirm the veracity of voices and forward, as soon as possible, the tape and results of voice confirmation to the Prosecutor General's Office. The same order was given to the DAS [Administrative Department of Security] director. After informing the prosecutor general, that same 17 June, Dr. Ernesto Samper Pizano was informed about this situation and a copy of the tape was forwarded to him. At about 1630 on 17 June, at the request of the defense minister, three Armed Forces commanders delivered the recording personally to the prosecutor general. The results of the confirmation of voices were forwarded first on Friday and then on Saturday. Taking into consideration that this investigation falls under the Prosecutor General's Office, the government immediately forwarded the tapes and the voice confirmation to that agency. Additionally and as is routine, the government and Armed Forces are ready to assist the Prosecutor General's Office in all support needed in this case.
