Take notice that on December 2, 1994, Eastern Shore Natural Gas Company (Eastern Shore), tendered for filing certain revised tariff sheets included in Appendix A attached to the filing.

Eastern Shore states that the above referenced tariff sheets are being filed pursuant to ยง154.309 of the Commission's regulations and Section 21 of the General and Conditions of Eastern Shore's FERC Gas Tariff to reflect a reduction in Eastern Shore's jurisdictional sales rates. The sales rates set forth thereon reflect a decrease of $0.5136 per dt as measured against Eastern Shore's sales rates filed in Docket No. TA95&hyph;1&hyph;23&hyph;000, et. al., its previous regularly scheduled annual PGA filing as filed on September 1, 1994 (and subsequently superseded on October 25, 1994). Further, the above referenced tariff sheets are being filed pursuant to ยง154.309 of the Commission's regulations and Section 24 of the General Terms and Conditions of Eastern Shore's FERC Gas Tariff to track a storage rate change made by Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco) in its PS/FT Demand Rate. Eastern Shore states that copies of the filing have been served upon its jurisdictional customers and interested State Commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, accordance with Rule 211 and Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214).
