SANKEI SHIMBUN has interviewed former DPRK Army Captain Shin Chung-chol about Kim Pyong-il, who is a half brother of [Workers Party of Korea] Secretary Kim Chong-il and is rumored to be feuding with the latter. Mr. Shin Chung-chol graduated from the same class of the Kim Il-song Military Integrated College as did Kim Pyong-il, who is former DPRK ambassador to Bulgaria. Mr. Shin Chung-chol, 46, is now serving with the South Korean Army with the rank of colonel. Mr. Shin defected to South Korea in 1983 across the North-South demilitarized zone. He is said to have lived together with Kim Pyong-il at the No. 6 Building of the Kim Il-song Military Integrated College for about four years from 1978 to 1982. In the interview, Mr. Shin made disclosures about Kim Pyong-il, who is shrouded in mystery. According to Mr. Shin Chung-chol, Kim Pyong-il was born in 1952 and is four years younger than Shin. Kim Pyong-il is 10 years younger than his half brother, Secretary Kim Chong-il. Kim Pyong-il served in the General Security Bureau as battalion commander with the rank of major before be was enrolled in the Kim Il-song Military Integrated College. At the college, Mr. Shin studied at the Reconnaissance Studies Department, while Kim Pyong-il studied at the Infantry Studies Department. They had frequent contacts because they were members of the same graduating class and lived in the same boardinghouse. Kim Pyong-il was an avid table tennis player, and they played ping pong from time to time. Unlike Secretary Kim Chong-il, who is short and stocky, Kim Pyong-il is a handsome man who is 180 cm tall and who weighs 80 kg. His colleagues knew that he was the second son of President Kim Il-song. Kim Pyong-il was a man of forthright character. He was humorous and very popular among his colleagues at the college. Kim Pyong-il, who studied in the Soviet Union and in East European nations, is said to speak six foreign languages. He did well at the college and excelled in the "duty inspection" component, a war game exercise, which was a graduation examination at the college. At the college, Kim Pyong-il once revealed to Mr. Shin that President Kim Il-song said to him when he was in junior high school, "I hope you will become a distinguished senior military officer when you grow up." According to Mr. Shin, Kim Pyong-il spoke highly of his older brother Secretary Kim Chong-il, saying, "He is a man of high caliber and is dutiful to his father." In this way, Kim Pyong-il neither spoke ill of his older brother Secretary Kim Chong-il nor referred to any feud with his older brother. Commenting on reports that Kim Pyong-il is feuding with Secretary Kim Chong-il, Mr. Shin said: "In my opinion, the reports are exaggerated. Kim Pyong-il will not succeed his father as president unless an accident happens to Secretary Kim Chong-il." According to Mr. Shin, President Kim Il-song may envision that Secretary Kim Chong-il will succeed him as president and Kim Pyong-il will support Secretary Kim Chong-il as a senior military officer. There is information that Kim Pyong-il would be appointed as North Korean ambassador to Finland, and Mr. Shin indicated that Kim Pyong-il will return to the military after serving as a diplomat for the time being. It has become a practice for Secretary Kim Chong-il to attend the Kim Il-song Military Integrated College's commencement ceremony and to hold discussions with students. In describing his impression of Secretary Kim Chong-il at the time, Mr. Shin said: His character was rash and capricious in view of his behavior and talking. I thought that he was a little bit frivolous as a leader of a nation. However, the contents of his address and explanations to the students were perfect, and I thought that he was very smart. In the interview, Mr. Shin said that at the college, he attended a lecture on the "offensive by the army corps with nuclear attacks" in the tactics course of the college. Mr. Shin added that the lecture was given in anticipation of North Korea's nuclear attacks against enemies. In pointing out that such a lecture was already being given at the DPRK's senior military officer schools around 1980, Mr. Shin stated, "I believe there is no doubt that North Korea has already developed nuclear weapons."
