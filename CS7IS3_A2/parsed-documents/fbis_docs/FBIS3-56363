The U.S. leader said that "under your leadership Russia is building a market economy," and that "this great multi-ethnic democratic state is being cemented with the ideals of freedom and trust." Bill Clinton went on to say that "yesterday I visited the Kazan Cathedral. The ancient church was recently rebuilt from new materials but nevertheless, its stands on its ancient foundations. It is exactly the same with Russia, Mr. President, which is creating a new society, yet it has its roots in the greatness of your history and your people." Raising a glass to the Russian president, Bill Clinton proposed a toast "with deep respect and admiration to the great peoples of Russia and the United States and to the bright and firm prospects of freedom which enlightens our common future."
