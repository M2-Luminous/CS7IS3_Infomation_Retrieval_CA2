For example, the initiatives aimed at easing tension around Sarajevo and opening Tuzla airport for humanitarian aid caused obvious irritation in NATO circles and among some Western leaders. I have turned to Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's deputy foreign minister, for comments. [Churkin] It seems to me that irritation is not exactly a political category. Indeed, there were some people in the West who wanted air strikes and saw them as the main task at the time. That was not possible, and therefore such politicians probably do not like what Russia did. If one were to speak about the official political reaction, it was quite normal. We were thanked for making it possible to find the way out of the crisis situation around Sarajevo. Moreover, after this, everyone recognized without reserve, Russia's role in the Bosnian settlement. [Gan] Well, Vitaliy Ivanovich, Americans have said that they have strategic interests in former Yugoslavia. Can you say just a few words on what sort of interests they might be and whether Russia has its interests there, too? [Churkin] I would prefer not to discuss American interests, especially strategic interests, and what is more, in Yugoslavia. I believe, of course, that such interests exist since the United States, like Russia, is a global country and I think that it is in the interests of both Russia and the United States that a political solution to the problem in such an explosive region of the world as the Balkans is found. Speaking about Russia's interests, our interest is primarily in this. We are not only a world power but also a European country and naturally it is in our interests that there is peace in Europe. It is only natural that apart from purely political interests we have practical economic interests. As soon as the war ends sanctions against Yugoslavia will be lifted, and everyone will be able to breathe normally in the entire Balkan region. We are already preparing for this, and we hope that Russia's economic interests, along with the economic interests of other countries, will benefit greatly from this. [Gan] One is getting an impression that we are supporting different sides in the conflict in Bosnia, I mean we and the West. For example, the Bosnian Serbs leader recently visited Moscow. Incidentally, they put forward a very important initiative with regard to the opening of Tuzla airport for humanitarian aid. The Muslim leader was in Washington. Do you have anything to say about this? [Churkin] As for Russia, we try to keep in touch with all three sides in the conflict. You were right to point out that Radovan Karadzic was in Moscow. We are expecting to see Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of the Bosnian Government and one of the Muslim leaders, in Moscow on Sunday, 6 March. Next week, probably on Wednesday, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic will also be in Moscow. I must say that the coming week will be extremely active from the point of view of our contacts aimed at settling the Yugoslav conflict. One could say that the center of world activity will move to Moscow, because apart from those two visits that I have just mentioned, we are also expecting to see in Moscow the Italian foreign minister who will mainly be here because of the Yugoslav affairs, while on 12 March the Greek foreign minister will come here, to talk about Yugoslavia as well. This round of contacts will be concluded on 14 March at a meeting in Vladivostok between our Foreign Minister Kozyrev and the U.S. state secretary. [Gan] There has been fighting and missile attacks in Sarajevo in the last few days. What are the peace prospects? [Churkin] The present situation in Sarajevo is better, although, as you said, there is sporadic fighting, and there have been reports about single missile attacks. But this is not at all what it was like, even two weeks ago. The situation in the city is much calmer. In general, there are still a lot of conflict zones in Bosnia, and many problems. Combat action continues in a number of areas of the country. I think that some partial measures will not be enough here. A global political settlement is needed here. A really great work has already been done by everyone toward a settlement. It seems to me that we still have to make a last step or two. But as you know, the last battle is always the most difficult one, not only a military one, but also a political and a diplomatic one. Therefore, I would not give any particularly optimistic forecasts. Thank you.
