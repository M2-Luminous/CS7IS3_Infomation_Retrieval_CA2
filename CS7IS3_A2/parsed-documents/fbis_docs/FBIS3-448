Addressing a media conference, Mr Molefe said the ANC would support the intensification of mass action in Bophuthatswana to ensure free political activity. "Bophuthatswana should be blockaded as a non-military step to force the homeland government to stop political persecution," he said. "The ANC election offices in the homeland were bombed on Monday as part of the campaign of harassment against the organisation including disruptions of voter education meetings." Mr Molefe, the ANC premier nominee for the North Western Region which includes Bophuthatswana, called on State President F W de Klerk to act more firmly against the homeland and take away its powers. He suggested steps to force the homeland to allow political activity, including: - transitional executive council intervention; - the independent electoral commission erect polling booths in the area; - blockading the homeland to prevent entry of South African goods; - stopping the annual budget allocation to the homeland; and, - cutting financial loans to Bophuthatswana. Mr Molefe said tourists should be discouraged from going to the homeland, although he admitted the move would hurt the economy and lead to a loss of jobs, but added it was more important to stop tyranny.
