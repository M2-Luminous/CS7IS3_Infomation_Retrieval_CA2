Ruckauf acknowledged: "Showing our meritorious accomplishments will not be enough." The minister said the government must not only corruption it must also "clearly state how -- while maintaining the present economic policy -- it intends to enhance growth and put provincial economies in order so that their authorities may maintain the transformations the country is undergoing." Ruckauf played down the increased popularity of the Grand Front and other opposition parties in the past 10 April elections. He remarked that to be a valid alternative "protests are insufficient." Ruckauf, talking on the radio, said that in the 10 April election, some sectors "thought it was important to protest," but things will be different in 1995 "because whenever there is an election for the presidency, governorship, or mayoralty, voters want to know how they will fare on the market or in life in the forthcoming months." He underlined the support the Justicialist Party managed to maintain in Greater Buenos Aires noting that "men and women living in the most humble areas voted for the plan that wiped out hyperinflation and achieved stability" because "they know there are more jobs, which is quite noticeable among those who work rather than among those who just hang about." Ruckauf added: "Nowhere in the world do people kill the goose that lays the golden egg, least of all when they have endured the economic setbacks Argentina has experienced." The minister concluded: "This country has registered the fastest growth in the western world over the last three years."
