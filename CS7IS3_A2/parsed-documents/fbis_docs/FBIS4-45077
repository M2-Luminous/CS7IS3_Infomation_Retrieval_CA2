Ibrahimi has delivered the text of the plan, a copy of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has acquired, to the Yemeni leadership in Sanaa. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has also learned that the plan has been distributed to the ambassadors of the permanent Security Council members, along with an attached message, so they can discuss it with their governments. Following is the full text of the three items: One, text of the memorandum conveyed by Ibrahimi to the UN secretary general: The Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] The Premiership Verbal Memorandum: The DRY sends its warmest greetings to his excellency the UN secretary general and expresses to him its extreme happiness with the arrival of Lakhdar Ibrahimi as his envoy to the two parts of Yemen. The DRY wishes to point out that the serious crisis the country has been experiencing is a result of the war that has been going on since 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih declared it in a public address he delivered at al-Sab'in Square in Sanaa on 27 April 1994. In this regard, we are eager to point out the following facts to open the way for a correct understanding of the causes that have necessarily led to the total collapse we are experiencing: 1. When Yemen's unity was proclaimed on 22 May 1990, our Yemeni people looked forward to creating a modern Yemeni state--a state of law and order in which all citizens have equal rights and duties and which sees to the country's development, progress, and prosperity. 2. At the time, leadership of the southern part of Yemen proceeded toward unity with our brothers in the northern part of the country confidently and responsibly in order to accomplish the great objective of establishing a united state on the basis of the unity accords signed by leaders of the two Yemeni states. 3. [As soon as] the Gulf crisis erupted, leadership of the former Yemen Arab Republic disavowed all the unity accords and worked with all means to impose its regime on the new state, thus reflecting negatively on the life of our people in the North and the South. 4. The national development and political, economic, administrative, and fiscal reform program that was passed by the House of Representatives on 15 December 1991 was an endeavor to deal with the problems that had emanated from the position of the leadership of the former northern part and to introduce political, economic, administrative, and fiscal reforms in order to create a modern state. 5. As soon as the government launched its effort, the minds that controlled the leadership of the former northern part and that opposed unity, development, and modernization launched an undeclared war against YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] leaders. This war has been embodied in political assassinations and in all kinds of terrorist acts that have touched even foreigners in Yemen. Fundamentalist Islamic forces have been used in terrorist acts. Despite all the endeavors to end this criminal series, the leadership of the former northern part refused to adopt any legal steps against suspects and those who support them. 6. The crisis peaked at the end of 1992, i.e., when parliamentary elections were scheduled to be held in November 1992, in order to obstruct the elections or to hold them under unstable security conditions. 7. The situation was pacified so as to hold the parliamentary elections, which took place on 27 April 1993. Everybody aspired to seeing the country make strides on the path of reinforcing democratic action, of creating a united state, and of introducing economic reforms. 8. The leadership of the former northern part continued to cling to its position, and the chain of political assassinations and terrorist acts continued on the eve of the elections, thus convincing broad political forces in the Yemeni society that conditions were going to remain unchanged, and even become more complex, unless the influential forces abandoned their practices, put an end to terrorist acts, and ensured security and stability. 9. Political and security conditions became more complex, thus impeding political and economic life. But efforts to seek means and ways to overcome the crisis continued, and it was agreed to hold expanded political dialogue among the influential political forces in the Yemeni arena; two principles were agreed upon: (1) peaceful dialogue to develop cures; (2) renunciation of the use of weapons to impose solutions. 10. The Pledge and Accord Document was developed after serious and responsible dialogue, and it was signed in Jordan on 20 February 1994. 11. Because of masked opposition, the influential forces refused to draft a program to normalize conditions and to implement the Document. So, political and economic conditions became tense and there were allusions made to the use of force. 12. After further dialogue, it was agreed to hold Cabinet meetings to begin implementing the Pledge and Accord Document in Aden, Ta'izz, and Sanaa. 13. The Cabinet held its first session from 23-27 March 1991 [year as published] and a number of resolutions were adopted to implement the Document, despite the attempt to foil the Cabinet work. Military conditions were touched off in Shabwah on the eve of the Cabinet session. Seven people were killed, and a number of others were wounded. 14. The Cabinet held its second session from 6-7 April 1994. At this meeting, GPC [General People's Congress] and YRG [Yemeni Reform Grouping] representatives backed away from a number of resolutions to which it had agreed in Aden. On the eve of the Cabinet session, an attempt was made to strike the Southern Basuhayb Brigade in Dhamar, which is within the northern governorates. 15. The Cabinet convened in Sanaa from 20-21 April 1994 but did not emerge with any resolutions. Its session coincided with the following: A. The Southern 3d Brigade, stationed in 'Umran, which is within the northern governorates, was hit on 27, 28, 29 April 1994. B. An attempt was made on the life of Dr. Hasan Makki, the first deputy prime minister, on 28 April 1994. C. Previously, the Southern Fifth Brigade, stationed in Hurf Sufyan, which is within the northern governorates, was hit on 26, 27 February 1994. 16. Military acts were staged against the Southern Basuhayb Brigade, stationed in Dhamar, at the beginning of May 1994. They were followed by military acts against the Southern 1st Brigade, stationed in Yarim. The brother prime minister contacted the brother Presidential Council chairman in the United States, where he is being treated, appealing to him to put an end to these military operations against the Basuhayb Brigade and the 1st Brigade. A number of Yemeni figures did the same thing. 17. The strikes against these two brigades, in the wake of the liquidation of the 3d Brigade and of the president's address on 27 April 1994, were tantamount to a declaration of war. Consequently, military operations spread to numerous parts of the country. 18. Since 27 April, Yemen has been witnessing a dangerous war between forces of the two former states, which have not been merged since the country's unification. Moreover, numerous other institutions have not been unified due to the aforementioned reasons. In accordance with the above, we would like to register our profound thanks to the esteemed Security Council and to his excellency the secretary general for their interest in the conditions in Yemen and for the issuance of Resolution 924. We reiterate our adherence to all the provisions of this resolution as of 1 June [1994]. In light of our talks with His Excellency Envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi, we summarize our viewpoint in the following: A. Ceasefire Observation Mechanism: Reaffirmation of Aden's and Sanaa's actual observation of the ceasefire, whose repeated violation by the al-Ahmar clan government in Sanaa has been confirmed, should take top priority in order to stem further deterioration of the conditions. In this regard, the DRY Government reaffirms that it welcomes Sanaa's declaration and announces its proposal, which it has conveyed to the Security Council through UN Envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi, that a military observation team supervise the ceasefire. Because the previous military committee was formed prior to the outbreak of the all-out war and because the U.S. military attache, the Russian military attache, and the French military attache, as the EC representative, plus brothers from the Sultanate of Oman and Jordan, participated in that committee, in addition to Northern and Southern military elements, then urgent steps must be taken accordingly to organize the ceasefire observation mission through a full team that is capable of managing and performing the mission in the best manner possible. In view of the serious current situation and to establish peace in northern and southern Yemen, it is logical and appropriate that the observation team should include African, Asian, and Arab League representatives so we can ensure a complete and prompt implementation of Resolution 924. Afterward, consultations can be held on the steps necessary to launch a dialogue between the parties concerned without prior conditions or reservations. B. Aid: The DRY Government also reaffirms the importance of addressing urgent attention to the humanitarian side, considering that environmental conditions in the governorates of Lahij, Abyan, and Aden have worsened. Ships and planes belonging to the International Red Cross, the Islamic Red Crescent, and Doctors Without Borders loaded with medicines and foodstuffs, as well as rescue teams, stand idle while waiting for their shipments to be unloaded at the Aden Port and Airport--which were still being subjected to concerted air raids and missile and field artillery shelling by hostile Northern forces while this statement was being written. This impedes the delivery of humanitarian aid to deserving Yemeni citizens in the southern governorates. C. Arrangements for consultations with the secretary general to hold an emergency Security Council session: While expressing its denunciation and its extreme resentment of the method employed by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, who has rebelled against constitutional legitimacy, who has been hostile to peace initiatives, and who has rebelled against the international community's will, which is embodied in Security Council Resolution 924, the DRY Government finds itself required, by virtue of its responsibilities, to seek the convocation of an emergency Security Council session to adopt a deterrent measure against the Sanaa regime. The DRY Government takes this opportunity to express its high appreciation for His Excellency Lakhdar Ibrahimi and to register its extreme respect for his excellence the secretary general. al-Mukalla, 12 June 1994. Two, text of the UN observers team plan: The UN team to observe the ceasefire between the two parts of Yemen in implementation of Security Council Resolution No. 924, issued on 1 June 1994: First, the team shall consist of: A. Supervision committee: It shall consist of 11 capable military men as follows: 1. Two Arab League representatives, one as original member and the other as alternate member. 2. Two representatives of the southern part, one original and one alternate. 3. Two representatives of the northern part, one original and one alternate. 4. Two representatives of the Sultanate of Oman, one original and one alternate. 5. Two representatives of Jordan, one original and one alternate. 6. The U.S. military attache or whoever represents him. 7. The Russian military attache or whoever represents him. 8. The French military attache or whoever represents him. 9. The PRC military attache or whoever represents him. 10. The British military attache or whoever represents him. 11. A UN military representative and an alternate member to represent him. B. Observers team: It shall consist of 100-150 officers. The number may be doubled if the need arises. This team shall be selected from the following countries: 1. The countries represented in the supervision committee. 2. Egypt, Syria, Morocco, and Algeria--Arab bloc. 3. Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and India--Asian bloc. 4. Senegal, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Kenya--African bloc. Second, the team shall operate under the UN banner and within the framework of Resolution No. 924. Third, tasks of the ceasefire observers shall be defined in: 1. Strengthening the ceasefire and determining the source of its violation. 2. Supervising separation of the [warring] forces and ensuring their withdrawal. Fourth, arrangement for safe aid operations: All facilities shall be secured for UN, International Red Cross, and Red Crescent aid operations and operations of all organizations involved in humanitarian activities. Fifth, the UN secretary general shall take all the measures necessary to ensure success of the ceasefire observation team's mission. Three, text of the DRY Foreign Ministry message to the permanent Security Council members: The Democratic Republic of Yemen; The deputy prime minister and foreign minister: The DRY Foreign Ministry conveys its warmest greetings to the foreign ministry of the friendly.... [sentence as published] And the foreign ministry wishes to point out continuation of the war declared by a backward tribal military band in Sanaa. This band is spreading terror among Yemeni citizens in the southern governorates, and it no longer possesses any constitutional legitimacy. Populated cities in the governorates of Lahij, Aden, Shabwah, Abyan, and Hadhramawt have been subjected to indiscriminate shelling with missiles and cluster bombs and to repeated air raids against civilian targets. You are aware that the DRY Government has made sincere efforts to reach arrangements for a ceasefire in accordance with Security Council Resolution No. 924. But the tribal military gang in Sanaa has persisted in its indiscriminate and concerted attacks, thus disregarding the resolution. Mr. Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the UN secretary general's envoy, has visited northern and southern Yemen and has talked to the parties concerned in an attempt to consolidate the ceasefire stipulated by the resolution and to make arrangements for peaceful negotiations between the parties concerned under UN auspices, either in New York or Geneva or in Cairo, the Arab League headquarters. Because the ceasefire arrangements have collapsed repeatedly as a result of Sanaa's failure to adhere to the ceasefire--a failure confirmed by neutral figures and organizations (AFP, Doctors Without Borders)--the DRY Government, while thanking your esteemed government for your interest in establishing peace between North and South Yemen so the two sides can devote their efforts to reconstruction and development, urges your friendly government to cooperate in approving the delegation of a UN-supervised ceasefire team selected from Arab, African, and Asian countries, including Algeria, Mali, Senegal, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Egypt, and Syria. Through regional cooperation, the financial aspect concerning the observation team will be secured without saddling the United Nations with its burdens. Establishing peace in Yemen will rely on your good understanding of dimensions of the problem of continued war in Yemen and of the ordeals and tragedies it will bring the Yemeni people in the North and the South. The UN charter guarantees peoples of the world their right to self- determination. We were, as you are aware, an independent and sovereign state that was tied to your country by firm friendly relations. The DRY Foreign Ministry takes this opportunity to express to your esteemed ministry its thanks, appreciation, and best wishes. 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Majid al-Asnaj Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Aden, 14 June 1994.
