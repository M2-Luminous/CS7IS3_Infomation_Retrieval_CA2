FBIS4-30203 "dreas122_m_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-122 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 Thailand Armed Forces Back Demands With Report Armed Forces Back Demands With Report BK2406093294 Bangkok THE NATION in English 24 Jun 94 pp A1, A4 BK2406093294 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] The military has issued a "Defence White Paper" detailing its strategic policies and explaining why it needs a huge budget, an unprecedented move that precedes a forthcoming parliamentary debate on the national budget. The document, prepared by the Defence Ministry and the Supreme Command headquarters, was presented yesterday to reporters and participants of a seminar organized by the National Defence College. Addressing the seminar on the "Military Role in National Defence and Development", Supreme Commander Woranat Aphichari said information in the Defence White Paper was not new but it had not been publicized before. "We have just never disclosed it before, which made people think soldiers lived in a closed society," Woranat told national security psychology students and journalists attending the seminar. "The situation has changed. To foster the democratic system in which we have faith, it is time to publicize this kind of information. This will make people understand the military more, and support our role. Some people's lingering doubts about the military's role will also be cleared up," he said. Another reason for disclosing information in the white paper is to show "our neighbours that we have nothing to hide, that every defence strategy is based on our non-aggression policy," Woranat added. The White Paper is divided into four main topics -- International and Regional Security, Basic National Strategy, Defence Strategy and the Thai Military in the Future. In the section on international and regional security, the military expresses concern over the nuclear tension on the Korean Peninsula and the Spratly Islands conflicts involving China, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines and Malaysia. The paper says the United States will continue to play an active military and political role to maintain peace in the region. It mentions India's "increasing military capacity", covering possession of nuclear weaponry, effective air logistics and transport, and a formidable navy. The paper says India's naval strength has caught up with that of China. The document also predicts that neighbouring Burma, with support from Beijing, will soon have a highly efficient military. According to the paper, Burma now has more than 300,000 soldiers and has been procuring tanks, artillery and rocket launchers. The Burmese navy is also embarking on an expansion programme to protect oil and gas exploration. The section on basic national strategy mentions attempts to improve Thai politics, "which needs to be carried out sincerely". The third section says Thailand needs a sophisticated air defence, covering surveillance, patrol, intelligence and alarm systems. In the section on future facing the Thai armed forces, the document says that to defend the country's borders, "enormous manpower and budget are required". "We need to set up compact fast-moving teams with compact and effective weapons, to defend several major spots at the borders. Tanks and armoured vehicles must be efficient and suited to the frontier geography," it says. The 1995 national budget allocates Bt131 billion for national defence and security, a five per cent increase on fiscal 1994. Woranat told the seminar that the country's defence budget for the next fiscal year had been trimmed by about Bt50 billion. The paper says Thailand's defence budget is relatively small compared with other ASEAN countries. "We have to explain our needs and programmes to the public. That is why we are disclosing this White Paper information," Woranat said. He added, however, that the military was satisfied with the final figures in the Budget Bill, which is to be deliberated by Parliament early next month. Parliament President Marut Bunnak said the bill could be listed for debate on July 6 and 7. If the debate cannot be concluded within the dates set, an extra afternoon, on Friday, July 8, will be set aside for it. The proceedings will be televised live, he said. Marut thought the bill would get the backing of the Phalang Tham Party and would get through the House, despite the coalition's internal problems.
