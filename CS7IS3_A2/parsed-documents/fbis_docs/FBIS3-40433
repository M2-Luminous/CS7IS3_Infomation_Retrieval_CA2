Polyethylene-Polyethylene composites are an attractive idea as both matrix and fibre are extremely light, the bonding between fibre and matrix is likely to be very good and polyethylene fibres offer excellent stiffness and strength properties. The resulting composites would have high absolute properties and exceptional specific properties. The drawback in the past has been that orientated polyethylene fibres tend to lose their properties at temperatures in excess of 120 degrees Celsius, making any melt processing of the matrix impossible. The IRC's approach is to use a hot compaction process where fibres of high modulus polyethylene are pressed together at elevated temperatures. Critically, however, only a small proportion of the fibres are melted -- enough to bind together the remaining fibrous material. The requirement is that nine percent of the fibre is melted, with this material binding the composite together as it cools. Sufficient pressure is introduced to stop shrinkage and to retain fibre orientation, but not to inhibit melting. The resulting composites are claimed to offer strengths at the level that might be expected from conventional composites with an equivalent starting quantity of polyethylene fibres, but with reduced stiffness. The exact mix of stiffness and strength, however, is variable according to the exact processing conditions selected. The process also works with other fibre types including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene and liquid crystal polymer. The IRC is now examining the material for applications in the biomedical field such as dental plates and bone replacement material.
