It discussed draft amendments to the law "On the Status of Judges." As a result, a drafting commission was confirmed which would busy itself with finalizing the wording of the amendments and then submit them to the State Duma of the Federal Assembly for approval. The plenum agreed with the provision in the draft law on a single status for judges. In the words of Constitutional Court acting Chairman Nikolay Vitruk, in the law "it is necessary to underline precisely the unity of judges." The plenum approved the article in the draft law on judges' independence and abiding only by the requirements of the Constitution and the Federal law. Speakers at the plenum noted that it is necessary to reduce the length of service qualifying judges for life-long financial support from 20 to 10 years. According to one of the judges, 10 years is quite sufficient for earning "the whole bunch of occupational ailments." The plenum also agreed that the length of service in the prosecution, justice, and investigation bodies should be taken into account in calculating the size of life-long financial support. Lyudmila Maykova, deputy chairperson of the Council of Judges of Russia, proposed that state arbiters should have the same social benefits as judges, which they do not have now. Representatives of the Constitutional Court suggested that the draft law should include a provision on the creation of its own independent security service. The participants also agreed with the provision that judges should have the right to carry firearms. The plenum also discussed the questions of benefits for judges working in the extreme north: one year of work there will be put on record as 18 months. The draft law "On the Status of Judges" will be put into final shape by a commission of nine participants in the plenum confirmed by that body.
