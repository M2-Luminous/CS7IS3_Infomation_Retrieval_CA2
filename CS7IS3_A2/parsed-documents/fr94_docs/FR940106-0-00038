FR940106-0-00038 FR940106-0-00013 33 CFR Part 165 [COTP Pittsburgh Regulation 93&hyph;010] RIN 2115&hyph;AA97 Safety Zone Regulations; Youghiogheny River AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the Youghiogheny River from mile 0.8 to mile 1.8. This regulation is needed to control vessel traffic in the regulated area during demolition of the main span of a bridge at mile 1.3. This regulation will restrict general navigation in the regulated area during demolition and subsequent debris clearing operations for the safety of vessels transitting the area. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective from 9 a.m. on January 8, 1994 and will terminate at 10 a.m. on January 10, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LT John Meehan, Port Operations Officer, Captain of the Port, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at (412) 644&hyph;5808. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation are LT John Meehan, Project Officer, Marine Safety Office, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and LCDR A.O. Denny, Project Attorney, Second Coast Guard District Legal Office. Regulatory History In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, a bridge is being removed from a navigable waterway. Bridge removal operations pose inherent risks to the waterway because the structure is progressively weakened as the operation proceeds. Once commenced, such operations should be completed as quickly as possible. Removal operations involving structural supports for this bridge have proceeded ahead of schedule, leaving insufficient time to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking. The Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation without waiting for a comment period, as immediate implementation of navigation restrictions is needed to ensure the safety of vessels transitting the area and to minimize the time a bridge in a weakened condition remains over the waterway. Background and Purpose The Port Vue Bridge located at mile 1.3 on the Youghiogheny River is not longer an active highway bridge and must be removed. The bridge consists of several small spans that are located over land and one 310-foot main span that crosses over the navigable waterway. As part of the overall bridge removal operation, this main span will be demolished with five simultaneously detonated explosive charges. This explosion, which will create an obvious hazard to vessels transitting the area, will occur at approximately 10 a.m. on January 8, 1994. After the explosives on this span are detonated, the steel and other debris from the bridge will fall into the navigable waters of the Youghiogheny River, creating an unsafe condition of vessels. The contractor will immediately commence clearing operations, but it will require 48 hours to restore the navigability of this section of the Youghiogheny River. Accordingly, during that period, no traffic will be permitted in the safety zone, as it would be unsafe for vessels attempting to transit and such transit attempts would interfere with the debris clearing operations. Regulatory Evaluation This regulation is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and not significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979), it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of information requirements. A full regulatory analysis is unnecessary because the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal due to the relatively short duration of vessel traffic restrictions, the relatively small size of the area regulated, and the absence of any commercial vessel transits along this section of the Youghiogheny River, due to insufficient bridge clearances and water depth downriver. Federalism Assessment Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation as an action required to protect public safety.
