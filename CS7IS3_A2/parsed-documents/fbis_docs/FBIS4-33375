FBIS4-33375 "drlat108_p_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-108 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 Ecuador Red Sun Reaches Peace Accord with Government Red Sun Reaches Peace Accord with Government PA0306183494 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0119 GMT 2 Jun 94 PA0306183494 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] Quito, 2 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Ecuadoran "Red Sun" armed movement announced today that it reached a "peace agreement" with the Ecuadoran Government, which will permit it to surrender its weapons and quit subversive activities. Ramiro Celi Garces, foremost leader of the subversive group, admitted at the National Defense Ministry the movement's "military defeat" and announced it will join the peaceful democratic struggle. He recognized the mistake of acting with weapons when violence is not favorable "at this historic moment" and he denied the group had engaged in terrorism or kidnappings. Celi Garces said the struggle of the "Red Sun" was directed at ending the injustices of "a totally atomized society" and the misfortunes of people subject to an unconscientious government. Our organization "has deemed it necessary to stop using weapons as an alternative" and "to proclaim our will to secure a peace agreement," he stated. The proposal by the Red Sun and Inti Puka [red sun in Quechua] is based on commitments that establish eliminating the organization, quitting clandestine activities, surrendering weapons to the Army, and rejoining the country's democratic activities. In exchange the group asks the government "as a demonstration of its will to achieve peace to redefine its social and economic policies" in order to improve the living conditions of the people." Inti Puka also requests the government to release of one of its leaders and the to end all police and military control of the demobilized militants of the "Red Sun Communist Party," as Celi Garces calls it. Defense Minister Jose Gallardo expressed his satisfaction with the decision of the group, which has been linked to the Peruvian Shining Path because of its actions and slogans, although no connection has ever been proven. Gallardo said the Red Sun's decision to adopt the path of peace represents a victory for peace-loving Ecuadorans. The group had been active in Ecuador for three years and had been blamed for several dynamite attacks against public offices which only caused material damages, including damage to an electricity tower of the Papallactal potable water plant last May. Leaders Celi Garces and Patricio Alban Sanchez, representing the demobilized members whose number is not known, surrendered their weapons to Gallardo at the Defense Ministry. Sophisticated weapons were exhibited at a sumptuous ceremony. The ceremony was attended by the military high command, members of the cabinet, representatives of human rights, and relatives of those laying down their weapons. Political analysts noted that the surrender of weapons has been the result of intense investigations and Armed Forces surveillance of the movement's activities. A 19-year-old student, who was captured in August 1993 for being a member of the Red Sun, denied that the group has any connection with any Ecuadoran political party, as local media have reported. The last subversive group recognized in Ecuador was the so-called "Alfaro Lives, Dammit" which in 1990 dissolved itself upon signing a peace accord with the Social Democratic government of Rodrigo Borja (1988-92).
