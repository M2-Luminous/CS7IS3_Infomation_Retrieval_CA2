FR940203-1-00020 FR940203-1-00005 We recognize that using the same formula to allocate the annual charges among a single pool of licensees (and exemptees) would cause a large increase, both in total dollars and percentage, that major municipal licensees as a group experience. We solicit comment on this impact. One approach the Commission could consider (discussed below) would be the adoption of a three-year transition period for phasing in the resulting cost changes. Changing the allocation formula from a mix of capacity and generation to capacity alone would reduce the Commission's administrative burden as well as the reporting requirements of major non-municipal licensees. Under the current system, the Commission obtains annual generation data from non-municipal project operators; delays in providing this information to the Commission complicate the billing process. By using authorized installed capacity exclusively, the Commission would always have the apportionment data on hand and the calculation of the bills would be simplified. The Commission is also considering alternative formulae, such as an allocation based in whole or in part on generation measured in kilowatt hours. In this regard, the Commission notes that the annual charges it assesses pursuant to OBRA are all allocated among the regulated entities pursuant to a formula based on an appropriate measure of volume rather than on a measure of capacity. OBRA requires the Commission to compute those annual charges based on methods which the Commission determines to be ``fair and equitable.'' 11 Annual charges under Parts II and III of the FPA and related statutes are apportioned to public utilities based on the data they submit with respect to megawatt-hours of adjusted sales for resale and adjusted coordination sales. 12 Annual charges under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and related statutes are allocated among natural gas pipeline companies based on the volumes of gas sold or transported by each company. 13 Annual charges under the Interstate Commerce Act are allocated among oil pipelines based on their operating revenues. 14 11 See Annual Charges Under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, Order No. 472, FERC Stats. & Regs. (Regulations Preambles) Â¶ 30,746 at p. 30,610 (1987). 12 See 18 CFR 380.201. It also contains a comparable provision for allocating annual charges among power marketing agencies. 13 See 18 CFR 380.202. 14 See 18 CFR 380.203. As noted below, there is a maximum charge. With respect to the annual charges for the administration of part I of the FPA pursuant to section 10(e)(1) of the FPA, the analog to allocation of the annual charges pursuant to OBRA would be an allocation scheme based on the electric energy actually generated by the various licensed and exempted hydropower projects rather than on their respective capacity to so generate. We are concerned, however, that the generation data reporting requirements necessary to implement such a scheme may impose an undue burden on smaller licensees and exemptees. Accordingly, the Commission invites comment on the propriety of using generation data rather than authorized capacity as the basis for allocating the charges, and on whether such a scheme would be unduly burdensome on some or all licensees or exemptees. We specifically invite comment from municipal and minor licensees as to whether they have equipment for measuring generation and whether it would be burdensome to report such data to us. Another alternative that the Commission is considering to simplify the allocation process is to eliminate only the third prong of the formula, and to include minor licensees in the respective allocation formulae for major licensees. In other words, the minor municipal licensees would be included in the same allocation formula with the major municipal licensees, and the minor non-municipal licensees would be included in the same allocation formula with the major non-municipal licensees. The Commission could include exemptees in the same manner. This alternative would preserve the existing use of a formula based on a combination of capacity and generation to determine the annual charges for non-municipal licensees, and of a formula based solely on capacity to determine the annual charges for municipal licensees. This alternative would avoid the large increase, both in total dollars and percentage, that major municipal licensees as a group would experience under a single, unified formula. The Commission could provide a transition period for phasing in the assessments for minor licensees and exemptees. The Commission specifically invites comment from minor licensees and exemptees on whether such a transition period would be helpful or appropriate. In this regard, the Commission notes that the current system of categorizing municipal and non-municipal projects separately for purposes of annual charges produces a sizeable disparity in the annual charges assessed for projects of comparable size depending on their class of ownership. The disparity is illustrated by the data in the table in Appendix A. Under the present regulations, and under the currently prevailing facts (which, as discussed below, can be expected to change), the non-municipal licensees are assessed a substantially larger annual charge per kilowatt of capacity than the municipal licensees. This is occurring primarily because the bulk of the Commission's current licensing activities is focused on processing applications for new licenses for projects whose original licensees expired in 1993. Since a disproportionate number of these projects are owned by non-municipal licensees, the effect of segregating out the hours spent on those applications is to allocate more of the annual charges burden to the non-municipal licensees. In other words, non-municipal licensees as a group are paying comparatively higher annual charges today than municipal licensees because at this time the non-municipal licensees, as a group, are imposing comparatively greater regulatory costs.
