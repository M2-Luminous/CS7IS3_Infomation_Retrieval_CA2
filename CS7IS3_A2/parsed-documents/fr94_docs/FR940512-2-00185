FR940512-2-00185 FR940512-2-00078 Projects in this priority area are intended to result in a process which encompasses the following types of activities: 1. The provision of assistance to grantees for the purpose of assessment of grantee and staff training needs and the development, management and implementation of training plans that ensure staff have the skills to carry out their responsibilities. Training and technical assistance designed and/or provided to grantees for this purpose must be accessible and individualized, must provide concrete information and skill building and must include follow-up efforts. 2. The provision of quality staff training which focuses on skill development that (a) provides opportunities for hands-on participation, direct observation, practice and expert feedback; (b) analyzes, integrates and transmits knowledge obtained from research findings, curricula, and models of greatest interest to grantees; and (c) recognizes new and emerging youth issues and provides intensive skills training in these areas. 3. The collaborative exchange of monitoring and MIS information with runaway and homeless youth programs for the purpose of planning training and technical assistance for the geographic area being served, and for the purpose of providing follow-up training and technical assistance responsive to the findings resulting from monitoring individual grantees; 4. The promotion of a cooperative relationship among training and technical assistance providers for the exchange of information regarding identified training needs, emerging youth issues, research findings, curricula and models. The award of these cooperative agreements will include a delineation of the responsibilities of the successful applicants and the Administration on Children, Youth and Families. The responsibilities contained in each cooperative agreement may be geared toward the unique needs of the RHY programs in the geographic areas to be served. At a minimum, responsibilities of the successful applicants will include development and implementation of a workplan, provision of training and technical assistance to grantees and coordination with other grantee support efforts and T&TA providers. Responsibilities of ACYF will include, at a minimum, review and approval of workplans, coordination and sharing of monitoring data, as appropriate, and sponsorship of a national meeting of T&TA providers. Minimum requirements for project design: As a part of addressing the generic evaluation criteria in Part II of this Announcement, each applicant must address the following items in the program narrative section of their proposal. Objectives and Need for Assistance 1. Identify the exact geographic area(s) to be served in terms of its distinctive features. 2. Discuss youth homelessness in the geographic area(s) to be served. Provide documentation of the incidence of homeless youth. 3. Demonstrate an understanding of the incidence and conditions of runaway and homeless youth in the geographic area(s) to be served; and current issues, special problems and needs associated with runaway and homeless youth such as substance abuse, learning disabilities, lack of independent living skills. 4.

Discuss the knowledge, skills, abilities and experience required by individual youth service professionals at both the administrative and direct service levels. 6. Discuss and justify the need for training and technical assistance in the geographic area to be served. 7. Discuss barriers to services in the geographic area and greatest training and technical assistance needs of runaway and homeless youth service providers. 8. Demonstrate an understanding of relevant research and development findings and products, and knowledge of available curricula, models and experts. Results and Benefits Expected 1. Discuss the goals and objectives of the proposed training and technical assistance effort and how it builds and improves upon past efforts. 2. Project the number of agencies and individuals that would receive training and technical assistance services. 3. Describe how the training and technical assistance effort will increase the capacity of RHY grantees to deliver effective and quality services to runaway and homeless youth.
