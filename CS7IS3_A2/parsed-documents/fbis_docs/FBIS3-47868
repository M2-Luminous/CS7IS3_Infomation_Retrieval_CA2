Japanese life and nonlife insurers also agree with them. According to sources in the MOF and the insurance industry, U.S. demands are all "unreasonable," and it is rather the U.S. insurance market which is "closed." Furthermore, the United States has been strongly critical of the Japanese Government, the Japanese bureaucracy in particular, even outside the framework talks. This has aggravated the antipathy on the Japanese side. Meetings on the insurance sector had been held on 10 and 11 January in Washington since the beginning of 1994. Yet, the gap between the positions of the two countries have not narrowed. Japan looks at the U.S. position as a completely uncritical representation of the demands of some private companies, and sees these demands as incoherent. Moreover, officials of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) are in charge of the negotiations, and they are not knowledgeable about the insurance sector, and "cannot conduct discussions based on the actual market situation," (according to a senior MOF official). Specific U.S. demands on the Japanese market include: 1) clarification of the standards for approving new products; 2) the introduction of a "broker" system, which is independent from the insurance companies and recommends insurance companies for the benefit of the clients; 3) reform of the insurance premium computation association system; 4) expansion of foreign companies' share in government-related insurance business; 5) postponement of liberalization of the third sector, where both life and nonlife insurance companies participate in the market; 6) rectifying the practice of insurance contracts between "keiretsu" companies; and 7) adopting market share of foreign companies as an objective criterion to gauge the openness of the market. Among these demands, for instance, the brokerage system has not even been introduced in 12 states in the United States. Furthermore, in the State of New York and several other states, foreign insurance companies are required to put up property in trust as the equivalent of reserve fund for liabilities; there is actual discrimination against non-U.S. companies. The MOF explains that "The Japanese insurance market is not closed compared to the U.S. market, but the USTR does not know this." With regard to the demand that liberalization in the third sector be postponed for five years, Japan believes that "On the whole, the United States demands the relaxation of regulations. Yet, it wants postponement only in an area where foreign companies are strong. That is self-serving." Japan also strongly refutes the U.S. claim that foreign insurance companies' share in the Japanese market is small, and thus, the Japanese market is closed, asserting "the figures cited are inaccurate." While the USTR claims that foreign share in the U.S. market is 10 percent, a senior MOF official says that Equitable Insurance, where Japanese and French insurance companies hold a majority of the stock, is counted as a foreign company, but foreign capital has no control in that company, and "no American would consider Equitable a foreign company." According to OECD statistics, foreign insurance companies' share in the nonlife sector was 2.7 percent in Japan, and 0.9 percent in the United States in 1990. The MOF interprets this to mean "you can say the U.S. market is more exclusionary." The Japanese insurance industry also decries the fact that the share of Japanese nonlife insurance companies is merely 0.1 percent in the U.S. market, while "national treatment for foreign nonlife insurance companies is being applied in Japan. It is rather the U.S. insurance market which is closed" (according to Sotaro Aoki, managing director of Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company). While Japan's current accounts surplus is the main reason for conducting the framework talks, in the case of the insurance sector, the balance of payments between Japan and the United States in fiscal 1990 showed a deficit of $420 million on the part of Japan. The MOF and the insurance industry remain doubtful if "insurance ought to have been an area of negotiation." Even though Japan sees the U.S. market to be more exclusionary, the United States regards the framework talks as a venue to correct the closedness of the Japanese market, and refuses to do anything to rectify the U.S. market. In other words, it takes the position of "rejecting two-way discussions." It even demands prior consultation with the MOF on the insurance system reform the ministry is undertaking at present. MOF negotiators call this "saying whatever pleases them." There is very little time left before the deadline of the negotiations on 11 February, when a summit meeting will be held between the leaders of both countries. Many in the MOF are of the opinion that "we would like to deviate from the old pattern of compromising in the end." Some even express the view that "a compromise will rather undermine bilateral relations in the future." Negotiations in the insurance sector are bound to continue with the possibility of a breakdown constantly haunting the negotiators.
