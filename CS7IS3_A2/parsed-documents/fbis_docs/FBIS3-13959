Meanwhile, official circles in the United States have expressed surprise over the hue and cry in India centering around the two letters written by President Clinton. They even questioned why the Indian Government felt it necessary to lodge protests over the letters. Washington stated that the President's office receives many letters every day, and his staff prepares the reply to the letters selected by them. It added that the President only puts his signature on letters drafted by his staff. The President does not have the time to go through these letters to see what has been written. Their clarification is not totally untrue. If the President had to reply to all the letters received by his office, then perhaps he would not have time to do other tasks, including eating and bathing. However, the explanation given by the President's aides is not acceptable. It is surprising to note that letters written on political issues are taken so lightly by the President's office, and replies to such letters are also prepared in the same manner. It is desirable that the President's signature carry more weight. The President should decide which letters should be selected for replies. He cannot refuse to give a reply to the letter written by Congressman Gary A. Condit who belongs to his own party. Someone should have the responsibility of going through the subject matter of the letter and taking precautions in replying so that it does not hurt those who are concerned with it. It is possible that the close aides of the President can work in accordance with their own likings and dislikings and justify their actions in the name of the President. Congressman Condit might feel encouraged to plead shamelessly for the militants of Khalistan with a view to pleasing a section of the voters in his constituency. However, the tone of the President's letter shows that he is himself pleading for the Sikhs. In replying to another letter sent by the pro-Pakistan Kashmiri American Council, President Clinton's letter gives the impression that he is raising the issue of protecting human rights in Kashmir with a view to assisting the secessionists. The U.S. Government spokesman has said that such an interpretation of the President's letter is unfortunate. He further added that Washington does not support terrorists or secessionist activities in any part of the globe. Their claim may not be wrong, but it does not seem that staff of the White House have the professional skill to prove their claim in the case of India. It should be noted that the Indian Government did not hesitate to lodge a strong protest in this regard. New Delhi also expressed its dissatisfaction over the issue through its ambassador in Washington, Siddharta Shankar Ray. It is necessary to lodge protests against the tendency of the present U.S. administration to indulge in unnecessary bossing. However, it would not be proper to think that the responsibility of India is over after the lodging of the protest. It is a type of weakness to display reaction over all matters. On one hand, we claim that human rights are not being violated in Punjab, Kashmir, or any other part of the country, while on the other, we will express our anger if anyone wants to probe into the alleged violations. This is not fair. In the past, several attempts were made to tarnish the image of our armed forces by bringing false charges against them. This is not acceptable. It is necessary to follow an open-door policy with a view to protecting the image of our armed forces. This would help in removing the doubts and the concern being expressed over human rights violations. It is true that the army and the police sometimes resort to repression, but the number of such incidents is very small. For this reason, it is good to confess the truth. This is the best way to close the mouths of those who protest. We should give up the habit of concealing to make others think that we have nothing to conceal. *
