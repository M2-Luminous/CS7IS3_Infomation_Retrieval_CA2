The document is ready for signing, the ministry said, adding that it enables people in both countries to cross the border into the other country regardless of official border crossings and to stay in the other signatory country's border area. The agreement includes third country nationals exempt from visa requirements for both of the two signatory countries and the European Union. The agreement is a sign of good relations between Germany and the Czech Republic, German Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said, adding he hoped it would spark development in the tourist industry and other kinds of enterprise in the area. The Czech Government approved a Czech-German Border Treaty on Thursday [13 January], Czech Government Office Spokesman Ladislav Pistora said, pointing out that the agreement on border area traffic approved by the German ministry is a separate and different document. Governments of neighboring countries conclude agreements on border area traffic as a matter of routine, Czech Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Lucie Pilipova said, adding that such documents include an arrangement on border facility maintenance.
