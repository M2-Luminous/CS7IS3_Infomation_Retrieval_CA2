Two shells fell about 300 metres (yards) east of the Grbavica bridge, which links the downtown Serb-held district with the rest of the city that is controlled by the Moslem-dominated government army, according to Guy Vinet, a UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) officer. A third shell was later reported falling on the outskirts of the city. There were no immediate reports of injuries and Eric Chaperon, UNPROFOR spokesman, described the shelling as part of the usual cease-fire violations. Government and Serb forces, faced with a threat of NATO airstrikes, were ordered in February to place all heavy weapons under UN control or move them outside a 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone.
