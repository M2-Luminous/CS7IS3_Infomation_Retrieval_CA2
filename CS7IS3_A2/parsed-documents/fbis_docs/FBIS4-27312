Follows the full text of the statement: The United Nations Security Council, on May 30, according to a scenario which had been worked out by some member states, published a statement of its president groundlessly slandering the DPRK and containing the unreasonable claim that the fuel rods must be replaced strictly in compliance with the practical demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the opportunity of selected separation and preservation of fuel rods might be lost. It is entirely wrong for the Security Council to have discussed the question of the DPRK on the basis of the wrong judgment made by the secretariat of the agency without any justifiable reason. It was only a few days ago that negotiations on the refueling of the 5 megawatt experimental atomic power station was held between the DPRK and the agency. The main question discussed at the negotiations was the preservation of technical possibilities of future measurement of replaced fuel rods and there was a sufficient debate on the reasonableness of the method applied by the DPRK at present. The agency said it would seriously study that method and the two sides agreed to continue to discuss it in the future negotiations. And it was confirmed that none of the fuel rods replaced this time had been diverted to another purpose and, practically, the whole course of current refueling is going on in the presence of agency inspectors and under a strict control of inspection cameras. We must ask what justification the UN Security Council has to put the question of the DPRK on its agenda and discuss it now. If things were to take a correct track, the Security Council should have called in question not the DPRK, but some quarters of the agency secretariat. Before starting refueling, we had requested the agency several times to take necessary measures such as its presence and the removal of the seals. But it failed to send a group of inspectors till refueling began, thus openly neglecting its duty as an international organisation. This was what some quarters of the secretariat did. Even when we allowed "an additional inspection" which alluded to "an inspection left incomplete" at the time of the inspection in March, they shunned it, thus intentionally ignoring the statement of the president of the UN Security Council dated March 31. It was also the IAEA Secretariat that distorted the fact by talking as if the negotiation had broken down and hurriedly transferred the problem to the UN Security Council without a clear explanation, categorically denying the method of the DPRK even before the negotiating delegation of the IAEA which had promised to study it arrived at the head office in Vienna. This act was aimed at putting the DPRK in the "[word indistinct]" by justifying their past behavior in concocting "inconsistency" against the DPRK on the basis of false information. It is only too natural that DPRK which has engaged itself only in peaceful nuclear activities as a dignified independent, sovereign state will not yield to such unreasonable act of the IAEA Secretariat and allow itself to be treated as an "offender." So, the UN Security Council, instead of finding fault with the DPRK, should have taken issue with some officials of the IAEA Secretariat who laid hurdles in the way of the DPRK's peaceful nuclear activities, framed a sinister political intrigue to shift the blame on to the DPRK and transferred the problem to the United Nations. It is also self-contradictory that the presidential statement of the UN Security Council unreasonably urged the DPRK to allow selected separation and preservation of fuel rods and preservation of the possibility of future measurement. Since we are in a unique status after a temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty], it is clear that we cannot accept such routine and ad hoc inspection as selected preservation of fuel rods. A full understanding of this was reached at the recent negotiations with the IAEA. Although we are refueling the reactor in a unique status, we are doing the utmost to show the transparency of our nuclear activities. The refueling is taking place in such a manner as to fully preserve the technical possibility of measuring the fuel rods as requested by the IAEA when our unique status comes to an end. This is a most scientific and realistic method invented by our scientists and facility operators with a high sense on cooperation, motivated by their consistent position to show the uprightness of the nuclear activities. Its feasibility has fully been proved through experiments. If this method of our style is applied, it will be possible to reproduce the channel and order of any fuel rods and measure them correctly in the future. At the recent negotiations in Pyongyang, we gave the IAEA side a full explanation of our-style method concerning the replacement of fuel rods and suggested with a good intention that if there were any more questions to be discussed, negotiations should be held any time. There have been attempts these days to create the "urgency" of the situation by alleging that the pace of the refueling is too fast. Since it is part of the pure peaceful nuclear activities and technical possibilities for ensuring the continuity of safeguards and measuring fuel rods in the future are fully guaranteed, there is no ground for taking issue with the speed of refueling. It was necessary to test the maximum efficiency of the refueling machine that our refueling progressed at a rather fast speed some time ago. This was also a normal course of the peaceful nuclear activities. So, this is hardly a matter for surprise. Such being a case, at a time when everything is progressing on a normal track, the UN Security Council discussed the biased report submitted by some officials of the IAEA Secretariat without any examination and hurriedly adopted a presidential statement. It is really hard to understand. This was because they were too dull to sense the reality or thy were affected by some sinister political background. If the UN Security Council, for this matter, is disgracefully charged with being manipulated by some specified member nations while ignoring its noble mission to be responsible for world peace and security, it will be a shame to history. Originally, the foundation of the existence of an international organisation is impartiality. If the IAEA Secretariat and the UN Security Council, bereft of impartiality, insist on pressure with an unreasonable intention [words indistinct] feel any need to be restricted by such pressure. It is more than intolerable that we have suffered from big obstacles in our peaceful nuclear activities, restricted by the unilateral demand of the IAEA. In case pressure is put on us again, we will no longer fall a victim to the unreasonable demand but will have to go our own way, unhindered by anything. This is the unshakable will of the Korean people, who regard independence as their life and blood. If some officials of the IAEA Secretariat declare that the technical possibilities of the future measurement of fuel rods were gone or the UN Security Council put pressure on the DPRK, threatening "sanctions" under that pretext, we cannot but take decisive countermeasures, rather freeing ourselves from such unreasonable restrictions than suffering from them, and we will be left with no other choice but to [word indistinct] over to the continuous process of the peaceful nuclear activities. We will respond any time with utmost sincerity to the intention to deal with the issue in a fair way and resolve it in a peaceful way through dialogue. But we will counter without slightest compromise any intention to unjustifiably put pressure on us, ignoring our sovereignty, if but a little.
