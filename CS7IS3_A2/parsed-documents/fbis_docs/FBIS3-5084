With the working group on China's joining GATT set to meet in Geneva in mid-March, the government will present China with a list of products including textiles, machinery, and electrical equipment, on which Japan wants it to reduce duty rates. Japan will also ask China to open up its markets in the service areas of trading agency business, distribution, and telecommunications. The duty rates in China, averaging more than 30 percent, are conspicuously higher than those of Japan, Europe, and the United States. China hopes to be admitted to GATT within this year, and GATT member nations like Japan, the United States, and European nations have expressed a willingness to support its admission. But with tariff rates so high and service markets not open enough, China is expected to have a tough time negotiating admission. Japan intends to work on China to reduce its tariff rates and open up its service sector, to help China in its negotiations on admission to GATT. As a result of the year-end agreement in the Uruguay Round of talks on tariff reductions, the average tariff duty rate for Japan came down to 1.5 percent, and that for Europe and the United States to the 3-percent level. Coming into 1994, China effected a large-scale tariff reduction of its own, but tariff rates in general still remain high, with, for instance, the import duty rates for gasoline-fueled vehicles of less than 3,000cc in displacement and color television sets running to 110 percent and 50 percent, respectively. The government will suggest large-scale tariff rate reductions primarily on Japan's key export products to China like machinery, textiles, and electric equipment. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is now studying the specific rates to suggest, but also is considering first suggesting actions on rates which exceed 50 percent. For Japan, China is the second largest trading partner after the United States, and the government hopes to expand its exports by having the latter reduce import duties. In the service market, Japan will call on China to open up the trading agency business which is currently under state control, and to also open up the distribution and telecommunications markets. At present, China and also Taiwan are getting ready to join GATT, and member nations agree: "Taiwan should be admitted after China is admitted." China in effect is accepting GATT's admission of Taiwan. That being the case, once China's admission into GATT becomes certain, the government will start negotiations on tariff reductions with Taiwan.
