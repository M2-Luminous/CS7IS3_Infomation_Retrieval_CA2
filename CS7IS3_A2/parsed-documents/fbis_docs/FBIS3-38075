Commenting at the request of an ITAR-TASS correspondent on today's decision of the Federation Council to allocate an additional military contingent for the UN forces, the diplomat stressed that we do not need confrontation and war, but we need a strong foreign policy based on a democratic consensus. Today's parliament decision, adopted at Yeltsin's request, will make it possible, he says, to hope that that is exactly how it will be. Churkin reported that for the time being the issue of expanding the presence of Russian troops in other places is not on the agenda. In general, he thinks that the crisis over Sarajevo -- the behavior of the Russian side and of our Western partners, who are NATO members -- needs to be analyzed seriously. During the crisis our attempts to solve issues amicably with them did not always produce a response, the deputy minister noted. That is why now, he believes, we need to formulate our position more precisely and to defend it in an equally precise way.
