Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, who led the delegation, believes the signing of the memorandum on mutual understanding between the governments of Ukraine and the United States on the transfer of missile equipment and technology has become an important step in Ukraine's accession to the world distribution of labor in the implementation of space programs, since no country owns a complete production cycle in this area. The document also illustrates the fact that "Ukraine has joined the group of civilized countries, instead of falling to the level of Iraq or North Korea." In the course of negotiations, the Ukrainian side managed to persuade the United States to lift the clause in the agreement on space cooperation between the United States and Russia that concerns the countries of the former Soviet Union as one which infringes upon the rights of the third party. Giving a generally favorable assessment of the trip's results, Valeriy Kazakov, deputy minister of machine-building, military- industrial complex, and conversion, said that despite U.S. assurances of a fine state of relations between the United States and Ukraine, economic cooperation and work in the sphere of conversion is proceeding slowly. A great deal of attention during the visit was paid to the intensification of conversion programs. For example, it was possible to agree to a list of 35 enterprises subject to immediate restructuring. The U.S. side has allocated 20 million dollars to this end. Asked by UNIAN to comment on the breakthrough in the U.S. attitude to Ukraine, Deputy Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk said it reflected international reality and our country's consistent policy stance. Tarasyuk emphasized that this change began after the signing of the trilateral statement by Ukraine, Russia, and the United States.
