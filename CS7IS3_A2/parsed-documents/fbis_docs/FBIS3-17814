Boris Suprugin, addressing the Russian president's commission on citizenship on Tuesday, urged Moscow to take action against what he qualified as discrimination against Russian speakers and to link Russia's economic assistance to Kazakhstan to this problem. He also insisted that the Russian government press for dual citizenship for North Kazakhstan's Russian-speaking community, which accounts for about 80 percent of the region's population, and for Russian speakers throughout Kazakhstan. Since the Kazakh government refused to allow Russia to open its consulates in Kazakhstan, Suprugin asked the Russian Foreign Ministry to set up consulates in Russian regions bordering on the Central Asian republic to make it easier for its ethnic Russians to receive Russian citizenship. Suprugin demanded an official status for Kazakhstan's Cossack community to make it "a state structure that would make it possible to keep on tenterhooks states which violate the rights of their Russian population." He said Russia should not have signed with Kazakhstan an agreement to lease from it the Baykonur spacecraft-launching complex for $115 Mn, for the complex had been built at Russia's expense. He expressed the apprehension that a similar agreement would be made on the 200-km section of the Trans-Siberian Railway running through Kazakhstan.
