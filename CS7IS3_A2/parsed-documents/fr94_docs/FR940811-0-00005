FR940811-0-00005 FR940811-0-00003 7 CFR Part 985 [FV94&hyph;985&hyph;2FIR] Spearmint Oil Produced in the Far West; Revision of the Salable Quantity and Allotment Percentage for ``Class 3'' Native Spearmint Oil for the 1993&hyph;94 Marketing Year AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim final rule to increase the quantity of Class 3 (Native) spearmint oil produced in the Far West that handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers during the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year. This rule was recommended by the Spearmint Oil Administrative Committee (Committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order for spearmint oil produced in the Far West. This rule was recommended in order to avoid extreme fluctuations in supplies and prices and thus help to maintain stability in the spearmint oil market. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert J. Curry, Northwest Marketing Field Office, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, 1220 S.W. Third Avenue, Room 369, Portland, Oregon 97204; telephone: (503) 326&hyph;2724; or Caroline C. Thorpe, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, Room 2525, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, D.C. 20090&hyph;6456; telephone: (202) 720&hyph;5127. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 985 (7 CFR Part 985), regulating the handling of spearmint oil produced in the Far West (Washington, Idaho, Oregon, and designated parts of California, Nevada, Montana, and Utah), hereinafter referred to as the ``order.'' This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions of the marketing order now in effect, salable quantities and allotment percentages may be established for classes of spearmint oil produced in the Far West. This rule increases the quantity of Class 3 spearmint oil produced in the Far West that may be purchased from or handled for producers by handlers during the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year, which ended on May 31, 1994. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are eight spearmint oil handlers subject to regulation under the order and approximately 260 producers of spearmint oil in the regulated production area. Of the 260 producers, approximately 160 producers hold ``Class 1'' (Scotch) oil allotment base, and 145 producers hold ``Class 3'' (Native) oil allotment base. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. A minority of handlers and producers of Far West spearmint oil may be classified as small entities. The interim final rule was issued on April 20, 1994, and published in the April 28, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 21917), with an effective date of April 28, 1994. That rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended May 31, 1994. No comments were received. The Far West spearmint oil industry is characterized by producers whose farming operations generally involve more than one commodity and whose income from farming operations is not exclusively dependent on the production of spearmint oil. The U.S. production of spearmint oil is concentrated in the Far West, primarily Washington, Idaho, and Oregon (part of the area covered by the order). Spearmint oil is also produced in the Midwest. The production area covered by the order normally accounts for 75 percent of the annual U.S. production of spearmint oil. This rule continues in effect the increase in the salable quantity and allotment percentage of Native spearmint oil that handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers during the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year, which ended on May 31, 1994. This rule also continues in effect the increase in the salable quantity from 714,665 pounds to 772,611 pounds and the allotment percentage from 37 percent to 40 percent for Native spearmint oil. The salable quantity is the total quantity of each class of oil which handlers may purchase from, or handle on behalf of, producers during a marketing year. Each producer is allotted a share of the salable quantity by applying the allotment percentage to the producer's allotment base for the applicable class of spearmint oil. The initial salable quantities and allotment percentages for both Native and Scotch spearmint oils for the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year were recommended by the Committee at its October 15, 1992, meeting. The Committee recommended salable quantities of 714,665 pounds and 716,164 pounds for Native and Scotch oils, respectively, and allotment percentages of 37 percent and 41 percent for Native and Scotch oils, respectively.
