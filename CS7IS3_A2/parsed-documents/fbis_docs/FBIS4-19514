The European foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg yesterday felt helpless. A meager consolation, however, is that all the parties involved in the Bosnian crisis without exception have been slapped in the face in Goradze. "Neither the UN nor the NATO actions have been able to help Goradze in a decisive way," German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said. However, the Twelve have not resigned themselves to giving up nor agreed to put up with a further deterioration of the situation. "We do not accept fait accomplis," Alain Juppe said. "The diplomatic initiative must resume." In line with the request put forward by Paris, the Twelve are urging the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution which includes the four proposals of Yasuhsi Akashi, UN special envoy to former Yugoslavia: immediate cease-fire in Goradze, withdrawal of Serbian troops to the positions they occupied before the attacks, guaranteed exclusion zone around the town, and deployment of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR). No additional pressure will be exerted, however, including the threat of air strikes. But turning those elements into a Security Council resolution will give them additional force, according to the Twelve. "Goradze has become a symbol," according to Klaus Kinkel. "A withdrawal of the UN troops will not benefit anyone, not even to the Serbs themselves." "They are acting out of despair because they feel isolated," Willy Claes believes. "But by attacking the blue helmets, they are playing with dynamite." A lifting of the sanctions against Belgrade is out of the question. "We cannot accept this blackmail," a minister stressed. "First, the West must make clear demands and the Serbs must send a positive sign, then we will see...." As far as leaving former Yugoslavia is concerned, "no one envisages such an option," Mr. Claes added. The real new element is the willingness of all sides to achieve better cooperation between the UN, European, Russian, and U.S. negotiators. "One day the Serbs talk to Churkin, the next day they see Redman, and then Akashi," Alain Juppe complained. "On the day they entered Goradze, the Serbs explained to Messrs. Akashi and Churkin that they were ready to negotiate." To put an end to the game being played by the Serbs, the Europeans suggest that the four main powers should create a joint negotiating team that would make it possible to put pressure on the warring sides. "The three parties have agreed to return to the negotiating table," according to the French. "But it has not materialized because they have not found any unified front. Moreover, the Goradze case has been badly managed." According to the French, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher "has not said `no.'" Russian negotiator Vitaly Churkin has supposedly approved the principle of a joint forum.
