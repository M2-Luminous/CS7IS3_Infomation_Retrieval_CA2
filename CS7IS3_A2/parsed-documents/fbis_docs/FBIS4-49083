Under the cover of tanks, troops from a reconnaissance squad launched a fierce attack on a high area guarded by the "enemy." Machineguns on the tanks spurted flames [as received], while mortars continually shelled positions afar. Before we knew it, brave soldiers who kept appearing and disappearing in the billowing smoke had planted an army flag on the "enemy's" position ... [ellipses as received] Hong Kong notables seated on the reviewing stand burst into applause. Yesterday, 216 Hong Kong notables arrived for a visit to Guangzhou-based troops under the Guangzhou Military Region [GMR]. This morning, the Hong Kong compatriots went to the GMR firing range in Guangzhou's suburbs by car to watch a military show put on by a unit. At 0930, Henry Fok Ying-tung, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Lu Ping, director of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office; and Zhou Nan, director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, reviewed Guangzhou-based unit in the company of GMR Political Commissar Shi Yuxiao amid powerful and majestic martial music. "Its military spirit was shaped by strict discipline, its fame shakes the southern territory." This unit possesses triphibious capability for ground, sea, and air battles. Highly difficult and dangerous training programs, such as the 10,000-meter swim at sea, emergency maneuver across 1,000 km, field survivorship, and parachuting produced this "sharp sword of Lingnan [Guangdong and Guangxi]," which is well known throughout south China. Two signal flares lifted into the air with a pop, raising the curtain for the military show. Four shooters shot down their targets to display 20 big red characters -- "politically qualified, militarily skillful, functionally sound, observing strict discipline, providing powerful safeguards" -- in front of the audience, winning a burst of warm applause. After that, the officers and men performed 10 programs, including "rapid mobile firing," "hand-to-hand combat," and "sub-squads seizing important positions behind enemy lines." Nine officers and men accurately shot the head, chest, and right and left legs of a "human body" at the first try. Mr. Henry Fok Ying-tung, seated on the reviewing stand, picked up the microphone and said: "Will shooter No. 2 please shoot the left leg of human target No. 1?" As his voice died down, the rifle immediately fired and got the target's left leg. Lu Ping and then Zhou Nan also instructed in succession specific shooters to shoot specific spots and the targets were missed not even once. "I have been to many countries and watched some military shows. Our Liberation Army's military skills and caliber are among the best." Before Mr. Li Jinwen [7812 6930 2429], a lawyer at a Hong Kong legal firm, could finish his words, his wife chipped in at his side: "These young men are all excellent in martial arts. It is really amazing that each one could skillfully handle eight or nine different kinds of weapons." As the Hong Kong notables were praising the sharpshooters, a dozen or so fully armed soldiers wearing camouflage coats fired from the top right-hand side of the reviewing stand. All acted like tigers with wings and compelled admiration when they performed the program of "traction and traversing" [qian yin heng du 3677 1714 2897 3256]. Mine-laying with rockets pushed the show to its climax. Rockets shot into the sky one after another, making piercing whizzes. Like petals slipping from the hand of a fairy maiden, mines hanging on small parachutes showered on the ground and thick growth of grass, building a formidable defense line and creating a sea of death. At 1100, the military show concluded amid applause and praises. Madam Zhang Yongzhen [1728 3057 3791], vice president of the Hong Kong Chinese Chamber of Commerce, told reporters with feeling: "I shed tears with joy after watching the soldiers' brilliant performance. The people's safety and well-being and the country's strength and prosperity are inseparable from the strong army of the people. I am proud that our country has such a powerful and civilized army." On behalf of the visiting group of Hong Kong notables, Mr. Henry Fok Ying-tung presented the troops with a silver plate engraved with the characters "Steel Great Wall" and also wrote "Steel Great Wall" as his message in the visitors' book. The Hong Kong notables enthusiastically posed with the officers and men for photographs and shook hands with them in farewell.
