The country has been maintaining such agreements with Central America since the 1970's. Panama has bilateral preferential commercial agreements with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. This kind of contract, however, is not limited to the region. Panama has also signed treaties with members of the Latin American Integration Association (Aladi), specifically Mexico and Colombia. In addition, the government is forwarding talks in that direction with Ecuador and Venezuela. Carlos Castaneda, director of the Panamanian Foreign Trade Institute (IPCE), has told EL PANAMA AMERICA "all these agreements are directed at increasing and strengthening commercial relations between contracting parties." The official said that "with such agreements, Panama has achieved a sustained increase in its trade relations with Central America." Statistics indicate a total of approximately $100 million in overall commercial activities between Panama and Central America. The official said this result benefits the business sector and, consequently, the country's economic policy. The figures show 62 percent of that amount represents imports from Central America into Panama, which suggests a trade balance deficit for the country. The IPCE director argued Panama is an importing country, given its service-oriented economy. He added overall trade figures for Panama and the rest of the world total $2 billion, 1.5 billion of which are imports. Costa Rica is Panama's major economic partner with 56.3 percent of the total. Guatemala (21 percent), El Salvador (13.8 percent), Honduras (5.8 percent), and Nicaragua (2.3 percent) follow in order of importance. Under these commercial contracts, Panama has exported $37.4-million worth of goods, of which $21.7 million are the product of negotiations with Costa Rica. According to official figures, Costa Rica sold Panama more than $47 million last year, while it purchased $35 million. The main products Panama exports via these preferential and free trade agreements are medicines, condensed milk, spices and condiments, tomato-based products, mayonnaise, cheese, cosmetics, packaged tea, shrimp, and aluminum containers. Panama receives mostly chemicals, fertilizers, and batteries from Central America. Regarding trade relations with Mexico and Colombia, Castaneda said Panama has signed several partial preference agreements. Concerning Mexico, import tax preferences are unilateral and nonreciprocal in Panama's favor, meaning 110 products entering Mexico under the agreement receive partial tax exemptions, but Panama is not obligated to grant these same privileges. Trade with Colombia, based on a recent agreement signed in July 1993 and pending approval at the National Assembly, includes 10 products yet to be negotiated. It is expected the agreement will lead to higher levels than with Central America, due to the development and size of the Colombian market, with its more than 40 million inhabitants.
