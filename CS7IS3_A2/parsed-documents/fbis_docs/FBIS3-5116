This is a very rude outburst throwing a wet blanket over the North-South working contact for the exchange of special envoys now promoted as part of the implementation of the steps of simultaneous action agreed upon between the DPRK and the United States. It is also a sinister attempt to create artificial obstacles and block the exchange of special envoys. Kim Yong-sam's talk about "nuclear card of the North" was aimed at isolating and stifling the North by branding it as a "nuclear culprit." While taking an insincere attitude toward the exchange of special envoys, Kim Yong-sam claimed that unless a "meaningful exchange of special envoys" is realised, the United States would never hold the third round of talks with the North." This is an imprudent outcry of a fool. It is ridiculous, indeed, for the colonial puppet who has no interest in the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and has no say to obtrusively behave as if he were a spokesman of the U.S State Department. This meant, in other words, that the traitor Kim Yong-sam ordered the United States to do this or that. But the folly of the colonial puppet wielding the baton at his master will make a cat laugh. The traitor also talked about the "importance of the cooperation system." This revealed once again his true color as a dyed-in-the-wool flunkeyist and heinous traitor to the nation who stoops to any infamy to do harm to fellow countrymen. Facts show that as long as Kim Yong-sam the fool remains at the "presidential" post in "Chongwadae," the Korean nation cannot live in peace even a moment nor can the desire of the South Korean people for independence, democracy and national reunification be realised. The Kim Yong-sam group engaged in treacheries will have to pay for the arch crime it has committed against history and the people.
