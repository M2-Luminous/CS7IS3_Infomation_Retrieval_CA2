In a statement, Arsenis also said that the coordination is necessary because the two countries face a common danger. The Greek national defense minister noted that a prerequisite for the coordination of defense plans is the coordination of armaments programs. That is why, during his visit, he will be accompanied by the president and other officials of the greek arms industry. Asked why a common defense goal had not been promoted in the past, Arsenis said that perhaps in the past there was too much optimism about the initiatives for a diplomatic solution. In order to promote a diplomatic, political, and viable solution, Arsenis stressed that we should have high credibility in the area of defense. [passage omitted]
