Addressing the ceremony marking the close of the course for the first marines in the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola's [MPLA] navy yesterday, Joao de Matos said that, quote, we must continue training forces like these, so that we can be more effective in combat, unquote. The MPLA war chieftain once again resorted to his usual excuses, saying the victim is the aggressor, and alleging that the FAPLA forces will continue to defend themselves in the face of aggression by the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, when in fact he is the one who is ordering the FAPLA forces to go on an offensive against Cuanza Norte, Cuanza Sul, Lunda Norte, Lunda Sul, Zaire, Huila, Moxico, and Bengo Provinces, among others. The MPLA's increasingly bellicose behavior is closely related to the inflexibility of the Faustino Muteka-led government team to the Lusaka peace talks, thereby confirming reports that the MPLA is only wasting time in the Zambian capital while waiting for the arrival of mercenaries and military equipment imported from foreign countries.
