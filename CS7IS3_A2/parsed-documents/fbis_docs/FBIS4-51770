Speaking to business leaders at a breakfast meeting held under the auspices of the Korea Management Association at the Hyatt Hotel, Song also said various government agencies were devising measures to help the loggers settle in South Korea. While delivering a speech entitled "The Outlook for the North Korean Nuclear Problem and the Seoul-Pyongyang Relationship," Song revealed that Pyongyang has stopped issuing travel certificates to North Koreans and strictly limited entry by foreigners since mid-March in an apparent effort to heighten internal tension. Pyongyang recently increased military activity 50 percent and resumed anti-air raid drills in the Yongbyon area, which Western countries suspect has facilities capable of producing nuclear weapons, Song said. North Korea had suspended the drills in the Yongbyon area last June.
