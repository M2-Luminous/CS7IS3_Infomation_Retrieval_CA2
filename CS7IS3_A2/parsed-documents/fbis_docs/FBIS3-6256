Concerning this, Hwang Chang-yop, secretary for international affairs of the Workers' Party who is in charge of North Korean diplomatic affairs, visited Vietnam from 7 to 10 March, and examined the background of Vietnam improving relations with the United States after the Vietnam war and the procedure to resume economic cooperation. Holding talks with high-ranking officials from the Vietnamese Communist Party, Secretary Hwang discussed the issue of the remains of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam. On 11 March, he visited Laos and discussed the issue of importing Lao-produced rice. Past North Korean SPA sessions debated buget and reorganization issues and the adoption of important resolutions as key agenda. On 14 March, one of the National Unification Board officials said: We paid close attention to the visit of Secretary Hwang, who actually supervises North Korean diplomacy toward Vietnam before the SPA session. Thus, there is a great possibility that the forthcoming SPA will make important decisions on the nuclear issue and on its relations with the United States. This official, however, noted that the possibility that steps will be taken for Kim Chong-il's succession to power is slim.
