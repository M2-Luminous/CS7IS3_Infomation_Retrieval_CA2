This influential member of the German CDU [Christian Democratic Union], 64 years of age, is very familiar with this institution because he has held a seat in it since 1973, and from 1984 to 1992 he chaired one of its most influential political groups: the European Peoples' Party. So he is one of the authors of Parliament's increasing powers, something which Germany in particular has wanted. In his opinion, the only body of the European Union [EU] which "meets and makes decisions publicly" should be given more powers, in particular "codecisionmaking powers for all legislative activities which are decided by the Council by a majority vote." His successor will also have to guarantee "the full implementation of the Maastricht Treaty" and "the deepening" of the EU through future enlargement. Therefore, the EU Parliament will have to "participate appropriately in the preparations for the intergovernmental conference in 1996." [Docquiert] What is the main lesson you have learned from the legislative session just ended? [Klepsch] Since the third direct election of June 1989, the European Parliament has increased its importance, influence, powers, and prestige considerably. It has made a decisive contribution to the economic and political progress of the last few years. It participated in the implementation and entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, the European Economic Area, and a number of agreements with third countries. It has managed to strengthen its role as a democratic supervisory body defending the interests of the people. Outside the Union, the European Parliament is considered a model for democratic development. [Docquiert] What strengths and weaknesses of the European Parliament have been highlighted? [Klepsch] One of the strengths of the Parliament lies in the fact that it has continually managed to find compromise solutions across national borders and the boundaries of the political parties. Moving beyond national interests and barriers, a European way of looking at things has taken root. In some cases, however, the contradictions proved too great, in particular with respect to the Commission's white paper on economic growth and employment, on which it was impossible to define a uniform position. This is undeniably one low-point of the legislative session which has just ended. [Docquiert] Do you feel that, because of Parliament's debates and work, the commitments made in Maastricht are beginning to take concrete form? [Klepsch] Even before the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, the European Parliament had finished the preparations needed to implement it. Several interinstitutional agreements have entered into force since late October 1993. Since then, a number of reconciliation procedures with the Council of Ministers have been successfully concluded. The Parliament stressed its point of view several times, especially during the procedure for adopting the new multiannual research program. The newly elected Parliament will shortly make use of its new right to ratify the nomination of the president of the Commission and the entire composition of the Commission. Thus, the practical implementation of the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty is continuing without a break. [Docquiert] The Treaty on European Union grants new powers to the Parliament. How do you see its role in the future vis-a-vis the Council and the Commission? [Klepsch] The European Parliament, which is the European Union's only directly elected institution, is also the only body which meets and makes decisions publicly. The Council and Commission work behind closed doors. It is important to make the activities and decisions of these two bodies more transparent. We must make Europe more understandable to the people. The European Parliament must broaden the codecisionmaking powers that it currently enjoys in the internal market and the key sectors to include all legislative activities which are approved by the Council with a majority vote. In addition, the Parliament demands full budget powers, i.e., powers which cover obligatory spending as well as "receipts." Moreover, it demands the right to approve amendments to the Treaty. Only under these conditions will the European Parliament be able to fully assume its role in the democratic debate and in the cooperative efforts with the Council and Commission. [Docquiert] What must the priorities of your successor be? [Klepsch] My successor, whether a man or a woman, should make it a priority to go after the full implementation of the provisions set out in the Maastricht Treaty. The comprehensive institutional reform and the parallel implementation of enlargement and deepening demanded by the European Parliament are still current issues. It is important that the European Parliament participate appropriately in the preparations for the intergovernmental conference to be held in 1996. The new Parliament and its 567 deputies representing 346 million EU citizens must make the most of this occasion to successfully push through other legitimate demands.
