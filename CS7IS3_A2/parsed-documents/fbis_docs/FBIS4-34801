It will be preceded by four regional marches that will end in Plaza de Mayo on 6 July. The decision was announced on 22 June by Cordoba Provincial Governor Eduardo Angeloz, who heads the UCR's Political Action Commission. The UCR's adhesion, which politically strengthens the labor sector's call, was preceded by support from some internal sectors of the UCR -- like the Convergence Sector, headed by Federico Storani and Juan Manuel Casella; the Centennial Athenaeum faction, headed by Jesus Rodriguez; and the Radical Youth. The decision announced by Angeloz has the support of UCR President Raul Alfonsin, who is represented by Leopoldo Moreau on the Political Action Commission. The Cordoba provincial governor explained that the UCR "adheres to and calls upon the people" to join the march because "there is a legitimate demand by a society that has been crushed by the economic debacle." The Grand Front and the Social Unity also adhere to the Federal March. The main leaders of these groups participated last week in a meeting with the labor leaders that head the mobilization: Victor De Genaro of the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA), and Juan Manuel Palacios and Saul Ubaldini of the Argentine Workers Movement (MTA). Cordoba (From our bureau) -- The Federal March will apparently not have massive support in Cordoba. The caravan coming from the northwest, which has been organized by state workers of that region, will pass through this city on the night of 4 July. A leader of the Union Liaison Board, which coordinates all Cordoba Province labor sectors, told CLARIN that it will formally adhere to the march next week. Notwithstanding, the degree of commitment to the march by members of the board, which was created on the eve of the 10 June general provincial strike, fluctuates. The local leaders of the CTA, which is one of the organizers of the Federal March, sounded out the possibility of launching another general strike on 4 July. Their colleagues from the CGT [General Confederation of Labor] Chacabuco faction, especially those who belong to the Labor Organization and Action Movement (MOAS), refused to go along. The Union Liaison Board on 22 June decided to invite other intermediate organizations to join the demonstration against the economic policy. The weight of the mobilization will basically fall on the Sanitary Works Union, the ATE (State Workers Association), and the Printers Union, which are all grouped in the CTA, and on the leftist political organizations. Other sectors of the Cordoba provincial labor movement, which have an ample majority, will only give their formal support.
