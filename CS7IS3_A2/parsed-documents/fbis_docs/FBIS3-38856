The European 12 at yesterday's meeting reiterated EU support to the realization of the joint plan, Juppe said. At the same time, he put forward an assessment that the plan has not been realized so far due to insufficient contribution by the United States and Russia. The political and diplomatic EU action is aimed at convincing both countries to exert political pressure on Serbia and Croatia in the Geneva talks. Juppe explained to Minister Ljubijankic that the EU plan should not be viewed as something definite, in the sense of take it or leave it. On the contrary, Europe is willing to improve it. The condition for this is a sincere approach to the negotiations by all sides. According to the French minister, the next NATO meeting in Brussels will be very significant regarding even sharper articulation of the stances taken by the European Union. He underscored that the final decision will, nevertheless, be passed by the EU ministers on the basis of yesterday's declaration. Juppe was interested whether the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities can guarantee security to the Serbs in, as he said, their parts of Sarajevo after the Serbian artillery has withdrawn to a sufficient distance from the town. Minister Ljubijankic reminded that the Serbs in Sarajevo and elsewhere in Bosnia-Herzegovina have never been threatened so far, nor will they be in the future. During the meeting with Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, the Belgian colleague said to our foreign minister that the EU attitude toward a concrete action in Bosnia has definitely changed after the last two massacres in Sarajevo. Claes's conclusion was that the decision about the ultimatum to the Serbs must be brought by NATO after examining all possible consequences. He is convinced that a consensus will be reached, even though the military experts will strive to prophetize caution and risks.
