The Russian poet, staring at the statue, suddenly asked: "Will we ever see the destruction of spiritual tyranny?" This question was not an unexpected one. This is a question familiar to all the enslaved peoples in the Soviet empire. Laughing, I gave the answer: "Sure, this statue will be destroyed, but when it is destroyed and crashes to the ground into thousands of pieces of cast iron and marble, then I will be afraid." I could not have imagined that this joke would turn into reality before even ten years had past because the Soviet empire was perceived as a powerful fortress which no power on earth could destroy. To be sure, Gorbachev did not come to the government to dismantle the empire, nor did Yeltsin. On the contrary, they came to reform this "fortress," to turn it into a modern empire. In fact, as the Russian chauvinists say, not even America could bring it down. The force that destroyed it was history, or something controlling history, the possessor of an iron law outside of man's will. We call this law the will of Allah. I mean to say that today Uzbekistan has attained its political independence, and our people are indebted to no one for this independence. Independence is only Allah's blessing and we are only indebted to Him. Is our people worthy of this blessing? Absolutely. This people survived 135 years in Russia's bondage. Over this long time, Turkestan sacrificed millions of its youths for freedom, and the bravest and most courageous of our people were martyrs on the road to freedom. What kind of people were these people? What kind of bravery did these people, who would take a gun in their hand or if they could not find a gun would take up a club, have to rise up against an empire armed with modern weapons? They were brave because they had feelings of faith, fatherland, freedom, and normal human pride in their hearts. Thus, the empire acted to kill these people's pride and, to a certain extent, succeeded. The lack of faith and pride today is buried under all the spiritual, political, and economic corruption in our life. Let me go on and speak openly. We are now in such a state that, if tomorrow a Russian or another government comes along and begins to reimpose tyranny, we would not have the will to rise up against it. Today our mood is known. Today the government can issue any decree it wants and impose tyranny on the people, if it wants, and the society will not stand up and say "respected government, you have made a mistake!" The present government names the minister it wants, and insults him if it wishes, but the minister does not open his mouth and defend his honor because he has no faith, no pride. A nation made up of such persons could easily endure the tyranny of another nation. The decline of man's will, the lack of honor and faith in our society -- this is an ugly heritage left over from the Russian empire. The time has come to save ourselves from this "inheritance." Now our nation must be recognized as a nation the equal of that of other nations and must learn to demand from every government its own rights appropriate to this. God knows, three years ago I said to President Karimov "first let us be free of Moscow's tyranny, and then if you demonstrate tyranny, we will fight against your tyranny." These words were half truth and half a joke. Now the joke is gone but the truth remains. In Uzbekistan the communist order did not change and we have fought against it from the beginning. We are in the opposition. We are not personal enemies of the president. We are enemies of the old order the president is defending. We are not demanding the resignation of the president, we are demanding the retirement of a transgressor order. This order does not look to the future of our Republic, but toward the past; it is a barrier to opening up the people's potential. Society has sunk deeply into corruption and injustice. It has taught the people spiritual humility. ON UZBEKISTAN'S DOMESTIC POLICY When I criticized this policy, I never intended to say that the general problems, which are special to all the old republics such as the economic difficulties, are the fault of the present government. On the contrary, I am criticizing it for reviving the old totalitarian order under the pretext of the problems left over from the past. Other republics, despite these problems, are acting with all their capability to lay the foundations for their peoples' future. If Uzbekistan's order is not changed, the laughable "democratic Russia" and "democratic Kyrgyzstan," which is always said sarcastically, will achieve economic progress before us. At the same time, we are sitting around and protecting our poverty with the police. This regime is not changing: either it resigns or the people drive it from the government. The people's punishment will be meted out when a new government replaces the old. One cannot say that the present government passed to the people when the old one disgraced itself. This suffering people is reliving the past problems of totalitarianism. For four and a half years now this government has been repeating the saying: "you cannot build a new house until the old one is demolished." It is quite true. We have grasped this piece of wisdom now for four and a half years and hoped that as long as there is peace, everything will be fine. But our hopes have been dashed: it is known that our government has no intention of building a "new house." It intends to repair the shack remaining from the Soviet empire, and is unable to do this. We have not gone forward, we have gone backwards. This backward movement has not just begun. The movement began after the entire government in Uzbekistan passed into the hands of one person -- after the presidential elections. Up to the elections, the government comported itself as if it were somewhat liberal, and imbued with the people's ideas. Until the election, the government had listened to the opinions of the Supreme Assembly and the peoples deputies and its policies advanced because of this. People's representatives could express their recommendations on the social and political conditions in our country, and this situation was very important in the life of the government. Had this mood of freedom continued, the Supreme Assembly, the people's deputies, and the political parties would undoubtedly have helped the government overcome the problems which had emerged. National unity would have turned into reality. After the new government was elected, it began to view every kind of opinion, but its own in a hostile manner. Its first act after the elections was bloodshed: students who demonstrated to show their dissatisfaction with the increase in the price of food on 16 January 1992 were shot. Then, attacks on the opposition parties began. Members of ERK, BIRLIK, and religious functionaries were persecuted without basis, and cases of imprisonment began to occur. 1992 was a bad year for the opposition: BIRLIK was banned, the ERK party's money and printing press were confiscated illegally. First, five viloyat newspapers of this party, then the central ERK newspaper was closed. Although hundreds of complaints came into the Republic administration about these arbitrary actions, not one was answered because it was the administration itself which was doing these arbitrary actions. The life of opposition members who was not imprisoned was turned into a living hell. They constantly lived under persecution by spies and provocation. In brief, Uzbekistan turned into a country of spies, investigators, and prosecutors. At a time when our people are groaning under poverty, the government is spending a substantial part of the national budget for the material needs of the police and the KGB. Certainly, our state has to have powerful and well equipped security organs. The opposition wants this, too. But if this equipment is not built on social justice, the people will not respected these organs, but curse them. In no city in the world except ours do the police rove in bands. One of my foreign friends asked me: "Why are there so many police on the street, was there an incident?" I was unable to answer, because there was no incident; they were afraid that an incident would occur. The police are increasing because those dissatisfied with the government are increasing. In the same was that persecutions are increasing, so are the numbers of people thrown in prison increasing. This is not the fault of the police, it is the fault of the government which is afraid of its own people. Because of this, the government's control over this dissatisfaction serves to increase the dissatisfaction. The government, essentially, is afraid of its own shadow. THE UGLY SCENE IN THE REPUBLIC'S ECONOMIC LIFE Although a law privatizing property has already been passed, privatization has not even begun. All of the companies that opened two years ago are now closed. The market did not break down under the influence of the laws, it was closed down by the government. Consumer goods, including food products, are not readily available. Foreign trade is not in the hands of the state, but has been passed on the relatives of the mighty. The greatest part of the income from foreign trade does not find its way into the national treasury, but into the pockets of unknown persons. Foreign companies will not move into Uzbekistan because we have no unified economic policy and they have no faith in the guarantees of the government. The most frightening thing is that the economic mechanism in the Republic does not operate; it is crippled by bribery, nepotism, and corruption. But the government is inviting foreign capitalists in, saying: "Come to us, we have political unanimity, and bring your capital!" But how long can one oil a rusted chain with the oil of political unanimity? And who will guarantee that this chain will not suddenly fall apart? Is political unanimity held together by force secure or is it dangerous for the people and the government? True unanimity is a unanimity built on the agreement of all groups in the society, and only with this kind of political unanimity is there a basis for a strong economy. The time of the appropriateness of economic liberalism and political authoritarianism has passed. Some of the newly independent states cannot achieve economic development through the old model, or the model of South Korea or Chile because between the 1960s and the 1990s mankind entered into an historically unprecedented dynamic that does not fit into the old molds. Every political leader and every government must understand this historical situation deeply. Today's political repressions have done more damage to Uzbekistan than bribery and corruption, because the capital and credits which are a life necessity to Uzbekistan are not coming in under these circumstances.
