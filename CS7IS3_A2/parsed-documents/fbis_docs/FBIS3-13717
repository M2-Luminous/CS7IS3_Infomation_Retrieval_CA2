In Tehran, the Friday prayers were led by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati. The acting Friday prayer leader of Tehran expressed congratulations on the occasions of the blessed 'Id al-Fitr and the auspicious new year. He stressed that people should use such occasions in order to perform good deeds, in particular deeds such as giving charity and aid to the poor and the underprivileged. [passage omitted] In his second sermon, Ayatollah Jannati thanked the Majles for its careful, timely, and skillful debate on the budget bill. He then referred to the anniversary of the Halabjah tragedy and the silence of international forums, in particular the so-called defenders of human rights, on that and other tragedies, such as the recent atrocity at the Hebron mosque and the continuing criminal acts in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said: These realities show that what is at present being said in the West about human rights is nothing but a political ploy. This ploy, however, is now old and rotten, and it should be clear to every one now that the greatest violator of human rights in the world is in fact America. He stressed: Such insinuations do not, and will never, have any effect whatsoever on the resolute will of the Muslim nation of Iran, and the struggle of the resilient nation of Iran against global arrogance will continue under the wise leadership of His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i.
