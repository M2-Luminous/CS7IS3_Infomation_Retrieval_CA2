In mid-December 1993, public security personnel in the cities of Guiyang, Zunyi, and Liupanshui of Guizhou province "staged work strikes" or "slowed down work." Over 200 public security policemen of Guiyang's public security bureau asked for leave collectively, and Zunyi's public security bureau had to stop work for one week due to a manpower shortage, while personnel of the Liupanshui's public security bureau went to present a petition to the provincial public security department, protesting against "fund shortages" and the "exclusion of bonuses." The fact that public security policemen take a passive attitude toward work has called for a series of countermeasures. Guizhou could not but send troops in the place of policemen for patrol purposes. The Ministry of Public Security sent an investigation group to Guizhou on 24 December.
