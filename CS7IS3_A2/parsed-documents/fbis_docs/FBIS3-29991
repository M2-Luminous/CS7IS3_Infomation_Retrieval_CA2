The Sunkyong Group announced on Tuesday that chairman Choe's planned visit to China from Feb. 24 to March 1 at the invitation of a Chinese oil-refining organization had been put off until the end of March because of problems with his itinerary. The FKI has changed the dates for two leadership meetings on selection of the main shareholder of the second mobile telecommunications firm from Feb. 21 and 25 to Feb. 22 and 23, due to chairman Choe's plans to visit China. Business sources said Choe probably postponed his visit because Pohang Iron and Steel Co. chairman Chong Myong-sik and Kolon Group chairman Yi Tong-chan had failed to agree on who should own the second cellular phone firm at a meeting on Sunday. Chong and Yi are vying for the phone business. Choe made his decision on Monday.
