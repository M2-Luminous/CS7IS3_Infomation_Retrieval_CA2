However, due to technical difficulties, the first 10 minutes of the appearance was missed. Oleksandr Moroz says there is a possibility that two more deputy Supreme Council chairmen will be elected, thereby more fully reflecting the different political forces in the Supreme Council. He says that it had been hoped that the parliamentary commissions would be formed quickly. The process is indeed coming to an end, and given the commissions' composition, he is sure that they will work fruitfully. However, says Oleksandr Moroz, political differences have emerged on the issue of the commission chairmen. According to Moroz, the principle of proportionality has been taken into account in this, too. But some groups, above all those of a right-wing tendency, although not numbering many representatives in parliament, are claiming and insisting on key positions and key commissions. Although this may seem boring to viewers, who are waiting for some results from parliament, Moroz says: "We must now create the conditions so that those results really will appear and so that the changes, which people are waiting for, occur in our state and in our society. The point is that we should change policy, first of all policy in the economic sector. We should move toward reforming the economy, but along which path? The one we have been going along until now? No, that is not right. For people understand very well that this path does not construct one's own economy, this does not strengthen the state. This destroys production, this robs the state. Everyone now understands this. And if someone wanted to reproach me or my supporters, or those who supported my candidacy, saying that we do not want to agree to a compromise, we have sufficient arguments to contradict them." Moroz then cites as examples support for Mykhaylo Kosiv for the commission for culture issues and support for Hryhoriy Omelchenko for the commission for issues of the campaign against corruption and crime, and adds that similar examples of their compromising may be found in all commissions. He continues: "Unfortunately, it appears that not everyone needs the work of the Supreme Council at all. Speculation has begun today on the matter of collecting signatures for the dissolution of the Supreme Council and the introducton of direct presidential rule. Nowhere in the world can one introduce the practice whereby, while the president's activity is coming to an end, he would risk introducing direct presidential rule. There are no grounds for it anyway. Moreover, there is no doubt that we will form working bodies of the Supreme Council on Tuesday 31 May, that we will make, so to speak, a base for legislative work, and in order of their urgency the draft laws, which people are waiting for, will start to work. "And to demand the introduction of direct presidential rule now, with unrest within society, which is caused above all by the collapse of the economy, unfair privatization, and many other ills, is at the very least irresponsible. I think the electors will understand that this is socially conditioned, that someone is directing their representatives toward such steps. I am convinced that the president would not resort to such steps and that he is not involved in this. I and he do not in fact have differences on the matter of the important steps which both the executive and legislative authorities must now take. It is above all about forming a strong executive power." Moroz adds that a new Cabinet of Ministers and prime minister should be appointed urgently without wasting any time, and without waiting for the presidential election. He adds: "One can say, for instance, that the president has now assumed responsibility for executive power, this is understandable. But the combination of the functions of president and head of government, and also the incomplete nature of the vertical structure of executive authority, confirm the necessity of concentrating power in the Cabinet of Ministers, in particular I mean executive power. And I am convinced that the Supreme Council supports such approaches, and that the president also agrees in principle with these approaches." Moroz dwells on the methods used by those not wishing the Supreme Council to work efficiently, for example, not registering for the parliament sitting. If this method continues to be used, Moroz says he will ask the media to print the names of deputies refusing to register. In another case Moroz can see that a deputy from a right-wing group wants to cooperate, but is dependent on a certain political force. Moroz says that he promised deputies today that the organizational process would be completed on 31 May, that he would submit candidacies for heads of commissions, and that the candidacies would be confirmed by voting, taking into account the proposals of all groups as much as possible, but bearing in mind that there can be no ideal solution. He continues: "While understanding the complex situation in our state, I and my deputies have to intervene in specific matters, in the life of the regions, and not only Crimea, not only in the problems of, for instance, agriculture, preparations for the winter, problems of the energy complex, problems of the banking system. We also have to get involved in these problems, although I understand that to some extent these issues are more for the executive power to deal with. But now such intervention is truly needed, because those processes which ensure the freedom of production, facilitate commodity turnover, and an increase and consolidation of the budget should be speeded up." Moroz concludes by saying: "Appealing to you, esteemed electors, I would like to ask you, please support those deputies who conscientiously work in the Supreme Council, who do not endeavor to resort to speculation, to disrupt the sittings, but honestly fulfil their obligations to you. I am convinced that their example will be a good model for other deputies, so that from next week the Supreme Council finally works constructively and efficiently, as current time demands, and as envisaged by the status of the state's highest legislative body. Thank you for your attention."
