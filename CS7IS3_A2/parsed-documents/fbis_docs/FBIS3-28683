The seven-party coalition, in line with Tuesday's accord, called for a one-year, 5.47 trillion yen income and resident tax cut and taxation modifications to rectify inequities. Measures proposed to redress the tax burden inequalities include a levy of 10 percent on entertainment expenses declared by companies even within the currently nontaxable limit and a punitively heavy tax on companies' unexplained expenses. Inheritance taxation would be relaxed by enlarging tax brackets and lowering tax rates. Liquor taxes would be raised, such as a 9 yen tax increase on a 633-milliliter bottle of beer. Also included in the proposal are tax incentives for stimulating land and housing transactions.
