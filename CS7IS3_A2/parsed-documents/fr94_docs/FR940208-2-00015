FR940208-2-00015 FR940208-2-00011 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket No. CP94&hyph;109&hyph;000] Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp.; Intent to Prepare an Environmental Assessment for the Proposed 1995/1996 Southeast Expansion Project and Request for Comments on Environmental Issues February 2, 1994. The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or the Commission) will prepare an environmental assessment (EA) that will discuss environmental impacts of the construction and operation of facilities proposed in the 1995/1996 Southeast Expansion Project. 1 This EA will be used by the Commission in its decision-making process to determine whether an environmental impact statement is necessary and whether or not to approve the project. 1 Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation's (TGPL) application was filed with the Commission under section 7 of the Natural Gas Act and Part 157 of the Commission's regulations. Summary of the Proposed Project TGPL wants Commission authorization to construct, operate, and modify the following facilities, on a phased basis. TGPL would use the facilities to transport up to 165,000 Mcfd of natural gas (115,000 Mcfd in 1995 [Phase I] and 50,000 Mcfd in 1996 [Phase II]) from the interconnection of TGPL's main line and its Mobile Bay Lateral near Butler in Choctaw County, Alabama, to certain points of delivery upstream of TGPL's Compressor Station No. 165 near Chatham, Virginia: Phase I Facilities (1995) •12,600-horsepower (HP) compressor addition at Compressor Station No. 90 in Marengo County, Alabama. •Two 7,000-HP electric drive units to replace two existing 5,620-HP steam turbines on Units 1 and 2 at Compressor Station No. 100 in Chilton County, Alabama. •15.13 miles of 42-inch-diameter loop on Main Line E in Chilton and Autauga Counties, Alabama. •Modifications to existing compressor equipment at Compressor Station No. 110 in Randolph County, Alabama. •12,000-HP compressor addition at Compressor Station No. 120 in Henry County, Georgia. •12,600-HP compressor addition at Compressor Station No. 150 in Iredell County, North Carolina. Phase II Facilities (1996) •6,500-HP compressor addition at Compressor Station No. 100 in Chilton County, Alabama. •12,000-HP compressor addition at Compressor Station No. 120 in Henry County, Georgia. The general location of these facilities is shown in appendix 1. 2 2 The appendices referenced in this notice are not being printed in the Federal Register . Copies are available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, or call (202) 208&hyph;1371. Copies of the appendices were sent to all those receiving this notice in the mail. Land Requirements for Construction The proposed loop would be built adjacent and parallel to existing rights-of-way. TGPL intends to use a 75-foot-wide construction right-of-way. About 15 feet of the planned 75-foot width would use existing right-of-way. Consequently, about 60 feet of new clearing would be required in most areas. Following construction, about 35 feet of the construction right-of-way would be allowed to revert to its former land use. In agricultural areas, a 100-foot-wide construction right-of-way is planned in order to segregate topsoil. Also, additional working space would be required adjacent to the planned construction right-of-way at road and stream crossings. The EA Process The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping.'' The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA. The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under these general headings: •Geology and soils. •Water resources, fisheries, and wetlands. •Vegetation and wildlife. •Endangered and threatened species. •Land use. •Cultural resources. •Air quality and noise. •Hazardous waste. We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process, the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for this proceeding. A comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider all comments on the EA before we recommend that the Commission approve or not approve the project. Currently Identified Environmental Issues We have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed facilities and the environmental information provided by TGPL. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list. The list of issues will be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our analysis. Issues are: •The loop would cross within 50 feet of 5 residences and a church, and would cross 2 orchards. •The pipeline would cross 9 perennial streams, 2 ponds, and 50 wetlands.
