The sermon lasts 17 minutes. In the second sermon he speaks, in part, about the severing of relations with the United States in 1980, which he says is now Muslim's number one enemy, and that Tehran will not reestablish relations with Washington. He says: "One of the great events of the week is the 1980 severing of relations with the United States. This severing of relations is a source of pride for Islamic Iran. Islamic Iran is proud to have such independence of spirit as to be able to put the United States aside. It is very happy about this and it is not prepared to return to American servitude. Although U.S. officials sometimes show courtesy here and there, such courtesies are to no avail as long as the United States does not end its wicked ways in the world [crowd noise] and as long as it does not end its enmity with Islam. The United States has really become the biggest enemy of Islam today. Those courtesies will bear no fruit and as long as the United States is a world Satan, Iranian people are determined not to establish any relations with it."
