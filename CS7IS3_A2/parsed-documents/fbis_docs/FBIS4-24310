Some 5,500 UN troops are expected in war-ravaged Rwanda by the end of July. The ministry added Conakry understood the need for the French-led Operation Turquoise humanitarian mission and wished to underline its "concern in the face of general genocide" being practised between rival Rwandan ethnic factions. Guinean forces are already engaged in UN peacekeeping missions in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Western Sahara.
