The English-Japanese, Japanese-English translator is the first embodiment of the example-based machine translation (EBMT) theory in Japan, the officials said. Under EBMT, machines first memorize example sentences, then translate sentences given, using the stock of memories and the machines ability to make analogies, they said. Conventional translation machines use the so-called transfer system, under which the machines, with a stock of memorized grammar and syntax, first break down the sentences given into parts, translate each, and recompose the sentences in the second language. Toppan officials said the conventional translation method often produces unnatural sentences. To make such translations more natural requires an additional input of new rules, which often confuses the machines, the officials said. The officials also said machines with the new translation system, called Toptran, have the ability to learn the more frequently they are used because of the increased storage of memories. The system, a fruit of four years of research and development and 200 million yen in investments, will be used only within the company and will not be put on the market for the time being, they said.
