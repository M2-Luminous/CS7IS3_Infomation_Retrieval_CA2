On the one hand, there is [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, promising to have "everyone pay less," and, on the other, the progressive forces, Mario Segni's Pact, and Mino Martinazzoli's Popular Party, who accuse him of demagoguery and of wanting to empty the state's coffers. In Italy too, as in the United States and Britain, this time votes will be gained partly on the basis of tax promises. Forza Italia has proposed a single income tax rate of 30 percent for all. But how are we to ensure that the rich pay proportionately more than the poor? By means of allowances on taxable income, Silvio Berlusconi's experts say. "In order to cancel out the negative impact on lower incomes," PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] economist Vincenzo Visco said, "the present deductions would have to be at least doubled. This would entail a frightening loss of revenue. It is easy to conduct propaganda in connection with taxation, but it is much more difficult to introduce reforms." According to Pact for Italy leader Mario Segni, Forza Italia's proposal "is clearly demagogic and would not achieve the progressive nature of taxation envisaged by the Constitution." This is a "nonexistent conjecture," according to Martinazzoli. The PRI [Italian Republican Party] daily, LA VOCE REPUBBLICANA, points out that Alan Ford's cartoon features a character called "Superchuk, a bizarre character who robs the poor to give to the rich. Is there perhaps a Robin Hood in reverse among the advisers of the magnate of Arcore [Berlusconi]?" According to the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor], these "extravagant promises" are "neo-Reaganite." Yesterday evening Berlusconi replied in an interview on television channel four news: "The progressive forces are still distorting the facts. First, our proposal envisages exemption from taxation for all the poorest families. Also we want to introduce an allowance for each family member, so that larger families will pay less." Lowering the rate to 30 percent, he added, will "ensure that those with higher incomes have less incentive to evade taxation and more incentive to invest." According to Forza Italia's economist, Antonio Martino, "poor people will no longer have to pay income tax." In an interview he said: "Those leveling charges against us are in fact defending a system in which for those with taxable incomes of just 14.4 million lire, there is a tax rate of 27 percent, close to the current U.S. maximum of 28 percent. The result is that poor people in Italy pay tax the same rate as applies to the Rockefellers in America." "A single tax rate," Segni replied, "is unknown in all the Western industrialized countries." It is better to "merge tax rates, reducing them to three or four and eliminating the highest and lowest rates." Tax expert Giulio Tremonti pointed out that "everyone is proposing bits of reform but forgetting the overall picture." AN [National Alliance] leader Gianfranco Fini proposed "a few clear regulations." The battle is likely to continue until the elections. The new system, which has led to a contest to the last vote among the three major alignments, favors the definition of well-defined stances. On 27-28 March three-fourths of parliamentary seats will be allocated to whoever wins in each electoral constituency. With the decline of the ideologically inspired vote, support must be gained on the basis of specifics. And taxation features very prominently among these. In its own election program Forza Italia proposes abolishing the current seven income tax rates (from the minimum 10 percent for those earning up to 7.2 million to the maximum 51 percent for those earning over 300 million) and replacing them with a single rate of 30 percent for everyone. Two days ago the progressive alignment, led by [PDS Secretary] Achille Occhetto, replied with calculations of its own, from which it emerges that by implementing a single 30 percent rate, people earning up to 70 million a year would pay more tax than they do now, whereas those earning more would make considerable savings. That is not true, Forza Italia replied: The calculations fail to take account of the allowances that we want to introduce. But apart from these calculations, the rival alignments are not relinquishing their traditional polemical confrontations. "The latest opinion polls tell us that 87 percent of Chinese citizens want Berlusconi as emperor of China," the Popular Party's Mino Martinazzoli said, in connection with Forza Italia's improving ratings in the opinion polls. "No specific arguments, and no ideas: All Martinazzoli is left with are petty jibes," Berlusconi's men replied.
