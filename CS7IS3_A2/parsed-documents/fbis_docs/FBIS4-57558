The place is located on the Tachira State border, in the southern zone adjoining Maracaibo Lake. The group was arrested during a security operation undertaken by the National Guard against outlaws and irregular groups. Group members were followed when they tried to implement their plan to kidnap a cattleman and his son. Intelligence work by the National Guard and police revealed the guerrillas' presence south of the lake. The operation led the police to the mountain area of Los Giros, very close to the farm owned by cattleman Manuel Maria Guerrero. The criminals had camped near the farm to kidnap Manuel Maria Guerrero and his son, who was not identified. The prisoners were identified as Alfredo Perez Alcina (26 years), alleged member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, Alvaro Pena Bejas, Carlos Rojas Tarazona, and a minor whose name was not revealed. The authorities confiscated a pistol, a revolver, knives, and canned food during the operation. The four prisoners were turned over to the PTJ [Technical Judicial Police] in Merida, and authorities are investigating their possible ties with and financial support from the Colombian guerrilla groups that operate along the border.
