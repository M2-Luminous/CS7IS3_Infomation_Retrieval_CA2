The TSE announced at 0100 (0700 GMT) that it would not provide further information for several hours, because "most" of the votes had been tallied, and only 843 out of 5,897 polling stations had not been counted. According to this latest official report, which politicians and authorities have recognized as practically unequivocal, the negative votes added up to 12.95 percent, with null or blank votes at 19.3 percent. President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said he was satisfied with the "yes" victory and downplayed the abstention, although he admitted it was "worrisome." The 43 approved amendments make it possible to hold anticipated elections this year to name a new Congress and Supreme Court, two branches that de Leon has wanted to purge due to the charges of corruption that were leveled against those institutions. Unexplained bomb attacks that had begun in the past few weeks continued on voting day. Two devices exploded in Guatemala City, and the police defused three others.
