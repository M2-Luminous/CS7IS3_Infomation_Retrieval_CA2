Ocalan: In a free democratic atmosphere! There should be an opportunity for the free exchange of views and political choice by removing the shadow of coercion. What I really mean is using the right of engaging in secure politics. If you guarantee this security throughout Turkey, I will have no other demands concerning the Kurdish problem. I want to engage in politics in an atmosphere in which arms are silent. This is a reasonable right. If you give the guarantee, then I will go in among the Kurds and Turks and engage in politics. If there is a real desire to end this war, I am all for it, really. And I will propose no preconditions regarding the Kurds' demands. Let the use of force be removed. Yes, to engage in free politics... Question: I am pleased to hear this. I have an actor friend who knows nothing beyond the propaganda in the press. When I told him that "Apo [alias for Abdullah Ocalan] might be satisfied with entering the parliament as a deputy from Diyarbakir or might be satisfied only with forming his own party," he replied: "Is that all?" I just wanted to mention this. Ocalan: Of course. This will require some negotiation. What I am saying is: Let us smooth these problems over. The use of political rights depends on particular guarantees. If I go there today, they will detain me and hang me tomorrow. The DEP [Democracy Party] was ostensibly given the right to engage in politics but now its members are facing execution on charges of being "traitors to the country." But I would want to engage in secure politics. I will seek security in the Constitution and the law. Not satisfied with that, I will ask for particular institutional measures. Being a democrat, I believe in a Kurdish identity. I will address the people with this identity of mine. This should have a place in the law. Let us make the necessary changes. Why should you [the Turks] impose your own arrangements on me by unilaterally denying everything that defines me? Will anything remain of democracy if you act like that? In the context of democracy there should be Kurdish parties and social and political institutions. There are lots of local problems to be tackled. So there will be local administrations. There will be local parliaments. But there are also things to be tackled together with the Turks. We will carry out joint government and parliamentary work. Some do not want to understand this. Let them come to me. I will explain all this in one go. I did not attend the law faculty but I can show them how to do what. I am looking for a counterpart. Let anyone with confidence in himself come here so that we can rearrange all these things within the context of Turkey's unity and territorial integrity. Question: Who do you want? Who will we bring to you? Ocalan: Anyone. I am even ready for an ordinary civil servant. Let him come so that heeding the people's voice, we can stop this conflict and usher in freedom of thought and particular political choices away from the shadow of arms. No one is avoiding this. I am ready to open a debate about particular and very modest democratic demands. I am asking you: Do you have such a counterpart for me? Question: They do not respect me, otherwise I would have come to the talks. I do not know if those higher up would. But what clear-cut communal and political projects is the PKK offering for the meaningful, democratic, free, peaceful, and stable solution of this problem? Ocalan: We want to reorganize the historic Turkish-Kurdish relations. History shows these relations. They began under Sultan Selcuk and peaked under Sultan Yavuz. They also form the foundation of the Republic established by Mustafa Kemal. These relations must be admitted first. We want to surmount the blind policy of violence, which is against the interests of the Kurdish people and goes as far as to deny all its national democratic demands and identity and even annihilates it. The following are some of the fundamental principles needed to surmount the current policy: (1) The recognition of Kurdish-Turkish relations. (2) The suspension of the policy of violence against and the assimilation of the Kurds, that is, the erosion of the Kurdish identity. (3) I am saying that alongside the institutions suitable for each people's national identity, there is a need to make a transition to a system of federal parliament and government based on partnership institutions, that is, to put it more concretely, based on local, or perhaps federal, parliaments and governments. This is the most concrete path to a solution that we could advance: the revision of all relations and the recognition of the need for reorganization, not under the shadow of arms or pressure, but based on complete free will. If this is accepted, then there could be an easy movement toward reorganization within Turkey's existing borders and based on the genuine free will of the two peoples, which would forge a stronger fraternity than the current one. This is possible without too much fighting. I believe in this but I have no counterpart. Question: You spoke against the use of force, assimilation, and the threat of arms but primarily the General Staff and an important section of the public accuse you and your party of using violence and of committing savagery and massacres. So while you declare your opposition to violence, your party is being accused of practicing such things. Is there not a contradiction here? Ocalan: Before asking me that, you should have read this [not further specified; however, Ocalan appears to be referring to a paper in his hand]. Do I have to read it for you? We announced the names of those killed during the shelling of Gabar, Sirnak, and Soke. Their birthplaces were also given. Some 16 people were listed. We also obtained the names and dates of birth of the villagers killed in the village of Ziver in the district of Eruh during the shelling. The number killed here was 23. Over 50 villagers were killed in shelling on election day alone. Their names are known. I am not exaggerating their number. The press did not mention these facts. So who is committing the savagery? Don't they claim that children are being killed? Go and check their age. You should be realistic. When women and children get killed and it is beyond our control, when angry young people place bombs here and there, you cannot describe this as PKK tactics. We are trying to prevent such action. If we do not prevent such action the streets might turn into a hell. We are very attached to the principles of humanism and war conventions. It is the General Staff that is not doing what is needed on this issue. Question: When do you hope to see the realization of your ideal of the "recognition of the Kurds' political, cultural, and historic rights and of your return to Turkey to represent your people on a legal platform?" Ocalan: [passage omitted] It is my ideal to be engaged in politics amid my people, even in Turkey. I am not devoted to conducting a policy with the use of arms. I have no intention of putting my neck out like a sheep if I am given no alternative but execution. I will defend myself to the end with whatever means I can find in any corner of the world. It is obvious that the defense of my own person is linked with the defense of my own people and party. Why am I doing all these things? I am doing them so as to engage in politics. I have no desire for violence for the sake of it. We have political goals and national and democratic demands and I want to put them into practice. It is the Turkish regime that does not grasp this. Let this regime express a bit of goodwill to solve the problems. Let it assign a counterpart to talks with us. Here my presence is not a condition. Let those counterparts who could solve this problem come together. Let us both [PKK and Turkish Government] support them. What is needed is for both sides to display goodwill. I reiterate: I am ready to display my goodwill to the end. But at the same time I will never allow the suppression, certainly not the denial, of a people's national democratic demands. If need be I can use ruthless violence for this purpose or act like the most democratic politician to fulfill these same duties.
