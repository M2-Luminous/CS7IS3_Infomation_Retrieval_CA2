ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: On June 25, 1992, and March 22, 1993, the State of Tennessee through the Department of Environment and Conservation submitted revisions to its State Implementation Plan (SIP) regarding general definitions, control of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and general alternate emission standards. On November 5, 1992, and April 22, 1993, the State submitted revisions to the VOC regulations and general alternate emission standards in the Memphis-Shelby County portion of the Tennessee SIP on behalf of Memphis-Shelby County. Since Memphis-Shelby County adopts the State's regulations by reference, the submitted SIP revisions were essentially identical to the regulations in the State's submittal. EPA is approving or conditionally approving revisions to the Tennessee SIP and the Memphis-Shelby County portion of the Tennessee SIP as meeting the requirements of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA). The State and Memphis submittals addressed, or committed to address, all of the deficiencies identified in the State's VOC regulations and documented by EPA in letters to the State dated November 9, 1987, June 10, 1987, and January 25, 1990, and to Memphis-Shelby County dated November 9, 1987. EPA is disapproving the deletion of rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.03 Standard for New Sources. DATES: This final rule will be effective June 17, 1994 unless notice is received by May 18, 1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register .

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In May 1988, EPA released 1987 air quality data which established the degree to which areas throughout the Nation attained, or failed to attain, the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and issued SIP calls for areas that failed to attain. The Memphis and Nashville areas in Tennessee failed to attain the ozone NAAQS. On September 7, 1988, at 53 FR 34500, EPA gave notice that SIP calls were made to the nonattainment areas. The SIP call letters, which were sent to Governors and State Air Pollution Control Directors, requested that the states respond to the SIP calls in two phases. The response to Phase I was due approximately one year following the issuance of final EPA policy program requirements for ozone and carbon monoxide nonattainment areas and/or reauthorization of the CAA. As part of the first phase, states were asked to upgrade SIPs to correct discrepancies in existing SIPs as compared with EPA's existing guidance under section 108 and part D (related to reasonably available control technology (RACT) for VOC emissions) and to adopt control measures to satisfy any commitments in the part D SIP's to adopt RACT measures. In 1990, Congress amended the CAA to address, among other things, continued nonattainment of the ozone NAAQS (Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q). Section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA requires states with existing areas designated nonattainment for ozone and classified as at least marginal, to submit, by May 15, 1991, revisions to the SIP that correct or add requirements concerning RACT in accordance with pre- amendment guidance. 1 The SIP call letters interpreted that guidance and indicated the corrections necessary for specific nonattainment areas. 1 Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of the Post&hyph;87 Policy, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); the Blue Book, ``Issues relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987, Federal Register Notice;'' and the existing Control Techniques Guidelines (CTGs). The Memphis area is classified as marginal nonattainment and the Nashville area is classified as moderate nonattainment 2 for the ozone NAAQS. Therefore, these areas are subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991, deadline. 2 The Memphis and Nashville areas retained the designations of nonattainment and were classified by operation of law pursuant to sections 107(d) and 181 (a) upon enactment of the Amendments. 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). Tennessee failed to meet the May 15, 1991, deadline for the submittal of corrections to the State (including the State's portion of the Nashville nonattainment area), Memphis-Shelby County, and some of the Nashville-Davidson County regulations 3 . EPA notified the State on June 25, 1991, that a finding of failure to submit had been made for the Memphis-Shelby County and Nashville nonattainment areas. This finding of failure to submit was published at 56 FR 54557 on October 22, 1991. The finding triggered the 18-month time clock for mandatory application of sanctions under section 179(a) of the CAA and the 2-year time clock for promulgation of Federal VOC regulations for nonattainment areas as required by section 110(c)(1). 3 On February 16, 1990, July 3, 1991, October 4, 1991, and January 2, 1992, the State submitted certain corrections to the VOC RACT rules for Nashville-Davidson County. EPA approved the February 16, 1990, revisions at 56 FR 10171 on March 11, 1991, and the rest of the amendments at 57 FR 28625 on June 26, 1992. The State submitted revisions to the Tennessee SIP, including Nashville, to EPA on June 25, 1992, and on March 22, 1993. The State submitted SIP revisions to meet the section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement on behalf of Memphis-Shelby County on November 5, 1992, and on April 22, 1993. EPA found these submittals to be complete on October 6, 1993, and June 9, 1993, respectively. This finding of completeness stopped the sanctions clock started on October 22, 1991, for the Memphis-Shelby County and Nashville nonattainment areas. However, the Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) clock continued to run. EPA's final approval action relieves EPA of the FIP obligation for those portions of the submittal that are being fully approved. EPA is approving the following revisions except where it is specifically noted that the revision is being conditionally approved or disapproved. Chapter 1200&hyph;3&hyph;2 General Definitions The following changes were made only to the Tennessee portion of the SIP, and not to the Memphis portion. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;2&hyph;.01 General Definitions The definition of ``air contaminant source'' was revised to correct a typographical error. The revision added the phrase ``portable fuel-burning equipment, and incinerators of all types, indoor and,'' to the definition of ``air contaminant source.'' The definitions of ``air curtain destructor,'' ``open burning,'' ``Ringelmann chart,'' ``soiling index,'' ``silicon carbide plant,'' and ``magnetite processing plant'' were deleted. Minor changes were made to the definitions of ``modification'' and ``reasonably available control technology'' to correct typographical errors and for clarification. The definition of ``malfunction'' was revised to correct a typographical error. The revision added failures that are caused by poor maintenance, careless operation, or any other preventable upset condition to the definition of ``malfunction.'' The definition of ``startup'' was revised to specify that ``startup is the setting in operation of an air contaminant source for the production of product for sale or use as raw materials or steam or heat production.'' Definitions of ``continuous emission monitor,'' ``nonattainment area,'' ``PM&hyph;10,'' and ``total suspended particulate (TSP)'' were added. Minor revisions to the definitions of ``air pollution,'' ``board,'' and ``cupola'' were withdrawn by the State via letter dated January 11, 1993, from Mr. John W. Walton, Technical Secretary of the Tennessee Air Pollution Control Board. Chapter 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18 Volatile Organic Compounds Applicability _The applicability requirements have been revised to state that the rules apply to facilities having potential VOC emissions of 25 tons per year or greater in Davidson, Hamilton, and Shelby Counties, and 100 tons per year or greater in all other counties in the State. The applicability requirements have been revised in the following rules. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.05 Automobile and Light Duty Truck Manufacturing; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.12 Can Coating; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.13 Coil Coating; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.14 Fabric and Vinyl Coating; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;15 Metal Furniture Coating; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.16 Surface Coating of Large Appliances; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.17 Magnet Wire Coating; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.18 Solvent Metal Cleaning; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.20 Flat Wood Paneling Coating; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.21 Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.26 Manufacture of Pneumatic Rubber Tires; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.27 Manufacture of Synthesized Pharmaceutical Products; and Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.28 Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning. Compliance _The following rules have been revised to reference the compliance provisions in paragraph 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.01(3) and rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.22. Paragraph 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.01(3) contains provisions for standards that limit the pounds of VOCs per gallon of material and rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.22 concerns leaks from gasoline tank trucks and vapor collection systems. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.08 Bulk Gasoline Plants; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.09 Bulk Gasoline Terminals; and Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.10 Gasoline Service Stations Stage I. The following rules have been revised to reference the compliance provisions in paragraph 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.01(3). Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.12 Can Coating; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.14 Fabric and Vinyl Coating; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.20 Flat Wood Paneling Coating; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.21 Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.22 Leaks from Gasoline Tank Trucks and Vapor Collection Systems; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.23 Petroleum Refinery Equipment Leaks; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.25 Petroleum Liquid Storage in External Floating Roof Tanks; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.26 Manufacture of Pneumatic Rubber Tires; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.27 Manufacture of Synthesized Pharmaceutical Products; Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.28 Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning; and Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.29 Graphic Arts&hyph;Rotogravure and Flexography. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.01 Purpose and General Provisions The following changes were made to both the Tennessee and Memphis portions of the SIP. Paragraph (1) was revised to change the applicability of emission standards and requirements from ``new and existing'' sources to ``certain'' sources of VOCs for which applicability is specified in this chapter or other chapters of division 1200&hyph;3. This paragraph was also revised to state that ``[i]n determining whether the source category at a facility satisfies the applicability standard of a specific rule, the potential emissions from all sources of the source category shall be totaled.'' Paragraph (3) was added to describe the standards that limit the pounds of VOCs per gallon of material. These standards must now specify the allowable VOC content per gallon of material less water. Demonstration of compliance with the VOC content standards of chapter 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18 was also addressed in paragraph (3). This paragraph states that compliance ``other than by use of complying materials, shall be demonstrated by the limitation of volatile organic compound emissions to a level equivalent to the quantities which theoretically would be emitted if complying materials would be used.'' Paragraph (4) describing methods for proof of compliance with the standards in chapter 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18 was also added to this rule. EPA is conditionally approving subparagraph 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.01(4)(b) in the Memphis submittal because it provides for determination of the VOC content, water content, densities, volume solids, and weight solids by certification from the manufacturer, if supported by batch formulation records and approved by the Technical Secretary. Based on Attachment 4 to the May 25, 1988, ``Blue Book,'' the reference to batch formulation data must be changed to batch analytical data. In a letter dated January 25, 1994, the State committed for Memphis to correct this deficiency by February 1, 1995. EPA is not approving this revision for the area of Tennessee outside of the Memphis-Shelby county area because the State of Tennessee revised this rule in a subsequent submittal on May 18, 1993, which will be acted on by EPA in a later notice. Subparagraph 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.01(4)(c), which refers to the procedure for the determination of capture efficiency, was withdrawn by the State via letter dated August 26, 1992, from Mr. John W. Walton, Technical Secretary of the Tennessee Air Pollution Control Board. Subparagraph 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.01(4)(c) was not included in the Memphis-Shelby County submittal. Paragraph (5) describing monitoring to confirm continuing compliance and daily recordkeeping procedures was added. Paragraph (6) providing for a nonrenewable exemption from the standards in chapter 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18 was also added. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.02 Definitions The definitions of ``urban county,'' ``rural county,'' and ``approved'' were deleted. The definitions of ``volatile organic compound'' and ``coating line'' were revised to correct deficiencies. Definitions of ``exempt solvent,'' ``operation,'' ``potential VOC emissions,'' ``potential emissions,'' and ``legally enforceable'' were added. A minor revision was made to the definition of ``existing source'' to change the word ``process(es)'' to ``process.'' Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.03 Standard for New Sources Tennessee proposed to delete this rule in its entirety. EPA is disapproving the deletion of this rule for the Tennessee submittal because Tennessee does not have federally approved New Source Review (NSR) regulations which apply to some of the sources in this chapter. EPA is approving the deletion of this rule for the Memphis submittal because the federally approved Tennessee NSR applies to the Memphis-Shelby County area. Section 110(l) of the CAA provides that EPA shall not approve a SIP revision if the revision interferes with any applicable requirements concerning attainment and reasonable further progress, or any other applicable requirements of the CAA. Section 110(k) of the CAA addresses the situation in which an entire submittal, or a separable portion of a submittal, meets all applicable requirements of the CAA. In the case where a separable portion of the submittal meets all of the applicable requirements, partial approval may be used to approve that part of the submittal and disapprove the remainder. EPA has determined that the proposed deletion of this rule is separable from the submittal because the other revisions apply to existing sources and this proposed revision applies only to new sources. Tennessee may submit the deletion of this rule with the submittal of their revised NSR regulations. For the deletion to be approvable, the revised NSR regulation must meet the provisions of part D of title I of the CAA, must contain requirements that will apply to the sources under this chapter and must be at least as stringent as the rule they propose to delete. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.04 Alternate Emission Standard This rule was deleted in its entirety. Alternate emission standards for VOCs were added to chapter 1200&hyph;3&hyph;21. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.05 Automobile and Light Duty Truck Manufacturing This rule was deleted in its entirety because there were no sources subject to the rule as contained in the Tennessee SIP and the Memphis portion of the Tennessee SIP. A new regulation for such sources consistent with EPA guidance has been submitted by the State and EPA will act on this submittal in a subsequent document. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.06 Paper Coating The definition of ``Paper coating'' in subparagraph (1)(b) was revised to include ``decorative, functional, and protective coatings.'' Paragraph (2) was revised to make saturation operations subject to the provisions of this rule. Paragraph (3) was revised to clarify the discharge limitation for the owner or operator of a paper coating line subject to this rule. The limitation disallows ``the discharge into the atmosphere of any volatile organic compound in excess of 0.35 kilograms per liter (2.9 pounds per gallon) of coating as applied (or as delivered to the applicator), excluding water and exempt solvents, except as provided in 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.01(3).'' Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.07 Petroleum Liquid Storage The reference to rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.41 was deleted in paragraph (4) because the rule was changed and the exemption is no longer applicable. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.08 Bulk Gasoline Plants Minor revisions were made to the exemptions in paragraph (3) for purposes of correction and clarification. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.09 Bulk Gasoline Terminals A condition was added to the loading restrictions in paragraph (3). This condition states that no person may load gasoline into any tank trucks or trailers from any bulk gasoline terminal unless all loading and vapor lines are equipped with fittings which are vapor-tight. Paragraph (6) was added to specify the applicable test method for determining VOC emissions from bulk gasoline terminals. This paragraph included subparagraphs which describe the principle, method summary, applicability, apparatus, test requirements, basic measurements required, test procedure, calculations, and calibrations of the test method. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.10 Gasoline Service Stations Stage I The exemptions in paragraph (3) were revised. EPA is conditionally approving the exemption in subparagraph (3)(a) of the Memphis submittal because it provides for director's discretion and therefore is not approvable. The exemption specifies that gasoline dispensing facilities equipped with control devices which have been approved by the Technical Secretary as providing emission reductions equivalent to that provided by floating roofs are exempt from this rule. In a letter dated January 25, 1994, the State committed for Memphis to correct this deficiency by February 1, 1995. EPA is not approving this revision for the area of Tennessee outside of the Memphis-Shelby county area because the State of Tennessee revised this rule in a subsequent submittal on May 18, 1993, which will be acted on by EPA in a later document. Subparagraph (3)(b) was revised to change the exemption from ``stationary gasoline storage containers of less than 7,570 liters (2,000 gallons)'' to ``stationary gasoline storage containers of less than 2,085 liters (550 gallons) capacity used exclusively in agriculture.'' Subparagraph (3)(c) was revised to change the exemption to facilities in counties other than Davidson and Shelby Counties. Subparagraph (3)(d) was revised to change the exemption from ``gasoline dispensing facilities with an annual throughput of less than 260,000 gallons which is serviced with a tank truck with a capacity of 4,200 gallons or less'' to ``gasoline dispensing facilities with an annual throughput of less than 120,000 gallons.'' Conditions were added to the limitations on the transfer of gasoline described in paragraph (4). These conditions specify that, ``[e]xcept as provided under paragraph (3) of this rule, no owner or operator may transfer or cause or allow the transfer of gasoline from any delivery vessel into any stationary storage tank as described in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph, unless the tank is equipped with a submerged fill pipe and the vapors displaced from the storage tank during filling are processed by a vapor control system in accordance with paragraph (5) of this rule.'' Subparagraph (a) specifies ``any stationary storage tank located at a gasoline dispensing facility, with a capacity of 7,580 liters (2,000 gallons) or more, which is in place before January 1, 1979.'' Subparagraph (b) specifies ``any stationary storage tank located at a gasoline dispensing facility, with a capacity of 948 liters (250 gallons) or more, which is installed after December 31, 1978.'' Minor changes were made to the phrasing in paragraph (6) to clarify the conditions on the owner or operator of a gasoline dispensing facility regarding design, maintenance, and refilling of a vapor-laden delivery vessel. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.11 Petroleum Refinery Sources The reference to rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.41 was deleted in paragraph (2) because this rule was changed and is no longer applicable. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.12 Can Coating Minor revisions were made in subparagraphs (3)(a), (b), (c), and (d) to clarify the limitations on the discharge of VOCs into the atmosphere. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.13 Coil Coating This rule was added to chapter 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18. Paragraph (1) contains definitions of ``Coil coating'' and ``Quench area.'' Paragraph (2) applies the rule, in accordance with 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.13 (3), to the coating applicator(s), oven(s), and quench area(s) of coil coating lines involved in prime and top coat or single coat operations. Paragraph (3) disallows the discharge of VOCs from a coil coating line into the atmosphere ``in excess of 0.31 kilograms per liter (2.6 pounds per gallon) of prime and topcoat or single coat as applied (or as delivered to the applicator), excluding water and exempt solvents, except as provided in 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.01(3).'' In the Memphis submittal, EPA is conditionally approving paragraph (3) because to meet RACT, the emission limits must apply to any coating, not just prime and topcoat or single coat. In a letter dated January 25, 1994, the State committed for Memphis to correct this deficiency by February 1, 1995. EPA is not approving this revision for the area of Tennessee outside of the Memphis-Shelby county area because the State of Tennessee revised this rule in a subsequent submittal on May 18, 1993, which will be acted on by EPA in a later notice. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.14 Fabric and Vinyl Coating The definition of ``Vinyl coating'' in subparagraph (1)(b) was revised to exempt the application of plastisol coatings. The qualification that plastisol coatings cannot be used to bubble emissions from vinyl printing and topcoating was also added to subparagraph (1)(b). The applicability provision in paragraph (2) was revised to include saturation operations. Minor revisions were made to the phrasing in subparagraphs (3)(a) and (b) to clarify the VOC emission limitations. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.15 Metal Furniture Coating Minor revisions were made to the phrasing in paragraph (3) to clarify the VOC emission limitations. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.16 Surface Coating of Large Appliances A minor revision was made in paragraph (3) to correctly reference the VOC emissions limitations in paragraph (4). Minor revisions were made to the phrasing in paragraph (4) to clarify the VOC emission limitations. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.17 Magnet Wire Coating Minor revisions were made to the phrasing in paragraph (2) to clarify the VOC emission limitations. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.18 Solvent Metal Cleaning The reference to rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.41 was deleted in paragraph (2) because this rule was changed and is no longer applicable. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.20 Flat Wood Panelling Coating Paragraphs (5) and (6), providing for increments of progress and proof of compliance respectively, were deleted because the dates for demonstration of compliance had expired. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.21 Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products Definitions of ``High performance architectural coating'' and ``Refinishing'' were added to paragraph (1). The definition of ``High performance architectural coating'' specifies that it is a coating ``[a]pplied at a facility located in a county which is attainment for ozone and had a population of less that 15000 according to the 1980 census.'' An emission limitation of 0.75 kg/l (6.2 lb/gal) for high performance architectural coating as applied (or as delivered to the applicator), excluding water and exempt solvents, was added as subparagraph (2)(a). The emission limitation of 0.52 kg/l (4.3 lb/gal) for clear coating as applied was clarified and moved from subparagraph (2)(a) to (2)(b). The emission limitation of 0.42 kg/l (3.5 lb/gal) for air dried coating as applied was clarified and moved from subparagraph (2)(b) to (2)(c). The emission limitation of 0.42 kg/l (3.5 lb/gal)for extreme performance coating as applied was clarified and moved from subparagraph (2)(c) to (2)(d). The emission limitation of 0.36 kg/l (3.0 lb /gal) for all other coating as applied was clarified and moved from subparagraph (2)(d) to (2)(e). The exemptions for the exterior of marine vessels and for bicycles in subparagraphs (5)(j) and (5)(m) were withdrawn by the State via letter dated March 9, 1993, from Mr. John W. Walton, Technical Secretary of the Tennessee Air Pollution Control Board. On August 30, 1993, the State sent another letter to EPA withdrawing these exemptions from the Memphis submittal. The exemption in subparagraph (5)(1) for prime and top coating aerospace components was deleted. Paragraphs (7) and (8), providing for increments of progress and proof of compliance respectively, were deleted. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.22 Leaks From Gasoline Tank Trucks and Vapor Collection Systems The limitation in subparagraph (2)(a) on loading and unloading conditions for a gasoline tank truck was further specified by the addition of the phrase ``when pressurized to gauge pressure of 4,500 pascals (18 in. of H 2 O).'' Paragraph (3) was amended by the addition of the requirement that testing of gasoline tank trucks for leak tightness be accomplished during or before the twelfth month after the month of the last test in which compliance with the standards of (2)(a) was demonstrated. Paragraph (4) was revised to state that the rule is also applicable to gasoline tank trucks which load or unload at applicable plants, terminals, or gasoline dispensing facilities in Shelby County. The requirement in paragraph (4) that gasoline tank trucks be equipped for gasoline vapor collection for this rule to be applicable was deleted. Paragraph (4) was also reorganized into subparagraphs for clarity. Paragraph (5) requiring initial testing was deleted. The reference to rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.42 was deleted in paragraph (6) because this rule was changed and is no longer applicable. Subparagraphs (6)(a) and (b) were revised to provide for EPA's approval of equivalent test procedures for proof of compliance. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.23 Petroleum Refinery Equipment Leaks Subparagraph (2)(a) was revised so that pressure relief devices which are connected to inaccessible valves are no longer exempt from inclusion in the inspection program. Paragraph (4), providing for the institution of an approved inspection program, was deleted. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.25 Petroleum Liquid Storage in External Floating Roof Tanks Paragraph (5), providing for increments of progress, was deleted. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.26 Manufacture of Pneumatic Rubber Tires Paragraphs (5) and (6), providing for increments of progress and proof of compliance respectively, were deleted. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.27 Manufacture of Synthesized Pharmaceutical Products Paragraphs (4) and (5), providing for increments of progress and proof of compliance respectively, were deleted. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.28 Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning Paragraph (5), providing for increments of progress, was deleted. Subparagraph (6)(d), providing for consistency with the test methods and procedures in rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.43, was also deleted. The test methods for proof of compliance are now provided for in paragraph 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.01(4). Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.29 Graphic Arts_Rotogravure and Flexography Subparagraph (2)(b) was revised to add the requirement that the ink in flexographic and packaging rotogravure contain no more than 0.5 pound VOC per pound of solids. Subparagraph (2)(b) was also reorganized into subparagraphs for clarity. Paragraphs (5) and (6), providing for increments of progress and proof of compliance respectively, were deleted. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.30 Surface Coating of Aerospace Components This rule was deleted in its entirety because aerospace sources are subject to Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.21 Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.40 Regulations Required Only in Metropolitan Davidson County This rule was renamed ``Regulations Required in Nonattainment Areas.'' Paragraph (1) was deleted and reserved for future use. Paragraph (2) was completely revised to state that ``[a]ny plant within a county designated in Part 1200&hyph;3&hyph;2&hyph;.01(1)(ffff)3 as nonattainment for ozone having sources with potential volatile organic compound emissions totaling more than 100 tons/year in the aggregate shall utilize reasonably available control technology (RACT) for volatile organic compound emission from those sources.'' This changes the emission requirement for implementing RACT from 1000 tons/year or greater only in the Metropolitan Davidson county to 100 tons/year or greater in the entire ozone nonattainment area which makes the rule more stringent. The State has submitted further revisions to meet the non-CTG requirements for the Nashville area and these will be addressed in a subsequent action by EPA. EPA is approving this revision for its strengthening effect. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.41 Compliance Schedules This rule was deleted and replaced with the requirement that the owner or operator of a source in existence or having a State or local agency's construction permit before June 7, 1992, and subject to a standard in chapter 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18 shall satisfy the applicable increments of progress specified in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c). This rule also includes a certification requirement and an exemption provision. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.42 Individual Compliance Schedules Paragraph (1) was revised to state that a facility with a source satisfying the applicability provisions of rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.41 may petition for a specific compliance schedule differing from the schedules contained in 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.41 and other rules in chapter 18 only if one or more of the conditions specified in subparagraphs (a) and (b) are satisfied. The condition in subparagraph (1)(c) was deleted. Paragraph (2) was revised to delete the word ``alphabetical,'' which was a typographical error, and to require final compliance with the specified emission standard as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the limiting conditions specified in paragraph (1) of this rule. Paragraph (3) was revised to state that individual compliance schedules approved under this rule must be submitted to EPA for approval. Paragraph (4) was revised to delete the reference to Hamilton County. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.43 General Provisions for Test Methods and Procedures Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.44 Determination of Volatile Content of Surface Coatings Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.45 Test Methods for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions Control Systems Efficiency Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.46 Test Method for Determination of Solvent Metal Cleaning Organic Compound Emissions Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.47 Test Procedure for Determination of VOC Emissions From Bulk Gasoline Terminals The above listed rules were deleted in their entirety. The test methods and procedures for proof of compliance are now provided for in paragraph 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.01(4). Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.48 Capture Efficiency Test Procedures This rule was withdrawn by the State via letter dated August 26, 1992, from Mr. John W. Walton, Technical Secretary of the Tennessee Air Pollution Control Board. On August 30, 1993, the State sent another letter withdrawing this rule from the Memphis submittal. The State intends to adopt capture efficiency (CE) test procedures after EPA publishes its revised CE test procedures. The study to evaluate the cost and technical aspects of alternative CE methods has been completed. EPA issued a draft document on October 6, 1993. This document is currently undergoing review and comment. Where states have not yet adopted CE regulations, EPA is allowing them to defer adoption of CE test requirements while the study is underway. Chapter 1200&hyph;3&hyph;21 General Alternate Emission Standards Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;21&hyph;.01 General Alternate Emission Standard The following changes were made to both the Tennessee and Memphis portions of the SIP. Paragraph (1) was revised to state that in lieu of satisfying the standards and requirements of other chapters of division 1200&hyph;3, air contaminant sources with a certificate of alternate control shall not emit particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, or volatile organic compounds in excess of the respective limits of said certificate. Paragraph (2) was revised to allow sources of VOCs regulated by other rules in the State's regulations to apply for a Certificate of Alternate Control. Paragraph (2) was also revised to change the word ``source'' to ``source(s),'' and to change the word ``must'' to ``may'' with regard to the Technical Secretary granting a request for a Certificate of Alternate Control. In addition, the requirement that these standards and conditions be submitted to EPA for approval was included in paragraph (3). The condition in subparagraph (2)(a) was revised to include VOCs and to replace the language regarding determination of equivalent emissions. Subparagraph (2)(b) was revised to state that if a schedule of compliance is required, it must be included as a condition on the certificate. The phrase ``this date'' was changed to ``the final compliance date.'' Subparagraph (2)(c) was revised to require the air contaminant source to use modeling consistent with Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised) , EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;78&hyph;027R, with the 1988 revisions, to verify that the alternate emission standard will yield equivalent or improved air quality for the pollutant involved. Minor revisions were also made in subparagraph (2)(c) to correct typographical errors. Subparagraph (2)(d) was revised to correct the reference to another rule and to replace the word ``old'' with ``existing'' in reference to sources. Subparagraph (2)(d) was also revised to require compliance with all applicable standards and requirements established under paragraph 1200&hyph;3&hyph;9&hyph;.01(4), under chapters 1200&hyph;3&hyph;11 and 16, and according to a lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) determination under paragraph 1200&hyph;3&hyph;9&hyph;.01(5). These standards and requirements will not be superseded or replaced by the alternate emission standard. Subparagraph (2)(e), providing that sources must establish a specific emission limit for each emission point, was deleted. Subparagraph (2)(f) was renamed (2)(e) and revised to increase the certificate fee for each source. Subparagraph (2)(g) was renamed (2)(f) and a phrase was deleted for clarification. A new subparagraph, (2)(g) was added to state that the provisions of the Emissions Trading Policy Statement, 51 FR 43850, dated December 4, 1986, are being satisfied. This policy statement is more stringent than subparagraph (2)(e) which was deleted. Paragraph (3) was revised so that alternate emission standards and certificate conditions are no longer considered to be an addition to the existing standards. In addition, the requirement that these standards and conditions be submitted to EPA for approval was included in paragraph (3). Paragraph (4) was revised to state that ``[g]ood engineering practice stack heights shall be utilized on all stack changes associated with the alternate control standards for particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide.'' Paragraph (9) was revised to delete the reference to each emission point. Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;21&hyph;.02 Applicability This rule was added to make chapter 1200&hyph;3&hyph;21 applicable ``only to those air contaminant sources which apply for a certificate of alternate control or a revision to a certificate of alternate control after March 18, 1993.'' Final Action EPA is fully approving the submitted revisions to the Tennessee State Implementation Plan (SIP) and the Memphis portion of the Tennessee SIP with the exception of the proposed revisions to Rules 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.01 (subparagraph (4)(b)), 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.10 (subparagraph (3)(a), and 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;13 (paragraph (3)) of the Memphis portion of the Tennessee SIP for which we are issuing a conditional approval and Rule 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.03 Standard for New Sources of the Tennessee SIP for which we are disapproving the proposed deletion. In addition, EPA is not approving the proposed revisions to rules 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.01 (subparagraph (4)(b)), 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;.10 (subparagraph (3)(a)), and 1200&hyph;3&hyph;18&hyph;13 (paragraph (3)) of the Tennessee SIP. These rules were revised in a subsequent submittal by Tennessee on May 18, 1993. Therefore, since these revisions are not approvable as submitted in this action, EPA will act on these rules in the action on the May 18, 1993, submittal. Because Tennessee has made a commitment for the Memphis nonattainment area that EPA believes meets the requirements necessary for EPA to grant conditional approval, EPA is conditionally approving under section 110(k)(4) of the CAA. In order for EPA to take final action on the commitment, the State must meet their commitment for the Memphis nonattainment area to adopt the identified provisions by February 1, 1995, and submit them to EPA within the time specified in this schedule. If the State fails to adopt or submit these rules for Memphis-Shelby County to EPA within this time frame, this approval will become a disapproval on that date. EPA will notify the area by letter that this action has occurred. At that time, this commitment will no longer be a part of the approved Memphis-Shelby County portion of the Tennessee SIP. EPA subsequently will publish a notice in the notice section of the Federal Register . If Tennessee adopts and submits these rules for Memphis-Shelby County to EPA within the applicable time frame, the conditionally approved submission will remain a part of the SIP until EPA takes final action approving or disapproving the new submittal. If EPA disapproves the new submittal, the conditionally approved submittal will also be removed from the SIP. Moreover, the rules on which the conditional approval was based will also be disapproved at that time. If EPA approves the submittal, those newly approved rules will become a part of the SIP and will modify or replace the commitment and the rules on which the conditional approval is based. If EPA determines that it cannot issue a final, conditional approval or if the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval, the sanctions clock under section 179(a) will begin. This clock will begin at the time EPA issues the final disapproval or on the date Tennessee fails to meet its commitment. In the latter case, EPA will notify the area by letter that the conditional approval has been converted to a disapproval and that the sanctions clock has begun. If the State does not submit and EPA does not approve the rule on which the disapproval was based within 18 months of the disapproval, EPA must impose one of the sanctions under section 179(b)_highway funding restrictions or the offset sanction. In addition, the final disapproval triggers the Federal implementation plan (FIP) requirement under section 110(c). This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates no significant comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective June 17, 1994. However, if notice is received by May 18, 1994 that someone wished to submit adverse or critical comments, this action will be withdrawn and two subsequent documents will be published before the effective date. One document will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 17, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (see section 307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2)). This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 26, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals and conditional approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. EPA , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S. Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).

EPA is disapproving the deletion of this rule for the Tennessee SIP because Tennessee does not have federally approved New Source Review (NSR) regulations which apply to some of the sources in this chapter. EPA is approving the deletion of this rule for the Memphis submittal because the federally approved TN NSR applies to the Memphis-Shelby County area.
