On the current religious situation, Mr. Nguyen Van Hanh said: It is the policy of our party and state to respect our Catholic compatriots' freedom of religion and encourage them to lead a life useful to both the region and the people so as to help build the country. Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh is a clergyman with a high sense of nationalism. He leads an ethical life and is highly popular. He has made positive contributions for the betterment of Catholic activities in Ho Chi Minh City. Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh's ecclesiastical and nationalist lines have been followed by a large number of Catholics. Mr. Nguyen Van Hanh also informed the audience of the positive results obtained in a meeting between the government Religious Affairs Committee and a representative of the Vatican Holy See during the Vatican delegation's recent visit to Vietnam. This is a welcome sign for the Catholic compatriots in the city to feel peace of mind so they can lead a Gospel-directed life within national bounds.
