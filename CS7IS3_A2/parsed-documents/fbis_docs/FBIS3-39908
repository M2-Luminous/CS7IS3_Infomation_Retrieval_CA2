On Tuesday [22 February], he presented the final figures: The total number of criminal offenses went down by 1.7 percent in 1993. The total number of offenses committed was 493,786, that is 8,654 fewer than in 1992. The decline in crimes is reflected in eight of the nine provinces; only in Vorarlberg was there a 7.7 percent increase. At 6 percent, Burgenland saw the biggest decrease; in Vienna the crime rate went down 1.4 percent. Justice Minister Nikolaus Michalek said that for the first time in seven years the number of crimes fell. The Justice Ministry will present a draft to change the criminal law in order to be better able to fight major crime. This should hit organized crime particularly where it is most vulnerable, at its financial center. It must be made easier to get at the profits from criminal offenses, Michalek said. Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] Chairman Joerg Haider accused the interior minister of "being at war with truth." He said Loeschnak was doing "first-rate cosmetics." If fewer offenses are indicated, this is due to the fact that fewer are being registered. Haider also criticized the fact that criminals continue to draw social benefits, such as unemployment and social welfare benefits, while they are in prison. "The longer you are in jail, the richer you get," he concluded. The Justice Ministry rejects these accusations: The fact is prisoners draw neither unemployment benefit nor social welfare benefits. It is only after release from prison that they have a right to social welfare benefit, or -- if they worked in prison -- unemployment benefit. Incidentally, the FPOe was involved in passing this regulation in parliament.
