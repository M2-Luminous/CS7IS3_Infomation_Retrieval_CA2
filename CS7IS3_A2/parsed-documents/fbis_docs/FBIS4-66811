The Bharatiya Janata Party today demanded that a "disinvestment commission" be set up by the Centre to decide on the mode and timing of disinvestment of public sector units. The party leader, Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, briefing the Press on the second day of the party's national executive meeting here, said that this commission should comprise financial experts, bankers, share brokers, trade union leaders, investors and Government nominees. He said that though this step would lead to privatization, it had to be related to the exit policy. He said that the aims of disinvestment should be made clear. The BJP today released a statement calling for a total rejection of the GATT proposals. Mr Joshi said that India can get out of GATT and cited China as an example. While adopting a resolution on the Union Budget, the BJP demanded the following: - A ceiling on borrowings--both internal and external--through a legislation under Article 195 of the Constitution. - "Preferential treatment" given to multinationals vis-a-vis domestic industries be stopped. - A complete ban on entry of multinationals into the consumer goods sector. - The proceeds from the dis-investment in PSUs [public sector units] be used exclusively for retiring national debt so that the interest liability could be reduced. Agencies report: Meanwhile, the pro-Advani group in the party has succeeded in thwarting the move to amend the party constitution to make the party president's term of three years instead of the existing two consecutive terms of two years each. This amendment had been proposed by the S.S. Bhandari committee and has been the subject of heated debate in the party. This and other amendments were circulated among the BJP leaders late last night, and were to be discussed today. But later, this amendment was deleted. Nuclear deterrant: The party president, Mr L.K. Advani, today said that India had "no option but to develop a nuclear deterrant in view of the hostile attitude of its neighbours." He told reporters here that Pakistan had been claiming that it possessed nuclear weapons and recent newspaper reports in the United States had only confirmed this. He added that with the United States deciding to supply F-16 fighter aircraft to Pakistan, the arms race in the sub-continent would escalate further. He added that Pakistan was not likely to go in for a "hot war" with India since it would not get much mileage out of it. Pakistan's decision to close down its consulate in Bombay, Mr Advani said, was prompted by its setback at the human rights meeting in Geneva recently. Kashmir issue: Mr Advani said that the victory at Geneva had not brought the country "an inch closer" to finding a solution to the Kashmir problem. He added: "Anyone can appreciate that the jawans cannot win a war with their hands tied behind their backs, as it exists now." Alliance: Asked if the BJP would sound the All-India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam for an alliance in Tamil Nadu, Mr Advani said elections in 10 States this year would be discussed at the party meeting later today. All the party units in these States had been asked to concentrate on building up the party and not think of alliances, he said.
