European telecoms operators, most of whom still enjoy a monopoly on telephone service and infrastructures, could lose approximately 25 percent of their shares over the next 10 years, when the European Union fully liberalizes the telecommunications industry. Such is the conclusion of a study by the financial rating firm Moody's. Some French experts, who cite Britain's experience, find the 25-percent figure a bit high. Ten years post-liberalization, BT [British Telecom] reportedly still has 90 percent of the telecommunication services market in Great Britain. Moody's also estimates that competition from open markets could lower the market shares of traditional carriers by 10 to 15 percent in certain niches during the first two years after liberalization. Generally speaking, companies such as Telefonica, Stet, or Deutsche Telekom, which charge high rates for both residential and business service, will be more vulnerable to the risks of competitive pressure than France Telecom or Belgacom. Moody's considers BT a perfect example of a company that was successful in making the transition from monopoly to market-oriented carrier, for it positioned itself to be competitive in a totally open telecoms market. European operators should nonetheless enjoy a solid credit rating in the medium term, since the process of telecommunications liberalization in the European Union will be much slower than in other parts of the world. But their rating is still expected to deteriorate in the longer run, when liberalization--slated for 1998 or 2003 depending on the country--goes into effect, says Moody's. Indeed, carriers will have to take on debt to invest the substantial sums needed to expand and update networks, and will be dealing with competition for the first time. That being the case, traditional operators will have to cut costs to become more flexible on rates and withstand competitive pressures. The speed and timing of decisions will be crucial.
