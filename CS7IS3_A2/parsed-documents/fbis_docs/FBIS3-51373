Ramiro Gurdian, Cosep [Council of Higher Enterprise] president, made the statements at the end of a meeting during which Economy and Development Ministry officials explained to representatives of the private sector the production program for this year, which should actually correspond to the available resources and human capability. The economy minister reiterated: "We are trying to create appropriate financial and production programs. We are also reviewing the possibilities to obtain resources so as not to create expectations when resources are limited." During the year, the government plans are aimed at promoting areas the private sector identifies as potential production areas, such as shrimp hatching and fisheries, as well as products of nontraditional crops. Pereira explained that the financial resources will come from the very payments made by debtors to the financial system, savings deposited in banks, and foreign resources obtained from the Central American Integration Bank (BCIE), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and other external sources. Meanwhile, the Cosep president said the organization prepared, together with Economy and Development Ministry authorities, an agenda that will be reviewed weekly to discuss what he called "bottlenecks" that may appear in the production area. "The reality is that we must all work this year without thinking about goals; if the growth expected by the government is achieved, then welcome it," he added. Gurdian stated that Cosep has asked the government about the need to revise the value of the cordoba, energy and diesel costs, and production costs in general. Meanwhile, Industries Chamber President Alberto Chamorro highlighted the determination with which the government is tackling the microaspects of the economy, such as production. Chamorro predicted a boom in the fishing and food and beverages sectors.
