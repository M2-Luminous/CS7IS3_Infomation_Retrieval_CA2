Foreword In the planning and design process for industrial products and interior space, mock-ups and small models were prepared and the situation of their use and the problems when used were examined. With the advances in computers in recent years, CG has been introduced and has been used for presentations to clients. In this field, a graphic image is primary and an image prepared by CG is recorded frame by frame, and an image for the presentation is prepared. On the other hand, virtual reality technology (also called VR: virtual reality, AR: artificial reality, or VE: virtual environment) effecting the sense that one is in a computer-generated world has been gathering attention.[.sup]1[/] VR has been applied in fields such as virtual surgery, education, and entertainment, and attempts for application in the design process are being made.[.sup]2,3[/] In VR, since interaction is important, the data used is very simple. Therefore, the problem is that the image quality attained is not sufficient for actually performing design review with the customer. Discussed here is a virtual prototyping system[.sup]5[/] which performs interactive instrument layout, using a high speed display algorithm[.sup]4[/] which can maintain high image quality and also effect interaction. The virtual prototyping system uses three-dimensional CAD data and can also make various arrangements; it has also made a prototype for a central operations room of a power plant. The example introduced here is of application to the new and old CT scanning (computer layer imaging equipment) room at the Toshiba Hospital. 2. Virtual prototyping system The virtual prototyping system has the following characteristics. 1. High quality display using three-dimensional CAD data 2. High speed display due to simplified layering 3. Interactive viewpoint indication and arrangement 4. Restrictions concerning material arrangement in the three-dimensional space These characteristics are explained below. 2.1 High quality display In order to support interaction, the three-dimensional CG model used in traditional VR is extremely simplified to several hundred polygons (Three-dimensional CG model data is often displayed as a collection of polygons when drawn, the number of those polygons shows the complexity of the model). The model used in usual CG (when taken frame by frame, it can be seen as animation) has several tens of polygons, but models having several hundred polygons are used in VR in order to increase drawing speed. Therefore, image quality is poor and the sense of reality is lost. In this virtual system, three-dimensional CAD data is used as is in order to compensate for the lack of this sense of reality. The dxf format data which is becoming the industrial standard is converted to a form which can be handled in the graphic library (GL) on the SGI graphics workstation (GWS). As a result, the high image quality display can be attained as VR as shown in the frontispiece. In order to increase the sense of presence, an actual output image is on the monitor screen of the console (texture mapping) and interior shadows are also made. Figure 1 shows the subject of the new and old CT scanning rooms in Toshiba Hospital. The console and the CT were prepared with three-dimensional CAD based on the designs. The desk and chair used were already input from prior prototypes. Figure 1. Old and new CT scanning rooms in Toshiba Hospital. CT prepared with three-dimensional CAD were arranged in the new and old scanning rooms in Toshiba Hospital. (a) Old scanning room, (b) New scanning room</graphic> The three-dimensional CAD data run on GWS just indicates the arrangement on the arrangement editor and has the advantage that a scanning room as in Figure 1 can be constructed even without special knowledge of CG since the three-dimensional space as in Figure 1 can be attained. 2.2 High Speed Display If a model of ten times the complexity is to be drawn, the drawing time increases ten times. In order to resolve this issue, speed is increased by simplified layering.[.sup]4[/] Simplified layering uses the fact that the discrimination of fine sections is lessened since the on-screen surface area of objects far from the point of view becomes small. In effect, the image quality is retained as the far objects are simplified and the near objects are displayed with more precision. This simplification is performed automatically or selectively. 2.3 Interactive Viewpoint Indication and Arrangement When three-dimensional CAD data is run, one can see from various points of view (walk through) inside the virtual space of the scanning room displayed with high image quality by simplified layering. Concretely, one can interactively indicate the position from which to see using an input device such as the VPL Co. DataGlove[.sup]TM[/]. Figure 1 shows a view from almost directly above. On the other hand, by designating the point of view seen from when the radiologist is working, it can be confirmed whether the radiologist can verify the condition of the patient. Also, not just seeing, but interactively changing the arrangement of the instruments is possible. The operation of the arrangement change is easiest when performed from a bird's eye view (seen from directly above) so that the entire space can be viewed. With this virtual system as above, the place can be seen from various perspectives and the conditions of use can be examined at the clients' request during design review. Furthermore, since the arrangement of the place can be changed if inconvenient and the results can be verified on the spot, the efficiency of the design process can be greatly improved. 2.4 Restrictions Concerning the Arrangement of Objects in Three-Dimensional space With just the simple transfer of objects, they interfere (sinking in together) and desks and tables float in space since three-dimensional CG data are without substance and the physical laws do not operate. Arrangement with care so that this does not happen in three-dimensional space is rather difficult. However, when interference checks are correctly performed and physical laws are calculated in order to resolve this, the calculation load is high and interaction cannot be supported. With this virtual prototyping system, the interference check is just performed for the bottom surface of objects in order to perform interference checks with a low calculation load. Also, in order to prevent things floating in midair, discrimination between interior and exterior is performed when the objects are arranged. Thus, desks and tables are on the floor and laptop personal computers are on the desks. Since the restrictions are satisfied on the spot, the arrangement can easily be changed while interaction is maintained. 3. Test case applied to Toshiba Hospital Renewal is necessary following the technical advance of medical instruments like CT. There are cases of newly making scanning rooms as well as using the original scanning rooms. In either case, customers with different perspectives such as doctors, radiologists, and nurses work in the scanning room. In order to design a scanning room with good conditions for use, it is necessary to reflect the voices of these clients, but presently, they are busy with their daily duties and cannot take time. Furthermore, the patients are the most important clients, but since they have health problems, they generally don't want to contribute to the design. The virtual prototyping system was applied to the new and old CT scanning rooms at Toshiba Hospital as a test case to clarify such problems. Figure 1 and the frontispiece show the output. The CG models of the CT and consoles are the same in the new and old scanning rooms. In the old scanning room, the CT was arranged at right angles to the console because of the relationship between the exit and the size of the room. Therefore, when the radiologist was interviewed, it was indicated that it is difficult to see the patient when operating the console. On the other hand, since the room is large, the new scanning room has the CT placed at an angle so that the entire body of the patient can be verified (frontispiece). 4. Conclusion A virtual prototyping system which can be used in design review was realized with high image quality, high display speed, interactive viewpoint indication and arrangement, and physical restrictions to arrangement. With this, the problems can be evaluated and corrected on the spot while the clients and technicians directly view the same information. This system was applied to the scanning rooms at Toshiba Hospital. In the future, virtual prototyping technology will be introduced with simulation applied to problems like the reflected simulation of a ceiling light developed separately and be applied to various types of examples. At the same time, we would like to establish it as evaluation technology[.sup]6[/] including work in real space. Footnotes 1. M. Hirose, Editor: Virtual Reality Applications Strategy, Ohm Co.
