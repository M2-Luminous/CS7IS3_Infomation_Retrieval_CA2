Observers think it is a very large staff. In addition, the president as a head of state and of the executive branch has the entire Crimean Council of Ministers at his disposal. As a matter of fact, on 8 February Yuriy Meshkov had separate meetings with the power ministers and the rest of the Republic of Crimea's government members. No information about the results of the meetings, however, has been made public. Participants in the meetings have said to your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that Meshkov told them that he had come without his own team and asked them all to stay on in their offices. On 10 February, when Meshkov was absent, various people from the presidential administration called Crimean Economy Minister Tatyana Shandra four times during the day. They demanded that a fact sheet on the state of affairs in the peninsula be drawn up and her proposals for ways to lift the economy out of the crisis be presented. Tatyana Shandra told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that the documents had been prepared.
