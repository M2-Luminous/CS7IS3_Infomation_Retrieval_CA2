Aliyev will hold talks with President Suleyman Demirel and several officials in that country. What do our people expect from his visit? Azerbaijan's Turkic people have a problem at the present time. A way must be found to end the war in the Republic, which has continued for six years. A way must be found to quickly end the aggression and fighting. The Armenian military forces must withdraw from the territories they have occupied in Azerbaijan. In short, Azerbaijan's people want the aggressor to be punished and peace and security to be reestablished. Undoubtedly, neighboring countries must give support to Azerbaijan to help it end the Armenian aggression. That is essential. They must help us convey Azerbaijan's just and honest views to the world. Turkey is one of the countries that help Azerbaijan establish peace and security on its territory. That country has significant political influence in the world. In view of that, we have vested significant hope in Turkey's support for Azerbaijan's effort to sign a peace agreement to quickly end the war. The hope we have vested in Turkey is based on many things. The language, religion, and traditions of the two peoples are very similar. We have a common language, religion, history, and literature. The two peoples have been attacked throughout history. They have waged a joint struggle against the enemy. We wish to recall the tragic incidents the Armenians created in Azerbaijan early in the century. Drawing strength from their supporters, the Dachnak Armenians carried out bloody massacres in Azerbaijan. Armenian terrorist activities were widespread in our Republic. Turkey extended a helping hand to Azerbaijan's people at the time. It took an active part in the effort our people made to evict the Dachnak Armenians from our territory. However, the Dachnak Armenians took action once again 70 years later. Their new action is based on many reasons. You may ask why the Turkic peoples do not move against a handful of Armenians? It is common knowledge that the Armenians have never been alone in their bloody crimes against the Turkic peoples. Powerful and influential countries have always supported them behind the scenes. The Armenians have been used as an instrument. The Armenians also created tragic incidents in Turkey. They wished to divide that country early in the century. However, Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey, succeeded in creating unity in that country and achieved victory. It is as if history is repeating itself. Aggressive circles have drawn up bloody designs against Azerbaijan's Turkic people. They wish to divide and fragment Azerbaijan to usurp its resources. However, they will not realize their objectives. Azerbaijan's sons have arisen. That has been confirmed by our national Army's recent victories. Turkey is the only country whose policy toward Azerbaijan complies with its intentions. Several of Azerbaijan's neighbors maintain a biased approach on the fighting in our Republic. Vague and deliberate reports are frequently published in their newspapers. In fact, several of them claim that Karabakh is a historic Armenian territory and argue that the pressure on the Armenians in Karabakh kindled the war in the region. [passage omitted] It would be better if the neighboring countries helped Azerbaijan at this difficult time to convey its just and honest views to the world. That is because Azerbaijan needs moral support more than material aid. Deliberately vague views confuse the international community. It must be stressed that the Armenians have occupied more than 20 percent of Azerbaijan's territory and more than 1,000,000 peaceful residents have become refugees. Turkey has been the only country to convey our just and honest views to the international community and to take serious action in international organizations. In view of that, we are convinced that President Aliyev's official visit to Turkey will further enhance the cultural unity and friendly relations between the two countries. We are also convinced that Turkey will expose the true nature of the Armenian aggression to the international community. We wish success to President Aliyev. We hope that the outcome of his visit will be successful and auspicious.
