Premier Li said that special attention would be given to the quality of commodities entering the Central Asian markets and legitimate business should be protected and speculation cracked down on. Border trade should continue to develop and its operational level enhanced. In reply to a question on the issue of dual nationality put to him by a journalist today, the premier said that China did not recognize dual nationality as was made clear in China's Law on Nationality. There were now 50 million people in the world of Chinese origin living outside China with most of them living in Southeast Asian countries. The fact that such a large number of people of Chinese origin were living overseas was a historical result and China accepted this historical fact. China had offered them the right to choose their nationality. They could either choose Chinese nationality or that of the country in which they lived. That option meant that they could enjoy all the rights and fulfill the obligations of the country which they choose. This morning, a Sino-Kazakh border agreement was signed here by Premier Li and the President of Kazakhstan, N. A. Nazarbayev. The Sino-Kazakh border is over 1,700 kilometres in length and the two sides reached agreement on more than 1,600 kilometres of its length. At their meeting, the Kazakh president said that Kazakhstan adhered to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and opposed national splittism and hegemonism. Kazakhstan, he said, would not allow "East Turkistan" to stage anti-China activities and undermine Kazakh-Chinese relations in Kazakh territory. President Nazarbayev also said that Kazakhstan considered Taiwan an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China and Kazakhstan would not have any official contacts with Taiwan.
