At the present time, Egyptian tourism faces a crisis that basically consists of a decrease in demand for Egypt's tourism product and thus a decrease in the income earned by tourism. This is a result of the negative image that has been exaggerated by some of the Western media concerning terrorist incidents. The Ministry of Tourism has prepared a plan to stimulate tourism in order to manage and deal with the crisis. Dr. Mamduh al-Biltaji, minister of tourism, feels that the element of time is of extreme importance in the establishment of this plan and obtaining the budget required, in view of what is demanded in terms of the necessity of having the ministry comply with the proper deadlines in a professional manner so that the plan for vigorous promotion of tourism can begin right now, as the time draws near for tour organizers and international tourism companies to prepare their programs for the marketing of tourism for the world's various competing destinations. The minister also feels that the matter requires the expenditure of the necessary effort and money, in accordance with international standards, in order to stimulate tourism. He says that the decrease in income from the fund of tourism and the capacities of the private tourism sector, under current circumstances, are making it necessary for the public treasury to participate in the budget for promoting tourism and that this participation will be decisive with regard to the possibility of managing and dealing with the crisis. He further states that when the expected volume of business occurs, after the campaign to promote tourism, then this participation will, of course, decline. Joint Effort Representatives from government agencies, as well as from the public and private business sector, participated in preparing the plan to promote tourism, and the plan will be carried out by means of a joint effort undertaken by both government and nongovernment parties. The government parties from the Ministry of Tourism are the Egyptian [General] Authority for the Promotion of Tourism, the principal party in charge of carrying out [such plans] by means of its foreign tourism offices actually located in the important markets; and the Conferences and Exhibits Authority, which is in charge of the work concerning conferences and exhibits and promoting them. There is also the Ministry of Culture, which participates by providing archaeological models to tour groups, as well as certain facilities at tourist sites (the Antiquities Authority), as well as the other artistic and cultural agencies of the ministry. Then there is EgyptAir, which participates by providing both free tickets and tickets at reduced prices, and takes part in promotional programs in general. And finally there is the Exhibits Authority in the Ministry of Economy, which helps exhibits with their marketing and arrangements, if they require it. The nongovernment parties provide facilities and services in their areas of competence, and they also partially finance the plan and are in charge of producing some of the promotional tools. These parties are the Egyptian Federation of Tourism Organizations, the Egyptian-American Chamber of Commerce (and similar organizations), and representatives of the hotel establishments and large tourist villages. A permanent committee will be formed to represent the government apparatus, as well as the public and private business sectors, and this committee will follow up on the implementation of the plan and evaluate its results. The committee, under the chairmanship of the minister of tourism, will hold meetings once every three months in order to evaluate performance, overcome any obstacles that might occur, and suggest changes necessary in light of the results of practical application. The plan is very much concerned with investing in the tools for promoting tourism in six principal world markets that export tourism to Egypt, and they were selected in accordance with objective and scientific criteria. These markets are the United States, Britain, Germany, Italy, France, and Japan. These are the markets that export the most tourism to Egypt, and they are also the markets that were most affected by a negative mental image of the terrorist events. These six principal markets were chosen as the target of an intensive effort to promote tourism in accordance with criteria and data dealing with numbers and types of tourists, average lengths of stay and expenditures per tourist, and the degree to which each market would respond to the campaign to promote tourism that will be undertaken. The Arab Market At the same time, though, the plan does not neglect other markets that might represent less volume and be of less importance. There will be a continuation and increase in efforts made and usual promotional tools utilized in these markets. The promotional activities, within the framework of the plan, will extend to a number of new markets such as South Africa, East Asia, Russia, and East Europe. These markets are promising and, at the same time, were not influenced to the same degree by the negative image protrayed by some of the Western media concerning the situation in Egypt. In view of the fact that the Arab market is of a special nature and is one of the important markets that exports tourism to Egypt, the plan has borne in mind the necessity of intensifying efforts to promote tourism by creating the appropriate tools--such as tour groups; hospitality programs; intensified contacts with official and professional organizations; more reliance on the role of the Egyptian press, radio, and satellite channel; and, at the same time, less use of the more expensive promotional tools (such as newspaper and television advertisements) that are not appropriate for this market. In this regard, for example, it has been decided to close the Egyptian Tourism Office in Kuwait, within the framework of the effort to geographically restructure the tourism offices and streamline expenses. The plan's overall budget until the end of the currrent year is $36.199 million for the promotion of foreign tourism and 20 million Egyptian pounds for the necessities for the production of printed materials, films, and hospitality programs that take place in Egypt (that is, a budget totalling about $42 million). The budget required for carrying out this plan until the end of next June is estimated at $25 million, since the expenditure during the first half of the year will increase as a result of production expenses. Dr. al-Biltaji says that the Ministry of Tourism will require two-thirds of the plan's financing requirements during the second half of this year in the 1994/95 fiscal year budget. Implementation Actually Begun The minister adds: "Since the plan includes 1994 as a whole, we actually began implementing some of its programs as of last January. They include the hospitality programs for representatives of the specialized tourism informational media and some of the representatives of the popular world media, actual participation in the most important international tourism exhibits and markets, financing some newspaper and television advertisements, and following up on the normal promotional activities in our foreign tourism offices." Dr. al-Biltaji points out that implementing the plan in a comprehensive, intensive, and productive manner until the end of the year, and then in subsequent years, is something that is dependent on the necessary awareness of the great economic importance of tourism and the strength of its links to all types of economic development and activity in [Egyptian] society. He also states that this can only be carried out by providing the necessary resources for promoting tourism. The minister goes on to say: "If, at this critical stage, it is necessary for the public treasury to shoulder a considerable portion of the promotional burdens, it is also true that the anticipated tourism business--in fact, it is certain, according to the criteria and rates of international expenditures--will bring an increase in tax revenues and will also result in more business for society as a whole. It will also contribute toward solving the unemployment problem, especially among educated young people and university graduates. Furthermore, it will also lead to prosperity of the private tourism sector and consequently to an increase in the volume and proportion of its contribution toward paying the costs of this promotional activity in the future, and thereby will result in a corresponding decrease in the volume and proportion of the contribution made by the public treasury. Main Goal of the Plan The main goal of the promotional plan has been determined. It is to provide incentives for increasing the demand for Egypt's tourism product and to increase the rate of tourism so that it approaches that of the year 1992. Achievement of this [overall] goal involves several other subgoals, which are the following: 1. Raising the level of the promotional tools utilized at the present time and the creation of some additional tools. 2. The creation of a sophisticated library of audio-visual materials to serve the purposes of promotion in the future. 3. Establishing the framework for coordinated activity abroad, which will combine the efforts of the government and private sectors in order to serve the cause of Egyptian tourism. 4. The creation of an agenda for Egyptian archaeological, cultural, musical, and athletic events, which could be utilized to attract tourists. 5. Opening up new horizons for Egyptian tourism in alternative markets in which promotional efforts have not been previously pursued in intensive fashion. 6. Highlighting the numerous attractive elements that Egypt possesses, such as the new tourist areas, an environment free of pollution, the hospitality of the Egyptian people and their friendliness toward foreigners, and the fact that Egypt has the lowest crime rate in the world. 7. Providing better opportunities to present Egyptian tourism development plans and plans for investing in new tourism areas to serious foreign investors in order to encourage them to invest their capital in these plans, so that new absorption capacities can be added to the presently available capacity. Correcting Egypt's Image The efforts of the activity in the targeted markets are being focused on correcting Egypt's national image and putting the terrorist incidents into their proper perspective, in cooperation with the other agencies of the state, which are working toward this goal--particularly Egypt's media and diplomatic missions abroad. The Ministry of Tourism is accomplishing this by means of an intensive advertising campaign dealing with the areas and features that attract tourists to our country. The goal is accomplished more effectively if one approaches the consumers directly. Statistical studies have shown that the largest proportion of tourists who come to Egypt come as individuals rather than in tour groups. This, of course, means that one must utilize widespread popular international media such as television, news agencies, and the principal specialized and nonspecialized press. Although this approach is costly, the returns it yields are double the cost. Therefore, contacts must be strengthened with traditional distributional channels such as tour organizers, travel and tourist agencies, companies that furnish incentives for tourism, conference organizers, associations, and airline companies. Also, the level of the sales promotional materials must be raised in terms of their language and production so that they attain an internationally respectable level. The efforts of the activity are also being focused on the implementation of a program for marketing Egypt's tourism product, as well as on development and investment on sound bases--a program in which one makes use of specialized national and foreign expertise in this field and utilizes a group tour approach having a variety of components and in which active participation in important international tourism conferences and exhibitions is involved. The activity also involves the establishment of a well-thought-out program for sending out invitations to tourist and media personalities to visit Egypt so that they see for themselves that the situation is stable in Egypt and become personally acquainted with the Egypt's historical, natural, human, and cultural features that attract tourists. Also, an organized mechanism needs to be established to periodically follow up on the phases of the plan, evaluate its results one by one, and introduce necessary modifications in light of this. Eight Main Tools The program for implementing the tourism promotional plan depends on eight main tools: 1. Printed materials: Available printed materials will continue to be used, but new materials will be added that, in terms of artistic and printing production, will be on a competitive international level. 2. Films: Five advertising films in different languages dealing with both traditional and new tourist attractions are being produced. They will be shown over the international BBC network, and then over national networks. This will take place in each of the six "main tourist markets" over a 16-week period that has been determined by marketing experts who know the best timing. The periods chosen are April-May and September-October, with the films being shown five days per week. Also, two documentary films are being produced. The first of them concerns the present absorption capacity of Egypt's hotels, the tourist villages, the infrastructure, both the traditional and new tourist attractions, new areas of tourism development and plans for investing in them. The second film concerns the most important events on the tourism agenda and shows some of the various activities connected with these events, as well as the historical and natural panoramic background associated with them. Arrangements are being made to have these films utilized by the national television networks in each of the targeted markets and to have them shown during professional conferences, exhibitions, and festivals held abroad. 3. Press: Paid advertisements and special supplements are being published in the most important newspapers and magazines in each of the targeted countries. 4. Exhibitions and conferences: An inventory is being made of the important regional and international conferences and exhibitions of a tourist nature, and the necessary arrangements are being made to actively participate in them. In addition to this, an inventory is being made of the exhibitions and conferences that could possibly be held in Egypt, and the necessary advertisement plans are being made to increase tourism revenue in connection with them. 5. Tourism agenda: The objective of this is to make a list of and confirm a group of various cultural, musical, and religious events that are held at certain times and places and geographically distributed throughout Egypt's tourist provinces, and to include these events in the foreign promotional programs in order to acquaint people with them and turn them into an additional tourist attraction. 6. Foreign visits and hospitality programs: These are considered to be among the most important means of promoting tourism because they focus on the idea of direct personal contacts and becoming acquainted with Egypt's tourist possibilities on the spot. Work is continuing on the policy of having those persons responsible for tourism in Egypt make visits to each of the main targeted markets, and others participating in the visits would include people from the public and private business sectors. Furthermore, invitations to visit Egypt are continuing to be sent out to a select group of prominent writers and businessmen in each of the targeted markets, and invitations are also being sent to some influential international personalities such as the heads of international tourist organizations or prominent artists to attend Egyptian events. 7. Organized tour groups: These constitute a direct field activity directed to the consumers. Rrevenue from them can be increased by means of appropriate media coverage. Most of the [efforts involving] the organized tour groups are being directed to the new markets and the Arab market. 8. Contests: These are considered to be an effective means of stimulating popular interest in Egypt and increasing knowledge about it. Foreign tourism offices are in charge of arranging these contests, together with establishments concerned in the countries where the offices are located, whether they be schools, universities, clubs, or other groups. The contests can take on the form of questions that must be answered, or they can be part of an already existing popular contest program in the country concerned. In this case, a free visit to Egypt would be the winner's prize, and the plan would set aside 180 prizes for 90 winners and 90 accompanying persons in the six markets, with each market having 30 prizes. The contests would be carried out in cooperation with international airline companies, EgyptAir, and the group of hotels that operate in Egypt. Choice Between Two Alternatives In conclusion, Dr. al-Biltaji, the minister of tourism, said: "This promotional plan has the objective of having Egypt attain, by the end of the present year, the level of income earned during the peak year of 1992, that is, $2.1 billion as opposed to the $1.3 billion earned in 1993. This is something that is quite possible if we undertake the necessary effort and make the expenditures necessary for comprehensive marketing. In other words, we want to spend $42 million in order to earn $800 million." He went on to say: "This plan seems ambitious or out of the ordinary. But this is not the case because, in fact, we are being confronted with two alternatives. The first choice is that we could reduce expenditures in order to deal with a whole list of actual priorities and requirements that, in some case, are urgent. The second choice aims at the future, would break through the blockade of our current problems, adopt the mechanisms of modern marketing, deal with the competition, be in line with the international rates of expenditures necessary for the promotion of tourism, direct the most competitive capability in the Egyptian economy toward export, and thus be committed to marketing requirements. This latter alternative is the choice that I believe we all need to come to the defense of."
