Minister Olechowski pointed out that Sweden, in entering the European Union [EU], will open the way to that organization for Poland and other Central and East European states. In his opinion, if Swedish society votes in the November referendum against Sweden's entry into the EU, this will probably make it impossible to start negotiations for other states to enter -- including Poland. Margaretha af Ugglas stressed that her government was in favor of an open Europe and supported the Central and East European states' strivings to enter the EU.
