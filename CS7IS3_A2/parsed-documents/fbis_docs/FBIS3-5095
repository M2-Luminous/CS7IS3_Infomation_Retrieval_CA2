Hata told a news conference that the move is "unilateral procedural strengthening" and that he is "concerned about it." U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday announced reinstatement of the 1988 trade act's Super 301 portion, which allows the president to retaliate against countries deemed to be engaging in unfair trade practices. Noting that the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks completed in December had agreed to prohibit unilateral steps, Hata said Japan hopes the United States will act on the trade authority carefully. He also indicated Japan will not hesitate to bring its case to the world trade body, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, if the U.S. uses the weapon against Japan. "Japan wants to resolve the case multilaterally rather than bilaterally," he said. Admitting that Japan's unabated current account surplus creates frustration in other countries, Hata also emphasized the need for Japan to make "meaningful" efforts to cut the surplus.
