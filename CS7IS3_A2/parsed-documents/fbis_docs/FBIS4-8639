[passage omitted] Seselj added that there were 180 Muslim casualties in the air strikes. "Nobody has won a war using air strikes. If the war continues the Muslims will be completely defeated and will be left without anything," he said. The radical leader said that the SRS decided that for the time being "there will be no retaliation against Italy," although NATO aircraft took off from air bases in that country. He explained it by the fact that the Italian Government has not yet been formed. Seselj welcomed Silvio Berlusconi's election victory and said that it was an old wish of the radicals that the two countries have a joint border in the western part of the Balkans. He expects that Berlusconi, "as an Italian patriot," will not sacrifice the interests of his country, but will oppose the use of Italian territory for NATO aircraft take-offs. The leader of the Radicals explained that the SRS deputies had walked out of the Yugoslav Assembly's session out of protest that a parliamentary discussion would not be held about the text of a declaration on the bombing of the Serb positions near Gorazde. He believes that it was the Serbian president who did not want the session to be held, for it would prove, according to Seselj, that "Slobodan Milosevic was most to blame for the bombing -- he was yielding more and more as the Western powers were setting increasingly unscrupulous demands." As regards the withdrawing of CNN and AFP correspondents' accreditations, Seselj said he wondered why this had not been done earlier.
