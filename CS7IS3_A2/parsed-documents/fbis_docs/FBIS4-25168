This week is the Water-saving week in China. [sentence as published] According to the Ministry of Construction, China's overall volume of water resources ranks sixth in the world while its per capita water resources is only one fourth of the world average. With the rapid economic development in the country, the demand for water will greatly increase and the expansion and saving of such resources has become an urgent task for the country. At a press conference on water-saving in cities in the country held today, Vice Minister of Construction, Mr. Ye Rutang, pointed out that management over water-saving should be strengthened while the water-container leakage problem first of all needed to be tackled. The leakage of cisterns in toilets has become a long-standing problem for water-saving which has even aroused concern of General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Mr. Jiang Zemin, so that the ministry and the National Construction Materials Bureau have decided that fittings for washing vessels used in toilets would only be allowed to be produced by the ten designated enterprises in some cities including Guangzhou, Beijing and Tangshan. [sentence as published] In addition, the ministry has greatly encouraged the re-use of processed waste water. China has now seen its annual volume of drainage of waste water up to 30 billion cubic metres with much of it being not re-used. China has in recent years made some achievements in its water-saving drive with 13.9 billion cubic metres of water being saved in the past ten years, the repeated utilization rate of water for industrial purposes in cities across the country has increased to 60 percent, and the volume of water exhausted in earning RMB [reminbi] 10 000 output value dropped by 60 percent. Some cities including Shanghai, Tianjin and Ningbo, have effectively controlled their urban surface subsidence through tightening management over the use of underground water.
