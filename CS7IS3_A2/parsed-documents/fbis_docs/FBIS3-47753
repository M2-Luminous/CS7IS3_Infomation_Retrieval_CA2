The Seventh CPV Central Committee decided to hold the mid-term national party conference according to Article 15 of the party statutes. Empowered by the party Central Committee, the Political Bureau decided that the mid-term national party conference will open in Hanoi on 20 January 1994 and will meet until 25 January 1994. The mid-term national party conference will review the implementation of the Seventh Party Congress resolution, sum up the actual results of the renovation process obtained since the Sixth Party Congress, and define major policies and measures aimed at successfully implementing the Seventh Party Congress resolution. The conference will hold a by-election to chose a number of members for the party Central Committee as stipulated in Article 13 of the party statutes. The mid-term national party conference will be attended by 649 delegates, three advisers to the CPV Central Committee, and 10 former Political Bureau members. The Political Bureau affirms that the mid-term national party conference will be a major party conference and an important event in the political life of our party and people and that it, however, is not a party congress. The conference will be organized in a solemn fashion, but it should bear the character of an internal meeting. Its activities should be carried out in a practical, effective, and thrifty manner without any showy displays and ceremonies.
