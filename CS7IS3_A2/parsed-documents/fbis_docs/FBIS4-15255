The court ruled that the publication of extracts from a novel "Mysteries of Kremlin" by former Soviet mp Iona Andronov in the newspaper "ZAVTRA" (TOMORROW), the successor to the notorious "DEN", presented a violation of "the law on the press". The court stated that in accordance with the law the government is entitled to issue a corresponding officiial warning to the newspaper. Two such warnings within one year are enough to close the periodical. The court stated that the publication was "based on absurd conjectures" and qualified it as aimed to "destabilize the situation in Russia and bar the signing of the memorandum on civic peace". The published extracts from the novel by an ardent Yeltsin's foe alongside with bitter criticism against the Russian president, concentrated on the most delicate theme of the present political situation -- the state of health of the Russian number one.
