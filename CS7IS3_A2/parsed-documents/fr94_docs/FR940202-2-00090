ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice informs the public of certain import statistics for the period from January through October 1993 and affords the public an opportunity to comment on certain discretionary decisions the President may make with respect to the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. These decisions concern: (1) The GSP ``competitive need'' limits set forth in section 504(c) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)); (2) the ``de minimis waiver'' authority set forth in section 504(d)(2) of the 1974 Act; and (3) the redesignation authority set forth in section 504(c)(5) of the 1974 Act. Presidential decisions concerning the application of competitive need limits and other product-related decisions stemming from the 1993 Annual Review are expected to be announced in April, and implemented on July 1, 1994. This notice also announces the successful disposition of the review of worker rights practices in Costa Rica and Paraguay in the 1993 Annual GSP Review. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: GSP Subcommittee, Office of the United States Trade Representative, 600 17th Street NW., room 517, Washington, DC 20506. The telephone number is (202) 395&hyph;6971. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Competitive Need Limits Pursuant to section 504(c), any GSP-eligible beneficiary country that exported to the United States during the most recent calendar year a quantity of any one GSP eligible article in excess of (1) $25 million indexed to the nominal growth of U.S. Gross National Product (GNP) since 1974, or (2) 50 percent of the value of total U.S. imports of the article, is to be removed from GSP eligibility with respect to that article not later than July 1 of the next calendar year. The preliminary estimate of this dollar limit, subject to revision, is $107,320,423 for calendar year 1993. II. Reduced Competitive Need Limits Pursuant to section 504(c)(2) of the 1974 Act, a general review of the GSP was initiated in 1985 and the results of the review were announced on January 2, 1987 (52 FR 389). The purpose of the general review was to determine whether beneficiary countries had become sufficiently competitive in GSP-eligible products, on a product and country specific basis. For beneficiaries found to be sufficiently competitive with respect to a product, the percentage competitive need limit was reduced to 25 percent and the dollar limit was reduced to $25 million, indexed to the nominal growth of U.S. GNP since 1984. The preliminary estimate of this dollar limit, subject to revision, is $41,621,070 for calendar year 1993. III. Discretionary Decisions A. De Minimis Waivers Section 504(d)(2) of the 1974 Act permits the President to disregard the 50 percent ``competitive need'' limit with respect to any eligible article if the value of total imports of the article during the most recent calendar year did not exceed $5 million, indexed to the nominal growth of U.S. GNP since 1979. The preliminary estimate of the de minimis level, subject to revision, is $12,553,356 for calendar year 1993. B. Redesignation of Eligible Articles If a country is no longer a beneficiary developing country with respect to an eligible article because imports exceeded the competitive need limits in a prior year, then, pursuant to section 504(c)(5) of the 1974 Act, the President may redesignate the beneficiary developing country with respect to the eligible article if imports do not exceed the competitive need limits in a subsequent year.
