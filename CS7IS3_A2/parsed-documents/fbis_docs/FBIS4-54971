Some 407.6 billion Slovene tolars are expected to accumulate in the state treasury, while the budget deficit will reach 12.8 billion Slovene tolars, which is 0.8 percent of the estimated GNP. The deficit will thus be a good billion higher than anticipated and its increase is primarily due to the additional funds for the maintenance of local and regional highways. All other allocations of funds more or less stayed within the proposed limits. [passage omitted]
