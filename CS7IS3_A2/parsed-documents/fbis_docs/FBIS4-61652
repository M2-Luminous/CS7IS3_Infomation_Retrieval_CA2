Having arrived here at the invitation of this country's leaders, the Belarusian delegation today conducted fruitful work. Mechyslaw Hryb and Vyacheslaw Kebich held negotiations with Moldovan President Mircea Snegur, which were concluded by signing two intergovernmental agreements: an economic and trade agreement and an agreement on social protection of citizens. Also signed was a protocol on consultations between the Moldovan and Belarusian Foreign Ministries. At a news conference, the state leaders emphasized that the agreements signed here are in the interest of both states and the people. At 1500, Mechyslaw Hryb and Vyacheslaw Kebich went their separate ways, as the saying goes. The Cabinet of Ministers chairman and the parliament speaker followed their own programs of the visit, which had been prepared, as I suspect, in accordance with their specific functions and responsibilities. Mechyslaw Hryb held a meeting with Moldovan Supreme Council Chairman Petro (?Kuchynskiy), and Vyacheslav Kebich toured the western regions of Moldova. The Belarusian prime minister visited a children's resort in the city of [name indistinct], and at a history museum, he learned about social and cultural aspects of the development of the Moldovan countryside.
