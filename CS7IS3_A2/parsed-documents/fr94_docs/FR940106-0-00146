FR940106-0-00146 FR940106-0-00022 48. Other source funds. The MESC, commenting on §617.24(e), stated that this rule allows approval of training for which all, or any portion, of the cost of training is paid ``from any other source''. The MESC points out that the rule does not sufficiently define acceptable funding sources. Some limits are necessary. Acceptable funding sources should be limited to recognized employment and training programs, including employer training funds. Such funding sources as friends, relatives, and fraternal organizations should not be acceptable, but §617.24(e) does not preclude them. Department's response. The Department concurs in this comment and has modified §§617.24(e)(2) and 617.25(b)(1) to clarify that other funding sources may not include sources personal to the individual, such as self, relatives, or friends. This is consistent with the Department's prior position on this matter. 49. Equal monthly installments. The MESC questioned the application of the requirement in §617.25(a) that employers be paid in equal monthly installments for on-the-job training (OJT) programs. The MESC stated that problems are associated with trainees entering OJT programs in the middle of the month, trainees receiving raises in wages during the month, and trainees working different hours. The MESC explained that it has attempted to satisfy the intent of the equal monthly payment requirement by having the employer bill for the trainee's hours in training during the month, which results in approximately equal monthly payments. The Governor of Idaho and the WESD presented similar comments on §617.25. The Governor stated that the proposed rule will require Idaho and possibly many other States to incur additional administrative costs to pay for tracking OJT reimbursements. The WESD suggested that reimbursement to employers for actual hours worked by the trainee, on a monthly basis, would eliminate overpayments. Department's response. The Department recognizes that the statutory provision requiring payments for OJT to be made to employers in equal monthly installments is presenting problems in negotiating and reimbursing employers for OJT contracts. In negotiating OJT contracts with employers, reasonable costs should be based on the achievement of a prescribed level of job skills, rather than being based solely on the hourly wages of the worker. The hourly wages should serve only as a guide for establishing OJT contract costs. A raise in the worker's wages implies increased proficiency of the worker and higher productivity, and may not form the basis for increasing training costs. Once the cost of OJT for a worker is established, payments can be made in equal monthly installments, with any required adjustment made in the final payment to the employer. What appears to be troubling to States in administering this provision is thinking of equal monthly installments in terms of equal ``dollar'' amounts. Instead, it appears most reasonable to base the ``equal monthly installments'' on the number of hours of paid work during the month, multiplied by the agreed upon rate of payment. Although this would not assure the same dollar figure for each month, it is nonetheless ``equal'' in the sense that the payment for each month is computed at the same rate. This method would appear to ad-dress the concerns expressed in the comments received, and may be accomplished under the present reading of §617.25(a). For these reasons, no change is made in the regulations. 50. Pell and similar grants. The ODHR, commenting on §617.25(b)(4)(i)(A)( 2 ), stated the rule is clear that when the direct payment of the costs of training has been made under any other Federal law, or the costs are reimbursable under any other Federal law and a portion of the direct costs has already been paid under such other Federal law, payment of such training costs may not be made from TAA funds. The ODHR points out, however, that grants, such as Pell Grants, are often paid directly to the institution to be applied toward tuition. The ODHR feels this contingency should be addressed here and that these funds should be allowed in these cases in determining costs payable from TAA funds for training. Department's response. The Department agrees that complications are presented in considering appropriate TAA funding in the case of Pell Grants and similar Federal educational assistance. Section 617.25(b)(4)(ii)(C) provides, in implementing section 236(a)(4)(C), that such federal educational assistance paid to the individual may not be taken into account in determining payment of the costs of training from TAA or other funds, but such payments to the individual shall be deducted from TRA under §617.13(c)(2). Conversely, when such Federal educational assistance is paid to the training institution, to the extent it is used for training costs otherwise payable from TAA funds, it must be taken into account in determining the training costs payable from TAA funds, either alone or in combination with other funds. To clarify this matter, the regulations at §617.25(b)(4)(ii)(C) are modified; combination funding is otherwise addressed in more detail in the completely revised §617.25. 51. OJT approval. The AFL&hyph;CIO recommended that additional standards be added in §617.25(a) concerning the approval of on-the-job training agreements. Further, the AFL&hyph;CIO recommended that since employers available to provide OJT under TAA have offered such training under JTPA, those who failed to meet JTPA requirements should be barred from receiving TAA funds for such training. Such a requirement is clearly in keeping with the emphasis on coordination of TAA program activities with the JTPA Title III program. Department's response. The requirements in §617.25(a) are based on existing statutory language, and provide adequate protection to workers from adverse effects under OJT training contracts. The Department agrees that contracts under the TAA program for OJT should not be entered into with employers who failed to meet JTPA requirements. While §617.25 (a)(9) and (a)(10) are intended to avoid such situations, the final rule is clarified to help ensure that employers who violated a JTPA training contract will be denied TAA training contracts. The words ``or under any other Federal law'' is added after ``this Subpart C'' in paragraph (a)(9) of §617.25, with another addition at the end of paragraph (a)(9) to make this point clear.
