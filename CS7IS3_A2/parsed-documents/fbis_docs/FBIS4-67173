It is estimated that the drugs seized, which required the processing of 40 tons of marijuana to produce, had a market value exceeding 150 million new pesos. Information obtained from the PGR's [Office of the Attorney General of the Republic] assistant attorney's office for local branches and inspection, headed by Alfonso Cabrera Morales, has revealed that the French citizen, Herder Falaizer Bober, and the Mexicans, Ismael Serrano Lopez, Ismael Adame Switeer, and Jose Dolores Garcia, are at the disposal of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office. The group had a shipment of 40.7 liters of hashish in its possession. The preliminary investigations reveal that those presumed guilty, who have made confessions regarding the charges brought against them by the social representative, were arrested in a domicile on the corner of Lazaro Cardenas and Ninos Heroes Streets, in the municipality of Cancun's Colonia Puerto Morelos. The probe has been intensified in that locality. It is recorded in preliminary investigation No. 50/94 that the confiscated drugs presumably were to be taken by land and air to the country's northern border. They were contained in two plastic kegs, each with a 20-liter capacity, and one bottle. Experts on the subject are still analyzing the hashish to determine its degree of purity. According to the police authorities, headed by the Attorney General's Office representative in that state, Jose Luis Farrera Olmedo, the captured traffickers are presumed to be members of a criminal organization operating on an international scale. They must have processed at least 40 tons of marijuana to procure the hashish, which "most assuredly was bound for the neighboring country to the north for sale and consumption." Giving further details on the incident, the Attorney General's Office reported that the police agents assigned to the case are primarily seeking, in the same town, the clandestine laboratory in which the marijuana was processed. They are also attempting to learn where the public poisoners obtained it. It was learned that the investigation has been extended to Guerrero and Tabasco States, of which the Frenchman's accomplices are natives. It is considered quite likely that these individuals sent the cannabis indica to Quintana Roo, and that it certainly was processed there. However, there is a rumor that this processing occurred in Cozumel, where police personnel also have been detailed.
