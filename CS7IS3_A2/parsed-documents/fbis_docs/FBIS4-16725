The report delivered by acting finance minister S. Dubinin notes that revenue is around 120 trillion rubles [R] whereas expenditure is R180 trillion. Well, the deficit is not all that alarming. Especially since the speaker gave an assurance that social needs have been protected. True, a comparison of the figures (48.5 trillion for defense and the law enforcement organs, 12.3 trillion for social needs) does not bear that out. The deciphering of the budget, item by item, alarmed the deputies. Deputy Bikalova characterized it thus: "The whole social sphere is under threat. You ask, where can expenditure be cut? I say, in the sphere of administration!" "It is impossible not to adopt the budget but it will be even worse if we adopt it in this form," Deputy Gordeyev from the Russian Federation Communist Party said. "If we do adopt it then in September-October we will be facing the problem of nonpayments. Production will stop once and for all. On 12 December the people said that there must be an end to the euphoria of the pseudomarket reforms. The optimism over the small deficit is unfounded. Tax receipts are falling, everything has been given to the private sector but it is uncontrollable. The government should not talk about objective difficulties but propose a set of measures making it possible to increase the revenue section of the budget. And expenditure must be taken under tight state control." Is that not too simple? But in that simplicity is the nub of the problem. For example, supposing that you try to check why it is that even those small amounts of money allocated to the agro-industrial complex have still not reached people in the countryside? Perhaps the power structures should try to find out which banks this money is languishing in, enabling devious officials to get rich? Or perhaps ministers do not mind the fact that they are greeted by a new picket every morning, as if to schedule? But what will happen if one day, for example, all of Russia suddenly unites behind the single demand: "If you cannot govern, get out"? The draft budget was adopted as a basis at the third attempt.
