FR940429-0-00120 FR940429-0-00012 Changes: Section 667.21(b)(4)(i) is revised to require a State to quantify this standard by establishing criteria (rather than just a percentage, as in proposed §667.21(b)(4)(i)) under which a SPRE determines if the tuition and fees charged by an institution for a vocational program are excessive compared to the amount of money that a student who successfully completes that program may reasonably be expected to earn. Section 667.21(a)(9)(i) is changed to clarify that this is the purpose of the standard. In addition, §667.22(b)(5) is revised to require a State to specify the methods and data used by the SPRE to determine if the tuition and fees charged by an institution for a vocational program are excessive. Assessing a Student's Ability to Complete the Program Comments: Many commenters objected to the proposal that a SPRE judge the effectiveness of an institution's method to assess that a student has the ability to complete successfully the educational program for which he or she applied. Many commenters argued that there is no correlation between an institution's assessment method and the graduation rate of students in an educational program. The commenters cited many reasons that a student might fail to complete a program that is unrelated to the student's academic ability, including motivation, personal finances, family obligations, a change in employement, and others, and suggested that the proposed requirement be removed. Many other commenters contended that the Secretary exceeded statutory authority in proposing this requirement. A number of these commenters argued that requiring a SPRE to judge the effectiveness of an institution's assessment method could lead to the use of mandatory, standardized tests, or other methods that require profiles of program completers, for determining a student's admission into a program. These commenters believed the use of these methods would lead institutions whose mission is to serve high-risk students to change their mission. Several other commenters suggested that the proposed standard be expanded to (1) include other positive outcome measures, or (2) allow a SPRE to consider the rigor, fairness, and consistent application of an institution's assessment method in judging that method. A number of commenters agreed with the proposal but suggested that an SPRE's judgment regarding the effectiveness of an institution's assessment method should be limited to vocational programs. Like many other commenters, these commenters contended that there is little direct correlation between student success and admissions standards for degree programs. One of these commenters argued that there is a much stronger correlation between student success and admissions criteria in vocational programs than in degree programs because of the shorter length and more narrow focus of vocational programs. The commenter believed there is a greater need to assess the adequacy of the admission standards for vocational programs because the population served by those programs tends to be less prepared for postsecondary education than students in degree programs. Another commenter believed strongly that an extraordinarily high student drop-out rate (1) may indicate other serious problems with an educational program, including the poor quality of its teachers or the lack of necessary equipment, and (2) invariably indicates enrollment of students unable to understand or handle course material. A few other commenters believed that the ``ability-to-benefit'' provision in the title IV, HEA program regulations satisfies the statutory requirement under this part that an institution have a method to assess a student's ability to complete successfully an educational program. Discussion: The Secretary is convinced that many points made by the commenters are valid, and that other standards adequately accomplish the Secretary's originally stated objectives in proposing this standard. The Secretary clarifies, however, that the standard described in §667.21(a)(3) applies to all regular students at an institution, not just those students who qualify to receive financial assistance under the title IV ability-to-benefit provisions. Changes: Proposed §667.21(a)(4) is removed. Suggestion to Augment the Standard Proposed in §667.21(a)(7) Concerning Compliance With Health and Safety Standards Comments: Most commenters objected to the suggestion in the preamble to the NPRM for views on whether a SPRE, as part of its review, should determine an institution's compliance with statutes and regulations governing access to disabled individuals. They considered the proposal to be beyond the scope and purpose of the SPRP. Discussion: Based on comments and further review, the Secretary agrees not to include this provision. Disabled individuals are protected under applicable statutes without the additional provision for a SPRE review in that area. Changes: None. Standard in Proposed §667.21(a)(9) Governing Institutional Plans for Closure Comments: A number of commenters, including several commenters writing on behalf of States, urged the Secretary to define the term ``financially at risk'' as that term applies to the standard under which a SPRE would require an institution to provide for the instruction of students and the retention of records in the event the institution closes. Discussion: The Secretary believes that a SPRE may view an institution to be financially at risk if it does not satisfy the factors of financial responsibility in §668.15 of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, 34 CFR part 668. Changes: None. Standard in Proposed §667.21(a)(14) Comments: A number of commenters suggested specific methods for establishing acceptable percentages for student completion and graduation rates, placement rates, withdrawal rates, and licensure examination pass rates.
