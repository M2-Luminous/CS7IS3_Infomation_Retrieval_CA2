FR941017-2-00103 FR941017-2-00061 [Release No. 34&hyph;34813; File No. SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;94&hyph;45] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Regarding Amendments to PHLX Rule 1015 and Floor Procedure Advice A&hyph;11 October 7, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on September 19, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change Paragraph (b), ``Trade or Fade'' of PHLX Rule 1015, ``Quotation Guarantees,'' provides that, for non-public customer orders to buy (sell) at the displayed offer (bid), or portions of customer orders grater than the minimum size guarantee in that option, the trading crowd must either: (1) Sell (buy) the number of contracts specified in the order; or (2) change the displayed offer (bid) to reflect that the previous displayed offer (bid) is no longer available. PHLX Rule 1015(b) also states that when the disseminated market quote is revised, it shall be considered inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade for the trading crowd to immediately re-display the previously disseminated market quote, unless such action is warranted by a change in market conditions. The PHLX proposes to amend Floor Procedure Advice (``Advice'') A&hyph;11, ``Responsibility to Make Ten-Up Markets,'' to add the ``trade or fade'' language of PHLX Rule 1015(b) to Advice A&hyph;11. In addition, the PHLX proposes to add the phrase ``in any options series on the Exchange'' to PHLX Rule 1015(a) in order to clarify the rule. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PHLX, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The PHLX states that the purpose of the proposal is to amend Advice A&hyph;11 to correspond to PHLX Rule 1015. PHLX Rule 1015, which was amended recently, 1 mirrors the text of Advice A&hyph;11 and also adds a trade or fade provision. Because Advice A&hyph;11 was also amended recently, 2 the text of Advice A&hyph;11 was in flux when new PHLX Rule 1015 was adopted, and, accordingly, did not contain the trade or fade language approved therein. Otherwise, PHLX Rule 1015 tracks the text of Advice A&hyph;11 and was intended to incorporate the procedures of Advice A&hyph;11 into a specific PHLX rule. 1 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34434 (July 22, 1994), 59 FR 39007 (August 1, 1994) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;94&hyph;30). 2 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34400 (July 19, 1994), 59 FR 38011 (July 26, 1994) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;91&hyph;45). At this time, the text of Advice A&hyph;11 no longer mirrors PHLX Rule 1015. In order to rectify this, the PHLX proposes to add two paragraphs to Advice A&hyph;11, which appears for advisory purposes in the PHLX's Floor Procedure Advice Handbook. In addition, the PHLX proposes a minor amendment to PHLX Rule 1015 to add the phrase ``in any option series on the Exchange,'' which appears in the first paragraph of Advice A&hyph;11. The PHLX also proposes to amend Advice A&hyph;11 by labeling paragraph (a) as ``Quotation Guarantees.'' The PHLX states that PHLX Rule 1015(a) was adopted without this particular phrase. The PHLX believes that the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and, in particular, with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, and to protect investors and the public interest by copying the text of the trade or fade provisions in PHLX Rule 1015(b) to Advice A&hyph;11.
