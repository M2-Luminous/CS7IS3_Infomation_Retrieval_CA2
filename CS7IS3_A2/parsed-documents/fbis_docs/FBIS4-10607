The Radical leader also continued to defend his decision to support the ruling Justicialist Party's reform platform last year despite his party's distant second-place finish in Sunday's [10 April] Constituent Assembly election. "I have complete assurance," Menem said yesterday, "that no matter how much (Radical Deputy) Jesus Rodriguez has expressed his desire to support Frente (Grande) or make an alliance" the pact will be fulfilled. Rodriguez led the Radicals' Federal Capital slate of candidates to a third-place finish in a district that until last year's congressional election had been the party's stronghold. Following Sunday's election he raised the possibility of forming a broad opposition coalition to defeat Menem next year if the Constituent Assembly approves the Olivos Pact, which would permit the President to run for two consecutive terms in office.
