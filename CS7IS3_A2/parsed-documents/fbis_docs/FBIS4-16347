A total of 337 deputies were elected as a result of the voting, extended for two weeks. This is quite enough for the parliament to start working. Elections were recognised as invalid in 113 constituencies, and run-off elections will be held there. It is clear already that the hegemony of the nationalistic ideology of the Rukh party in Ukraine was dealt a crushing blow. The fact that more than one third of deputies belong to the bloc of the left-wing forces (86 communists, 14 socialists and 18 members of the Peasants' Party) is not the most important of all. There is another thing which is even more important: The elections showed vividly that the left-bank and right-bank parts of Ukraine have different concepts of the country's future. The industrially developed eastern regions of Ukraine demonstrated most convincingly what they want: The overwhelming majority of their residents voted for representatives of left-wing parties and movements and for industrial managers. No one could forecast the tremendous defeat suffered by national-radicals in the biggest regions of Ukraine. The Donetsk and Lugansk regions sent left-wing deputies to parliament and strengthened their anti- nationalistic stand by the results of local referendums. The Donets coal basin (Donbass) voted unambiguously for the equality of the Russian and Ukrainian languages, for Ukraine's joining of the CIS and its interparliamentary assembly, as well as for the federal setup of Ukraine. It remains to be seen whether or not deputies from the eastern regions of Ukraine will manage to prove in parliament the expediency of their attitude to those problems. This is not going to be easy, however. Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the people's Rukh party, stated point-blank on the second day after the elections that his party, which got 38 seats in parliament, intended to further oppose both Ukraine's joining of the CIS and the equality of the two languages in the independent Ukraine. Observers do not rule out a possibility of a split in the new parliament according to the territorial principle. Many people believe that the first session, scheduled for mid-May, will be held in an atmosphere of anti-Russian and anti-communist hysteria, because the western regions of Ukraine again sent to parliament, together with popular fighters for the independent Ukraine, several members of UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian National Self-Defense], which is an openly fascist organisation. National- radicals do not conceal their intention to give a "farewell performance" on April 22 and to use the last session of the current Supreme Soviet for setting the tone for the speeches of their successors. However, a political debate will hardly be long in the new parliament, because this will be mortally dangerous for the Ukrainian economy, nearly brought to a standstill, and for the destitute Ukrainian population.
