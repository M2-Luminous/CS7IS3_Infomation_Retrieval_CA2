Government elements are currently discussing the details of the initiative in preparation for the formulation of Israel's official position, which will then require the approval of Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister. The review is taking into account political and technical considerations, such as the international policy on the prevention of nuclear proliferation, the U.S. position on Israel's nuclear capability, and the future of this issue in the era of peace arrangements. Senior government elements said in the past that ``Israel has no problem with any part of the initiative, and it can live with it,'' but divergent opinions have been voiced in internal debates, leading to sharp disagreements. Various elements have voiced reservations about Israel's joining the Clinton initiative, asserting that Israel should not make commitments that will confine its future activities. [passage omitted on the Clinton initiative and foreign reports] Senior government elements said that the main problem facing Israel's nuclear policy is the renewal of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which Israel refused to sign. This treaty, which was first signed in 1968 and went into effect in 1970, acknowledges five nuclear states: the United States, Russia, Britain, France, and China. Many countries, as well as U.S. Administration figures, have urged Israel to sign the NPT. The belief in Israel, however, is that the United States will not exert pressure to secure Israel's signature to the treaty as long as the peace process continues and Israel is required to take territorial risks. According to this theory, Israel will be able to withstand pressure from the international community, but will find it difficult to stand up to direct U.S. pressure to join the NPT. In 1969, the U.S. Administration endorsed the understanding achieved between President Richard Nixon and Prime Minister Golda Meir, and that understanding remains the foundation of Israel's nuclear policy.
