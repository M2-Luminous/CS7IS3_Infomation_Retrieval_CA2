He first of all tried to enter a room where a meeting of the Liberal Group was being held (which had refused to let him participate), and then let fly vindictive remarks aimed at the French authorities because they had issued him with a restricted visa. Mr. Vladimir Shumeyko, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, spoke at the opening of the sitting. He once more appealed for swift accession by Russia to the Council of Europe, which would constitute recognition of the "irreversible choice for democracy and human rights" made by his country. He stressed that the organisation cannot become truly pan-European until Russia is part of it, and that accession would naturally lead to greater reform. This, however, is not Mr. Zhirinovskiy's opinion. He considered the Council of Europe should understand that the delegation sent to Strasbourg represents the "losers" of the last elections, and that he, alone, represented the winners. In his view, "most deputies want neither NATO nor the Council of Europe." He said Russia was more "advanced" than the Council of Europe: "We have overtaken you (...) We have more rights and liberties than your Member States," he said. He went on to say that the Council of Europe encompasses countries like Turkey which bombs Kurd villages and the United Kingdom that inflicts a bloodbath on Northern Ireland, while NATO bombs the Serbs. In his opinion, NATO should be dissolved and the Council of Europe should not speak to Russia with the "tone of mentors" as it is the Council that should conform to Russian norms and not the other way round. "You should pay us for all the revolutions you have stirred up over the past 75 years (...) and for having inoculated us with the virus of communism," he added before going on to conclude: "We do not yet know where Russia's frontiers are.... You will have to accept them once we have decided."
