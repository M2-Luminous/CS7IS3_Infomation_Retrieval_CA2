There is still a chill in the air of Beijing in February, but the Friendship Palace of the Friendship Guesthouse is full of spring. On the stage, students from the Central University of Nationalities were displaying costumes and styles of China's minority nationalities. [passage omitted] Among the audience, Israeli Ambassador to China Ya'agov praised: "It's so beautiful! The long history and splendid culture of China are intoxicating." It seems that China's achievements have even more impressed the ambassador who has been here for a half year. He said: "I am not long in China, but everything in China, particularly her progress over these years, has surprised me." [passage omitted] The "Sinologue" "No Longer Recognizes China" Speaking on China, Russian Ambassador to China Rogachev, who has enjoyed the nickname of "Sinologue," looked a little excited. He said: Since the founding of China, particularly since the 1980's, China has changed so greatly that "I can hardly recognize her." [passage omitted] Rogachev said the greatest changes in China over these years can be seen in people's attitudes, words, and behavior. He said: "They are all very busy and have their own goals; they are very optimistic, which is obviously the result of continuous improvement in living standards." The Practical "New Generation" Cheerful Cuban Ambassador to China Guerra maintained that China's development over the decade or so is a "miracle." Guerra paid his first visit to China in 1967, when the "Cultural Revolution" was in progress. At that time, he said, "People wore the same style of clothes, spoke, and behaved almost identically; one could hardly tell who was man and who was woman." When he returned to Beijing in 1988, he found that Beijing had "completely changed." People's clothes have turned from dull blue, grey, and green to distinct colors; the wide streets, skyscrapers, and incessant flow of traffic all display the city's vitality. From ordinary people's daily activities and codes of conduct, Guerra concluded: The most profound change in China is the renewal of people's thinking -- the emergence of "a practical new generation." The Large, Attractive Market French Ambassador Presant [name as received] just returned from Shenzhen. He had participated in the ceremony for putting the No. 1 generator of the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant into commercial operation there. In conversations, Presant showed his joy for the successful operation of this project. Although he has been in office for one month, he has deeply sensed this country's vitality. He said: "Commercial complexes stand in Beijing everywhere; the thick commercial air here seems to match that in Paris." A two-day tour in Shenzhen allowed him to witness an extraordinary development in China. He said: "It is hard to imagine that Shenzhen was a small fishing village 15 years ago!" Speaking on the prospects for economic cooperation, he said: The trade volume between France and China accounts for only 1.8 percent of France's foreign trade; "France's share in the big market of China does not match her position in the international economy and does not correspond to the potential of both countries. Presently, French enterprises in the energy, transportation, and telecommunications sectors strongly desire to cooperate with China, and the normalization of Franco-Chinese relations is good news to these enterprises." "Difficulties in the Course of Development" The ambassadors have also noticed some difficulties confronting China, including transport and energy shortages, unbalanced development among regions, the need to readjust the industrial structure, and others. "Take transport as an example; nearly one-third of Russo-Chinese trade contracts could not be fulfilled in 1993 because of transport shortages," said Rogachev with regret. As for the gap between eastern and western China, Guerra, who has inspected both Shanghai and Xinjiang, said: "They are at different levels, but they are both advancing. It is like two high jumpers -- one jumps to the two-meter mark from his starting point at the one-meter mark, whereas the other jumps to the four-meter mark from the three-meter mark. In one sense, Xinjiang may be undergoing greater change, despite the fact that it will still take a long time to catch up with Shanghai." Indian Ambassador to China Dasgupta felt that China needs to improve her basic education and occupational training. "As a country with a large population, China and India are both facing the problem of improving their population quality as quickly as possible," otherwise the population will adversely affect their "economic development and social progress." Rogachev maintained: "There would be no progress if there were no difficulties. China's difficulties are occurring in the course of development; she will overcome all kinds of obstacles and accomplish greater achievements." China's Progress Is "A Contribution to World Development" [Passage omitted] Dasgupta maintained: As a country in which one-fifth of the world's population lives, China's rapid development will produce a profound influence on the whole world; it will be "a contribution to world development" and will inspire development in other countries. Klara Meszaros is a female ambassador from Hungary; female ambassadors have been rare in China. She said in fluent Mandarin: "China is a country full of vitality and hope." [passage omitted] This female ambassador was infatuated with China's ancient civilization, but she obviously showed more concern for China's reform. She said: "I am very glad to see China's progress; it will benefit the whole world."
