The daily's editor, Michele Garttan, said the sources had been assured of anonymity when they agreed to give their story to the newspaper. "Their identity is confidential and we will not betray their trust in us," said Garttan said in a telephone interview today. On whether she would cooperate with Malaysian police in their investigations, Garttan said they had not been approached as yet. "We will decide on this if and when we are approached," she said. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Rahim Noor said on Tuesday that they had sought the help of the Australian Interpol to interview the former ASIS agents who had made the accusations. Rahim said police also wanted to interview the editors and journalists of the THE CANBERRA TIMES and the SUNDAY TELEGRAPH regarding the reports. Garttan said there had not been many reports in the Australian newspapers over the last few days on the issue as interest seemed to have died down. The SUNDAY TELEGRAPH reported on Jan 16 that opposition leaders in Malaysia and Singapore had been paid bribes, while the report by THE CANBERRA TIMES on Feb 3 stated that the recipients of these bribes included Government politicians. The reports claimed that the payments were made without the full knowledge or consent of the Australian Government. They claimed that payments were first made when the leaders were junior politicians and increased as they grew in stature. It was reported today that the editor-in-chief of the SUNDAY TELEGRAPH, John Hardigan, had agreed to cooperate with Malaysian police in their investigations. Police are expected to send several officers from the special team set up to investigate the allegations to Australia soon. The team has already recorded statements from several politicians here. Meanwhile, the Australian journalists' union has rejected a Malaysian suggestion that reporters should reveal to Malaysian police their sources for allegations that Australian spies had bribed Malaysian politicians. Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance national secretary Chris Warren said in Canberra that Australian journalists would not reveal this information to Malaysian authorities or anyone else because journalists here are bound by a code of ethics not to prejudice sources or breach any other confidences.
