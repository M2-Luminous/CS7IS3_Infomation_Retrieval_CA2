[Jeszenszky] We made a mistake in communication; we did not manage to put across our successes. Some people have claimed that, during the past month, we have been conducting a clumsy propaganda campaign of success. However, we were merely informing the people of what we have achieved. For instance, many people got back their property, something they did not even dream of in 1990. Moreover, a campaign was waged in our country for four years claiming that we were not succeeding. It was also claimed often that we have no experts. At the same time, no Hungarian Government has ever had so many educated people, people with academic titles. It was thought that the previous communist government had the experts and that these people would be necessary. [LIDOVE NOVINY] Did you not lose because you behaved in too authoritarian a manner, because you, for instance, discharged hundreds of journalists critical of the government from public radio and television? [Jeszenszky] In no way; these journalists were not discharged by the government or the Hungarian Democratic Forum. The government cannot interfere in these media. Many people, especially Hungarians living abroad, are not satisfied with television and radio. They complain that these media only present our country in a bad light. [LIDOVE NOVINY] What is your opinion of the victorious Socialists? Is it possible to talk about the return of the old communist structures or is there a young, liberally endowed left wing at the head of this party as there is in Poland? [Jeszenszky] There are about 20 more of these Hungarian Socialists than Polish socialists and, according to some observers, they are in an even worse situation than in 1990. That is, they have no Pozsgay or Nemeth. However, I am keeping my fingers crossed for them and hope that they come up to scratch and keep their promises. [LIDOVE NOVINY] Why did people vote for them? [Jeszenszky] This was a typical protest vote against the government; the people did not want us to carry on. They succumbed to illusions. Hungarian communism was, during its last 10 years, more moderate than in your country. Gas and bread were cheaper then than they are today and people believe that they will again become less expensive. [LIDOVE NOVINY] What will you do after the elections? Will you return to history, to your original field? [Jeszenszky] I would like to. I have given a lecture once a week for four whole years. However, I will probably have to remain in parliament and supervise government policy. Former Prime Minister Antall was my history teacher, I had known him since I was 15, and I feel obliged to carry on his ideas.
