Describing the situation in Gorazde, Enes Musovic says that "the chetniks have been fiercely shelling all the residential areas this afternoon. It has been particularly bad in Vitkovici and the surrounding villages." He says that "the chetniks have been pounding the village of Kopaci with multiple rocket launchers. The latest information is that the chetnik heavy artillery and infantry attacks are still under way on (Borova) from the direction of Ustipraca. There is very fierce hand-to-hand fighting." Enes Osmancevic reports from Tuzla that "this morning Karadzic's Serbs fired with tanks and artillery at Tuzla airport. A dozen destructive shells were fired at the airport from Jablanica on Mt. Majevica, which has been under the control of Karadzic's terrorists since the outbreak of the war." He says that "just after this artillery attack on Tuzla airport, NATO planes appeared and patrolled for a while over Tuzla and Mt. Majevica." Reporting from Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that "the defenders have been heroically resisting attacks that have been coming in waves. In decisive counterattacks, the defenders today eliminated dozens of chetniks and destroyed one T-55 tank. As for Buzim, the attacks on this area have been increasingly coming from the territory of Croatia, that is, from the so-called Serbian autonomous region of Krajina, and the enemy mortar shells have also been sailing over the heads of members of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]." Reporting on the situation in Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says that "the Serbian aggressor's troops have today carried out a whole series of tank and infantry attacks. There have been nine of them on the Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca-Boderiste direction alone, and at the moment of reporting chetnik infantry and tanks, supported by all sorts of artillery pieces, are attacking the central part of the Brcko defenses, and again Omerbegovaca, Vranovaca, and Boderiste. These attacks, which were launched late this afternoon, came after the aggressor received new amounts of MTS [expansion unknown] from Banja Luka." He says that "over 3,000 shells of various types have landed on the Brcko defense lines today, and the enemy commanders are also not sparing their manpower. Such losses by the aggressor have been unseen here since last summer. The fighters of the 108th Motorized and the 108th Infantry Brigade have brought the chetniks to their knees today. At 1615 the fighters of the 108th Motorized Brigade destroyed a chetnik tank with its entire crew, then they destroyed the command post of an enemy unit, and then a chetnik stronghold on the central part of the Brcko front. There was a real slaughter of chetniks in the Omerbegovaca- Vranovaca-Boderiste direction. (Two) high-ranking enemy officers and a number of their retinue still lie dead in front of our positions. The chetnik ambulances have today covered as many kilometers as there are on the Paris-Dakar rally." Ahmed Begicevic reports from Travnik that "the chetnik shelling started early this morning and throughout the day mortars of all calibers have been landing on the town. The chetniks also shelled the defense lines in Turbe."
