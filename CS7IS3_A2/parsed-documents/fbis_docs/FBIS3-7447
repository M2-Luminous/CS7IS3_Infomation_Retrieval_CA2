On March 26, while making a round of frontline units of the puppet Army, he incited war fever against the North, crying for a flawless "posture for countermove". It cannot go unnoticed that the South Korean puppets are fanning confrontation with the North at a time when the perfidious U.S. warlikers are aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula by threatening the resumption of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises this year and ordering the deployment of "Patriot" missiles in South Korea after totally reversing the agreed conclusions reached between the DPRK and the United States in New York. Facts show that the South Korean puppets are getting more frenzied with the passage of time in driving inter-Korean relations to the brink of war on the order of the U.S. masters. The South Korean puppet clique are trying to ignite a war against the DPRK, following the adventurous war moves of the U.S. imperialists. But they would be well advised to mind that they would eventfully die a miserable death in the flame they kindled.
