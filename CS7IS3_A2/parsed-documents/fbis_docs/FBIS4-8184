The Muslims abused this. We now still have Serbs in Gorazde. For a whole two years the cries of Serbs could be heard from Gorazde. Our troops on the surrounding mountain peaks could hear them and it was not easy for them. If the attacks continue, we will employ the measures that all peoples and armies employ in self-defense. If we deem it necessary, we shall proclaim a state of war. It is clear then, that we have to name the aggressor and all the structures that belong to this aggressor are not welcome on our territory, but we are convinced that incidents will not happen, with the exception of what we command and the orders issued from the level of the General Staff and the Interior Ministry. In any case, our army showed restraint, and that is why the effects of the bombings were not worrying. Moreover, we have our objective and that is the breaking of the Muslim offensive. If the attacks should continue, I am convinced that an escalation is unavoidable, but everyone needs to know that we will not become frightened. Our people have a goal, they know precisely that they are right. Our army is ready and raring to go, and we have no reason to be afraid. There is no air force that can deter us from realizing our goals, nor can it turn the war luck. On the contrary, it can plunge the entire region into a crisis, and, as I said, the West will be the first to plunge into a crisis because of what it has done. We believe that the international community is pushing us precisely in the direction that it wanted to divert us from. It is pushing us toward creating a unified state. If the Serbian people continue to be exposed to our enemies' attacks and to the international community's benevolence toward our enemies, it may decide to go ahead with unification. We want everything to progress in phases, and we want everything to progress in accordance with the international community. However, if the international community continues with such behavior, we may decide to take a different course. And then the international community will find itself facing a fait accompli. [Correspondent] What is the Serbian side's position in the war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina regarding a political solution to the war, the crisis in these areas, that is, and tell us frankly what is the Serb side's position regarding the partition of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Karadzic] Well, look at it this way. We did not want this war, we did not want the (?disintegration) of Yugoslavia, or if you want to put it this way, we are still in Yugoslavia because we never agreed to leave it. We were forced to create our republic in order to be able to defend ourselves and to legitimate all our efforts. The essential interest of the Serbian people is to live in one state. Our priority is unification with Serbia. We are even ready to consign the Srpska republic to memory, and to unite with Serbia as a whole [sentence as heard]. If this proves impossible, we will accept the status of some kind of Serbian federation for as long as we want it, and then later we will go ahead with unification. If, however, this too proves impossible, we will nevertheless not give up on independence. Whether we are going to link up with someone after recognition, and who this will be, this remains [changes thought] this is a political issue. As far as territory is concerned, let me put it this way: If Serbs are dying for their village, then they are not giving it up. Knowing the concessions the Serbs would have made, it is completely unclear why the Muslims are attacking certain areas that could have been theirs without any struggle. Since they are fighting, and the Serbs are dying for these areas, they will not get anything. The Muslims are at a great risk of losing everything. We hold (?64 percent) of the territory as our own, and we live on (?65 percent) of the territory as a majority people. We control 72 percent of the territory. We will probably have to give back at least the percentage from 72 to 64 percent [sentence as heard]. Perhaps -- in the name of communications and [word indistinct] and so forth -- we could go a little below (?64 percent). However, 50 percent or below 50 percent.... [Correspondent, interrupting] Forty-nine, which is [words indistinct] [Karadzic] That is out of the question. That was a variant in which the Muslims would get 33 and the Croats 17 or 17.5 percent had peace been signed that day. At the same time, there is a calculation that, I admit, (?has been calculated) by Mr. Krajisnik, which is correct. We should actually get 60 percent and the Muslims and Croats should get 50 percent. This means, that the former Bosnia-Herzegovina has 110 percent, naturally. This is actually so, as the Muslims and the Croats have some territories that overlap, that is, the territories that [word indistinct] to the Muslims and the Croats alike. Therefore, the Muslims and the Croats can satisfy their appetites in this respect. However, if a war solution takes place, we will most definitely keep everything. For this reason it is much better for the opposite side to immediately agree on restoration of peace and political talks. [Correspondent] Mr. President, in place of my last question, would you like to send a message to our nation, which probably expects you to say something regarding the latest events? [Karadzic] I can say that all the Serbs worldwide are proud of the way in which we, here, have faced the threats of bombing. Now, the bombing has materialized and we have seen what it looks like. Simply as if the people would say, fire away and we will see what next, what you want. The people feel as strong as Antaeus, they feel strong because they are on their own soil. I would like to send a message to our people not to worry, as it will be the way the people have decided. The authorities, the army, and the police will do what constitutes the tendency and aspiration of our nation. We know this aspiration from several referendums, from the first elections, and finally also from daily contacts.
