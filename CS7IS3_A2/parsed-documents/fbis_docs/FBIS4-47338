There are fluctuations caused by nonuniform precipitation due to medium)scale (several hundred meters) atmospheric turbulence. Thereafter such statistical phenomena are called intermediate statistics. Local fluctuations of contamination density due to heterogeneous migration of radio nuclides (caused first of all by microrelief of the terrain) when the size of the studied territory is under 10 m are called local statistics. The objective of the work was to determine the character of statistical distributions caused by local and intermediate statistics, the number of soil samples necessary for determining the surface density of radioactive contamination with required accuracy, and parameters and structures of statistical regularities of the entire set of available data on soil pollution in Bryansk oblast settlements (selected because the largest volume of information is available for the oblast). At the local statistics level the distribution of radioactivity of soil samples is lognormal. At the intermediate statistics level the distribution is also lognormal, but with a larger standard deviation. Figures 8, references 3: 2 Russian, 1 Western.
