The financial scope for new expenses and "social charitable acts" are not currently available, the minister said at a Christian Democratic Union event on the European election in Bielefeld. Bonn's priority objective must be a solid financial and tax policy. One must not deviate from the course of annual savings of 70 billion German marks, he said. For this year, Waigel predicted an economic growth of 1.5 percent in the old laender and 7 to 10 percent in eastern Germany. The inflation rate will probably have a two before the decimal at the end of 1994. "Things are improving again; we have the problems under control," the minister said.
