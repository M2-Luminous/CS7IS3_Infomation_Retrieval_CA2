Both the White House and Downing Street were clearly embarrassed by the publicity spree enjoyed by the Sinn Fein leader, who flew home last night, and in London diplomats and ministers could scarcely conceal their fury over Mr Clinton's decision. But with John Major due to meet the President in Washington at the end of the month, officials on both sides of the Atlantic tried to play down suggestions of a rift. Downing Street insisted that relations were in good shape, although the American ambassador to London admitted that the issue had caused difficulties. In Washington, White House officials felt disappointed and let down by Mr Adams, who failed to deliver the concession that had been expected as vindication of the President's controversial decision. Mr Adams's congressional backers had led key presidential advisers to believe that he would use his address to a New York conference on Ulster to advance the peace process, possibly by announcing a three-month ceasefire. In the event, he merely repeated his calls for clarification of the Downing Street declaration. By the time he left, however, Mr Adams was coming under strong pressure from embarrassed White House officials and his own supporters, and in a final press conference he promised prominent Americans who had backed his visit that they would not be let down. He would apply himself to making concrete decisions when he got home. But Downing Street had already made clear that it was no longer willing to wait for Mr Adams and that efforts to reach a political settlement in Northern Ireland -- if necessary without Sinn Fein -- were about to be intensified. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, is expected to bring forward fresh proposals, possibly including an Ulster assembly, in the next two weeks. In an interview with the FINANCIAL TIMES today, Sir Patrick indicates that his framework would involve simultaneous talks on internal political arrangements for Ulster and on relations between Belfast and Dublin. But he insists that talks on crossborder co-operation would not lead to joint authority. Senior ministers admitted yesterday that Britain had been caught on the hop by the Adams visit: the Government believed until late on Sunday [30 January] that Mr Adams would be allowed into America only if he renounced violence. But officials said it would have been difficult for anyone to counter the Adams bandwagon once it had got under way -- during his 48 hours, Mr Adams notched up eight television appearances, five press conferences, newspaper interviews, and meetings with congressmen and as well as speeches to enthusiastic audiences. He was said to have "put a human face on the IRA" and was compared with Clint Eastwood, Nelson Mandela and George Washington. To cap it all, he challenged Douglas Hurd to a television debate, a gauntlet ignored by the Foreign Secretary. Whitehall officials said he would not be seen answering the Adams agenda. "Mr Hurd should not be put on the same level as Adams," they said. Mr Hurd was also anxious to avoid a public row over Mr Clinton's decision to grant Mr Adams a visa, although he made Britain's displeasure plain in meetings with Vice President Al Gore, Warren Christopher, the Secretary of State, and Anthony Lake the National Security Adviser. Officials said they had been left in no doubt of "the offence not just to the British Government, but to the British people and the people of Northern Ireland." At the same time Raymond Seitz, the American ambassador, was called to Downing Street to be told of Mr Major's alarm, while Britain's ambassador, Sir Robin Renwick, conveyed the same message to Washington. Mr Seitz is understood to have been against the visit -- as were the FBI and the Justice and State departments -- and the ambassador admitted yesterday that there had been a tussle inside the American Administration. He said Mr Clinton "took a chance." By late on Tuesday, the President appeared to admit his mistake when he said his idea of appointing a special envoy had been overtaken by events and praised the initiative undertaken by Mr Major and Albert Reynolds. Mr Major meanwhile signalled his determination to press ahead with that initiative as Downing Street officials warned that the peace process "cannot and will not wait for Sinn Fein." The provisionals had been challenged to give up violence and had not done so. They had been challenged to enter the democratic arena and had not had the courage to do so. "While Adams was telling the Americans he favored peace, his movement was firing mortars in Northern Ireland. His smokescreen of evasions and falsehoods has not deceived people."
