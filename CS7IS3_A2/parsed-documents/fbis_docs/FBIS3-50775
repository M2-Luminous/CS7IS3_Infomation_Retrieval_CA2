The event occurred on Wednesday morning when the peasant leaders were taken away in a military Jeep in Chiapas State, where a guerrilla uprising against the government has been under way for six days. Jorge Luna, Central's spokesman, deplored the fact that the minister failed to establish guarantees for the dialogue he summoned, adding that the "government has lost control over the Army," which is "deciding what should be done in the area involved in the conflict." Luna issued an appeal to prevent a massacre of peasants and Indians and held the government responsible for the "tragedy that afflicts our state and our comrades' safety. Moreover, 11 organizations that make up the Permanent Agrarian Congress condemned the arrests and sent a document to Mexican President Carlos Salinas demanding a political rather than a military solution to the conflict and urging the rebels to put down their weapons. According to the Congress, the ownership of land in Chiapas represents an essential factor for peace and social justice.
