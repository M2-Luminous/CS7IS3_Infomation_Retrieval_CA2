Shahidi: "The Juggling of the Methuselah of Imperialism"] [Excerpts] In the wake of the diplomatic battles that began between Iran and Britain with the summons of our charge d'affaires to the British Foreign Office on Thursday [28 April], the British mass media initiated a heavy political onslaught against the Islamic Republic of Iran. [passage omitted] One cannot know with certainty what diplomatic or propaganda objectives are being pursued by the British, but certain issues that could be considered close to the truth can be mentioned regarding the current British-Iranian relations. The following points may help in shedding light on the latest act of politico-propagandistic blackmail by Britain: 1. Washington encountered defeat in disrupting financial dealings between Iran and Japan as well as the European countries, which resulted in its losing face on the international level. Therefore, Britain in its capacity as the European political pillar of the United States resorted to this new politico-propagandistic blackmail to unite the Western front against Iran. [passage omitted] 2. The contempt that Whitehall is sustaining in view of the categorical stance of the Iranian leadership and government and the British Government's pressure, which it tried to exert by various means, has not been able to have the slightest effect on Iran's stance on the Rushdie issue. [passage omitted] 3. The fact that the latest British propaganda coincided with the session of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] contact group, especially on the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina, cannot be considered incidental. It is no secret that the Islamic Republic of Iran is the foremost proclaimer of the oppression of the Bosnian Muslims, while the British Government is considered among those directly to blame among the so-called civilized Western countries for this situation. So far all the efforts to lift the embargo against the Bosnian Muslims have been foiled by the government of Great Britain! [passage omitted] 4. Despite our categorical denial of these accusations, and while we consider ourselves innocent of any connection with the internal crisis in Britain that stems from its domineering policies, we cannot refrain from being amazed at the double-standard approach of the West in general and Britain in particular toward the same matter. How is it that the British Government actively supports Iranian terrorist organizations whose hands are stained with the blood of thousands of innocent Iranian people and officials and there are overt contacts between the leaders of these terrorist organizations and the British officials? London endorses these meetings and contacts without any qualms and considers them symbols of democracy, but raises a hue and cry over the "possibility" of Iran's links with the IRA. [passage omitted] In our opinion, the latest British ploy stems from the weakness and impotence of the Methuselah of 19th-century colonialism in resolving its domestic crises and its sheer helplessness in the face of the decisive stances of Iran, and it is doomed to failure from the outset. Thus, the Islamic Republic of Iran should adopt a more aggressive politico-propagandistic policy and should rub the nose of the British into the dust and show that country that pursuing the policies of the arch-Satan will not benefit it. Therefore, it is necessary that this old Methuselah of colonialism should relinquish its melancholia [malikhowlia] and learn that the protection of the boundaries of countries and reciprocal respect in political relations is the primary principle of wholesome diplomatic relations and the adoption of a policy without dignity that resorts to political machinations and false accusations cannot pressure a capable government to change its stance.
