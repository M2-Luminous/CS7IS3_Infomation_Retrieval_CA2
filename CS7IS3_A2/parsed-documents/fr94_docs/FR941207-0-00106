ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: The USEPA is approving the State of Wisconsin's revision to its State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the Rhinelander, Wisconsin sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) nonattainment area.

The rationale for this approval is set forth in this final rule; additional information is available at the address indicated below. Elsewhere in this Federal Register , USEPA is proposing approval of, and soliciting public comment on, this requested SIP revision. If a comment, or a notice of intent to comment is received on this direct final rule by January 6, 1995, USEPA will then use this rulemaking as a proposed rule. Comments received will be addressed in a separate final rulemaking. Unless this final rule is commented upon, no further rulemaking will occur on this requested SIP revision. DATES: This final rule will be effective February 6, 1995, unless notice is received by January 6, 1995 that someone wishes to submit adverse comments. If the effective date is delayed due to adverse comments, notice withdrawing this final action will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: Carlton T. Nash, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;18J), USEPA Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604&hyph;3590.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background In 1981 and 1983, exceedances of the primary SO 2 NAAQS were monitored in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. On April 1, 1985 the State adopted Wisconsin State Rule NR 154.12(9), which regulated certain sources of SO 2 constructed before April 1, 1985 located within the corporate boundaries of Rhinelander, Wisconsin. The Rhinelander Paper Company (source), a paper mill, was the only source affected by the State Rule's limits. These limits proved ineffective to protect the NAAQS after three more exceedances which were attributable to the source were monitored in 1985. On April 28, 1989 the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) submitted a revision to Wisconsin's SO 2 SIP to USEPA, consisting of Wisconsin State Rule NR 418.07, to satisfy the requirements of section 110 and part D of the Act for the Rhinelander nonattainment area. The SO 2 limits included in the State Rule are summarized in USEPA's January 5, 1993 (58 FR 326) notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR). This rule was disapproved in final on May 13, 1993 (58 FR 28362), because the State had not shown that the rule provided for attainment and maintenance of the SO 2 NAAQS. After the 1993 final action of disapproval, USEPA notified the State of the commencement of sanctions clocks due to the disapproval. Further discussion is found within the August 30, 1994 Technical Support Document (TSD) from Sheila Breen to Gary Gulezian, the November 10, 1994 addendum to the TSD from Christos Panos to Gary Gulezian, and the Federal Register documents, dated January 5, 1993 and May 13, 1993, and will not be discussed here. The latest SIP revision request dated October 21, 1994 includes Consent Order AM&hyph;94&hyph;38, effective August 22, 1994 and two letters (August 29, 1994 letter from WDNR to the source and an October 19, 1994 letter from the source to WDNR), which clarify certain items found in the Order such as storage of test samples and definitions. This 1994 SIP revision request was submitted to fulfill the requirements of section 110 and part D, and to cure the deficiency that led to the notification regarding sanctions. II. Description and Analysis of State Submittal The USEPA has reviewed the August 22, 1994 Consent Order AM&hyph;94&hyph;38, the Monitoring Data, and letters that were submitted in conjunction with the Rhinelander SO 2 SIP revision request, and is approving the SIP revision. Except for the emission limits for the stoker boilers, the limits for each SO 2 source in the proposed SIP revision are summarized in Wisconsin State Rule NR 418.07 and were detailed in USEPA's January 5, 1993 NPR. Background information for USEPA's 1993 NPR is contained in the January 5, 1993 Federal Register and will not be repeated here.
