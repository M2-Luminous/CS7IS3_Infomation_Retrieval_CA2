Fritz Verzetnitsch, president of the European Trade Unions Confederation (ETUC), was optimistic following talks between an ETUC delegation and Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn today that a guideline to this effect will be adopted during Germany's EU presidency, which starts on 1 July. European works councils are the necessary answer to the increasing internationalization of decisions made by big companies. At the same time, Verzetnitsch made clear that European trade unions expect the EU to step up initiatives to combat unemployment and to expeditiously adopt a European social charter. Europe's social unity is limping behind schedule, he claimed. Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said that the chancellor and the ETUC delegation agreed that combating unemployment is the central task of the EU and its member states. European integration must be given a fresh impetus. Chancellor Helmut Kohl confirmed that guidelines on the establishment of European works councils, on part-time work, and on short-term employment contracts are a high priority for the German Government. Great importance is attached to the social dialogue with trade unions and employers' associations in the European unification process. A Europe geared to people's needs requires unions and management who help shape social realities in the member countries and in the Community, the chancellor stressed.
