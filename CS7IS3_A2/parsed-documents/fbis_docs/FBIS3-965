Though it did not approve a new sanctions package against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], the UN Security Council meeting, which wound up after midnight, could yet approve such sanctions at a meeting to be held two weeks from now, should UNITA insist on war. In the resolution it approved, the UN Security Council urged an end to hostilities and condemned all behavior that hinders humanitarian work in Angola. [passage omitted] Afonso van Dunem Mbinda, Angolan ambassador to the United Nations, has expressed satisfaction about the fact that the UN Security Council has told UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali to present a report on the evolution of the Lusaka peace talks over the next two weeks, after which UNITA could be severely punished, should it continue to resort to warmongering behavior. [Begin Mbinda recording] We are very happy to know that the resolution adopted by the UN Security Council gives a two-week deadline for the UN secretary general to present a report on the evolution of the Lusaka peace talks. We are also very happy to learn that, should UNITA continue to hamper the implementation of the peace process, the UN Security Council will again analyze the problem and impose whatever sanctions it deems necessary. [end recording] Speaking to the press only minutes after the UN Security Council meeting, Ambassador Afonso van Dunem Mbinda said the Lusaka peace talks are deadlocked all because UNITA is unwilling to budge. [Begin Mbinda recording] We can say that the Lusaka peace talks have come to a halt. The Angolan Government has just advanced a proposal, it has just made an offer, in which it proposes that UNITA be given several ministerial posts in the central government, the provinces, and other areas where UNITA can participate in terms of the peace process. The government did so as a gesture to encourage national reconciliation. UNITA has not accepted that gesture by the government. UNITA demands, needs, or requires more ministerial portfolios. It has demanded far more than what it deserves. Our government has already noted that it will not make any more such concessions. So, this was an offer the government made UNITA and now the government is unwilling to negotiate that offer. If we negotiate an offer, we will be [words indistinct] of the electoral process which makes it clear that it is up to one of the so-called sides, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, MPLA, to form the government and govern. [end recording] The Angolan ambassador to the United Nations also voiced the opinion that the international community must exert pressure on UNITA to end the war and make greater efforts to reduce the Angolan people's suffering.
