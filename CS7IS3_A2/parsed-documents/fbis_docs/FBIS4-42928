Membership in the European Union will be considerably more costly for Finland than those responsible for the negotiations have so far publicly stated it will be. An error produced by counting subsidies for disadvantaged areas twice was discovered later. Therefore, Finland will be making net payments to the EU right from the start. However, the net cost to Finland is also estimated at too low a figure in a report, "The Impact of the EU, a Summary," published on 29 March 1994. Neither the funds to be paid to the EU Development and Cohesion Fund nor the 6.1 billion markkas for funding to be granted to the European Investment Bank (EIB) and loan commitments are included in the summary figures. They too must be counted as expenses since none of the funding representing solutions to problems is for Finland; quite the contrary, the EU will try to use these funds to finance its East European ventures. The permanent EU farm subsidies (CAP [Common Agricultural Policy] subsidies) will presumably still remain the same, even though they are tied to production, which is decreasing. When we make these adjustments and use estimates of economic growth and inflation rates that correspond to the basic tenor of the Finance Ministry's latest "Economic Policy Line" report, we get a Finnish payment to the EU for the years 1995-2000 averaging 9.5 billion markkas a year and funding for Finland from the EU amounting to about 6 billion markkas a year. Over these years Finland will pay the EU a total of 57 billion markkas and receive 36 billion markkas from it; that is, it will be paying it over 20 billion markkas more than it receives from it. Conservatively estimated, a fifth of our domestic demand for food products will be covered by additional imports worth about 20 billion markkas between 1995 and 2000. Our net payments to the EU and the additional imports will burden our trade balance with a total of 40 billion markkas. If EU participation in the marketing of Finland's agricultural surplus at first compensates for this to the tune of a billion a year and EEA [European Economic Area] expenditures are reduced, we will still be in the hole to the extent of over 30 billion markkas. In addition to that there will be the expenditures for interest. From the standpoint of the Finnish public sector deficit, the situation looks even much worse. We will be contributing 9.5 billion markkas a year to the EU budget, 300 million markkas of which we will be spared because of the elimination of EEA expenses. In addition to this, 6.3 billion markkas a year will be expended for national limiting conditions stemming directly from the EU agreement and for northern subsidies. We will lose nearly 13 billion markkas a year in excise taxes and taxes and duties on farm products. During the first year we will also suffer 2.5 billion markkas in grain storage losses. If the domestic demand for farm products declines by a fifth and structural changes result in about 1 percentage point more unemployment elsewhere, that will cost us 4 billion markkas a year in expenditures for unemployment and in loss of tax revenue. This will result in a gross sum of 32 billion markkas to be covered. Current farm subsidies will be reduced by the gross sum of 7 billion markkas a year. After deducting this, there will still be 25 billion markkas a year to be covered. If reductions in excise taxes are covered with new taxes, we will be able to save an average 11 billion markkas a year. By cutting current funds for employment as well as regional and construction subsidies by an amount equivalent to what comes in from EU funding or national subsidies stemming directly from the EU agreement, we will be able to save 4 billion markkas. Funds from these sources amount to 23 billion markkas a year. But over 10 billion markkas a year on average will still not be compensated for. The public sector will be left with a total deficit of 55 billion markkas to cover between 1995 and 2000 as a result of EU membership.
