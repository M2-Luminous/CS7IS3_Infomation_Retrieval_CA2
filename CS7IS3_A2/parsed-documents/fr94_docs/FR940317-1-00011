FR940317-1-00011 FR940317-1-00004 This proposal would also require that operators submit a report to the FAA of any discrepancy found during any inspection. Additionally, this proposal would expand the applicability of the rule to include additional airplanes that have been identified as being subject to the addressed unsafe condition. There are approximately 94 Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 42 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 16 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would be provided at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $36,960, or $880 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1.

Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39&hyph;8403 (57 FR 47991, October 21, 1992), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), to read as follows: McDonnell Douglas: Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;216&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 92&hyph;23&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;8403. Applicability: Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes; as listed in McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Alert Service Bulletin A54&hyph;31, dated September 17, 1992, and McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Alert Service Bulletin A54&hyph;31, Revision 1, dated June 3, 1993; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent structural damage to the engine mount structure, which could lead to loss of airplane components, accomplish the following:
