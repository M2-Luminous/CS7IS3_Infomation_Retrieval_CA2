He added that progress has been achieved and if we continue in the same manner, we can deal with the substance of the issue and make progress. Before making his statement, Clark met briefly with UN envoys Gustave Feissel and John Paul Kavanagh. In his statement, Clark reiterated that the international community is satisfied that both sides have shown goodwill, adding that interest has been expressed on the higher levels of the international community. Answering a question, Clark said he can give assurances that implementation of the confidence-building measures [CBM's] will not constitute a Cyprus solution. He added that the CBM's are the principle that will lead to an appropriate climate to discuss the substance of the Cyprus issue. Answering another question, Clark said he disagrees with the view that the CBM's are destructive, adding that his mission is to promote a procedure that is supported by the United Nations. Clark said it is important to achieve progress by the end of February, when the UN secretary general will submit his report, so that the UN Security Council can evaluate the whole issue.
