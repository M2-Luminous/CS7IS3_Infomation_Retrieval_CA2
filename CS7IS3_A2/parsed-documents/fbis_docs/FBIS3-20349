Fini is maintaining his usual calm, even if he has said that Bossi is not fit to be prime minister. He has pointed out that although the National Alliance has accepted decentralization, it will continue to defend Italian unity. He is awaiting the outcome of the patient tactics of Silvio Berlusconi, the spinner of webs. [Begin Fini recording] I believe that at this stage it is up to Berlusconi, who has obtained the most votes, to set up a series of meetings. We met this afternoon and discussed the tremendous election results. We discussed the fact that Italians have chosen who they want to govern them. I believe that in the next few days Berlusconi will also meet Bossi, after which we will meet again. There will certainly be two of us present -- I do not know if there will be three people at the meeting. As far as we are concerned, the problems connected with the Northern League remain the same: We want an absolute guarantee that Italy remains united and a policy of solidarity between north and south. [end recording] [Announcer] Fini warned, however, that without Bossi they would not have sufficient numbers to form a government.
