It calls you, your unity and cohesion, your national identity, your national affiliation, your awareness and understanding and it urges you to rise up as one man to achieve the great goal of expelling the hateful Zionist occupation and its dark age from our country so our people can enjoy freedom and independence. Let us all chant our historic slogan: "All rifles should be directed against the enemy, and all efforts and energies should be mobilized to fight the enemy, which is seeking to destroy our life and future." Let each one act from his position to confront the army's occupation and the hordes of its settlers. Let a new wave of our brave intifadah move in one national voice and one combat spirit. This time is no longer one for differing slogans and speeches. Rather, it is one for a unified national action, which allows only for different actions. Yes, this is a time for a unified national action and this is a time for a national unity to protect the lives of our people and bring double retaliation to the murderers, the hordes of the Zionist settlers, and the occupation army and authorities that protect these murderers. Let us work in the arenas of struggle, conflict, and confrontation as one unified rank and let us all chant in one voice: Either freedom and independence or fighting. Long live Palestine free, Arab, and Palestinian.
