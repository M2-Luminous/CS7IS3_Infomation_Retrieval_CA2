However, this party is no longer that party. This party cannot be called "the party." This is only a party that can make it into Parliament if it is successful in the elections. It seems that it has all the chances to make it into Parliament. We spoke about this with Workers Party Chairman Gyula Thurmer. [Moricz] Only 0.32 percent separated your party from parliamentary membership in the 1990 elections. If you had presented a Pest county list at the time, you would have made it into Parliament. Now, you have presented 156 individual candidates and you also have all the district lists. What percentage are you counting on at the elections? [Thurmer] Even on the basis of mathematical logic, one can presume that the Workers Party will make it into Parliament. With a realistic optimism, I am hoping for 7-8 percent of the votes. [Moricz] You mentioned 5 percent in February. Does that mean there has been an increase in support for the Workers Party? [Thurmer] There is definitely an increase in support for our party. We hope to be successful in the first round. I think we can justifiably hope for 5-8 percent of the votes; of course, miracles can also happen. A Formal Freedom of the Press [Moricz] According to a survey carried out by the Szonda Ipsos in January this year, 8 percent of the people surveyed thought that Gyula Thurmer was the chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP].... [Thurmer] I suspect the pollers are not so much interested in the people's opinions; they are much more interested in influencing them. Fortunately, the pollers themselves refrain from suggesting that the Workers Party will not make it into Parliament. Thanks to the brainwashing carried out by the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], freedom of the press in Hungary is only formally present. We are only beginning to receive the amount of radio and television time we deserve now on the eve of the elections. [Moricz] So you do not accept the fact that many of your voters do not even know whom to vote for. [Thurmer] That is possible, but these people mostly vote for the left; at most, they hesitate between the MSZP and the Workers Party. [Moricz] In your opinion, what is the difference between these two parties? [Thurmer] The MSZP accepts capitalism, while the Workers Party does not. I also welcome the success of the MSZP. [Moricz] On your visit to Salgotarjan in connection with the news of the arrest of two former policemen, you again called for a halt on political trials and for immunity to the future deputies. Does that mean that there are former members of the III/III department and former policemen among you? [Thurmer] This is not the point. There is no sense in political trials because their goal is to threaten people and show power. Instead of the district commissioner, a 15-20 member action group took an unfortunate pensioner in Nograd to the police, although he would have gone to the police alone. [Moricz] In other words, you agree with the moral administration of justice and you only disagree with its implementation. [Thurmer] No, I do not agree with this. The law on the administration of justice itself is bad. The issue of the 1956 uprising should be left alone because no justice can be done here. There were two sides on the barricades, and the one who stood on one side of the barricade will never see events the way the one who stood on the other side sees them. As for the members of the III/III department and the former police, they are not among us but among the deputies of parliamentary parties. [Moricz] You often said that the Kadar regime was more honest and better than the current one. What is your opinion on Kadar's declaration in the course of the retaliations following the 1956 revolution, according to which the counterrevolutionaries should be hanged en masse. [Thurmer] I do not know whether Janos Kadar said this. [Moricz] There are written documents attesting to this, Hungarian Television presented these documents, and one can read them in the report of the Kahler committee. [Thurmer] The Kahler committee is not a source for me. [Moricz] A protocol was prepared on this declaration. [Thurmer] This has no importance today. Obviously, many people said many things about 1956 at the time. We should not deal with this. I do not understand the timeliness of this issue. After 38 years, why is it interesting for MAGYAR NEMZET to ask the chairman of a party about what the chairman of a former party said? [Moricz] Because the chairman of this party said the Kadar regime was more honest and better than the current regime. [Thurmer] I continue to claim that the Kadar regime was more honest and better. This does not depend on a quotation but on the way people lived then. [Moricz] A considerable number of people fled the country and many people were imprisoned. [Thurmer] That is not true. The Kadar regime gave most people more and better chances than the current regime. [Moricz] In other words, the Workers Party is conducting a policy that does not take into consideration how certain parts of society are living. [Thurmer] This is more characteristic of the current regime. We do not want to repeat Kadar's policy, but the results achieved in the past decades must be preserved. Yes to Socialism [Moricz] One of the pet subjects of the Workers Party is that it does not want the Boross-type Christian national capitalism, or the Horn-Nagy-Bekesi-type of rose capitalism, or Kuncze's liberal capitalists either. At the same time, your party says that Sandor Nagy is only a rival and not an enemy, and the party has signed an agreement with Nagy's National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ]. [Thurmer] We signed an agreement with the workers' platform of the MSZOSZ, and not with Sandor Nagy. The fact that such a platform could emerge shows that there are many left-wing people in the trade unions who are seeking the policy of the Workers Party. We do not want any type of capitalism. [Moricz] Is socialism your distant goal? [Thurmer] Of course. [Moricz] However, you said you were not in favor of restoration. [Thurmer] When socialism is created in Hungary, this will be a historical progress, rather than restoration. [Moricz] You nevertheless supported the forces representing the restoration of the old regime during the coup attempt in Russia. [Thurmer] I do not know whether these forces supported restoration. On thing is certain: Even the U.S. President would pray for the united Soviet Union that we too support, but it is too late. [Moricz] You said earlier that joining the Partnership for Peace program would have Hungary drifting into the Yugoslav conflict. Do you continue to believe this now that Hungary has joined the program and after meeting President Milosevic? [Thurmer] Hungary does not have to drift into the Yugoslav conflict: We are already in it. We take part in the economic sanctions directed against Yugoslavia. The Hungarian Government also rejected the latest idea of the Romanian, Greek, and Bulgarian governments to lift the sanctions. Except for its steps coordinated with the West, the Hungarian Government has not taken any individual foreign policy initiatives. This is the policy of the last ally, and this has never led to anything positive in Hungarian history. Hypocritical Law [Moricz] To the disapproval of the West, Peter Boross demanded that AWACS aircraft refrain from directing military attacks from Hungarian airspace. [Thurmer] Peter Boross' declaration had no importance whatsoever, because it is not the Hungarian Government that decides on the deployment of these aircraft. Besides, the positive things achieved in Hungarian-Yugoslav relations are being spoiled on the other side: [Foreign Minister Geza] Jeszenszky goes to Belgrade, but one month later he celebrates the anniversary of 15 March in Vojvodina, and he also takes short trips to Bosnia and Croatia. [Moricz] Does that mean that one should not go to Vojvodina after Belgrade? [Thurmer] After Belgrade yes, but not on a separate occasion, and not on 15 March, and particularly not on this 15 March. The ethnic Hungarians living beyond our borders should not be involved in the election campaign. The question is much more complex. The Hungarians are able to celebrate the anniversary of 15 March perfectly without Mr. Jeszenszky. [Moricz] You also criticize this government's national minority policy within our borders. You recently apologized to the national minorities in Hungary for this government's mistakes. You claim that this government's national minority policy is bad because it encourages the national minorities to create efficient organizations. In reality, it wants to hinder their unity with this. Do you seriously believe this? [Thurmer] Everything that is good in the situation of national minorities in Hungary has already been good so far, and the new things are bad. The general situation is worse in areas and counties with national minorities. The national minorities have more rights in the sense that they can set up self-government bodies, but no one knows what will happen to these bodies and whether there is the money for them. The law is hypocritical from the outset, because the law that was eventually adopted is not the one sent to the European Parliament. [Moricz] In your opinion, the national minorities also think that the Kadar regime was better for them. Did your talks with these people convince you of this? [Thurmer] Of course. [Moricz] Whom do you regard as a personal example among the major leaders of the workers' movement? [Thurmer] I do not have models. [Moricz] ??? [punctuation as published] [Thurmer] I follow my own road and we follow our own road. That is the most reliable one.
