Speaking from it, and attacking ANC Housing Minister Mr Joe Slovo, was the National Party's Mr Piet Coetzer -- called "a National Party hit man" by a subsequent speaker. Mr Coetzer started off by commenting on what he called a "honeymoon debate" filed with non-confrontational maiden speeches. An air of unreality prevailed while the tough debate lay ahead, he predicted. He then turned on Mr Slovo as having broken with tradition in his maiden speech and said: "If you don't behave like a maiden, don't expect to be treated as one." Mr Slovo, he said, had attacked Deputy President F W de Klerk (his party leader) for distorting the past about the delivery and payment of services. "There is a gap between his (Mr Slovo's) interpretation and the truth of the past," Mr Coetzer said. Mr Coetzer then quoted statistics of serviced sites delivered by the Transvaal Provincial Administration. It far exceeded the 25,000 units a year Mr Slovo had referred to, he said. Furthermore, if Mr Slovo wanted to apportion blame, he himself would have to admit to the ANC's share or his dreams for housing would blow up in his face. "While local authorities were trying, the ANC was promoting a policy of making the country ungovernable. It must now accept responsibility for boycotts and non-payment of services," he said. Despite an agreement between Mr de Klerk and President Nelson Mandela in January this year that the rent boycott would stop, income from services had continued to drop to a national average of 20 percent. In Soweto it was far below 10 percent. The monthly income there was R[Rand]900,000 whereas the annual water bill alone was R4 million. In central Witwatersrand alone R400 million of regional services council funds had been spent on running costs instead of the infrastructural expenditure it was intended for. "If this culture is not reversed, you will not succeed in realising this (housing) dream," Mr Coetzer said. He wanted to plead with the state president not to try and convert the country into a welfare state, but rather to create conditions under which people could improve their own circumstances. As Mr Coetzer finished many boo's and hisses came from ANC members. Next speaker was ANC member Mr Jannie Momberg -- like Mr Coetzer a carry-over from the previous Parliament. He said he wanted to inform his new colleagues that in the past, when the National Party was in trouble, "they used to send in Piet Coetzer as their hit man". "At this stage, I did not think the NP was in trouble," he remarked, to mirth. He reminded the assembly that today, May 26, was the anniversary of the National Party takeover of power in 1948. "On that day a few hundred thousand people gained their freedom from English dominance at the cost of 40 million (sic)." Now 40 million people had gained their freedom at the cost of no-one.
