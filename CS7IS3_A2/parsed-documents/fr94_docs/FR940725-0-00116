FR940725-0-00116 FR940725-0-00015 The fishing period limit is shown in terms of dressed, head-off weight as well as dressed, head-on weight. Fishermen should be aware that regulations require that all halibut from Area 2A be landed with heads on. The fishing period limit applies to the vessel, not the individual fisherman, and any landings over the vessel limit will be subject to forfeiture and may result in a fine. Area 4C to Reopen on August 2 The IPHC has determined that nearly 676,000 lb (306.6 mt) were harvested from Area 4C during 14 1-day fishing periods between June 3 and June 30. As the total catch is 24,000 lb (10.9 mt) less than the catch limit of 700,000 lb (317.5 mt), the IPHC will reopen Area 4C for a single 24-hour fishing period commencing at 12:00 noon Alaska Daylight Time on August 2 and ending at 12:00 noon Alaska Daylight Time on August 3. A 1,500 lb (0.7 mt) catch limit will apply to all vessels during this fishing period instead of the 10,000 lb (4.5 mt) limit specified in the 1994 Pacific Halibut Fisheries Regulations. September Fishing Periods and Limits in Areas 2C, 3A, and 3B The IPHC has determined that fishing period limits will not be required in Area 2C during the September opening, but will be required in Areas 3A and 3B to avoid exceeding the catch limit. The IPHC has set the fishing period in all three areas at 48 hours. The fishing periods will open on September 12 at 12:00 noon Alaska Daylight Time, and close on September 14 at 12:00 noon Alaska Daylight Time. Fishing period limits for Areas 3A and 3B are as follows: ‚ê£ 1Vessel class 2Length 2Letter 1Fishing period limits (pounds, dressed, heads off) 2Area 3A 2Area 3B 0&hyph;25 A 600 600 26&hyph;30 B 900 900 31&hyph;35 C 2,700 2,700 36&hyph;40 D 3,500 3,500 41&hyph;45 E 5,600 5,600 46&hyph;50 F 7,900 7,900 51&hyph;55 G 11,600 11,600 56+ H 20,000 20,000 The above fishing period limits reflect the historical average catch, adjusted by anticipated fleet size and catch rate to avoid exceeding the catch limit. The appropriate length and letter for each vessel class is printed on each halibut license. Decals showing the letter have been supplied with the license and should be displayed on the vessel. In the event that the catch limit in one or more of the three areas is not attained, and sufficient poundage remains to permit further fishing, the next scheduled fishing period is October 10. NMFS should be contacted regarding sablefish retention during the halibut opening. Dated: July 18, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
