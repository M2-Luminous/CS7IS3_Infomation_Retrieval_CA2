A bus in Hadera was bombed earlier today with six Israelis killed and 28 wounded, including 18 Israeli soldiers. "This action, like those before it, is a further attempt by extremists to derail the peace process," Clinton said, adding that "they must not be allowed to succeed." "We believe the best response to the enemies of peace is to demonstrate that negotiations can change realities on the ground and give hope to Israelis and Palestinians for a peaceful future," Clinton said. White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said that Clinton telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to express condolences over today's bus explosion. Clinton stressed the urgency of bringing an end to the on-going talks on implementing the PLO-Israeli peace accord signed in Washington on September 13 1993. During the telephone talk, Rabin agreed with Clinton on the need to reach prompt agreement on the implementation, Myers said.
