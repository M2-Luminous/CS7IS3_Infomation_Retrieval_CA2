According to the report, there has been an individualized follow-up investigation of the legal situation of 131 persons reportedly arrested, including three minors. Of those persons, 60 have formal arrest warrants against them, and 58, including one minor, are free. It is also known that 18 persons who are Guatemalan, Salvadoran, and Honduran nationals are at the disposal of the immigration authorities in Tapachulas for violating the General Population Law [Ley General de Poblacion]. The CNDH reports that out of 400 missing person reports, 278 people have been located. Regarding the criticisms from nongovernmental organizations -- particularly from Amnesty International -- the CNDH said it believes the time will come for them to settle those differences. For the time being, the CNDH said, it is focusing all its attention on complaints and its work in support of the civilian population. On another topic, Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de Las Casas, said all the Mexican people, regardless of their religious preferences, must get involved in the search for a profound solution to the problems brought up during the conflict. Ignacio Diaz De Leon, executive secretary of the Inter-Religious Council meeting in San Cristobal de Las Casas, said the role of the Council is to raise society's consciousness regarding the dignity of the indigenous groups.
