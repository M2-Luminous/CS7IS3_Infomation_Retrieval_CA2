The focus of everyone's attention, however, will be the steps Prime Minister Narasimha Rao will take regarding the situation in Kashmir. The developments related to New Delhi and Srinagar will take place under his personal supervision. Skeptical people will ask, "How do you know?" After all, there was never so much unawareness as there is now in the capital of what the prime minister wants. I can say, referring to a very reliable source, that one month ago, the prime minister had taken all of the Kashmir-related issues into his own hands. The people who had been associated with Kashmir's administration until now are amused by the prime minister's direct interest in it. They argue that General Krishan Rao, Kashmir's governor, talks directly only with the prime minister. He does not even have time to talk with Home Minister Chavan or the Home Minister for State, Rajesh Pilot. The fact is that if either of them had any clout, he would have already been removed from the position of governor. After that, they would have been busy trying to push each other out and, following the Lucknow etiquette, asked one another to go first. By taking the Kashmir affair into his own hands, he has cleared up the rumor that he was removing the governor from his position. The governor is still there. The people in the North Block who had bombarded the governor with accusations have pointed their cannons toward the governor's assistant now that the situation has changed. The balls of accusation are aimed at Sheikh Ghulam Rasul, the chief secretary of Jammu-Kashmir affairs. He is accused of being like a strange courtier who first won the governor's confidence with his cunning and then tried to dethrone him. The argument is that the chief secretary does not allow the governor to do what he wants to do. The list of accusations continues, and there are about 80 government employees who do not even go to work but still draw their salaries every month, thanks to the chief secretary. There are quite a few employees of the Jammu-Kashmir police who are working in cahoots with the terrorists. Until they are controlled, the Central Reserve Police and the Border Security Force cannot work closely with the local police, because the fear is that all their plans are forwarded to the terrorists. After the peaceful resolution of the Hazratbal crisis, there were indications that the Kashmiri people wanted a normal situation in the valley. The administration there, however, was not the kind which respected their wishes and followed up on them. No attention was paid to accounts for four years. Now the chief secretary is being blamed for part of this poor administration, breaking various rules and regulations (which used to be blamed on the governor before), and hindering the government's work. The situation [here described] in Kashmir is not based on my own observations. I have not visited the valley for some time. I have based my conclusion on what I have heard from the politicians and officials who have visited Kashmir. How will the prime minister proceed with this affair? He will talk with the governor and announce that it is very important that Sheikh Ghulam Rasul remain in his present position. The intelligence bureau report will be presented in detail. Until the chief secretary is removed, the terrorism in the valley will not end. At one point, it was a common belief that the British and the Americans believed that Pakistani assistance to Kashmiri terrorists had started to come from across the border. Siddhartha Shankar Ray complained to U. S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in their sole meeting that Pakistan was helping Kashmiri terrorists and encouraging them. He was given the answer, "According to our information, this is not happening now." Our diplomats have begun to strongly believe that Western intelligence can get information only to an extent, and not more than that. Therefore, as the Indian sources indicate, Kashmiri terrorists are still getting help from outside, and we should take this information seriously. The fact is that the permanent secretary of the British Foreign Commonwealth Office, Sir David Gillmore, repeated the same comments given by Prime Minister John Major during his trip to New Delhi last year. He said, "We believe that the best way is to find a solution according to the Shimla Agreement. Steps should be taken to implement a sincere political process by talks, respect human rights in Kashmir, and stopping outside aid to the terrorists which is creating most of the problems." According to one analysis, the mercenary terrorists across the border are facing a new problem. There is such a heavy concentration of Indian soldiers on the border that the mercenary soldiers, if they enter Kashmir, find it difficult to go back. This analysis indicates that those terrorists are acting like daredevils. When the prime minister sits down to review the situation, he will find that the basic facts cannot be clouded by analysis. One fact is that there still exists the feeling of our being the outsiders among the people who live in Kashmir. Because of the lack of information among our security forces, they committed atrocities against the people, which strengthened this feeling. When the prime minister talked with Muslim ministers, senators, and others about Kashmir and invited them to find a solution, this issue was raised again during the talks. The following people participated in this discussion: Jaffar Sharif, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Salman Khursheed, Ahmed Patel, Saifuldin Sauz, and Farooq Abdullah. The prime minister is making Farooq Abdullah the New Delhi spokesman for Kashmir. One thing he will understand very soon is that we kept the DULF [expansion not given] leaders in Sri Lanka so close to us that they lost the respect of the Tamils there. This resulted in the rise of the LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]. We know that Farooq Abdullah is not very popular in the valley. Perhaps by appointing him spokesman for human rights in the Geneva Human Rights Conference, we have totally destroyed his credibility in the valley. *
