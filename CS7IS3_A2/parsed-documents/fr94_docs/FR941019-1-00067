FR941019-1-00067 FR941019-1-00009 The Department is soliciting comment on whether use of a seven percent discount rate (the current value in Circular A&hyph;94) is appropriate or whether trustee officials should be allowed to use a different discount rate. A possible alternative discount rate for future public losses of natural resources is the consumer rate of time preference, which is the rate of interest at which an individual would be indifferent between consuming goods now and postponing consumption to a later date. Interest rates on investments with little or no default risk, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, provide an estimate of the consumer rate of time preference. The Department solicits comment on whether trustee officials should be allowed to use a discount rate based on the U.S. Treasury borrowing rate on marketable securities with maturities comparable to the period over which future losses will occur. Such an approach would be consistent with that proposed by NOAA under OPA. See 59 FR 1184. Information on U.S. Treasury borrowing rates on marketable securities is provided in Appendix C of OMB Circular A&hyph;94. 5. Cost-Effectiveness The Department's regulations define ``cost-effectiveness'' to mean that ``when two or more activities provide the same or a similar level of benefits, the least costly activity providing that level of benefits will be selected.'' 43 CFR ยง11.14(j). Commenters have expressed confusion over the difference between cost effectiveness and maximization of net benefits. Consideration of cost effectiveness involves comparing activities that provide the same or a similar level of benefits. In contrast, consideration of net benefits can be used to compare activities that provide substantially different levels of benefits. Another commenter stated that the definition of ``cost-effectiveness'' should be changed to delete the reference to ``similar'' levels of benefits, in order to ensure full restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. Use of the phrase ``same or similar'' was not intended to force trustee officials into using methods that produce lower benefits. Instead, the term merely reflects the fact that in the damage assessment context trustee officials will often be comparing methods that do not produce exactly the same benefits. The Department solicits comment on whether additional clarification is warranted. D. Legal Topics 1. Judicial Review One significant area of discussion has been judicial review of damage assessments. CERCLA provides that any determination or assessment of damages performed ``in accordance with'' the natural resource damage assessment regulations ``shall have the force and effect of a rebuttable presumption on behalf of the trustee.'' CERCLA sec. 107(f)(2)(C). This provision is incorporated into the Department's regulations without further clarification. See 43 CFR ยง11.91(c). Commenters have asked the Department to define the term ``rebuttable presumption'' and clarify when and to which aspects of the assessment the rebuttable presumption applies. Some commenters have questioned whether the phrase ``in accordance with'' the regulations allows trustee officials to obtain a rebuttable presumption for any portion of an assessment that complies with the regulations or whether it restricts the rebuttable presumption to those assessments that follow all portions of the regulations. The Department's regulations provide both an administrative process for development and review of documentation as well as a range of alternative methodologies for the actual determination of injuries and damages. The Department believes that in order to obtain a rebuttable presumption, a trustee official must follow the entire administrative process set forth in the regulations. If the trustee official has followed the administrative process, the rebuttable presumption attaches to those components of the damage claim that were calculated through the appropriate use of any of the methodologies described in the regulations. However, trustee officials are not required to use all of the listed methodologies in order to obtain a rebuttable presumption. The Department solicits comment on this interpretation and on whether additional clarification of the effect of the rebuttable presumption is warranted. There have been comments about whether judicial review of an assessment should be limited to an administrative record. Under NOAA's proposed OPA rule, judicial review of assessment costs and estimated costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources would be conducted on an administrative record. 59 FR 1185. The Department solicits comment on whether a similar provision should be included in its regulations. The Department also solicits comment on whether judicial review of compensable value should be conducted on an administrative record. 2. Effect of Amendments Commenters have expressed confusion over the applicability of amendments of the natural resource damage assessment regulations to ongoing damage assessments that were started before the amendments became effective. The Department solicits comment on whether it should clarify that trustee officials are entitled to a rebuttable presumption so long as their assessments are in accordance with the regulations as they were in effect at the time that the assessments began. 3.
