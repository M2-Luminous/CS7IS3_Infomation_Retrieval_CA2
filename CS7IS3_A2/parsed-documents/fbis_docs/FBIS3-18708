This is his third visit to Britain in the office of Czech prime minister, although this is the first official one. A few minutes ago we received a video about the talks held between Prime Minister Klaus and British Prime Minister John Major. [Correspondent] Prime Minister Klaus opened his first official visit to Great Britain since the establishment of the independent Czech state with a meeting with British Prime Minister John Major. Before the talks began, Prime Minister Klaus said that the chief purpose of the meeting was to confirm views on certain questions of a bilateral and Europe-wide character. At the same time he said he shares the somewhat less pro-federal view of British politicians on the future set-up in Europe. The talks betweem the prime ministers at 10 Downing Street, where British prime ministers have had their residence since 1735, lasted about one hour. After the talks ended Prime Minister Klaus said, among other things: [Begin Klaus recording] As regards bilateral relations, we considered that there are no significant problems which the prime ministers should tackle. Therefore the subject of our talks was of course Bosnia, Europe, European communities, the gradual integration of our country in European communities, and the Partnership for Peace, which the British Goverment really regards as a mechanism for our entry into NATO. We discussed the issue of the OECD, an organization which I believe offers a more realistic way for our country's rapid entry into European structures than some other organizations. [end recording] [Correspondent] Prime Minister Klaus has also given a lecture at the British Royal Institute for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the transformation of Czech society and its Europe-wide context. He repeated his view that of all the postcommunist countries the Czech Republic has gone the farthest in its reformist endeavors. At the same time he said that in this situation the West should not cease to seek an optimal method for the integration of the postcommunist structures. At this moment the Czech prime minister is meeting with the chairman of the British Conservative Party, Sir Norman Fowler.
