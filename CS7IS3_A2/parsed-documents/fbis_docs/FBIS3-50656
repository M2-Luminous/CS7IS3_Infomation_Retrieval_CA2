I have two questions. Last week an ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] deputy said that there was proof of the transshipment of arms from the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] to Guatemala; the second question is what is your opinion regarding the incidents that are taking place in Mexico? [Cristiani] I believe that as far as specific proof is concerned, the reports from Guatemalan authorities claim that there is a shipment of arms to Guatemala. There is no specific proof, however, of who is shipping the weapons. We want to be very clear about this, because we are not going to accuse anyone until we are entirely certain. We are continuing to coordinate with Guatemalan authorities in this respect. We are conducting an investigation, and as soon as we have any information you will hear about it. One thing is clear, however, certain weapons were not available in Guatemala, and today they are being recovered by the Guatemalan Army; this shows that there is a flow of weapons into Guatemala, and there are only two neighboring countries through which they could be passing--Honduras and El Salvador--although they might be coming from Nicaragua and pass through El Salvador. Why is there is no specific proof yet? Concerning Mexico, we deplore the fact that there are still groups on our continent that are trying to use violence and terror to achieve political aims. We believe that this must pass into history so that novelists can write about it, but it cannot be justified in view of the advances of the processes in Latin America. We cannot justify the existence of armed rebel groups causing violence and terror, particularly against the people, who are the ones who always suffer the most in activities of this type. We believe that if countries such as El Salvador have been able to give an example of solutions to these problems, it is shocking to hear that there are groups that now want to launch such an adventure. Experiences in other places show us that the idea is to do away with, not encourage, activities of this type; consequently, we can only feel disappointed to see that on the American Continent there are still minority groups bent on using violent methods. [Reporter Mario Godoy Landin] Good morning, Mr. President. My first question has to do with the transshipment of arms. How is the verification of the serial numbers of the AK-47 rifles that were found in Guatemala progressing? Have they already been verified? The second question is, regarding the violence and murder of several peasant families in different areas of the country could one consider that the deployment of Armed Forces members has not achieved anything? [Cristiani] Regarding your first question, I do not have the information on hand. We will try to check to see if there is specific information regarding the serial numbers, and we will release the information as soon as something is obtained. Regarding your second question, I do not believe that the fact that criminal actions are perpetrated means that something has or has not failed. In this case I would like to ask if we would not have had a larger number of incidents without the preventive deployment in the area? This is something that is very hard to measure. What is obvious is that there is much violent activity and that many problems, even family problems, are being resolved violently. Maybe this is due to what our country has gone through. A large number of Salvadorans have been exposed to a tradition of violence and believe that problems can only be solved through violence. I do not believe, however, that one can come to the conclusion at which you arrived: that one thing is directly linked to the other. The question should be, had the deployment not been carried out would there have been more or less violent incidents? [passage omitted]
