On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, I hereby extend my cordial regards and high respects to all of you, to all democratic parties and patriots without party affiliation, and to workers, peasants, intellectuals, cadres, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, armed police officers and men, and public security cadres and policemen of all nationalities across the country. I hereby also extend my sincere festival greetings and good wishes to Taiwan compatriots, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, our countrymen living abroad, and our international friends who have shown concern for and given support and assistance to China's modernization drive. The year 1993 was a year in which, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, we continued to win victories by grasping the opportunity to deepen reform and to develop the economy rapidly and in a healthy manner. It was also a year in which we made a major stride toward the goal set by the 14th CPC National Congress of building a socialist market economic system. China has maintained social and political stability, our economy has developed rapidly, people of all nationalities have worked in unison, and new progress has been made in our endeavors in all spheres. Last year, we continued to reap bumper agricultural harvests, our industrial production grew rapidly, the domestic market was brisk, our foreign trade was active, and our people's livelihood continued to improve. We won new diplomatic victories, and China's international influential power grew further. All these encourage us to usher in the new year with full confidence. The year 1994 will be a very crucial year for our reform, opening up, and modernization. All party members and people of all nationalities across the country should more closely unite, work industriously, adhere to and carry out the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and, closely revolving around the central task of economic construction, go all-out to push forward our socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and socialist spiritual civilization. In the new year, the nucleus of our efforts to deepen reform is to meticulously organize and implement a series of major reform measures designed to build a socialist market economic system. Due to the arduousness and comprehensiveness of the task, many new situations, problems, or even difficulties are bound to arise. Therefore, we must make thorough preparations beforehand, decide the best time to initiate each reform measure, carefully observe the progress we make, sum up experience in a timely manner, and ensure that our work is successful. We should continue to bring up new ideas of economic development, strengthen and improve macroregulation and control, and apply ourselves to restructuring the economy, to truly bring about a coexistence between speedy development and an improvement in economic efficiency. In carrying out the new year's economic work, we not only should make new major progress in economic reform, but we also should strive to make new progress in increasing our agricultural development potential, in increasing peasants' income, in transforming state-owned enterprises' operating mechanisms, in increasing these enterprises' vitality, in increasing the quality of enterprises' economic management, in assuring good order in our economic activities in all sectors, and in further broadening the scope of opening up to the outside world, so that we ensure that our economy develops rapidly and in a sustained and healthy manner. In the new year, one of our important tasks in developing socialist democratic politics is safeguarding and developing unity and political stability by relying on and uniting the people, so as to continue providing good social and political conditions for reforms and development. Leading comrades at all levels must bear in mind Comrade Xiaoping's important thinking that "stability is the overwhelming priority"; must correctly understand and handle the dialectical relationship between reform, development, and stability; and must correctly understand and handle the two types of social contradictions differing in nature. Leaders at all levels must crack down on crime according to the law; they should never be tenderhearted in dealing with crime. At the same time, they should earnestly study the new form of contradictions among the people and the trend of development of such contradictions and pay particular attention to new problems and new contradictions which may be created as a result of the need to further readjust the structure and relationship of interests in the course of deepening reform. Under no circumstances should they be negligent in this regard. From a long-range point of view, the development of the economy and the deepening of reform can further rationalize the various patterns and relationships of interests and lead to the objective of common prosperity for all people. However, in the course of reform it will be difficult to avoid certain degrees of gaps in benefits received by the people. Leading comrades at all levels must be good at analyzing and handling all types of contradictions among the people; they must do their ideological- political work and other corresponding work among the people meticulously and solidly to make them feel that the party and the government are reasonable and that they are sincere about safeguarding their interests and about caring about their hardships. Thus, the people will truthfully and sincerely support us and actively help us, or coordinate with us, in handling the various types of contradictions and problems. In this way, political stability and unity will continue to consolidate and develop. In the new year, we must vigorously promote the building of a socialist spiritual civilization and strive for a breakthrough in achieving the progress of spiritual civilization in the entire society. This is urgently necessary if we are to accelerate reforms and development and bring about all-round progress in society. This also constitutes the urgent demand and common aspiration of the people of all nationalities across the country. In everything we do, we must do so according to the demands and aspirations of the people. Only thus can we gain their trust, and only thus can we gain the initiative and be successful in our work. At no time should we forget this historical truth. Our important strategic policy is to build a material civilization and a spiritual civilization simultaneously in the entire process of embarking on the socialist modernization drive. The more vigorously we develop the socialist market economy, the more truly we should strengthen the building of a spiritual civilization; develop education, science, and culture; arm the people with a correct ideology and ethics; and develop a noble, healthy atmosphere characteristic of our nation, a good social order, and a good social mood. This will provide us with a strong motivation and an important guarantee for building a material civilization, and ensure the all-round development of socialism with Chinese characteristics. To ensure long-term political stability in China and to make it a prosperous and strong country, we must arm the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must adhere to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts; strive to strengthen the party ideologically and organizationally; improve its style of work; and consolidate and strengthen the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the people. The call of the times and the expectations of the people demand that we strengthen the building of party organizations at all levels in the new period and that, in particular, we build a contingent of cadres who are capable of carrying on and developing the party's fine traditions, who are capable of going deep into reality to see how things really are, who advance in a pioneering spirit, who dare to assume responsibility, who take the interest of the whole into account, and who carry out their duties honestly. Cadres at all levels must bear in mind that they should establish contacts with the masses, carry out propaganda among the masses, organize the masses, and unite the masses to work for their own benefit -- this is our party's underlying strength and asset, as well as a way for to achieve victories in all areas of our work. We sincerely hope that everyone will give primary consideration in every respect to the interests of the party and the state, will make the masses their base, will discard all kinds of unhealthy practices of bureaucratism and formalism, will make progress in their leading skills and work methods, and will create a new style in wholeheartedly serving the people's interests. The CPPCC has availed itself of the elite of prominent figures of all democratic parties, prominent figures without party affiliation, and prominent figures from all circles of the country. Over the past year, they earnestly carried out their responsibility to conduct political consultations and democratic supervision, in accomplishing a great deal of work and making many contributions. Adhering to the principles of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, treating each other with all sincerity, and sharing weal and woe," the CPC will continue to strengthen its close cooperation with all democratic parties and patriots without party affiliation, to give better play to the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the CPC's leadership. I hope that each of you will continue to offer your opinions and suggestions for the country's reform and development so that we can combine our efforts to serve the country and the people. Realizing the great cause of the motherland's reunification is a sacred mission of all Chinese people, as well as an inevitable trend of the development of the Chinese nation. The Chinese Government and people across the country have the confidence, determination, and ability to promote the motherland's reunification according to the principle of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems." We resolutely oppose any forms of "two Chinas," "one China and one Taiwan," or "one country, two governments"; we resolutely oppose any discussions and actions aimed at promoting "Taiwan independence." We hope that the Taiwan authorities will put national righteousness above everything else and agree to establish direct contacts between the two sides of the strait as soon as possible under the principle of one China, in order to do some practical things to pave the way for the motherland's peaceful reunification. Recently, due to Britain's insistence on its erroneous position, the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's 1994-95 election arrangements have broken down. As a matter of course, this has been denounced by all Chinese people, including our Hong Kong compatriots. Whatever problems may lie ahead, we will join all patriotic compatriots of all circles of Hong Kong in upholding the "one country, two systems" principle and the principle of the Hong Kong Basic Law; we will not change our determination to restore the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and to preserve Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. We believe that with the common efforts of the Chinese and Portuguese Governments, a steady transition of Macao and a smooth handover of its political power will be ensured. In the world's current process of the development of multipolarization, China is an important force for preserving world peace and stability. China's development will not pose a threat to any country. We oppose all kinds of hegemony and power politics. In the new year, we, as always, will practice our independent foreign policy of peace, insist on developing friendly and cooperative relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and continue to work actively to build a peaceful, stable, fair, and reasonable new international order. Comrades and friends, the lofty cause that we have been toiling to achieve is to build China into a strong, democratic, civilized, and modern socialist country, following the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Whatever difficulties and disturbances we might encounter on the way of our expedition, our great cause shall not waver, and the pace of our advance must not slacken. Let us unite together more closely, firmly grasp the historic opportunity, and work hard for the Chinese nation's rejuvenation and the Chinese people's good future.
