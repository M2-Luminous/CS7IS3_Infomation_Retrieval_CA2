NATO officials have been calling on an increasing number of occasions for using the technique of an ultimatum followed by diplomatic activity in Tuzla and Mostar. Churkin told NATO that a replay of the Sarajevo scenerio was out of the question. He believed that that which did not come off the first time, is also not going to lead to anything the second time. He did not think that air strikes could be effective in Mostar, where Bosnian Croatians and Moslems are engaged in fighting. "In any case, we do not support such operations," he emphasized. He said that what was needed in Tuzla was opening the airport for humanitarian aid rather than lifting the siege. "Various options are possible but I do not think that the humanitarian situation in the town can be improved by shelling its environs," Churkin said. Vitaliy Churkin stressed that energetic activities were being carried out in Tuzla. "The purpose is to open the airport under an agreement between the UN forces' leadership in former Yugoslavia and the two conflicting parties -- Serbs and Moslems. Both Serbian and Moslem parties put forward the demands which hamper the resolution of the issue on opening of the airport," he said. "Russia keeps working with Serbs. However, we hope that somebody else will assume responsibility for negotiations with Moslems who currently control the airport. To open the airport it is necessary that the UN and Serb observers come there. This creates certain problems for the Moslem party," Churkin added.
