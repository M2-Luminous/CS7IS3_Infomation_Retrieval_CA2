The commission will return to the problem of the budget sector before the end of the week, while specific decisions regarding prices of energy carriers are to be made on 6 June, which is when the Main Statistical Office, the Central Planning Administration, and trade unions will present materials regarding the proportion of Polish families' budgets spent on energy expenditures. An increase in prices of energy carriers is a life-or-death issue for the energy industry, Deputy Finance Minister Waldemar Manugiewicz stated after the debate was over. He reported that, in line with government plans, the level of economically justified prices shall be reached in the energy industry in the year 2000. Before that date, however, investments necessary for modernizing the branch will total approximately 3,000,000 billion zlotys [Z]. The trade unionists reminded participants in the meeting that over 40 percent of Polish families spend between 12 and 18 percent of their incomes on energy, while, in families whose incomes do not exceed Z1.2 million [per month], the amount reaches 20 percent. Solidarity is of the view that official regulation of energy prices has an inflationary effect: Enterprises are aware of planned increases in advance, and they decide to increase prices on their products beforehand. The trade union suggested that energy prices be frozen for a year against inflation. The government's proposal of a law regarding the regulation of salaries in the budget sector raised reservations of the trade unions and employers. According to the document, the Council of Ministers is supposed to present to the Trilateral Commission proposals for percentage-based remunerations in the budget sector for a following year,. The commission would then have a month in which to arrive at a joint position. If no agreement were to be reached within 30 days, the government would take into account the amounts in line with its proposals in the budget for the following year. The government also presented a proposal for regulating the powers of the Trilateral Commission. As A. Baczkowski informed, the principle of consensus is supposed to be the main principle of decisions. If the parties do not reach an agreement, the position worked out by them would only be of an opinion value for the Council of Ministers and the parliament; it would not influence the shape of the final decisions, Baczkowski explained. We do not agree with the proposition because we think the government may come up with a low level of salaries, Solidarity argued. The All-Poland Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] also opposed the proposal by saying that the issue of salaries in the budget sector cannot be a reason for problems that occur every year. According to the OPZZ, the only acceptable solution would be to design minimum financial guarantees for the budget sector.
