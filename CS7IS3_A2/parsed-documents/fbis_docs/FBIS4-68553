But the debts remain--250 million to Pressa Publishing House and many millions to paper combines, printing offices, and partners in the delivery of the newspaper. How did these debts arise? It is known that through the actions of the former Ministry of Information and the Press, subsequently declared illegal by the court, publication of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA was halted for two and a half months during the October-December 1993 period. The editorial office sustained large losses as a result of the interruption of the subscription campaign during the first half of 1994 and was deprived of income from advertising and retail sails--on the whole the losses for the end of 1993 exceeded R1.3 billion rubles. In addition, the working account of the editorial staff was frozen for a long time by an order of the Central Bank, which was deemed by the High Arbitration Court to be invalid--thus arose a string of debts and unjustified fines. At the same time we know that our readers need the newspaper very much--soon it will largely have restored its readership: The number of subscribers has exceeded 270,000 and the overall circulation is approaching a half million. Since April, 18,000 subscribers have joined us. And it is becoming increasingly expensive to publish the newspaper. We now spend R25-R30 million to publish one issue. And this is--for now! How can this be?! Let us consult. Contribution of State Duma Deputies The Communist Party of the Russian Federation faction of the State Duma also decided to render aid to SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA.
