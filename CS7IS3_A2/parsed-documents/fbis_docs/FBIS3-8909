Beric: "Karadzic's Warning to the Muslims"] [Text] Borovo Naselje, 14 Mar -- The first constituent session of the convention of the Serbian Democratic Parties [SDS] of the Serbian Lands, which was attended by members of the SDS of the Serbian Lands from east Slavonia, Baranja, and western Srem, who adopted with acclamation the convention on the unification of all SDS into one party that was signed in Pale on 7 November 1993, was held in Borovo Naselje yesterday. The membership accepted with acclamation that the SDS of the Serbian Lands cease work and transfer their powers to President Radovan Karadzic and a main committee. Radovan Karadzic, president of the SDS of the Serbian Lands, presented the program aims of the united party. According to Karadzic, which is something he insisted on throughout his speech, the aim of the SDS of the Serbian Lands is not to win power, but to realize its program in the interest of the people -- "winning power is the means to accomplish this." One of the main tasks of the party is reinstate the traditional values of the Serbian people. State Unity -- The Basis of Everything On our path to realize the program, Karadzic said, there are several priorities. The first priority is to overcome the divisions in the Serbian nation in every respect, especially tribal divisions. "The state unity is left for the end and this unity is in fact the beginning of everything," Karadzic said. The state is a guarantee for the survival of a nation. The time has come for the Serbs to finish what Karadjordje had started. The phrase frequently misused in the world is "great Serbia." Russia is big, and Serbia is as big as it is. Once all Serbian lands are incorporated, they will make up some 150,000 square meters. The Serbs in the Serbian Republic, Karadzic said, have their territory and are controlling it; they have their own nation and effective authorities. These are the elements needed for the existence of a country, which was also admitted by UN representative Akashi. However, the military victory is only one step and this military victory should be turned into a political and diplomatic victory. After that we should seek the recognition of sovereignty. After the constituent session and the speech by President Karadzic on the party's program, the delegates held a meeting behind closed doors at which they discussed the new program and the statute of the party. Dr. Karadzic then held a news conference. Regarding the opening of Tuzla airport, Karadzic said that he had reached an agreement with a Russian diplomat on the conditions needed to be met for the opening of the airport. These are the guarantees that the airport will not be used for military purposes. However, the Muslims have started the spring offensive on Mount Ozren in an attempt to capture Modrica and Doboj, which, according to Karadzic, is the first stage of breaking through the corridor. "We will say very clearly, and I am saying this to you now, that if the Muslims do not stop their offensive, we will not make any territorial concessions. The Muslims cannot be guaranteed 30 percent of the territory and allowed to continue fighting against us. Since they have opted to fight, they will then get as much territory as they win. Had they opted for political talks in time, we would have come to certain arrangements in a peaceful way." The statement by Alija Izetbegovic that 64 percent of the territory will belong to the Muslim-Croat federation, according to Karadzic, is simply a provocation directed at the Serbs to reject this idea. This would then be used as the reason to reject the Washington agreement. Karadzic claims that neither the Croats nor the Muslims want the agreement, which they were forced to sign. They are looking for reasons and motives to break the talks and the agreement. Radovan Karadzic then confirmed that the talks with the Russians were difficult because, "contrary to the erroneous belief in the world, the Russians are not our protectors in the sense the that Americans are the protectors of the Muslims." Secret Signals to Serbs "Russia is playing a constructive role and we must clearly say that Russia is not partial toward the Serbs. Russia is trying to be objective and it is in its interest that a solution be found as soon as possible. Whether this solution is favorable for the Serbs or not, they are not asked about it that much. However, we are here to say that such a solution is not a solution for us. Nevertheless, I think that Russia has a correct view on all this and that the Russians will realize that it is in their interests that the Serbs realize their aims, because these aims could not be against Russia's interests." Answering the question as to whether Russia had prevented NATO's military intervention in the Serbian Republic, Karadzic expressed the view that NATO was relieved when Russia entered the game. According to Karadzic, in this game with NATO, the European Union ejected itself from the game. The Serbs are now receiving secret signals from certain European capitals. They now want to achieve through the Serbs the kind of results achieved by Churkin. They missed their chance and we no longer have reason to deal with European capitals. If Russia and the United State are here, we will deal with them, with those that can bring about a solution, Radovan Karadzic said. [Box, p 11] Karadzic on Churkin's Statement in Zagreb The most interesting remark was certainly Karadzic's view on the statements by Vitaliy Churkin in Zagreb on the possibility of the Serbs entering the federation with the Croats and the Muslims in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. "This is possible but not probable," Dr. Karadzic said. "We are allowing for the possibility of discussing all this and do not want to spoil what the Croats and the Muslims are doing. This is their right, as long as it does not affect the Serbs in the Serbian Republic and the Serbian Republic of Krajina. I ask myself somewhat naively: Why would it be natural for the Serbs to live with the Croats and the Muslims and not with the Serbs. I have no answer to this simple question."
