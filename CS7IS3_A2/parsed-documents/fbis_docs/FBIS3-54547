In this meeting, which was also attended by Foreign Minister Velayati, Tajikistan's foreign minister conveyed the very sincere greetings of Tajik President Rakhmanov and handed his written message to the president. Submitting a report about the latest developments in Tajikistan, the Tajik foreign minister informed the president of the decision of the Tajik Government about the holding of general elections and the establishment of peace and stability in that country. Olimov stressed that the Tajik nation and government have enormous respect and affection for the Islamic Republic of Iran and hope that, with the help of the friends of Tajikistan--especially Iran--they will witness national reconciliation and peace and security in Tajikistan in the near future. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani then expressed his thanks for the kind message of the Tajik president and welcomed the decision of that government to bring about national reconciliation and an end to internal clashes. He said: The only solution for the well-being of the people of Tajikistan is in cooperation, national reconciliation, and solidarity. Clashes, fighting, and ignoring a section of the society will produce no benefits and will result in the destruction of national capabilities. No one will benefit from it. We hope that we will be able to witness the return of calm and stability to Tajikistan as soon as possible, and we are prepared to help you achieve this goal.
