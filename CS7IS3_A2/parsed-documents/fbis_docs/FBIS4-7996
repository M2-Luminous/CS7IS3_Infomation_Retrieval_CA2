So much for his attitude toward the taking of the presidential seat, and as far as concerns the "strategic orientation," which "will never be given up," according to Milan Martic, it is "a historical task, with which the Serbs in the republic of Serbian Krajina should secure the same rights as the Slovenes, Croats, and other nations on the territories of the former Yugoslavia have been given." Milosevic Is a Politician of International Caliber [Paripovic] Did the fact that you are Slobodan Milosevic's man, which you admitted yourself, help your "victory" after the elections were repeated? [Martic] It is correct that I once said I was Slobodan Milosevic's man. That cannot be interpreted as some blind obedience or subjection. I am Slobodan Milosevic's man to the extent to which we are both dedicated to the historical task of establishing Serb national interests. The president of Serbia has become a politician of international caliber, respected by the international factors that participate in the resolving of the crisis on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Not even the greatest Serb-haters and his opponents can dispute that. Not even opposition leaders, such as Vuk Draskovic, attack Slobodan Milosevic any more, because it is no longer popular even abroad, let alone in Serbia and the republic of Serbian Krajina. My relation toward the president of Serbia is clear, but I think that did not have a crucial impact on the results of the elections. [Paripovic] How do you account for the sudden change of the voters' decision to your benefit? [Martic] In the first round my opposing candidate Milan Babic won more votes only because there was no control in that round. In the second round we established the control mechanism and ensured that the voting was regular. Milan Babic has an extremely bad political rating in Serbia, and this he can primarily ascribe to the tactless actions and statements with which he seriously endangered the unity of the Serb people. Nothing Behind Knin's Back [Paripovic] You talk of Babic's bad rating in Serbia, but the elections were not held in Serbia. There is no doubt that your nomination was aided by a shameless soliciting of the votes of certain members of the SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia] leadership who are close to Milosevic. [Martic] Babic's prediction was that the opposition would win in Serbia, and he gave verbal support to the opposition several times before the elections. That is normal. However, this is why he could not expect the support of the authorities in Serbia. In fact, both of us received the support of those who saw the similarity between their political programs and ours. [Paripovic] What condition is the economy of the "Krajina" in, and what is the social situation of its citizens? There is talk of the economy and the citizens being exhausted, of poverty. [Martic] It is understandable that the economic situation in the state, after several years of war, is difficult. At the same time, we are waging a war, building the state institutions, and trying to revive the industrial and agricultural production. However, the situation is not nearly what it is believed to be. [Paripovic] Goran Hadzic, your predecessor, has again raised the issue of the justifiability of the unification of Slavonia, Baranja, and western Srem with the so-called Knin Krajina, adding that it was a formal unification, and he has asked how justifiable it was to send aid to Knin "when there is no one there who is not too lazy to unload it." Could you comment on that? [Martic] I am not familiar with these statements by Goran Hadzic, but I think that they are not important. He is the former president of the state, who, I deeply believe, was not suited for the job he was entrusted with. I really do not want to comment on his statements, as I do not consider them to have any political importance. [Paripovic] All right. May I remind you of Jovan Opacic's statement, according to which Serbia "is making a colony out of Krajina," which Opacic called creating an "Indian reservation," and Serbia's attitude an "anti-Serb act"? [Martic] The process of the integration of the Serb lands, which has assumed its latest dimensions with the establishment of a unitary monetary system, a unitary market and economy, can certainly not be called by that name. I believe other steps will be taken in the upcoming period, after which the issue of unification will really be sheer formality. [Paripovic] How do you see the normalization of the relations between Serbia and Croatia, and the signing of the Joint Statement in Geneva? According to certain estimates, this normalization was done "behind Knin's back," while some have interpreted Slobodan Milosevic's statement that the relations between Croatia and the so-called republic of Serbian Krajina should be resolved directly by the negotiators of these two sides as "Belgrade's giving up on the republic of Serbian Krajina." [Martic] The normalization of the relations between the FRY and Croatia represents quite a normal and logical factor in the context of the strengthening peace initiatives for resolving the crisis on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. If this normalization contributes to resolving peacefully the conflicts between Krajina and Croatia, that is, through political means, we will welcome it. I see nothing there that could make the position of the republic of Serbian Krajina more difficult, and nothing that could have been done "behind Knin's back." The statement of the president of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic is in fact a confirmation of our position that only representatives of the republic of Serbian Krajina and Croatia can discuss any disputable issues. In order to establish negotiations, it is necessary for Croatia to stop the constant attacks on the republic of Serbian Krajina, that is, it is necessary to establish a permanent cease-fire. Demarcation Is the Way to Peace [Paripovic] According to some political analysts, you are a man who will only carry out, on the side of the so-called republic of Serbian Krajina, what is possibly arranged with Mr. Tudjman. [Martic] We will insist on the negotiations being held on an equal basis and on the principle of reciprocity. I see no reason why such a dialogue should not be established, as I see no way of resolving the disputes in another way. We are prepared to discuss the economic and communication problems of both sides, as well as of the demarcation between the republic of Serbian Krajina and Croatia. I believe that is the best and fastest way of reaching the normalization of relations very soon. [Paripovic] In your statement: "Martic will exist as long as there is Knin, and Krajina will exist as long as I do" many have recognized the position that war with Croatia is inevitable. [Martic] Our orientation is peace, not war. We have no reason to attack Croatia if the other side accepts the peace option. However, the experience we have had so far has taught us that there is an extremely militarist atmosphere in Croatia, and that the leading HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] regime thus suppresses the social and political tensions. This is why we have no illusions about the real intentions of the Croatian authorities. We are prepared to convince them that they will not be able to solve a single thing with a war against Krajina, and that sooner or later they will have to sit at the negotiating table with us. Another of Croatia's great delusions is that Germany will do the job for them. All these delusions lead to a long, exhausting war, which will bring neither side any good. [Paripovic] What is the lower limit in the negotiations and the arrangement of relations with Croatia; how far will your side go? [Martic] As far as the relations between the republic of Serbian Krajina and Croatia are concerned, I have already said that there was no reason for them not to improve in the future. In fact, we are asking nothing of Croatia. We expect the international community only to give us what it has already given the Croats, Slovenes, and Macedonians, that is, the right to self-determination. We are prepared to hold a referendum in the Krajina, most strictly controlled by the international community, on whether our people want to live in Croatia, and that is the limit below which we will not go. The United States Has Imposed It [Paripovic] How do you see the Croat-Muslim agreement? [Martic] As far as the agreement between the Croats and Muslims in the former Bosnia is concerned, clearly that is something the United States has imposed, and something that is far from reality. That marriage was made out of interest, and I do not believe in it, especially after everything that has happened. As far as possible repercussions are concerned, they are not insignificant, but I do not think they can have a significant impact on the position of the republic of Serbian Krajina.
