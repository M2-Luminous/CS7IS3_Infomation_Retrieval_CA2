In his opinion, conditions are not yet ripe to enter this international organisation, but he emphasised the need of coordinating activity on world oil markets. Russia and OPEC, he said, are largely concerned over the drop in oil prices, and they intend to take measures to stabilise them. This considered, meetings between Russia and OPEC will be continued on the ministerial level. As Viktor Chernomyrdin and OPEC Secretary-General Subroto met in Davos, Switzerland, the sides discussed mutual reductions of oil export quotas with a view to stabilising prices for the product.
