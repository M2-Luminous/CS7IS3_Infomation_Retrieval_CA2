During a congress held on Saturday [14 May] and Sunday, he was supported by almost all 290 delegates. They responded to his speeches with standing ovations and voted for a list prepared by Kaczynski of candidates to the party's leadership. Kaczynski was able to say then: "Our opponents"--he did not say who they were--"tried to destroy us using the Office of State Protection and attacks in the mass media. They did not succeed. We are stronger now than at any time in the past. The most dedicated activists have remained in the party. We have gotten rid of career-oriented ones and also of those whose assessments of the PC were based on GAZETA WYBORCZA and NIE weekly." Just One Mistake During his 40-minute speech, the PC chairman admitted having committed just one mistake: He was not ruthless enough when it came to opposition inside the party: He had not thrown out Olszewski's supporters earlier, and he tolerated "party do-nothings." Apart from that, he has always been right. But leaders of other center right-wing parties made a major mistake: They refused to join forces before the 19 September elections. As a result, the center right wing has no representatives in the Sejm, even though it could have had as many as 150. Unification of the center right wing is goal number-one for Kaczynski. He made the first step, with the Christian-National Union, the Peasant Accord, the Movement for the Republic, and the Conservative Coalition. Last week, the "five" formed a confederation named "Alliance for Poland." They will gladly accept new members. Kaczynski repeated at the congress: "We have no enemies in the right wing." Strong Words After a break lasting six months, Kaczynski returned to his strong anticommunist and anti-Walesa rhetoric. Depriving the Democratic Left Alliance, the Polish Peasant Party, and Lech Walesa of power is goal number-two for Kaczynski. The president is a danger to democracy and Instruction 0015 is a symbol of his rules. The postcommunists are reinstating arrangements that existed in the period of the Polish People's Republic [PRL], and they are waging a war on national traditions and the church. Kaczynski argued that only the right wing is capable of severing ties to the PRL's legacies. Only the right wing is capable of "building a new Poland that would be free of the communist mentality." Kaczynski wants to begin the process with a radical decommunization and file-checking [lustracja]. He announced the removal of "PRL people" from the Army, the police, the state administration, and banks. "The Hungarian example shows that, without such measures, even four years of center right-wing rules bring bad results," Kaczynski said. He was making a reference to the recent election triumph by postcommunists in Hungary. In Kaczynski's view, the postcommunists in Poland want to take advantage of the upcoming self-governmental elections in order to take over power in towns and villages. "It is our obligation to successfully resist the offensive," he appealed to his confederation partners. Strzembosz for President The entire post-Solidarity camp should come up with just one candidate in the presidential elections. The center right wing has been promoting Supreme Court Chief Justice Adam Strzembosz, but it first wants Solidarity to approve him, followed by the Freedom Union. Dispute About Punishment The congress was well prepared but boring. Everyone agreed with the chairman on everything, with one exception: When Kaczynski proclaimed a draft resolution calling for increasing the fight with crime, a storm broke out. The PC chairman suggested radical measures: reinstating the death penalty, imprisoning even 13-year-old criminals, restricting conditional releases, punishing severely for drug trade and possession... Among others, former Senator Leszek Piotrowski argued with Kaczynski by saying that the restrictive ideas will get bad reception in the mass media and in Europe, with which we have been integrating. But Kaczynski did not give up: "Crime is on the rise. The law must begin protecting victims, not criminals," he said. "One must increase police powers; murderers cannot be in a better position than their victims." These arguments got a positive reception by the majority of candidates. The resolution was supported by 120 delegates, with 70 against.
