The Slap in the Face From Partners May Cost the `Partnership' Plenty"] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The events in Bosnia may seriously affect the future of Russian-NATO relations within the "Partnership for Peace" program. Although officials at the Russian Foreign Ministry have assured your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that Russia's signing of the "Partnership for Peace" will take place on the date agreed earlier, neither can one rule out a different option. Since the events in Yugoslavia, to all appearances, are becoming yet again a factor in Russia's domestic political struggle, there is a high degree of probability that the Kremlin may opt to postpone the signing. Otherwise it risks turning into too comfortable a target for the opposition, which is always ready to raise an outcry over "the sellout of Russia's national interests." It is not a coincidence that even the voice of the most steadfast proponent of "Partnership for Peace" -- Andrey Kozyrev -- has acquired new undertones. After talks with Javier Solana, chief of the Spanish Foreign Ministry, Kozyrev stated that Russia -- as a great military and nuclear power -- lays claim to a special role within the "Partnership." All the more so because, the minister said, Moscow is inclined to see the NATO initiative as just one of a number of programs, not the most important one at that, in the process of creating a single Europe.
