There is now open warfare between the management of the national space agency, the scientists, and the Minister of Research who are involved in choosing a national space policy. Extremely heated accusations are being exchanged concerning the correctness of behavior in the past, the validity of the programs, the accounts that do not balance, and the methods of control that go back at least to 1988 when the ASI (Italian Space Agency) was set up. The confused atmosphere that already existed has become incandescent since the Corte dei Conti [Italian audit department] formally raised numerous points with the ASI. The Corte dei Conti has requested clarification of about 20 controversial points, that translated into figures have a total value of over 600 billion lire. At present the ASI is under the control of a commission and will continue to be until 28 February. The commission was set up to manage the transitional phase leading up to the appointment of a new board of directors. In reality it seems that the goal of the commission is simply to restart all the activities of the ASI that have been subjected to criticisms from the penal and administrative judiciary regarding funding for research, the dismissal of Remo Ruffini (former president of the scientific committee and one of the most regular critics of the ASI's CDA), the San Marco program of Rome university, and the SAX [X-Ray Astronomy Satellite] satellite. Resorting to three commissions, made up of private citizens who are not members of state bodies, has not resolved these problems yet. The real problems are the guidelines for national participation in the European Space Agency (ESA) and the goals of national space activity. These still have to be either analyzed or discussed by parliament, especially now that the adjustment of new scenarios has become necessary following the cancellation of the Hermes space plane and the redimensioning of permanent orbital activities. There is annual funding of 800 billion lire, and the obligations to the ESA are somewhere between 560 and 700 billion a year, to which internal costs of about 70 billion must be added, together with consistent obligations for expenditure that have been underwritten for the coming years without either the necessary authorizations of the CIPE [Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning] or financial cover. The European situation, in the light of the increased cuts called for by Germany and Italy, and the ratification of Maastricht, is weakening Italian industry, which is already being penalized by the depreciation of the lira, and has reduced the industrial returns that come from our participation in the ESA by about one third, and analogously increased the management costs charged to us. The fluctuations in exchange rates have intervened on a strategy that favored long-term programs and the many unknown factors. The Tethered and Italsat programs were the subjects of controversies regarding their real effectiveness in the past, and today the SAX program is under discussion. SAX is a project for a light launcher and logistic space station modules. It has cost 644 billion lire over 14 years. Research Minister Colombo spoke on this subject at the end of December. He confirmed the regularity of the project (limiting this to the scientific and industrial aspects). As far as the national launcher is concerned, the conclusions of the relative committees are not yet known (but the delays and some forecasts have already sparked off discussions and clarifications). In any case, whilst the 90 billion assigned to Rome university have been blocked for three years, and the 440 billion requested by FIAT for the VEGA [Advanced Generation European Carrier] carrier have not yet been authorized, work is continuing on the construction of the two logistic modules for the United States space station: 500 billion for the construction and a successive payment for maintenance and operational activities, without significant technological, scientific or commercial returns. In the meantime, yesterday, Research Minister Umberto Colombo presented the report on the government lines of action for innovation and research policy. This analysis points once again to the necessity of favoring innovation in the productive sectors that are leading our economy, promoting advanced technologies that have a strong capability of dissemination, reinforcing research and technological development activities connected with the modernization of the infrastructure networks (information science, telecommunications, transport), and favoring the setting up of industries that have a scientific basis. Despite the situation of economic crisis, some decisions taken by the current government have allowed about 3.3 trillion lire to be recuperated, and 588 billion have been allocated to national research plans, 300 billion to technological parks in the Mezzogiorno [southern Italy], 350 billion to training, 540 billion to projects coming under Law No. 46, and 600 billion to the Italian aerospace research center, that has recently been reoriented toward aeronautical themes. Colombo declared that these resources, that total 15 percent of the annual funding for research "are improvements obtained by eliminating areas of inefficiency and management errors, but it will soon be necessary to increase the resources available because the gap dividing us from the other industrialized countries has become intolerably wide." The immediate necessities are for the universities to pay greater attention to research programs that have fixed goals, for more effective coordination between programs and public research organizations, and for an increase in resources for training young researchers but "before asking for more money it is necessary to spend what is already available well," concluded Colombo. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Research: A Comparison Between Countries | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Italy without personnel | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Year |Country |Personnel Engaged | | | | |in R&D in Ind-| | | | |ustry | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1989 |Canada |53,860 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1989 |France |149,822 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1989 |Germany |296,510 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1989 |Japan |528,363 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1989 |United Kingdom |176,100 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1989 |Italy |64,944 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1990 |Canada |53,240 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1990 |France |163,228 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1990 |Japan |558,261 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1990 |United Kingdom |155,000 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1990 |Italy |57,944 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1991 |Germany |313,300 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1991 |Japan |563,018 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1991 |United Kingdom |150,000 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1991 |Italy |55,461 | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
