The minister asked the chambers of commerce in Damascus and the Damascus Rural Area to hold a joint meeting to achieve this objective by enlightening retailers. We believe that intensification of price control patrols alone will not be sufficient to cover the capital and the rural area, in view of their vast expanse and the huge number of retailers, As for enlightening retailers about the need to stick to official prices, this is something which can never be materialized. Prices increase or decrease according to the market forces of supply and demand, which apply to all commodities. The retailer will not stick to an official price list, even if there is one. So what can the consumer do in the face of such a situation? Whoever follows the market movements will observe that there has already been a clear increase in prices since the wage increase. We know, for instance, that the Ministry of Supply has so far not announced any changes in the prices of commodities or services, other than domestic transportation fares between provinces. Still, the prices of many commodities have gone up and the citizen is being compelled to pay the price charged by the retailer. The stability of market prices demands government intervention through its commercial network and public sector companies in order to provide a suitable package of commodities for the citizens at prices which can complete with market retail prices. We believe that the government has companies which produce all kinds of commodities. It also has a sufficient number of sales outlets and consumer cooperatives which can ensure the stability of market prices. When the private sector discovers that the commodities it is selling are offered by consumer cooperatives at cheaper prices, it will be compelled to charge a price closer to that of the cooperatives. Therefore, the solution does not just lie in suppressing retailers who sell at higher prices by intensifying price control patrols, which will not be able to control everyone no matter how hard they try, but also in the intervention by the government and the numerous productive public sector companies by providing a package of commodities acceptable in quality and price. This is the most effective way to achieve price stability in the short and long term. This way, we will be able to achieve two objectives at the same time: Introducing the production of public sector companies on the one hand, and ensuring commodities for citizens on the other.
