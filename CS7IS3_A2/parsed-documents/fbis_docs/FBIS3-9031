Bujak, addressing the committee meeting, argued that the transformation of the Vistula region troops into, as he put it, a presidential guard, would be "a dangerous shift on the political arena." He said that such a military unit may be "equally efficient in averting as well as in carrying out a coup d'etat." Bujak expressed the opinion that any kind of one-person control of a concrete political force over the Vistula troops poses a "threat of their misuse." A further discussion of committee members was held behind closed doors. A draft law prepared by the National Security Bureau at the Presidential Chancellery and approved by the National Defence Committee last year, provided for the transformation of the Vistula troops into a national guard subordinate to the president. The idea caused much controversy, including protests from deputies and members of the parliamentary national defence committee. Among tasks of the elite unit is the protection of 36 government buildings and 130 foreign diplomatic missions in Poland and Polish diplomatic and consular missions in 16 states. At present the unit, with 12,000 soldiers and civilian employees, is subordinate to the minister of internal affairs.
