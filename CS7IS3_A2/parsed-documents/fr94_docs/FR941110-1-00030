FR941110-1-00030 FR941110-1-00006 New Jersey contains areas classified as moderate nonattainment for carbon monoxide. New Jersey has established a major source threshold of 100 TPY and an offset ratio that equals or exceeds 1.0:1.0 for these areas. These provisions meet the federal requirements and are, therefore, approvable. NSR Requirements for PM&hyph;10 The general statutory permit requirements for PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are contained in section 173 and in subpart 4 of part D of the Act. For both classifications of PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas, moderate and severe, states must adopt the appropriate major source threshold, offset ratio, significance level for modifications, and provisions for PM&hyph;10 precursors. New Jersey has no areas classified as PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. New Jersey has established a major source threshold of 25 TPY, a minimum offset ratio which equals or exceeds 1.0:1.0, and a modification significance level of 15 TPY. These provisions exceed the minimum federal requirements and are, therefore, approvable. If any area is subsequently reclassified as nonattainment for PM&hyph;10, New Jersey will be required to amend its SIP and include the requirements for PM&hyph;10 precursors and the applicable threshold, offset and significance level requirements for that area classification. NSR Requirements for Sulfur Dioxide The general statutory permit requirements for SO 2 nonattainment areas are contained in section 173, and in subpart 5 of part D of the Act. For SO 2 nonattainment areas, states must adopt the appropriate major source threshold, offset ratio, and significance level for modifications. New Jersey has one SO 2 nonattainment area. New Jersey has established a major source threshold of 100 TPY, a minimum offset ratio which equals or exceeds 1.0:1.0, and a modification significance level of 40 TPY. These provisions meet the federal requirements and are, therefore, approvable. NSR Requirements for Lead The general statutory permit requirements for lead nonattainment areas are generally contained in section 173, and in subpart 5 of part D of the Act. For lead nonattainment areas, states must adopt the appropriate major source threshold, offset ratio, and significance level for modifications. New Jersey has no lead nonattainment areas. New Jersey has established a major source threshold of 10 TPY, an offset ratio of 1.0:1.0, and a modification significance level of 0.6 TPY. These provisions meet the federal requirements for offset ratio and significance level, and exceed the requirements for major threshold level and are, therefore, approvable. NSR Requirements for Nitrogen Dioxide The statutory permit requirements for nitrogen dioxide nonattainment areas are contained in section 173, and in subpart 5 of part D of the Act. For nitrogen dioxide nonattainment areas, states must adopt the appropriate major source threshold, offset ratio, and significance level for modifications. New Jersey did not address this requirement since there are no nitrogen dioxide nonattainment areas in the State. General Savings Clause Section 193 of the Act states that no control requirement, in effect before November 15, 1990, in any area which is a nonattainment area for any air pollutant, may be modified after November 15, 1990 unless the modification ensures equivalent or greater emission reductions of that air pollutant. New Jersey's revised NSR rule contains three modifications to control requirements. First, the revised regulations relax the NO X emission offset ratio from 2.0:1.0 to 1.3:1.0. Second, the revised regulations relax the VOC offset ratio from 2.0:1.0 to 1.3:1.0. Third, the revised regulations relax the carbon monoxide applicability threshold from 50 to 100 TPY. In all three instances, New Jersey has demonstrated that the revised rule, taken as a whole, provides equivalent or greater emission reductions than the current rule. It thus complies with section 193, the General Savings Clause. EPA Policy Issues EPA has identified the following provisions of New Jersey's NSR rule which do not adhere to current EPA guidance. 1. Net Air Quality Benefit. Current EPA guidance (1989 SO 2 Guidance EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;89&hyph;019) states that a net air quality benefit analysis must be demonstrated for sources that do not satisfy the location requirements for emission offsets as specified in 40 CFR part 51, appendix S. According to that guidance, the net air quality benefit is made with a modeling analysis that predicts that the LAER and emission offsets proposed will result in a net concentration change that is less than zero at an agreed upon number of receptors within the nonattainment area of the emission increase. As in the Act prior to 1990, section 173(a) specifies that emission increases from a proposed major source or major modification must achieve LAER and sufficient offsetting emission reductions in order to represent, when considered together with other provisions of the SIP, reasonable further progress towards attainment of the NAAQS.
