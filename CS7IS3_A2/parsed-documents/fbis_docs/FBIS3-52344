However, falling snow has curtailed the intensity of the battle. A report dispatched by the Voice and Vision correspondent from Kabul indicates that following the heavy battles of the past few days, groups of people have left their homes to purchase basic essentials. At the same time, a large number of people are trying to flee the city, fearing that the clashes might intensify again. Our colleague, Darestani, reports by telephone from Kabul on the latest developments and the situation in Kabul today: [Darestani] Thousands of family groups, whose houses have been demolished during the clashes, began moving toward more secure regions today. After three days of heavy battles, the government is saying that its forces have succeeded in taking control of the important centers of the capital. At the same time, General Fahim, the head of Kabul's general security, who is one of the top commanders in the Shura-ye Nozzar [Supervisory Council], said today: The president's forces are in full control of all the central districts in the city of Kabul, except part of the heights in the southern and southeastern districts and two joint headquarters of General 'Abd-al-Rashid Dostam's forces, and the forces of Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party] along the slopes leading to these heights. He added: General Dostam's forces were forced to retreat from Kabul airport. At the same time, reports have reached us indicating that General Dostam's forces have taken positions in three areas of Kabul airport. General Fahim, referring to the efforts undertaken by some jehad groups of Afghanistan including Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami, Hezb-e Harakat-e Enqelab-e Eslami [Islamic Revolutionary Movement] and Hezb-e Jam'iat-e Eslami [Islamic Society], as well as Iran and Pakistan to establish a cease-fire in Kabul, further added: We regard these efforts positively and if practical steps were to be taken to esablish a cease-fire, Borhanoddin Rabbani would welcome it. Our colleague, in continuation of his report from Kabul, added: The commander of General Dostam's forces has announced that the forces under his command have made major advances in the battlefields. Speaking from his headquarters in the southeastern suburbs of Kabul, he described the losses inflicted on Ahmed Shah Mas'ud's forces as being very heavy.
