Thirty years ago, however, they did not even have their own independent "status" and were included as "rural sidelines" as the was the job of chicken raising by old women. In 1958 following communization, in order to adjust to the specific environment at that time, villages in all localities began to run various types of small factories, called "production-brigade-run enterprises," which were characterized by groups of indigenous industries producing things like chemical fertilizer, pesticide, cement, steel, and processed food. That year, they achieved a output value of 6.25 billion yuan. In the 20 years that followed, the production-brigade-run enterprises had ups and downs in their course of development. By the end of 1978, the number of production-brigade-run enterprises rose to 1.52 million, which offered jobs for a surplus rural work force of 28 million people, and achieved an output value of 49.1 billion yuan that year. Their real big development, however, began since reform and opening up. In the past 15 years, China's township and town enterprises suddenly have stood up and leapt onto the new stage one after another. Their total output value in 1983 exceeded 100 billion yuan and in 1987 leapt to nearly 500 billion yuan. In 1991, their output value broke through 1 trillion yuan for the first time. In 1993 total output value reached 2.9 trillion yuan, net profits came to 160 billion yuan, the taxes they turned over to the state totaled 95 billion yuan, exports totaled 190 billion yuan, and they had 112 million staff and workers, exceeding the total number of the staff and workers of state-run enterprises. In as short a time as 15 years, township and town enterprises have grown from a tiny and tender seedling to a big strong tree and have become an important pillar of the entire national economy. They already account for one third of China's total industrial output value, and they have become the main body of China's medium-sized and small enterprises. They are important income earners for the national economy, an important force that supports and strengthens agriculture, a major form of shifting the surplus rural work force, and a major force that promotes the development of cities and towns in rural areas. True, in their course of development, township and town enterprises still have problems, such as, their layout is not rational enough, they are excessively scattered, their technology, equipment, personnel quality, and management expertise are still rather low, government and enterprise functions are not separated and ownership and management are not clearly defined, and their development in eastern, central, and western China is still unbalanced. These problems need to be resolved in the course of their future development. We have the reason to believe that as long as we unswervingly continue to walk on the right road, township and town enterprises will surely be able to have a brighter tomorrow which will draw worldwide attention.
