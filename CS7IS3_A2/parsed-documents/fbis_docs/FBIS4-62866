The present meeting in Baku essentially signifies, in the opinion of the head of the Azerbaijani state, the start of a new stage in a settlement of the conflict. He believes that the Minsk Group of the CSCE has as of late enlarged the scope of its activity and has been adopting a more realistic approach to the possibilities of a resolution of the problem, relying on the efforts of all its member countries. There was a positive assessment here of the interaction of the CSCE Minsk Group and Russia, specifically this country's Foreign Ministry, aimed at a resolution of the conflict. According to the president of Azerbaijan, "this may be considered a new qualitative level of the peacemaking process." As Geydar Aliyev emphasized, there is no more important aim currently than a search for the most acceptable resolution of this complex problem. He expressed confidence that all interested parties would act in this direction. The president shared the opinion of Jan Eliasson and Vladimir Kazimirov concerning the importance of a cease-fire as an indispensable condition of the settlement process. "I believe that a cease-fire should be followed by specific practical actions which culminate in the immediate withdrawal of the Armenian armed formations from the occupied territories and the implementation of the program specified in CSCE documents," the head of the Azerbaijani state noted, in particular. He expressed the conviction that these stages should be continuous. Only in this case can, in his opinion, real results in a settlement of the conflict be achieved. Geydar Aliyev evaluated Azerbaijan's signing of the Bishkek Protocol, which has been greeted ambivalently in the Republic, as a "correct step" leading to a cease-fire and the creation of the conditions for the realization of active practical measures to achieve long-term and stable peace in the region. The basis for this exists, he maintained, things are quiet currently in the conflict zone. It is now a question, he emphasized, of consolidating this achievement with the assistance of international observers, who should put under supervision the processes of demilitarization and the withdrawal of the forces of occupation. This, the president of Azerbaijan observed, would give everyone confidence in the irreversibility of the peacemaking process. Minsk Group Chairman Jan Eliasson, who spoke at the meeting, declared that a settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict at its present, highly dramatic, stage would require the exceptional and swift actions of all interested parties. According to him, there is a great risk of the wrong path being taken. At the same time the opportunities for the adoption of serious and important decisions are just as significant, but this, the diplomat believes, presupposes the unification of all peacemaking efforts. As Jan Eliasson emphasized, it is essential to do two things -- achieve and consolidate a cease-fire and establish international observers' supervision of observance of the armistice process. The chairman of the Minsk Group announced that last week he had had a "good meeting" with Andrey Kozyrev, minister of foreign affairs of Russia, and Vladimir Kazimirov, ambassador at large of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, on the creation of a "joint monitoring structure." We are even now, Jan Eliasson declared, practically prepared to send to the conflict zone the first small group of international observers. When, however, official opportunities are afforded, we can then, he observed, track the sequence of the peacemaking process. At the same time the chairman of the Minsk Group emphasized that he had to be sure that the process, once begun, would not be frozen in the cease-fire phase. Having cited phased progress as the main principle of the settlement process, the diplomat emphasized the need for "strong connections" between each stage, in the form, for example, of a timetable for the withdrawal of the troops or the elaboration of confidence-building measures. He had the day before, he said, obtained in Vienna the "full blessing" of the CSCE for the continuation of actions to achieve peace in the zone of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. Jan Eliasson also informed the president of Azerbaijan of his New York meetings in the UN Security Council and with the secretary general of the community of nations, at which ways of achieving peace in the region were discussed. Vladimir Kazimirov, plenipotentiary representative of the president of Russia for a peace settlement in Nagornyy Karabakh, evaluated today's meeting as a very important event. It is no accident, therefore, he stressed, that the attention of the world community and all people of good will interested in an end to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is focused on it at this time. As the ambassador maintained, the "risks of peace" are being weighed at this time. "And it is essential to reduce these risks to a minimum, the prospect of a continuation of the bloodshed should be jettisoned, in any event," the diplomat emphasized. Vladimir Kazimirov expressed satisfaction that preference had been given the concept whereby the peacemaking process begins with a cease-fire. And this, he believes, is dictated not only by humanitarian, but also practical considerations since it would be difficult otherwise to resolve the problems that have built up over six years of the conflict. The main thing now, he observed, is to prevent the detachment of the cease-fire and the cessation of hostilities from the next stage, that is, to prevent a freezing of the situation. "We need to ensure the integrity of the settlement process, and a precise sequence of actions must be not a promise but the dependable undertaking of all parties to the conflict," the ambassador at large emphasized. In his view, this could be secured by a strong political agreement, which would require the parties to observe it and on which the world community could count with a certain degree of confidence." According to Vladimir Kazimirov, the main purpose of the Russian side as a mediator is to contribute to not so much a rapid as a dependable settlement of the conflict. Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan, State Councillor Vafa Gulizade, Minister of Foreign Affairs Gasan Gasanov, Nizami Bakhmanov, leader of the Azerbaijani community of Nagornyy Karabakh, and Azerbaijani and foreign diplomats took part in the meeting. Upon the conclusion of the negotiations the CSCE mediating mission left for Yerevan.
