This whirlwind, coinciding with the process of building new post-cold war world order, is being generated by the discord and friction between opposing cultures as China, Japan, and the ROK try to weld themselves into a Northeast Asian sphere of influence so that it may become the center of international order in the 21st century, replacing the United States and Europe. On the other hand, the ROK, China, and Japan are each looking to secure a position of regional hegemony by taking advantage of the changes in the outside world, and trying to find ways to adapt themselves to these changes. Their ambitions are giving rise to recurring whirlwinds in this region. At the moment, their ambitions are hidden behind these whirlwinds. There is no telling how soon, or in what form the effects will be felt. It is precisely because of these changes that the civilian government in South Korea has begun to talk about improving the nation's competitive strength, begun to attach more weight to internationalization, and started to advocate a "new diplomacy." In the short term we need to continue to further our pragmatic national security and economic interests as much as possible in the interest of existing cooperative relations with the United States, China, and Japan. In the mid to long term, we need to lay, by our own effort, the national foundation that will enable us to increase our influence in the new international order and seek future prosperity. This makes it all the more imperative for us to clearly perceive the given "opportunity and challenge" and work out an independent strategy for the future. President Kim Yong-sam's scheduled visit to Japan and China for summit meetings with their leaders is coming at a historical moment when the prevailing international political situation gives hope and opportunity despite its uncertainties and uneasiness. The coming trip could stop at making us feel keenly about the difficult "challenge" posed by the outside environment, or serve as an "opportunity" to take advantage of the uncertain international environment. Needless to say, what all of us want is successful fulfillment of this opportunity. This fulfillment requires an overall change in thinking on the perceptual as well strategic planes with regard to the idea of "the ROK-China-Japan triangular alignment." From the ROK point of view, the triangular relationship of the ROK, China, and Japan has roughly two aspects. One aspect is the existing status quo-oriented pattern of cooperating with China and Japan to promote ROK-Japan economic cooperation and ROK-China exchanges from the standpoint of seeking our national interests while maintaining the ROK- U.S. alliance and friendship as the immutable axle. Under this pattern, our goal in the ROK-Japan relationship will be the correction of the trade imbalance, the acceleration of technology transfers, the promotion of friendship on the government and private levels, and the respect of Japan for the status of the ROK and its people. In ROK-China relations, our main goal will be the expansion of trade, the strengthening of government-level cooperation for the expansion of industrial cooperation, the promotion of private-level investments, and the acceleration of cooperation in the diverse areas of technology and management. Short-term reality makes the promotion of such cooperation essential, and this cooperation is realizable. However, this course separates the economy from security, and it does not mean that we ourselves will engineer the structural change in the future international order. Another aspect of the triple relationship is that this relationship means a new forward-looking alignment with an eye into the 21st century. It relates to the questions of what independent method the ROK would use to bring China and Japan together and what strategic position the ROK would take in the event, for instance; the security environment on the Korean Peninsula should change, accompanied by the revamping of the international order in Northeast Asia. The international order is a result of the rivalry and discord between the United Stats, China, and Japan. To be more specific, let us assume that the United States and North Korea will have better foreign relations and cooperative ties with each other, Japan and North Korea will establish diplomatic relations, Japan will pursue an independent line divorcing itself from the U.S.-Japan security arrangement and alliance, China will begin to assert its role as a mediator in military security in North East Asia, and Russia will propose to form a military alliance with any one country. This is a scenario that was hardly imaginable in the past. However, the problem is that the scenario is gradually approaching the realm of reality and it may become reality in the near future. The ROK-China-Japan triple alignment, that may emerge in the course of structural revamping of the international order in Northeast Asia, is bound to be radically different from the existing status quo-oriented bilateral form of cooperative relations currently perceived and being applied by these countries. The difficulty in finding the direction for the development of the ROK- China-Japan triangular relationship lies in the necessity of considering not only short-term pragmatic objectives but also longterm goals. In view of the unsettled issue of North Korea's nuclear facilities, as well as the current North Korean economic condition and the attendant uncertainty in the security environment on the Korean Peninsula, it is very clear that the arrangement of the ROK- U.S. alliance will continue to prove effective. Considering the worldwide economic recession and the current economic situation in our country, we cannot neglect in the least our efforts to accelerate normal ROK-China economic exchanges and ROK-Japan economic cooperation in order to secure our country's competitiveness necessary for the continued buildup of national strength and future national development. However, dealings between states are one thing and transactions between private firms are another. In dealings between states there are many aspects that cannot be measured in terms of monetary value. For instance, problems such as those involving national sovereignty, nationalism and national sentiments, the legitimacy and efficiency of the government, and the quality of the leadership are delicate problems in dealings between states. They have direct bearing on the future of bilateral or multilateral relations. From our point of view, the ROK-China-Japan triangular relationship is a matter that we need to handle by looking ten, twenty, or one-hundred years ahead. If we are to chase two hares at the same time, namely, the pursuit of short-term national interests and the search for a forward-looking scheme of cooperation, it is imperative to change our way of thinking in establishing our foreign policies. The first requirement is to free ourselves from the conventional strategic view with which we have continued our "subservient diplomacy." In the period of the Sixth Republic our government advocated partnership relations with, and independent diplomacy toward, the United States as its goal. However, the "pragmatic view"--the view that security cooperation from the supposedly honest-minded hegemonic power is essential--still persists true to the age-old convention of subservient diplomacy, coupled with the alarm against the danger of invasion from North Korea. Admittedly, our policies "in the style of subservient diplomacy" have greatly contributed to our national security in some aspects. However, a policy of dependence on foreign powers or a policy of inviting in foreign powers will be no longer helpful in turning our international environment to our advantage in the future; rather it will only serve as a structural impediment to the pace of our development. Arguments about the rise and fall of U.S influence in Northeast Asian countries are intensifying as we move into the mid-1990's. To state my conclusion on the basis of many of these arguments, neither the United States, China, or Japan will be able to secure a hegemonic position in Northeast Asia. The reason is this: Ironically, all three have the ambition and potential to maintain hegemonism, and as a consequence, they will keep an eye on one another and try to hold one another in check. Accordingly, the international order in Northeast Asia is bound to continue for the time being in the form of maintaining the conventional balance of power by tacit multilateral agreement. This situation offers the ROK the best opportunity to play an active role as a balancer in maintaining the balance of power. Under the circumstances in which the balance of power is actively at work, the economic and cultural competition among states will be a dominant factor in international politics, and countries with an eye toward the future will make every effort to consolidate their national foundations under the balance of power. At the same time, diverse forms of multilateral arrangements and dialogues will be developed actively through various channels. That is why we must make preparations now for that future. What position will the United States, China, and Japan take under this new international order? Needless to say, the international order in Northeast Asia will for the time being, be characterized by the influence and role of the United States, the military superpower. However, the current condition of the United States, its foreign policy, and its recent moves suggest that "the time being" will not be too long. Although the U.S. economy is on the way to recovery, the United States incurs a trade imbalance each year of nearly $100 trillion and a fiscal deficit of $300 to $400 trillion. Accordingly, the curtailment of defense expenditure would not be completed in a short period of time (the defense cost may be reduced from 5 percent to 3 percent of the GNP for the next 10 years); and the reduction of U.S. forces in this region will become inevitable as the scale of reduction in the defense cost is to be expanded to the Pacific region from Europe. Already 2 years ago Holbrook, then U.S. assistant secretary for Asia-Pacific affairs, predicted that "U.S. troops will withdraw from Asia within 10 years." President Clinton advocated a "new Pacific community" during his visit to Korea and Japan last year. Presiding over the APEC summit that took place subsequently, he admitted that the way out for the U.S. economy depends on the Asia-Pacific region in general and Northeast Asia in particular. More recently, he began to apply trade pressures by invoking Super 301. He has began to use the human rights issue as a diplomatic trump card against China. In the future the United States will enter willy-nilly into relations of competition and rivalry in Northeast Asia rather than keep on offering concessions and cooperation to China, Japan, and the ROK. Under these circumstances, what outlook will Japan hold for the future? Up till now since its defeat in World War II, Japan has been able to concentrate on economic reconstruction thanks to the U.S.-Japan alliance. For the time being Japan will seek to promote stability and national interests while supporting the U.S. leadership in the international community. However, Japan's economic power has already reached the point where it is threatening to the U.S. leadership. The current deteriorated economic situation in Japan is prompting some critics to predict a very negative outlook for Japan. But the argument that Japan will surpass the United States in the 2000's is gaining ground. If Japan continues to allocate 1 percent of its GNP for its defense expenditure, Japan will have an edge over the United States in the Asia-Pacific region in terms of military expenditure in the early part of the 21st century. [passage omitted] The problem involves the changes that will take place in the future in conjunction with the economic dispute between the United States and Japan, the territorial dispute between Russia and Japan, and the multilateral territorial dispute over the South sea Islands. Amid these changes, voices will mount in Japan demanding for an independent position in security, foreign relations, and economy and calling for the status of a political-military superpower, and this will be a major uncertainty factor in Japanese domestic politics. Therefore, from the ROK's point of view, it should be able to lead the way in devising some ways to eliminate Japan's uncertainty. As a matter of fact, the ROK is not in a position to maintain a military strength superior to that of Japan nor to surpass Japan in national strength. This is why the ROK will have no choice but to exert efforts to work out a diplomatic strategy designed to take advantage of the peculiarities of international relationships in Northeast Asia instead of trying to deal with developments in this region in an emotional way. In the economic field, Japan has already laid the groundwork for exercising its influence in the Southeast Asian region by providing economic development funds for and making direct investments in that region. Japan is also shifting the focus of its industrial and trade policy from Europe and the United States to East Asia. The ROK should be able to deal with and take advantage of this strategy. China was a sleeping lion for the past 100 years or more under the domination of Western material culture. But awake from its long sleep, China is now building its body and sharpening its nails, determined to restore its grand posture as "the center of the universe." Since China adopted a reform and opening policy in the late 1970's in conformity with the Deng Xiaoping line, it has recorded marvelous economic growth. It achieved an annual GNP growth rate of 9.4 percent in the 1980's, and entering the 1990's it has recorded an annual growth rate of over 10 percent despite the worldwide economic recession. The volume of its commodity exports is also increasing at an annual rate of 12.4 percent. [passage omitted] Under an economic strategy seeking trade with the Western world and inducing investments from the outside world, China has pursued an economic policy "centering on the coastal region." The greatest problem China is facing now is the appalling gap between its coastal areas and the interior resulting from this policy. In the Chinese economic structure, foreign trade now accounts for more than 30 percent of the GNP. That is why China cannot but be susceptible to changes in the external environment. From a mid-long term point of view, China is faced with the serious limitations inherent in "the socialist market economy." It is maintaining an iron-clad rule dominated by the communist party while pursuing a capitalist economic development strategy. The ideal of "equality" in income and distribution is gradually becoming passe. There is no telling when another democracy or liberalization movement will break out. Nevertheless China's continuing rapid economic growth is having a tremendous influence on the process of establishing a new order in Northeast Asia. China began reducing its military strength in the 1980's, but entering the 1990's it began to add spurs to defense modernization by continually increasing its defense outlays. China is particularly trying to develop, deploy, and sell high-tech weapons by using its military-industrial complex. Recently China has been found to be receiving various types of high-tech weapons and military technologies from Russia. As a result of the effort to rebuild its backward navy, many foreign observers maintain that the Chinese program for building an "oceangoing navy" is now getting into gear. China contends that its defense modernization is for defensive purposes and it is no match for the United States or Japan. Yet China seems to believe that national strength not backed by military strength is hollow. One should see that behind its naval buildup is its intention to cope with the territorial dispute in the South China Sea on the one hand, and on the other hand to fill the power vacuum created by the U.S. withdrawal from Subic Bay and the weakened strength of the former Soviet Union's Far East Fleet. However, the ultimate goal of China's military buildup policy will be to counter the U.S.- Japan policy of maintaining a military balance in Asia. Speaking of China's waxing economic influence in Asia, China is seeking to form an economic union called "the Zhonghua economic zone" by bringing together overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and ASEAN countries. This raises the possibility that China will face diverse competition with Japan, which seeks to expand its economic influence in the Southeast Asian region. Needless to say, considering the distinct gap between China and Japan in the levels of economic development, capital, and manpower, there will be a complex mixture of competition and cooperation as far as Asia is concerned. Accordingly, China will have no choice but to give weight to its economic cooperation with the ROK for the sake of countering Japan's leading position and for the sake of its own economic development. China is ahead of the ROK in the fields of basic science and technology, but it is trailing the ROK in the commercialization of technologies. That is why China needs the ROK industrial system which has low capital-intensive features. China will also continually desire ROK participation in the economic development of the Chinese northeastern region. Therefore, the ROK should be able to take advantage of these diverse needs of China. There are roughly two points that can be ascertained by the reality in the United States, China, and Japan and through a prognostication of their outlook for the future. One is that China and Japan will be recognized before long as world superpowers in all aspects--diplomatic, economic, and military, if the current pace of development should continue. However, viewed from the pragmatic point of view of forming a new order in Northeast Asia, if Japan and China should seek to gain a superior position against each other or seek regional hegemonism, it would invite direct check intervention by neighboring countries, aggravating the international discord. The other point is that the ROK will be able to play the role of a balancer to maintain the balance of power in Northeast Asia, and by taking advantage of this position, to maximize its practical benefits as an intermediary. Needless to say, this optimistic view is based on the assumption that the relationship between North and South Korea will improve to the extent that the ROK may no longer be fettered by its North Korea policy. This assumption may well become a reality because the current political and economic condition in North Korea and the international environment will compel North Korea to behave reasonably. If the above analysis is acceptable, our foreign policy option should be directed at bringing the Sino-Japanese relationship into our forward-looking strategy. To work out a new "ROK-China-Japan alignment," a shift to a "policy of active involvement" is needed. This is to say that we should do away with the past foreign policy of inviting in foreign powers. The ROK can no longer be content with playing its role as a trumpeter of the U.S.-Asia policy. It should stand in the van of anti-hegemonism as the balancer of power in Northeast Asia. It should play an active role as arbiter of "positive peace" for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia. To play this new role, it is imperative for the ROK to formulate its own foreign policy principles and for our people to have self-pride and stand ready to share as widely as possible whatever short term losses they may incur from abiding by these principles. In international politics in Northeast Asia, the ROK should seek to form the framework of the "ROK-China-Japan triangular alignment" in such a way as to play its role as an arbitrator of international disputes, as a contact point for international interests, and as a mediator of international competition. To this end, our country should forge relationships of unswerving trust with other countries at the leadership and organizational levels. It is essential to pursue many-sided diplomacy by expanding the channels of private-level diplomacy. With Kim Yong-sam's forthcoming visit to China and Japan as momentum, ROK-China and ROK-Japan economic cooperation is expected to accelerate. In the interest of this acceleration, our country is expected to exert efforts to make legal and structural improvements on the administrative level and expand methods of cooperation. On the basis of the successes that will be made in these efforts, the ROK should search for a more farsighted creative framework of economic exchange and mutual cooperation with China and Japan. What we need to do is map out a strategy for making investments in areas where we can exercise definite influence on some sectors of the Chinese and Japanese economies and forge the kind of mutual economic relationship by which we can get a grip on the weak links in the Japanese and Chinese economies, and on the other, to boldly invest our resources for the implementation of this strategy.
