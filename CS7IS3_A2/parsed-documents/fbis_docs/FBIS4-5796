FBIS4-5796 "dreas072_a_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-072 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Differences Over Hosokawa's Successor Continue Differences Over Hosokawa's Successor Continue Miyazawa Faction Supports Kono OW1404125794 Tokyo KYODO in English 1203 GMT 14 Apr 94 OW1404125794 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Yohei Kono will meet Michio Watanabe, an LDP faction leader and former foreign minister, on Friday [15 April] to ask him not to run for the premiership to avoid splitting the largest opposition party, LDP sources said Thursday. Kono will visit the faction office of Watanabe at 4 P.M. [0700 GMT] Friday, they said. Kono vowed Tuesday to run in a prime ministerial election in the Diet for the successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who last Friday announced his resignation. Watanabe is eager to be prime minister and had rejected Kono's request for face-to-face talks. Executive members of his faction met Wednesday and agreed to lobby other LDP members by seeking their signatures endorsing Watanabe as the next premier, faction sources said. Nearly 100 signatures have been collected, a senior faction executive said. Watanabe faction executives affirmed their opinions that the LDP president must not necessarily be the party's candidate for prime minister, and that a government with large alliances of ruling and opposition camps is needed to break through the political turmoil following Hosokawa's announcement, they said. Members of an LDP faction led by former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa agreed Thursday to back Kono as the sole LDP candidate for the premiership, faction sources said. Kono had belonged to the Miyazawa faction until he became LDP president last July. The Miyazawa faction decided to set up an election campaign office for Kono in a Tokyo hotel in case Watanabe does not give up his candidacy and to seek support from other parties' members, the sources said. In three other factions -- led respectively by former Transport Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, former Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi and former State Minister Toshio Komoto -- members generally fear a party split-up and hope Kono and Watanabe will peacefully resolve the candidacy issue through talks, faction sources said. Watanabe emerged earlier this week as a prime ministerial candidate after a feud within the ruling coalition threatened to split the government, weakening the chances of front-runner Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata being named Hosokawa's successor. But on Tuesday, the coalition, which was on the verge of collapse, moved to maintain the current framework of the government, once again strengthening Hata's hand. However, a senior member of Watanabe's faction said there is still hope Watanabe will be named prime minister because the ruling coalition parties have failed to mend wounds within the shaky alliance and band together to support Hata.
