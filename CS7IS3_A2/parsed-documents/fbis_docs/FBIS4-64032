FBIS4-64032 "drsov103_d_94010" FBIS-SOV-94-103 Daily Report 21 May 1994 Regional Affairs Commander's Dismissal `Slap in the Face' to Fleet Commander's Dismissal `Slap in the Face' to Fleet PM2605161994 Moscow Ostankino Television First Channel Network in Russian 1700 GMT 21 May 94 PM2605161994 Moscow Ostankino Television First Channel Network Russian BFN [From the "Novosti" newscast: Video report by Oleg Padenko] [Text] [Padenko] In the old days, when returning from assignments to the correspondent's office in Vladivostok, we would bring back souvenirs such as exotic shells, ornaments, or pictures. Nowadays we bring back mortar fragments like this from the scenes of explosions. Although just this type of souvenir -- an unexploded mortar shell -- nigh on turned the hair of the owner of this kitchen garden in Novonezhino white, while this old woman, Praskovya, who by some miracle avoided being buried alive in her own home, will now, like many others, have to live in another village. [First unidentified speaker] The storage of ammunition in our country just takes the cake. They store matches more carefully around here than they do ammunition. [Second unidentified speaker] The munitions dumps were overfilled with a huge quantity of ammunition brought in from the Baltic region over the last few months, which should have been destroyed over there somewhere. When the first rumblings were heard, I said to myself that I'd bet anything that the entire 53d depot was going up in smoke. [Padenko] The old man was right -- 1,600 tonnes, 800 railcars of lethal weapons exploded, which is equivalent to a nuclear bomb. The tremors resounded across Ussuriysk Bay and were felt in Vladivostok, houses in several villages burned down, and a railroad was destroyed. The memorable munitions explosion of two years ago -- you are watching footages of that disaster here -- was nothing compared to this. Bombs and aviation missiles are still going off at will all over the place for miles around. The whole area has been staked out like a minefield. Unbelievably, but fortunately... [Unidentified speaker] ...there have been no fatalities. Although, taking account of everything, there have been something like 23 casualties. [Padenko] But for the mountains and the speedy evacuation, things could have been a lot worse. What is needed now is help, as the damage runs into tens of billions. But there is no money. Which is probably also the reason why the clearly naive sailors went to the depots and through criminal ignorance started off a small local war. You know, at present the Pacific Fleet is more than 30-percent undermanned. Many of the recent draftees are quite simply useless. And the amount of finance allocated to maintain one of the world's most powerful fleets is laughable -- in May alone just 12 percent of the requirement was forthcoming. But at the same time I must stress, to counterbalance the accusations leveled, that combat readiness has actually increased. Mutual relations have improved, and the fleet's future is looking brighter. Which is why everybody was shocked by the dismissal of Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Gurinov. Officers' assemblies were held in the fleet, and appeals to the Russian president to repeal the dismissal were adopted. [Rear Admiral A.A. Belousov] This is the opinion of officers and instructors at the Pacific Fleet Higher Naval Training School named for Admiral Makarov. It is the view of many Pacific Fleet commanders. And it is the view of many admirals. [Captain First Rank A.I. Gruzdev] If Admiral Gurinov's dismissal from the post of fleet commander is upheld, then the Pacific Fleet personnel will see this as a slap in the face. [Padenko] Harsh words, but true. Meanwhile, Vice Admiral Khmelnov has been appointed acting commander of the Pacific Fleet.
