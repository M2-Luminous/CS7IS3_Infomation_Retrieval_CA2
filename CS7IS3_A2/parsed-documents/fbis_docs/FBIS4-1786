"Wei Jingsheng, during the period of his parole and deprivation of his political rights, has violated the concerned regulations, and the public security organs have the right to investigate him according to the law," the spokesman said. The statement came days after Wei was detained by police while returning to Beijing following a forced exile from the capital, which coincided with a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the meeting of China's National People's Congress. Wei, the godfather of China's pro-democracy movement, was detained in early March after meeting with U.S. Undersecretary of State John Shattuck and expressing his view that the United States should continue to pressure China on human rights issues. The meeting reportedly infuriated China's dictatorial leaders who has viewed Wei as a menace to their authority since he called for greater democracy in the late 1970s. On Saturday, Xinhua News Agency reported that Wei "had a talk" with Beijing police and "left the bureau immediately afterwards," but on Monday the dissident's family and friends had no clue as to his whereabouts and under what pretext he was taken away. Wei was released last September, seven months short of a 15-year term, in what was widely regarded as a cynical human rights gesture aimed at influencing the International Olympic Committee into selecting Beijing as the host for the 2000 Olympic games. His parole was to last until March 29, the original date of his release, while his political rights will continue to be withheld for three years. Since his release, Wei has been hounded by the police and told to refrain from being interviewed by foreign journalists and writing essays for the foreign press. Last year, Wei, who steadfastly maintained his innocence throughout his 15-year ordeal, was a cowinner with Nelson Mandela of the Gleitsman Foundation international activist award.
