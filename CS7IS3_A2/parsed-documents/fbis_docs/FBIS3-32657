The agreement was reached by Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina Idiaquez and General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, commander of the Armed Forces. Gen. Discua Elvir explained that the practice of deploying hundreds of soldiers to the country's urban centers to capture youths and forcibly take them to military units will be suspended. This practice has been constantly criticized by the media, parents, and human rights defenders, who term it kidnapping. The youths were taken to the military units and not given the opportunity to contact their parents about their situation. Military service in Honduras is for a period of two years. Today's agreement states that the practice will be stopped, while a commission of civilians and military personnel will draw up a new plan. Gen. Discua Elvir told a news conference at the Government House that the establishment of the Educational Voluntary Military Service [Servico Military Voluntario Educativo] and the Constitutional Military Service [Servicio Militar Constitucional] has been proposed to President Reina Idiaquez. Neither Discua Elvir nor President Reina told the media what each proposal entails. They said the proposals will be developed by the governmental commission that they appointed. The Honduran president told the news conference that the military sector realized that the forcible enlistment of youths was "negative and harmful to the Armed Forces."
