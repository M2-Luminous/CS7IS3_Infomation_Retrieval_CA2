In a joint press conference following their meeting, both government chiefs underscored the importance of the major political events in their respective countries, the elections and EU membership, and stressed the "excellent" relations between their two countries which they agreed were highlighted by economic and cultural exchanges of "the utmost quality." Premier Ciampi added how Rome and Vienna had consolidated their collaboration not only on a bilateral level, but also on an international one, and reiterated Italy's full support for Austria's membership in the European Union. Looking at the political evolution in Italy, the Austrian chancellor observed how "every nation, from time to time, goes through more or less strong political change" adding how it was the duty of neighboring countries "to take note of the rhythm of this change and draw the consequences for themselves." Vranitzky had words of praise for Premier Ciampi, whom he described as "one of the interpreters and fundamental promoters" of Italy's political and institutional renewal, and that he wished him all his best. Turning their attention to the ex-Yugoslavia, Ciampi said both he and the Austrian chancellor agreed on the need to intensify their common commitment in international forums in the search for a solution. In reference to the ex-Yugoslavia's territorial closeness to both Italy and Austria, the Italian premier stressed how their common frustration for the duration and brutality of the conflict had to be translated into a stimulus for a greater commitment in the search for a solution. Ciampi then went on to deny criticisms that the policy of the European Union towards the ex-Yugoslavia was being carried out on the front line by France, Germany and Britain. Italy, he argued, was on the front line with its participation through the European Union and NATO and its contribution to United Nations' efforts, but as a neighboring country its actions were limited. Nevertheless, Ciampi stressed, this was in no way an apology for the failure, up to now, of the international community to find an effective solution and this has created "a felling of frustration which must be transformed into a motive for greater commitment." For his part, Chancellor Vranitzky voiced Austria's "enormous admiration" for Italy's commitment in the ex-Yugoslavia and expressed his and his nation's condolences for the deaths of the Italian three-man television news teams in Mostar last week.
