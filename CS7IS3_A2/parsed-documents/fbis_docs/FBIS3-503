According to opposition newspapers, the money was distributed by supporters of the presidential group to "buy the consciences" of parliamentarians so as to disrupt deliberations at the HCR-PT and prolong the political impasse in Zaire. On the other hand, the SALONGO daily, close to the former single party, the Popular Movement of the Revolution [MPR], charges that the opposition is distributing $300 per head to "buy votes for Tshisekedi" The HCR-PT has been meeting since 23 January to decide on the accords concluded between the presidential group and the radical opposition to extricate the country from its political and institutional crisis. Deliberations continued in commissions, and then resumed in plenary session on 28 February. Since then the meetings have remained blocked over a disagreement between the presidential group and the radical opposition on the future prime minister. The radical opposition supports Etienne Tshisekedi, elected prime minister by the Sovereign National Conference, but his appointment was later revoked by Marshal Mobutu. The Political Forces of the Conclave (FPC), which is the driving force of the presidential group, wants the new prime minister to be chosen henceforth by the HCR-PT. According to the opposition press, the FPC has been distributing money to encourage an "impasse" in the deliberations of the HCR-TP in order to bring about a new political crisis. Such a situation, according to the opposition, could allow Marshal Mobutu to arbitrarily choose a new prime minister from his camp. This theory is contradicted by circles close to the FPC, which recall that the head of state himself had expressed a wish to see the future prime minister "come from the opposition" and that he has described the Birindwa government as "only a caretaker government." These circles also claim that radical opposition parties "are trying to rally their scattered troops with money to avoid a rout for Tshisekedi."
