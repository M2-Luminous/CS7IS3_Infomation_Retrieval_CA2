Akashi, asked if he would be prepared to reduce the duration of the ceasefire as demanded by the Moslem-led Bosnian government and their Croat allies, answered firmly: "No, I am not." But, he added "our negotiation with both parties separately is proceeding exceedingly well. The atmosphere is businesslike, frank and friendly." The duration of the ceasefire is one of the principle sticking-points in the ceasefire talks which began here Monday between Bosnia's Croats, Moslems and Serbs, UN diplomats said. [passage omitted] Akashi said that although the ceasefire talks were "separate from a political settlement ... of course the two agreements have to be closely linked." Akashi said there were still "a few difficult questions which have to be resolved." But, he added "we will make every effort possible to anchor the agreement by tonight." [passage omitted] Akashi was due to meet the Serb delegation led by Radovan Karadzic Tuesday morning for an hour before joining a meeting between UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and the joint heads of the Bosnian delegation, Kresimir Zubak and Ejup Ganic, around 11:30 a.m. (0930 GMT). "Then we will see the Bosnian side and the Serb side and we will repeat this throughout the day," Akashi said. The UN envoy said he did not envisage the Bosnian and Bosnian Serb delegations would sit at the same negotiating table except "for the signature" of an agreement.
