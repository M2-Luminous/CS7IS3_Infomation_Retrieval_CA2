Now he has returned to the director's chair. [Bondarenko] Did you not quit the institute during your time in the government? [Gaydar] No, I left these walls temporarily, although I maintained many links with the institute. [Bondarenko] Clearly it is dear to you personally. [Gaydar] Of course, because the institute represents a community of skilled specialists. Many of them think as I do. On the whole this is a viable scientific collective. [Bondarenko] Would you say that this is your scientific school? [Gaydar] I would not put it that way. It is more a question of a group of economists who came with me to carry out reforms. [Bondarenko] As I understand it, whatever the situation, you intend to use the institute to advance the reforms which have begun? [Gaydar] In any event we shall try to do everything in our power to give a precise analysis of what is going on, to express our views on what is being done right and what is being done wrongly, and to submit our own proposals. [Bondarenko] On the matter of analyses, incidentally, what is your assessment of the country's socioeconomic situation at the present time? [Gaydar] It is characterized by a considerable instability. The most serious problem, in my view, is the lack of determination on the part of the organs of power to continue to implement the economic course adopted. We have already seen how in the period between 1989 and 1991 an ominous situation developed in which the old system of economic management had already outlived itself but the union authorities could not make up their minds to embark on a new one. Consequently the most urgent question today remains that of stepping up the dynamic transformations so as to more quickly organize the kind of integrated life-support system for the country which would be based on market relationships, private ownership, and civil law. In my view, things began to go wrong at the start of 1993, when the rate at which outmoded economic structures were being dismantled slowed considerably. That is why the former sources of financial receipts rapidly ran dry, while the proper preconditions for new sources were simply not created. [Bondarenko] How long can this uncertainty go on? [Gaydar] World experience suggests, unfortunately, that there is certainly no definite time limit. For example, there is a whole series of states which, like Russia, have moved away from socialist methods of economic management but have not been able to find within themselves the strength to carry the reforms they have begun through to their logical conclusion. Although, it is true, some countries can already boast of successes. [Bondarenko] In your opinion, which countries have been successful? [Gaydar] Well, first of all I would name Poland. You will recall how back in the late eighties it had far more appalling indicators of declining output volume than, for instance, Romania, which was not very prosperous at that time either. But whereas Bucharest is still unable to cope with such a decline, Warsaw has managed to improve the situation for three years now and has recently achieved tangible and stable growth of the national economy. [Bondarenko] Nevertheless, in Poland they also change the composition of the government quite often, the country is periodically shaken by strikes, and there are demonstrations of discontent. [Gaydar] All of this merely demonstrates one thing: The process of the transition to the market is bound to have problems by virtue of its complexity and extraordinary nature. Thus even when its implementation is generally successful, a temporary socioeconomic tension is always bound to occur. In addition to Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary have also been coping with the reforms quite well. [Bondarenko] How, then, do you explain the undoubted economic successes of such recently poor countries as China and Vietnam, even though the regimes there are still authoritarian and they still have party general secretaries as leaders? [Gaydar] It is simply that in those countries we see an example of economies which are only just becoming industrialized. In that sense the states you mention are comparable more with the Russia of the NEP period and the subsequent industrialization. In China and Vietnam a large part of the population is still employed in the agrarian sector. Thus the potential for the redistribution of labor resources to industry is still huge there. So comparing their situation with the present situation in Russia is unacceptable, in my view. Especially since the level of poverty in those countries and in ours still does not favor them. The question here is more one of whether it is possible in industrialized postsocialist countries to make the transition from the plan to the civilized market gently and painlessly. At the present time we have approximately 23 states, including the former republics of the USSR, which made the transition between systems between 1989 and 1994. Their experience suggests that the attempts to implement the reform slowly and in small steps, with one eye on the past, without counting the cost, and retaining state monopoly of the management of the economy entails the most catastrophic failures. The closest example of that is provided by Ukraine, with its policy of rock-bottom prices. Nevertheless, that is effectively what the leaders of Civic Union, the communists, and the agrarian-industrial factions in parliament are urging us to do. For my own part I drew the conclusion long ago that indecision during the transition to fundamentally different forms of economic management is the worst sin. [Bondarenko] Are there significant differences between Zhirinovskiy's econonmic program and what is offered by, say, the communists and agrarians? [Gaydar] Zhirinovskiy has no economic program at all. How can you describe a great mass of empty promises as an economic program? [Bondarenko] Yegor Timurovich, is there anything for you to criticize yourself for during your tenure as head of the government? [Gaydar] That is inevitable. First, for not doing enough to explain our work. Furthermore, we did not do enough to create a theoretical base to ensure the irreversibility of the reforms. [Bondarenko] I can somehow understand the rejection of your program by the venerable academics whom Konstantin Borovoy called, aptly I think, the pensioners of perestroyka. However, how do you explain the fact that you were and still are sharply criticized by those who would seem to be your potential supporters, people of undoubted democratic convictions and, furthermore, your coevals. I have in mind Grigoriy Yavlinskiy and Larisa Piyasheva. Would it not be better to win them over to your side and include them in the government rather than simply leaving them among your opponents? Because, it seems to me, many people are confused and cannot make up their minds which of you they ought to trust. [Gaydar] I would gladly take Grigoriy Alekseyevich into my team, but I fear he would not accept. [Bondarenko] Did you sit down with them at the same table, counter their objections, and come to some kind of consensus? [Gaydar] I have spoken with Yavlinskiy many times. And I was convinced that we do not have as many substantial differences of opinion as we may seem to have to outsiders. The only problem is that our views do not coincide on certain practical steps in the implementation of the reforms. [Bondarenko] What about Larisa Ivanovna? [Gaydar] To be honest I have not had the occasion to meet with her. I do know, however, that Anatoliy Chubays has had a thorough discussion with her on the problems of privatization. As is well known, Piyasheva was the initiator of the so-called wholesale privatization carried out in Moscow. As a result the majority of the capital's stores passed virtually for nothing into the hands of the sales staff alone, which had dire consequences for the efficiency of the trade sector. [Bondarenko] You will remember that when you were premier many business people explained their exclusively commercial activities by saying that excessive taxation simply does not allow them to invest resources in production. [Gaydar] On the whole I agree with such assertions. Taxes in our country are indeed high. Thus their gradual reduction is, generally speaking, our state's strategic task. [Bondarenko] But was it impossible to act differently before? [Gaydar] Bear in mind that taxes are set in such a way as to cover state expenditure. At present state expenditure is so high that it does not allow enterprise to develop normally in this country. We in the government sought to create the preconditions for the gradual lowering of expenditure, to which end it was proposed to reduce appropriations for defense, cut subsidies on imports and in the national economy in general, and abandon preferential credit issue and everything else which has an adverse effect on the level of taxation. But strange as it may seem, it was for steps such as those that we were criticized most. [Bondarenko] After the collapse of the USSR, the great many union departments, ministries, and party committees at various levels were scrapped, of course. As a result, in Moscow alone a mass of official buildings were due to be vacated. But what has happened in practice is that there is a chronic shortage of them. Does this mean that the administrative apparatus has not only not been reduced since then, which could logically have been expected, but on the contrary has grown even larger? [Gaydar] I must object straight away that a considerable part of the premises are actually not now occupied by administrative organs but are leased by commercial structures. As for the former union sectoral ministries, they have virtually all been transformed into concerns without changing addresses. Nevertheless, I do not deny that the old managers were able to adapt very quickly to the present economic conditions. Both because of the inconsistency of the reforms and the fact that the most important levers of individual control held by functionaries were not dismantled, with the latter managing to a considerable extent to seize real power at a new level. You have deprived us of the opportunity of allocating funds and setting limits, they say, so we will distribute quotas and preferential credits just as successfully. [Bondarenko] Your opponents claim that relative financial stabilization has largely been secured by artificial means. They cite the chronic holdups with wage payments, the state's tremendous internal debts, irritating problems with mutual nonpayments, and much else besides. They even predict that one fine day it may all burst like a soap bubble and total collapse will, they say, hit the economy. [Gaydar] I agree with one point you made. The excessive financial promises made a year ago have caused a very severe financial crisis which is still having a very painful effect on the Russian economy. Because nonpayments and underfunding of state spending have regrettably become a regular phenomenon. Hence the endless complaints from all quarters. Thus, the gap between financial commitments and real potential has proved an extremely unpleasant fact of life, the result of ill-conceived government decisions. This must of course be taken into consideration and our work must be geared to this. Nevertheless, amid these unfavorable conditions we have nonetheless been able to drive the rate of inflation down from 26 percent last August to 21 percent in September, 16 percent in November, and end the year on 13 percent. We brought about the marked improvement in the picture not by reducing current state funding but by cutting back excessive state commitments. [Bondarenko] Do you not think that the dictatorship of the proletariat which the Bolsheviks discussed at such length is today manifesting itself more perceptibly than ever? You only have to compare the wages of a professor at a higher educational establishment and a miner. [Gaydar] As for miners' wages they are by and large not as high as they were in the former Soviet Union, say. At the same time there are many industrial sectors where the pay is extremely miserly. However, I do agree with you on another point. The income of representatives of fundamental science, culture, and education has of course suffered the most. This abnormal situation has arisen in my view because the above spheres of intellectual labor had the least protection in the face of the powerful lobbying done by various sectors of the economy. People must clearly realize that every extra ruble they get for themselves ultimately means one ruble less to fund the social sphere. [Bondarenko] It is no secret that the government did not pay peasants on time for last year's harvest. It is only now that the agrarian sector is being allocated a sum running into trillions. Fears are being voiced that this money will once again go down the drain. Yet at the same time, something must be done about the debts. What do you see as the best solution? [Gaydar] This question must be divided into two parts. The ordered grain must of course be paid for. But at the same time we must also see the root of the current nonpayments crisis. I repeat, the government has taken on a financial burden that is totally beyond its capabilities. In 1993 decisions were promulgated regarding the retention of the state order for food, major federal investment programs, and high -- and, what is more, indexed -- purchase prices for the harvest, whereby the government drove itself into a corner. [Bondarenko] Shouldn't the unfavorable consequences of these measures have been foreseen straightaway? [Gaydar] They were quite obvious even then. A very serious mistake was made, let me tell you. [Bondarenko] But why? [Gaydar] Because there is a tremendous temptation not to take money seriously. Especially if you can avoid paying today and leave it until a few months later. Because current funds and what are still only proposed funds are quite different things: You are very conscious of the former, but the latter are just a hope of better things to come. Especially when you are coming under pressure from all sides, beset by demands or even threats. Take the agrarians. They simply implored us: Just make us a promise and it will all work out all right. Nevertheless everything ultimately has to be paid for and, regrettably, at a very high price. What do I see as a reasonable solution? Once you make promises, you must carry them out like it or not. But you must think twice before venturing to make any promises. And agriculture is by no means the exception here. [Bondarenko] In the light of what we have said, how do you see the country's economy developing by the end of the year? [Gaydar] Two scenarios are likely. One presupposes that the government will nonetheless be able to keep some control of the situation and not take the stupid actions that it is vigorously being pressed to take. Let us hope the authorities will not fling credit around all over the place. Although even in that situation the Cabinet of Ministers will be forced to work under serious pressure. Because in my view inflation will remain fairly high until the end of the year, fluctuating between 15-20 percent a month. In any case, I do not see any real chance of an appreciable fall in this indicator. This means that we should not expect major private capital investment, nor will the preconditions for economic growth emerge. But at the same time this does not mean inevitable collapse. The second scenario is far less favorable. If the government succumbs to the lobbyists' demands, it will have to considerably increase the growth of the money supply. And, faced with the subsequent rapid price rise, the authorities will end up having to introduce a fixed ruble rate of exchange and establish tough price controls. As a result we will once again be faced with commodity shortages, loss of ruble convertibility, and, ultimately, the end of the reforms. [Bondarenko] In your view, what should the center's regional policy be? [Gaydar] It should of course be based on the principles of normal federalism, which presuppose the clear-cut distribution of sources of income for the federal and local budgets. The republics, krays, and oblasts must be able to use their own financial resources independently. They must be given extensive powers in the field of economic activity on the territory under their jurisdiction. Nevertheless, federal bodies must effectively monitor the unity of the Russia-wide market and regulate foreign economic ties. [Bondarenko] We are coming up to new elections to local bodies of power. Not-unfounded fears are being voiced that the communists and similar forces may quite easily take their revenge during these elections. And once they have consolidated their position at the helm in the regions, they would wage a more decisive offensive on the center. I would like to know what you think about this. [Gaydar] The situation is indeed a difficult one. That is why we have tried to create more organized and competent managerial organs in the regions that would not subsequently repeat the vexing mistakes of the past. I believe the results of the coming elections will be like the previous ones, extremely differentiated. We do know, after all, that the December elections to the Moscow Duma brought success for the democrats. I am hoping for a similar result in other major centers. Nevertheless it is too early to predict the outcome of the campaign in many regions. [Bondarenko] I realize that both the "Russia's Choice" movement you lead and the president need one another's support. Nevertheless, a perceptible distance between them has been felt just recently. Is that due to tactical considerations, or is the problem more serious? [Gaydar] I must state unequivocally that we still support Boris Nikolayevich and he us. The fact that, as head of state elected by the whole people, B.N. Yeltsin must consider various factors and cooperate with a broad spectrum of political forces, is another matter. It is no secret, however, that we by no means always agree with the decisions taken within the president's entourage. [Bondarenko] Can "Russia's Choice," in view of the size of its deputy faction, use the State Duma not only as a platform to propagandize its ideas but also to put them into effect? [Gaydar] I admit this is difficult. We do not after all have a parliamentary majority, but nonetheless we are not abandoning our attempts to achieve our aims. For instance, we have just been able to make substantial amendments to the new Criminal Code. There are also other draft legislative acts that we intend to promote with the support of other factions. [Bondarenko] How strict is internal discipline within your faction? Are deserters threatened with exclusion from the list of deputies? [Gaydar] We give our deputies fairly broad autonomy. We even agreed to two of them switching to other factions, although that was indeed only their own wish. I am very surprised by the press speculation regarding the alleged crisis or even split in our bloc. On the contrary, "Russia's Choice" now seems to me to be the most disciplined faction -- and the most solid faction in light of the results of voting in the Duma, since the other democratic factions cannot compete with it. Nevertheless I do not rule out the idea that in time one or two people may break away from us. However, the express desire of representatives of other parties and independent deputies to cooperate with "Russia's Choice" easily makes up for these losses. [Bondarenko] How did parliamentarians react to your intention of creating a party of the same name on the basis of the election campaign movement? [Gaydar] You know, to my amazement this idea met with extremely broad support from democratic factions. Even those colleagues who were previously seen to waver are vigorously joining in the work of organizing the new political party, whose task is to act as a stable base for implementing socioeconomic transformations. [Bondarenko] Which factions do you rank among your closest allies in the Duma? [Gaydar] Based on the results of the voting, the "12 December" deputy group is very close to us. They are followed by the Party of Russian Union and Accord and the "Boldyrev-Yavlinskiy-Lukin" faction. [Bondarenko] How likely is the possibility of a broad union of democratic forces in the near future? [Gaydar] We have always been and will remain in favor of that. So, it is up to the other members of the democratic movement.
