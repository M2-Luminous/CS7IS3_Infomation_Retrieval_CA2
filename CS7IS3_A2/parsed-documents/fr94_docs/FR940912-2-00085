FR940912-2-00085 FR940912-2-00056 Attachment A_Notice of Divestiture and Requirement for Confidentiality Roche Holding Ltd (``Roche'') and Syntex Corporation (``Syntex'') have entered into a Consent Agreement and Agreement to Hold Separate with the Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') relating to the divestiture of the Syva Business. Until after the Commission's Order becomes final and the Syva Business is divested, the Syva Business must be managed and maintained as a separate, ongoing business, independent of all other Roche businesses and independent of the Roche drugs of abuse business. All competitive information relating to the Syva Business, including without limitation the drugs of abuse business, must be retained and maintained by the persons involved in the Syva Business on a confidential basis and such persons shall be prohibited from providing, discussing, exchanging, circulating, or otherwise furnishing any such information to or with any other person whose employment involves any other Roche business, including the drugs of abuse business, therapeutic drug monitoring business and the Roche Biomedical Laboratories business. Similarly, all such persons involve in the Roche therapeutic drug monitoring business, drugs of abuse business and the Roche Biomedical Laboratories shall be prohibited from providing, discussing, exchanging, circulating or otherwise furnishing competitive information about such business to or with any person whose employment involves the Syva Business. Any violation of the Consent Agreement or the Agreement to Hold Separate, incorporated by reference as part of the Consent Order, may subject Roche and Syntex to civil penalties and other relief as provided by law. Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted provisionally an agreement containing a proposed consent order from Roche Holding Ltd (``Roche''), under which Roche would be required to divest the assets relating to Syntex Corporation's drugs of abuse reagent business (``Syva Business''). The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received, and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed Order. In a proposed tender offer, Roche plans to acquire 100% of the voting securities of Syntex Corporation and merge Syntex into Roche. The proposed complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would constitute a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. section 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. section 45, in the market for drugs of abuse reagent products. The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation by replacing the lost competition that would result from the acquisition. The proposed Consent Order provides that Roche shall divest the Syva Business within twelve (12) months from when the Order becomes final. If Roche is unable to divest the Syva Business during the allotted time period, then a trustee may be appointed to divest the Syva Business within a twelve (12) month period. If, at the end of the twelve month period, the trustee has submitted a plan of divestiture or believes that divestiture can be achieved within a reasonable time, the time period for divestiture can be extended by the Commission, or, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court. The Commission, however, may extend this period only two (2) times. A Hold Separate Agreement signed by Roche provides that during any period in which Roche possesses an ownership interest in the Syva Business, these assets will be operated independently of Roche. Under the provisions of the Order, Roche is also required to provide to the Commission a report of compliance with the divestiture provisions of the Order within sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes final, and every sixty (60) days thereafter until Roche has completely divested its interest in the Syva Business. The Order also prohibits Roche from acquiring any interest in any other company that sells drugs of abuse reagent products without prior approval from the Commission for a ten-year period. The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.
