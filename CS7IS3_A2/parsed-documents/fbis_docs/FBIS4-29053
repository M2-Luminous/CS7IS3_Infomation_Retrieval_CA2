The three are among the 26 Chinese minors who fled the bureau en masse, of whom a total of 22 have been recaptured, police said. The 26, including two girls, were taken into custody on may 18 after they were found hiding in a warehouse in Fukuoka, western Japan, with more than 100 adult Chinese, who were all arrested on suspicion of illegally entering Japan. The immigration officials also found 22,000 yen in cash hidden in a cigarette box left on a shelf in one of the detention center rooms. The officials suspect the money is what is left of the 30,000 yen which one of the Chinese took when fleeing the center. A senior immigration official earlier said the escape began Sunday evening when one of the Chinese asked for hot water. When a bureau official opened the door, 10 Chinese minors jumped on him and two other immigration officials, handcuffed them and stole about 30,000 yen from a drawer before escaping, the official said.
