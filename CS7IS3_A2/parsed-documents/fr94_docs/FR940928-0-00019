FR940928-0-00019 FR940928-0-00005 7 CFR Part 1036 [DA&hyph;94&hyph;20] Milk in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania Marketing Area; Temporary Revision of Rule AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Temporary revision of rule. SUMMARY: This document temporarily revises the supply plant shipping standards under the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania Federal milk order (Order 36) for the months of September 1994 through February 1995. Required shipping percentages for pool supply plants are reduced by 10 percentage points for each of the affected months. This action is necessary to prevent the uneconomic and inefficient movements of milk to qualify plants for pooling. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 1, 1994, through February 28, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Constance M. Brenner, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 720&hyph;2357. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Prior document in this proceeding: Notice of Proposed Temporary Revision: Issued August 22, 1994; published August 26, 1994 (59 FR 44088). The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. This temporary revision is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the provisions of ยง1036.7(f) of the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania order. Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 44088) concerning a proposed temporary relaxation of the supply plant shipping standards under the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania milk order. The revisions were proposed to be effective for the months of September 1, 1994, through February 28, 1995. The public was afforded the opportunity to comment on the proposed notice by submitting written data, views and arguments by September 2, 1994. One comment supporting the proposed revision was received. No opposing comments were received.
