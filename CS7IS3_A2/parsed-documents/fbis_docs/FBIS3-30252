This was communicated to NOVY CAS daily by Karol Dropa, deputy head of department of special production at the Slovak Ministry of Economy. The essence of this export, in his view, was only one contract--namely, the export of tanks to Syria. For the sake of comparison, the daily says that last year the Czech Republic exported military equipment and materials worth approximately $167 million, which is $17 million more than similar exports in 1992 by the former federation.
