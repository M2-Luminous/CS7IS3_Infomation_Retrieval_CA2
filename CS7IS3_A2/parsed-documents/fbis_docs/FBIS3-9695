The replacement of Janez Jansa with Jelko Kacin, former Democratic information minister and, before that, Jansa's deputy in what was then the Secretariat for Peoples' Defense, thus marked the political spring that could quickly turn into a political winter. We can merely guess what tilted the scales against the defense minister. However, it seems that, this time, the prime minister did not find a magic formula with which he could at least partially satisfy the main protagonist of this -- as we have subsequently learned -- criminal game. Besides Jansa, it also involved Christian Democratic [SKD] Interior Minister Ivan Bizjak, and primarily President Milan Kucan, the likely mastermind of the entire game, who was also instrumental in the downing of Peterle. Let us just recall Kucan's carefully chosen, ominous words about disqualifications and liquidations after the organization that is supposedly backed by Kucan's circle realized that the Defense Ministry had established the presence of its agents, even though it did not identify them yet. We would be naive to think that Drnovsek decided for the replacement (only) because of the overstepping of their authority by the defense ministry employees and the violation of constitutionally guaranteed human rights. These were precisely the arguments that a part of the former committee for the protection of human rights put to him. The foundation stone for the replacement was laid when the Democrats abandoned their several-months-old pro-Demos policy and, together with some political organizations, finally cut back on the defense funds. By joining the Liberal Democratic Party, they covered their backs in the face of an increasingly unfavorable outcome of the [Maribor] arms' affair, whose main protagonists they were. The interior minister of that time, Igor Bavcar, and the director of VIS [Security-Information Service] Dr. Miha Brejc (as the latest testimonies and the Maribor public prosecutor's indictment suggest) with the cooperation of the president of the state arbitrarily and independently of the Defense Council and the Defense Ministry, which is authorized to issue permits for the transit of arms, brought arms for Hasan Cengic to Maribor airport. And how did the Christian Democrats, who will now be the only "right-wing" party in the government, decide? It is not very likely that the Social Democrats will stay in the government -- despite Drnovsek's offer -- and accept another ministerial post. This was implied by Jansa's clear warning to Drnovsek immediately after the prime minister's decision was announced to the public. The stance of the Christian Democrats was not decisive enough. Their public statement demonstrated that -- despite the demands for an investigation with clear results -- they allowed Drnovsek to have a free hand. They only added a warning that -- if the investigation shows so -- the president of the state should also resign. However, how the investigation will continue without Jansa is quite another matter.
