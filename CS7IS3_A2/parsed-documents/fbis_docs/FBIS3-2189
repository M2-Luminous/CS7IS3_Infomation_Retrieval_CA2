Delivering his 1994/95 budget in the Legislative Council, MacLeod said that through serving and investing in the mainland, Hong Kong continued to find new markets for its expertise in manufacturing, marketing, banking, communications, tourism and professional services. He said the mainland accounted for 35 percent of Hong Kong's total external trade in 1993 while the territory constituted about two thirds of total external investment in the mainland, which is probably the largest external investor in Hong Kong. MacLeod said Hong Kong residents made no less than 23 million visits to the mainland last year while nearly two million foreign visitors used Hong Kong as their gateway to the mainland. In addition to the 34,000 flights Hong Kong handled to and from the mainland, there were 7.4 million road crossings by cars and lorries. MacLeod claimed that last year was the 27th successive year in which Hong Kong's [HK] economy grew in real terms since 1966 and the GDP [gross domestic product] per head had more than trebled in real terms since 1970. A surplus of 15.1 billion HK dollars (about 1.9 billion U.S. dollars) was expected for 1993/94 and reserves on March 31, 1994 were expected to total 136.1 billion (about 17.45 billion U.S. dollars), he said. "This is an improvement in our finances of 18.5 billion (about 2.37 billion U.S. dollars), an improvement due for the most part to a growth in revenue well above what had been forecast," he added.
