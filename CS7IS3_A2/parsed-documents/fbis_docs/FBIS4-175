The report said that British Airways was preparing to divert flights to Johannesburg and Cape Town if violence in the townships spread to the white community. One million three hundred thousand whites hold dual South African-British citizenship, but it is reported that priority in such an evacuation will be given to those whose sole nationality is British. Last week reports from Lisbon said that the Portuguese government had plans for the evacuation of about 600,000 Portuguese nationals from South Africa if necessary.
