This means that 15 of the 29 chapters have now been ticked off. The major part of the remaining issues is to reach the agreement stage by the beginning of February. This means that from next week on, the accession locomotive will be running at full blast. Chancellor Franz Vranitzky stressed the "enormous importance" of his visit to Greece, which currently holds the EU Presidency. The "big chunks" -- agriculture, transit, and second homes -- will become central issues. The Social Democratic Party's foreign policy spokesman, Peter Schieder, told DER STANDARD: "We will find a solution to all of these issues." Vienna is preparing for the following compromise solutions: transit agreement to run throughout its envisaged period but including East European and domestic transport; domestic and foreign transport to be treated equally; no "sensitive regions" but nationwide applicability; increasing weight limit from 38 to 40 tonnes. For agriculture and second homes, transition periods of four to five years are envisaged. The talks on foreign trade policy were slowed down by Austria during Friday's negotiations. As Austria sees its brown coal mining endangered by imports from East Europe, it aims at a five-year transition period, which has been rejected so far by Brussels on the grounds of EU antidumping regulations. The chapter on customs union has also been completed apart from expiration dates on Austrian forms. The customs union will do away with country of origin regulations, which have been a great problem to Austrian exporters and have obstructed across-the-border processing. In Brussels, a new working group has started formulating the first final agreements in order to avoid bottlenecks later on.
