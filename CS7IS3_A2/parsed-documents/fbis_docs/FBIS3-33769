The interior minister said that Egypt knows the identities of the countries that finance the terrorists but does not want to reveal them so that the terrorists who are there now will not escape. Maj. Gen. al-Alfi stressed that the police are taking the initiative rather than reacting to operations and are aborting them before they can occur. He said the police have succeeded fully in this task and that a new attempt to assassinate certain public figures was uncovered and the criminal culprits were arrested and referred to the Prosecutor's Office. He explained that no public announcements will be made on this issue until the trial begins.

The individuals involved were arrested. The interior minister said the police have been equipped with modern equipment and that they depend on scientific planning, sophisticated technology, and modern weapons.
