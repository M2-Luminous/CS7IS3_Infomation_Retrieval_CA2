Local officials, contacted by telephone, said all measures had been taken to destroy the levy at Foshan, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Guangzhou city, if flood waters continued to rise. "If the flood waters rise by another 30 centimeters (one foot), then we will have to sacrifice part of Foshan," one official told AFP. Threatened downriver were Guangzhou, the provincial capital which has been on full flood alert since Saturday, and the Pearl River delta, which is home to China's largest concentration of foreign investment. Hong Kong newspapers called the floods -- triggered by successive days of torrential rains which persisted Monday -- the worst in 50 years, claiming more than 200 lives in various areas by official count. The crisis disrupted what was supposed to have been a triumphant inspection tour of the province by China's president and communist party leader Jiang Zemin, the EASTERN EXPRESS newspaper said. Jiang arrived Sunday in Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong, only to spend his first hours visiting some of the 160 injured in Friday's collapse of a fire-gutted textile mill in another city, Zhuhai, that left 24 dead. The Guangdong official, who asked not to be named, said the demolition of the levy had been approved by the central government in Beijing, which has called for all efforts to protect China's richest province. Blowing up the levy would put a vast area of lush farmland underwater, but reduce the threat of floods wreaking greater damage downriver. Flood waters had already submerged several counties around Sanshui city, upriver from Foshan, where the North and East rivers join to become part of the Pearl River delta, which flows into the South China Sea. Late Sunday, flood waters in Sanshui had risen to 12.34 meters (40 feet) or nine meters (30 feet) above the warning level. In nearby Zhaoqing, the North River had jumped its banks, rising 13.53 meters (44 feet) or 4.53 meters (15 feet) above the warning point. Tens of thousands of Foshan residents were evacuated to Guangzhou, residents said, while in the provincial capital itself 500,000 people -- half of them from the Army -- had been mobilized to fight the floods. In Guangzhou, shops and factories along the river banks set up walls of sandbags and moved equipment to higher ground, residents said. Provincial authorities meanwhile banned increases in staple-food prices, with immediate fines for anyone caught profiteering from the flood.
