FR940902-2-00017 FR940902-2-00014 Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI); Organization, Functions, and Authority Delegations AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Extension of closing date notice to solicit public comments. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice of extension of closing date is to allow the public_particularly school officials, teachers, and college and university faculty_additional time to prepare and submit their comments. Many of these educators only very recently became aware of the notice and will not be able to meet the September 6, 1994 deadline. Also, many other potential commenters have been away from work during the comment period (summer months) and have neither received nor been given information on the public notice. An extension of the comment period will permit many more educators and other interested parties to submit comments and recommendations. DATES: The revised deadline for receipt of comments on implementing the ``Educational Research, Development, Dissemination, and Improvement Act of 1994'' is November 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments responding to the July 7 Federal Register notice should be addressed to Dr. Laurence Peters, U.S. Department of Education, 555 New Jersey Avenue, NW., room 600, Washington, DC 20208&hyph;5530. Comments may also be sent to the Department of Education at the Internet electronic mail address: reauth-comments@inet.ed.gov.

Comments will be used to help the Assistant Secretary plan for the reorganization of OERI and the activities it will carry out, as well as establish, in collaboration with the National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board, priorities for OERI's future work.
