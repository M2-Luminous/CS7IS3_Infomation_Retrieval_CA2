Because of this appalling poverty, the royal government cannot escape criticism that it has been squandering the national budget on certain superfluous enterprises that do not benefit either national reconstruction or national defense, but is spent on extravagant entertainment. His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman of the Kingdom of Cambodia recently expressed a strong opinion about this. In a message to the heads of the royal government earlier this week, the king appealed for an austerity program to be observed by Cambodia. It can be understood easily that the austerity program urged by the king is a program of thrift and frugality in the face of the reckless, unnecessary spending currently seen by impoverished Cambodia. Of course, some would say that "thrift and frugality" are preached especially by communists. The truth, however, is that thrift and frugality in general belong to the most elementary economic concept that everybody, whether he is red, blue, or pink, must espouse. Through his initiative, the king of Cambodia has forced the royal government to realize that Cambodia, which is strapped with serious budget constraints, must cut spending on costly decorations and entertainment from all public ceremonies, a step seen as part of the "austerity" program. The king pointed out that the royal government should stop such activities as fireworks displays, conducting parades and processions, and holding beauty contests. These events were especially brazen during the celebration of the latest Cambodian traditional new year. While suggesting that there should not be parades, processions, floats, and fireworks during independence day celebrations, the king proposed that a traditional dance show and just one or two musical bands would suffice for public entertainment. Besides, the king also suggested that the number of delegations abroad and the length of their stay in each foreign country should also be limited to the minimum. It is true that "the people will surely be pleased with this kind of austerity program." However, the royal government must not consider only the belt-tightening measures initiated by the king. It must work out its own austerity policy. In the current situation in which poverty is widespread, the royal government must never allow its ministers to remain extravagant. Or does it wish to preserve a tradition of extreme lavishness with each minister being accorded a monthly telephone bill of over $10,000; electricity consumption of 30,000 to 40,000 kilowatt-hours; and two, three, or even four official cars at his disposal?
