The Council of Ministers assessed Butrus-Ghali's report during its meeting today. The statement issued after the meeting states that the Council of Ministers share President Rauf Denktas' views concerning the report and sincerely hopes a realistic and viable solution acceptable to both sides will be reached in Cyprus. Noting that the secretary general's Cyprus report makes it harder to reach an agreement on the CBM's as well as making it harder for an atmosphere of trust to be established between the two communities, the statement points out that the Greek Cypriot position is presented as that of the United Nations. The statement further remarks that the report is written in a manner which condemns the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' [TRNC] position inspite of the TRNC's show of goodwill and constructive stand. The statement notes that the Council of Ministers believes that approaches of this kind -- be it in the form of CBM's or be it in the form of a comprehensive agreement -- will not achieve a solution and continues: Undoubtedly, no solutions can be reached when views, acceptable to one side on condition and not even approved by the other side, are coerced to one of the sides. It was also stressed in the statement that Denktas supports and endorses the favorable and constructive views he communicated to Gustave Feissel, UN secretary general's deputy special envoy in Cyprus, yesterday.
