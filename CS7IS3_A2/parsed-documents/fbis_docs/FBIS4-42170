What relevance does one have to the other? [Major] D-Day launched the liberation of a Europe that has twice this century been the catalyst for world war in which millions were killed. The advent of Europe over the past 40-odd years has meant it is inconceivable that there could be a war started in West Europe. Their interests, their trade, are now so interlinked that the prospect of a war among them is quite impossible. So the first thing Europe has done is to give us 50 years of peace. The second thing it has done is spread democracy. Portugal and Spain were run by dictatorships not all that many years ago and now they are both mature democracies. I want to see the widening of the Community for several reasons. It will extend democracy, it will make Europe a better and safer place to live. That is one very direct lesson for D-Day. [Buckland] How does this affect the European elections? [Major] It is a long time since there has been such a sharp difference in European policy between that of the Conservatives and the Labour and Liberal Parties. They are more inclined towards a centralist, federalist Europe that we do not favour. We are very much in favour of a deregulated, decentralised Europe. We want to cut down on expenditure they will increase the level. We want to retain Britain's veto. They -- in the case of the Liberals quite clearly and in the case of Labour by subterfuge -- wish to diminish or wreck entirely the national veto. I don't believe their policies are remotely acceptable to the British people and that is why they are determined to fight this election on anything other than European policies. They want to treat British voters as though they were not entitled to a mature debate on Europe. We are not going to accept that. We are going to set out our vision of Europe in the future and expose the policies that they are trying to hide. [Buckland] But it appears that some people want to vote on the Governments record, not on Europe. [Major] I don't think people have appreciated the importance of stopping the sort of policies that activate Labour and the Liberals. The British instinct on Europe is that they recognise that our interests lie there. They want Europe to be a success. They realise it is economically important for us but they are very worried about two things. They believe Europe may be dragging us in a direction we don't wish to go and they can see that all across the European Union [EU] the people of Europe have lost affection for the way in which it has been developing. These are vitally important issues that need to be discussed in this election. [Buckland] Generally voters only get a chance once every five years to exercise their democratic rights. Can you blame them for using this chance to send the Government a message? [Major] No politician should blame the electorate -- they have a sovereign right to vote as they wish. I would simply say that we have to persuade them these elections are important. Europe has been the poison in the well of British politics for a very long time. It would be a very great oddity if having aroused all those emotions people would then be persuaded to vote on matters quite unrelated to Europe. [Buckland] Do you think it is time to rein in the powers of the Commission in Brussels to make them more like the unelected civil servants they are? [Major] Yes. I think they need controlling by the European Council, the elected ministers of all the European nations. [Buckland] What about the veto? [Major] We have to cut down the amount of legislation, we have to deregulate and we have to pass more powers back to the individual states of Europe. I believe the people of this country and across Europe will be much more settled when they are satisfied that Europe is not going to interfere with their culture and traditlons. I don't believe it will in the way people fear, but it must be clear to the people before the Union regains the popularity it once had. If we didn't have a veto on foreign policy that would mean that the EU could decide our policy on Hong Kong as far as China is concerned. That has nothing to do with the Belgians and the Greeks and Dutch, friends though they may be. And if we had not had the veto we would have lost the rebate Lady Thatcher fought for in the 1980s. That is worth 3 billion pounds a year to the taxpayer. [Buckland] Do you expect to see a single European currency in your lifetime? [Major] I plan to live a very long time. I do not see a single currency for a very long time. I'm not sure it will happen. [Buckland] The next Inter-Governmental Conference is in 1996. If there are changes in Europe of the magnitude of Maastricht surely the argument for a referendum is unanswerable -- if only for domestic political reasons. After all you will then be approaching a General Election and won't want the Tories divided on what may have been agreed. [Major] If I think there is a deal that is not in the interests of this country I won't accept it. If I think there is, I shall put it to Parliament and expect support. I don't believe anv issues suitable for a referendum are likely to emerge. Why We're Right Back on Track There is no gain without pain, John Major once told the nation. And his party is still suffering because of the voters' perception of the state of the economy. Here he explains his hopes for economic recovery turning the political tide. [Buckland] Why is it taking so long for the gain to come Irom the pain? [Major] We are getting the gain already, but it isn't apparent to people. A couple of years ago, we had inflation at double figures -- it is now below 3 per cent. We had interest rates at 15 per cent, now down to 5 per cent, We had unemployment rising rapidly which is now falling quite rapidly. In addition we now have exports running at record levels, production back to the peak of the late 80s. All that has happened, but history tells us that after a recession it takes some time before the good news filters through. We have the best chance of sustainable growth with low inflation for as long as I can remember. [Buckland] But people just laugh when you say the country is on the up and up. Despite all the statistics they think it is a joke. And they have just had big tax increases. [Major] The tax increases arg a good deal smaller than many people imagined. Everyone said they were going to stop the recovery stone dead. They have not. We have had to do what is necessary to put this country on a consistent growth pattern and improve living standards in the medium and long term. [Buckland] The economic prospects look good for the next two years at least. But how are you going to capitalise on that politically? [Major] It is not quite so much one single big idea, but to ensure this country actually becomes more prosperous and that means better services across the board. What concerns most people is the prospects that exist for themselves and their family. So what we need to do is to make sure we carry through the economic and other reforms to maximise the freedoms and opportunities of families. [Buckland] Why muddy the waters with a highly unpopular idea like privatising the Post Office? [Major] We are eonsidering that, but we are living in a very competitive world and need to be able to compete if we are to improve our living standards. At the moment British industry is the most efficient in West Europe. Our job as this recovery matures is to stay that way and make ourselves even more competitive. There is a world beyond West Europe, the Pacific Basin and the United States and we must beat them too. [Buckland] Whose side are you on -- Norman Lamont's who says you should go back to Thatcherism with continual revolution, or do you believe people here have lost the stomach for painting pillar boxes a different colour and deregulation all over the place? [Major] I'm in favour of common sense and will judge policy on the basis of whether it is good policy or bad policy and whether it is common sense or not.
