The troops were killed Friday in an ambush in Jembeh, 200 (130 miles) east of the capital, the officials said. Two days earlier an United Revolutionary Front (RUF) rebel group occupied nearby Massingbi before being forced to retreat by government troops. That incursion marked the furthest known advance by the rebels since the insurgency was launched in May 1991 from their presumed bases in the Kailahun and Pujehun regions 300 kilometres (180 miles) east and 210 kilometres (125 miles) southeast of Freetown, the officials said. Also Wednesday a separate RUF group tried to sabotage a hydroelectric dam at Bo, 170 kilometres (1O5 miles) southeast of the capital. The dam held, but the attackers torched several houses and farms in the region. The military junta in power since April 1992 declared "total war" against the insurgents in January.
