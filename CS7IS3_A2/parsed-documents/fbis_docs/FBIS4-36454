Sajar Zubayr Ja'atah, president the General Federation of Cooperative Peasant Societies, told AL-THAWRAH: The necessary measures have been taken to bring this campaign to a successful conclusion. Supervisory committees have been set up and Executive Bureau members have been appointed in various governorates to coordinate with the local federation branches and unions on how to overcome any obstacles facing the campaign. Ja'atah added: Priority has been given to the manual harvesting of small plots belonging to families of martyrs, POW's, and the missing in action. The mechanized harvesting of large areas of wheat and barley is continuing at the same time. Ja'atah called on peasants and farmers to work to complete the harvest by the established deadlines, avoid waste, sell all their crops to the receiving stores, centers, and silos, and block those who tamper with prices and those who hesitate to market their crop. The president of the federation praised the unlimited care and attention given by the beloved leader of the people Saddam Husayn to the agricultural sector. He pointed out that meritorious prizes and rewards will be given to outstanding peasants in the harvest and marketing operations, according to the rules.
