The countries' defense ministers have signed an agreement on the matter in Visby, Sweden. The Nordic countries will support the project with both training and material assistance. Timo Seppaenen reports from Visby: [Seppaenen] The Baltic countries' joint peacekeeping battalion will be set up to operate in duties defined by the United Nations and the CSCE. The battalion will be formed by an Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian infantry company as well as the countries' joint logistics company and headquarters. The Baltic countries' readiness to create a modern peacekeeping force is very poor. For that reason, the countries need the assistance of the Nordic countries in handling even the most fundamental matters. Under the agreement concluded today, the Nordic countries will be supporting the establishment of the peacekeeping battalion for three years. The first step in the project is language training. As early as the beginning of September, the Baltic peacekeepers are to be taught English-language military terms. The main part of the assistance offered by the Nordic countries consists of various forms of training. For instance, Finland's contribution to the cooperation consists mainly of that. The Baltic peacekeepers can receive training for instance at the Military Academy or at Niinisalo [near Helsinki] where military observer training is given. The Nordic countries have also promised material aid to the Baltic countries. For the time being, only a small part of it will consist of weapons, but in time the Baltic peacekeepers are also likely to receive weapons from the Nordic countries, says Finnish Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn. [Begin Rehn recording] When we are thinking of the peacekeeping battalion to come some time in the future, it might be quite natural that if they want, if the personal armaments used by our UN peacekeepers [as heard], we might perhaps sell them later.
