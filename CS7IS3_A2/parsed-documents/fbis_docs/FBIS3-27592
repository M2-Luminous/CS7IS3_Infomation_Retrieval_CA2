The country's annual quantity now takes up about one-sixth of the world's total. In comparison, China turned out only one-45th of the world's aquatic products in 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded. During the past 15 years in particular, a time of economic reforms and opening up to the outside world, the output of aquatic products rose by 2.8 times, reaching 17.86 million tons in 1993. One distinct change is that the proportion of China's ocean fishing decreased while the freshwater fishing industry has grown markedly, the ratio now is three to two. In addition, 48 percent of the country's output of aquatic products is from artificially bred stock, according to the paper. However, on average, China's output is 14 kg of aquatic products per capita, only equal to two-thirds of the world's average, the newspaper noted.
