AL-AHRAM says there will be no vanquished and no victor in the current war in Yemen. In such senseless wars we all end up losing, and badly. The paper calls on all Yemenis to listen to reason and seek a negotiated settlement that would save lives as well as resources. The paper asks disapprovingly: How can dialogue be scorned by brothers at a time when it has been pursued by "sides that have known enmity for decades" and whose conflict has been more complicated and deep-seated? AL-AHRAM says that there may be a grain of truth in claims that the Yemeni crisis is an internal affair. But this crisis is undeniably a general Arab and Islamic concern. We cannot be indifferent to the events in Yemen, because they constitute a painful blow to every Arab and Islamic tradition, the paper declares. Writing on the same topic, AL-JUMHURIYAH says that one cause of the Yemeni crisis is that some Yemeni leaders tried to fiddle with the political balances in a newly united country that still lacked the mature political institutions that can withstand tinkering. Yemeni leaders, AL-JUMHURIYAH adds, adopted a tribal perspective and ditched time-tested procedures and norms. With political acumen obviously lacking, the conflict is likely to take on a life of its own, AL-JUMHURIYAH predicts. No one in Aden is likely to honor any pledge of unity with those who besieged their city and threatened to take it by force. A lust for revenge has gripped Sanaa, with many ears deafened by the thunder of missiles and the buzz of planes, the paper concludes.
