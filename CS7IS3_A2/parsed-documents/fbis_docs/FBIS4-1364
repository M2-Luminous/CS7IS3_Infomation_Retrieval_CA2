It all happened at about 0900 [0800 GMT] when UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] rebels began firing light weapons and launching shells at government forces deployed in the southern part of the city. It lasted for about 15 minutes, and sources say two people were killed and five others wounded. There was agitation among the residents, and the streets were deserted for about an hour. As is usually the case, the men in the service of Savimbi fire shells at the defenseless residents because they are unable to face government forces.
