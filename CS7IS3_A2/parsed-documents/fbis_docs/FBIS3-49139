Administrative costs such as, for example, those for privatisation commissions, were 240 million crowns, while 450 million crowns was spent on depreciated property returned to its original owners. Settlement of liquidation consequences of state-owned companies have thus far demanded close to 2 billion crowns.

The net balance from the process is 31.2 billion crowns, of which 20 billion has been deposited long-term, the interest of which is to be used in the privatisation of health care, Jezek concluded.
