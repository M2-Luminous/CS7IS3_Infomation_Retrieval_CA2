ITAR-TASS has been told in the press center of the Russian Navy that an armored group of a Pacific Fleet coastal defense formation, tanks, and armored personnel carriers are operating in the area; some of the fleet's aircraft (a plane and a helicopter) have been brought in to study the site of the accident. According to data currently available, there have been no victims among the guards or the personnel servicing the dump. According to the assessments of specialists, the distance to which shrapnel will scatter as a result of the munitions' explosions (conventional munitions were stored at the dump) rules out the possibility of their falling on housing and other buildings of the civilian population of the villages of Novonezhino and Romanovka. The situation in the disaster area is under unremitting control.
