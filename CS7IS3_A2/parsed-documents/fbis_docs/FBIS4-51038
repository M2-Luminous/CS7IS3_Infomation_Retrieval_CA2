He made the remark after heading a four-member delegation, entrusted by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to investigate the salt industry in Yingcheng city and Yunmeng county of Hubei, in the middle of this month. The two areas are ideal centres for producing iodized salt, according to the mission. The two areas should expand projects for producing edible iodized salt, in a bid to meet the demands for iodized salt of China's 450 million people in the country's iodine-deficient areas and help China to realize its target to wipe out completely by the year 2000 all the diseases caused by iodine deficiency. Hubei is one of China's leading producers of salt from mines, and most of Hubei's salt production centers are located in areas between Yingcheng city and Yunmeng county. Along areas between these two, there are ten large and medium- sized salt-making enterprises, producing 2.1 million tons of crude salt a year. Hubei began production of iodized salt in the 1960s.
