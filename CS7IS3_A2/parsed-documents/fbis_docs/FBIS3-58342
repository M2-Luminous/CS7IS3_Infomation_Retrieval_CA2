Kinkel conceded that the matter consisted of many components. The industry's anxiousness to produce and export arms contrasted with the political will to prevent the FRG from becoming "world champion for armament exports." It is necessary to achieve conciliation between "the two poles." With this statement, the federal foreign minister intervened in the ongoing discussion on easing German export restrictions for arms. For months, a Federal Government working group has been thinking of how changes in Germany's arms export practice could be achieved in the course of liberalization within the framework of the European Union [EU]. The members of this working group, which is headed by Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, share the view that the other EU members will not, under any circumstances, be willing to adopt Germany's very restrictive arms export regulations. Experts within the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU]/[CSU] Bundestag group have also discussed the liberalization of arms exports for some time. The Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce [DIHT] was meanwhile also intervened in the debate. In a statement, the DIHT emphasized that, regarding the necessary easing of German export restrictions, one should not start with armament products, because it would mean taking the second step before the first in this sensitive area. In the DIHT's view, one should start with the so-called dual-use goods, that is to say products that can be used for both military and civilian purposes. Many more jobs are dependent on the export of these products than on armament exports. Moreover, in the sphere of dual-use goods there is a danger of the German economy being uncoupled from the international market. Therefore, the DIHT requests that restrictions be first eased for these goods. Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] accused the government of having a new armament policy in mind. Considerations within the CDU are proof of it, it was said. SPD Bundestag deputy Klaus Kuebler said that the objective of harmonizing arms exports within the EU member states was misleading. In this connection, Kuebler said that it was politically and morally irresponsible for the Federal Government to intend to supply war ships to Indonesia. Thus, Bonn "brazenly" was ignoring the resolutions of the Western European Union [WEU], which were also supported by the Federal Government.
