With the Japanese-U.S. summit meeting on 11 February nearing, prospects for the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks coming to a successful conclusion look extremely bad indeed. While talks on individual sectors are experiencing rough sailing, there is no telling when the economic stimulus package, which was supposed to have been Japan's trump card, will come into being. The vice- ministerial-level meeting to resume in Washington on 7 February is likely to be held in a gloomy mood. The negotiations on individual sectors are progressing, albeit slowly. In talks in the area of government procurement (for telecommunications and medical equipment), an agreement is nearing as a result of Japan's concession on 5 February in agreeing to lower the amount of procurement to be subject to open bidding to 100,000 SDR's (IMF-set special drawing rights; equivalent to about 19 million yen). But in the telecommunications market sector, a sharp confrontation persists between the two countries. While the United States demands that the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) be included among organizations to be subject to open bidding for government procurement, Japan insists that "NTT is a private enterprise. The U.S. demand is absurd, and it does not conform to the GATT's rules, either." As far as procurement by NTT is concerned, Japan wants to satisfy the U.S. complaints only within the framework of the existing agreement. In the area of insurance, holding a "two-way dialogue" was agreed on at the vice-ministerial-level talks in January. This means the two countries have agreed that the economic talks should address not only the problems of Japan and the question of how they should be resolved, but also the problems of the United States. In the United States, procedures for issuing permits for the insurance business differ by state, and this makes foreign companies' entry into that nation's market difficult. The two-way dialogue is expected to contribute to liberalizing the U.S. market. With respect to the talks on automobiles and auto parts, Japan has also proposed easing rules on issuing permits which come under the jurisdiction of the Transportation Ministry. The United States, which has continued criticizing the current system as "a nontariff barrier to the export of finished automobiles," considers this a welcome proposal. However, because of the scrapping of the plan for a 6 trillion yen tax cut, the economic framework conference itself has become shaky. The most important purpose of the talks is to redress Japan's huge current accounts imbalance. Consequently, however difficult the talks on individual sectors might be, "the real key to the success of the talks lies in whether domestic demand could be expanded by coming up with a big economic stimulus package," (according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs). The United States' "basis of evaluation" of the economic stimulus package is a "minimum of 5 trillion yen," a senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said. That being the case, the proposed economic package in the neighborhood of 15 trillion yen including tax cuts of 6 trillion yen would have been satisfactory to the United States from its position of wanting Japan to reduce its surplus by expanding domestic demand. But the plan for tax cuts has been scrapped. As long as no action is be taken on the tax cuts and the budget, even if Japan pledges large-scale economic measures, this certainly would not be so persuasive to the United States. Besides, President Clinton's support for Prime Minister Hosokawa, who is for change, is very warm. As such, the government initially thought that "they wouldn't do anything to kick him off of a cliff" (to quote a government source), but the government is now concerned lest the president's evaluation of the prime minister should change as a result of this uproar over the tax plan and the subsequent scrapping of the plan. Meanwhile, the numerical targets that the United States set out as objective criteria for measuring the openness of the Japanese market have become the biggest factor in making progress in the individual-sector talks difficult to attain. In the negotiations on the government procurement of telecommunications equipment, the United States insisted, "Foreign products' share of the Japanese market is less than 5 percent; over the next several years, it should be raised to about 20 percent, which is the level found in other industrialized nations." The United States wants Japan also to promise to "buy foreign products at levels comparable to those found in other industrialized nations" in the talks on insurance, automobiles and auto parts, and other sectors, which would be tantamount to presenting numerical targets in the form of market shares. Japan then rejected this, insisting that doing such a thing is equivalent to practicing managed trade, and saying that "we can never agree to setting future targets" (to quote a government official). Subsequently, the United States proposed using different expressions like "indicators" and "trends" to describe the "objective criteria." When U.S. officials thought they could not get their way by pushing for increased market shares, they switched to demanding assurances of "certain continuous rates of increase." But Japan rejected the demand very completely, saying, "those are nothing more than numerical targets worded differently." Japan's position is that "the best it can agree to is to say that it will make efforts to increase the procurement of foreign products." But within the United States, there are strong sentiments like that of envoy Mickey Kantor which charge that "not one of the Japanese-U.S. agreements concluded in the past has been effective" and that that country is perplexed by the strong resistance being put up by Japan.
