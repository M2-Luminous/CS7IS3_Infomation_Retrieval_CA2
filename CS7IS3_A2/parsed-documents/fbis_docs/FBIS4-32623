According to the National Polish Bank, at the end of last year the foreign trade deficit reached over 2 billion zlotys. Maciej Lesny, under secretary of state in the Ministry for Foreign Economic Cooperation, has told journalists that this trend is against the government's intention. Proexport state policy guidelines, which were prepared recently, attach much importance to economic contacts with Russia, the opening of the European Union markets, and the elimination of protectionist measures. [Begin Lesny recording] First, we will be able to give export incentives to large exporters. Second, we will be able to insure them to cover not only commercial risks but also political risks, which is extremely important. Third, reputable exporters or importers will be able to receive refunds of customs duties and taxes very quickly, if they have to use imported components for the manufacturing of goods earmarked for exports. Home producers will be able to receive VAT [value-added tax] refunds on goods to be exported. In the near future, we hope to work out solutions that will enable those who have to import materials in order to export their products later to avoid paying any charges as a result. [end recording]
