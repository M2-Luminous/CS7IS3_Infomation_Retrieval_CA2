It notes that the index, which is an indication of the quality of life within a country, ranks South Africa "alongside such shining examples as Libya and Lebanon." Noting some regions of particular concern, the editorial concludes: "The new Government is obviously more people-oriented than its predecessors and its Ministers have not wasted any time in calling for, among other things, bold housing initiatives and the need to ensure access to clean water for all. These are some of the fundamentals that will lift this country above the Third World quagmire. The balancing act is going to be a challenge." SOWETAN Praise for Police -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English in editorial on page 10 of its 18 May issue notes that "radical rightwing elements have been dealt a series of blows which have taken a lot of wind out of their sails." The potential for violence by the right wing is diminishing. The editorial credits the police: "The police have done a sterling job, especially against radical rightwing groups. Their swift action has thwarted other possible bomb attacks....We can do no more than praise the police for acting so fast and decisively against terrorism."
