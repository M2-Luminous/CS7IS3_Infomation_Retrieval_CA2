Russia Loses Billions, Surrendering Arms Market to Competitors"] [Excerpts] I remember five years ago when I first wanted to write an article about the arms trade I was advised not to touch on this "slippery" subject. They said that it was shameful to make money from other people's blood and that I should on the contrary advocate universal disarmament. And we have acted, and in such a way that the whole world has gasped. First we axed the army then the defense industry and we have "surrendered" the world arms market with virtually no resistance. We were applauded and warmly supported (verbally) but for some reason there were none who were eager to follow the example. Today we have come to our senses. We have realized that it is shameful to squander irreplaceable natural resources, shameful when a great industrial power is assigned the role of a raw material tributary, shameful to ask for help and credits. And we have looked hopefully to our censured and destroyed defense industry: Save us, dear defense industry, earn currency for the country. But what can it do if the majority of the sector's plants are still on compulsory Christmas vacation because of the shortage of funds and resources, if the state has still paid less than half of what it owes for output bought last year and the financing of science has been reduced almost tenfold?... [passage omitted] Gennadiy Yampolskiy, deputy chairman of the State Committee for the Defense Industry, admits that so far warehouse stocks of arms and equipment have been sold off -- mainly items with which our army is "stuffed full." The producers of new output have mostly remained without orders. Because "fresh" models cannot be exported. And if someone does try to overcome these bans and restrictions he soon realizes it is a hopeless business. At the "Fakel" plant near Moscow they designed a very "intelligent" air defense missile. And they did so at their own initiative and using their own funds. There is no shortage of people anxious to buy it, including the Russian Defense Ministry. But the trouble is that no one in this country has money and it cannot be sold abroad without special permission. And the "commodity" is left with no demand for it. [passage omitted] It would be all right if it were only foreign businessmen who were preventing us from trading. One can understand them. But how can one understand our own Russian Government, which is "putting spokes in the wheels?" To draw up an ordinary contract you need to spend 12-18 months touring the corridors and bowing and scraping in offices. Over the course of three years there have been 12 (!) decisions by the president and government on deliveries of aircraft to China and the sale of licenses. And far from all the decisions were irreproachable. For instance one Russian firm agreed with the Chinese that the latter would pay for their deal half in currency and half in barter but the joint government commission gave our southern neighbors the go-ahead to reduce the currency proportion to 35 percent. Here barter is subject to such taxes that it is becoming disadvantageous to import it to Russia. Or take another example. Our aircraft industry officials reached an agreement with the United Arab emirates for the delivery of output worth several hundreds of millions of dollars but after Vice Premier Shokhin's trip there it emerges that three quarters of the profits will go to pay state debts. Enterprises naturally do not like this "aid" from the state -- they have to pay their workers' wages, settle accounts for deliveries and taxes. No one now wants to work at a loss. It is an open secret that one of the main aims of any international meetings at all levels is to "push" one's own goods on the foreign market, including the market in arms and military equipment. Our defense industry officials expect as much from their own government. And not directives with a mounting list of countries with whom it is "not recommended" that contracts be maintained for various short-term political reasons. There should be a reduction in the export duty, not an increase in taxes. You can only shear a sheep which has managed to grow a fleece, you can take nothing from a naked sheep except its skin and its meat. [passage omitted] Our newspaper recently wrote about the fiber-optic equipment developed at Chelyabinsk-70, which surpasses in quality any foreign counterparts and is far cheaper. And then what? The Americans intend rapidly to lift the ban on the sale of their fiber-optic technology to Russia which, according to their calculations, could bring in about $100 million in annual profit. But the Russian Federation Communications Ministry is signing documents on the construction in Voronezh of a plant for the production of cable using the technology of British and German firms. Again the result is that no one is a prophet in his own country. We subsidize foreigners and bar the way to our own people. It is naive and futile to hope that the defense industry will become a "golden fish" by itself and bring the state sufficient currency without support. The hen which lays the golden eggs is also in need of care and feeding.
