FR941028-2-00194 FR941028-2-00109 Fixed room-air recirculation systems (i.e., systems that recirculate the air in an entire room) may be designed to achieve negative pressure by discharging air outside the room (Suppl. 3, Section II.C.3). Some portable room-air recirculation units (Suppl. 3, Section II.C.3.b.) are designed to discharge air to the outside to achieve negative pressure. Air cleaners that can accomplish this must be designed specifically for this purpose. A small centrifugal blower (i.e., exhaust fan) can be used to exhaust air to the outside through a window or outside wall. This approach may be used as an interim measure to achieve negative pressure, but it provides no fresh air and suboptimal dilution. Another approach to achieving the required pressure difference is to pressurize the corridor. Using this method, the corridor's general ventilation system is balanced to create a higher air pressure in the corridor than in the isolation room; the type of balancing necessary depends on the configuration of the ventilation system. Ideally, the corridor air supply rate should be increased while the corridor exhaust rate is not increased. If this is not possible, the exhaust rate should be decreased by resetting appropriate exhaust dampers. Caution should be exercised, however, to ensure that the exhaust rate is not reduced below acceptable levels. This approach requires that all settings used to achieve the pressure balance, including doors, be maintained. This method may not be desirable if the corridor being pressurized has rooms in which negative pressure is not desired. In many situations, this system is difficult to achieve, and it should be considered only after careful review by ventilation personnel. c. Monitoring negative pressure. The negative pressure in a room can be monitored by visually observing the direction of airflow (e.g., using smoke tubes) or by measuring the differential pressure between the room and its surrounding area. Smoke from a smoke tube can be used to observe airflow between areas or airflow patterns within an area. To check the negative pressure in a room by using a smoke tube, hold the smoke tube near the bottom of the door and approximately 2 inches in front of the door, or at the face of a grille or other opening if the door has such a feature, and generate a small amount of smoke by gently squeezing the bulb (Figure S3&hyph;3). The smoke tube should be held parallel to the door, and the smoke should be issued from the tube slowly to ensure the velocity of the smoke from the tube does not overpower the air velocity. The smoke will travel in the direction of airflow. If the room is at negative pressure, the smoke will travel under the door and into the room (e.g., from higher to lower pressure). If the room is not at negative pressure, the smoke will be blown outward or will stay stationary. This test must be performed while the door is closed. If room air cleaners are being used in the room, they should be running. The smoke is irritating if inhaled, and care should be taken not to inhale it directly from the smoke tube. However, the quantity of smoke issued from the tube is minimal and is not detectable at short distances from the tube. Differential pressure-sensing devices also can be used to monitor negative pressure; they can provide either periodic (noncontinuous) pressure measurements or continuous pressure monitoring. The continuous monitoring component may simply be a visible and/or audible warning signal that air pressure is low. In addition, it may also provide a pressure readout signal, which can be recorded for later verification or used to automatically adjust the facility's ventilation control system.
