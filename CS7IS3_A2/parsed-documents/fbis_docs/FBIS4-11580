It has been reported that the appeal was filed at the CSJ Secretariat at 1845 local and that the file will be sent to the Constitutionality Court (CC) today. Thus, the decision to continue the electoral process is in the hands of the CC magistrates, who should either confirm the provisional amparo ordered by the CSJ or amend it. The latter looks more likely, according to legal and political analysts. On 22 April, the CSJ magistrates, acting as an amparo chamber, accepted the provisional amparo which Social Action Movement (MAS) Deputy Carlos Arroyave Cerna had requested saying he had been harmed by the TSE's call for the elections to be held on 14 August. This action interrupted the election process. The CC magistrates are expected to overrule the CSJ and rescind the resolution in a few hours, however. Consequently, the election process would continue while the provisional amparo filed by Deputy Arroyave follows its normal course. The fact that the TSE magistrates have filed an appeal on the CSJ resolution means that they acted according to the Constitution and the law by calling the Guatemalan people to hold legislative elections to elect a congress of 80 deputies. Democratic Union (UD) Party Deputy Luis Chea last night said he hopes the CC magistrates "will abide by the law and confirm the TSE's call for elections, which is according to the law." Roberto Arana Espana of the Central Authentic Nationalist Party said: "The CC must rule favorably on the appeal filed by the TSE magistrates because the CC is the only institution backed by the people. It is the only body whose decisions are accepted by the people because the CC has always abided by the Constitution." Arana Espana added that the people are ready to participate in the elections on 14 August, "a historic date which will change the country's politics."
