In her opinion, it is advantageous for the national-communist opposition to undermine the authority of a major radio and television company on the threshold of elections to the City Assembly in order to "damage" the reputation of political organizations close to the company's management. According to some reports, after the statement by the manager of the RGTRK "St. Petersburg Fifth Channel" the deputy mayor of St. Petersburg, Valeriy Malyshev, sent a directive to all rayon administrations in the city to eliminate unauthorized pre-election broadcasts by rayon radio stations and to henceforth coordinate the content of pre-election broadcasts with the management of the RGTRK "St. Petersburg Fifth Channel." In Mr. Malyshev's opinion, the RGTRK is the only competent broadcaster in the entire city, and all the other broadcasters (even those registered as mass media) which use the city's radio relay network should ask for the consent of its management in order to prepare their broadcasts. However, it is possible that the scandals involving the RGTRK "St. Petersburg Fifth Channel" stem not so much from political reasons as commercial reasons. According to certain information, the RGTRK management is studying the establishment of of a joint-stock company (with the transfer to it of all buildings, structures, and equipment of the RGTRK) with the participation of the American company "TV and Radio St. Petersburg," which is to receive 49 percent of the charter capital of the future AO [joint-stock company], and one more TOO [limited liability partnership], whose founders are not known at present. The documents on establishment of the joint-stock company have been passed by the head of the Press and Mass Media Committee of the municipal administration, Dmitriy Mezentsev, and they have had time to remain on the desk of Vladimir Sumeyko, the press minister. Meanwhile, the radio and television company's financial activity is attracting more and more interest from law enforcement organs. The public prosecutor's office has asked for the documents on its transactions with the "TV and Radio St. Petersburg Commercial Center" Joint-Stock Company and the "Nevskiy Glashatay" AO.
