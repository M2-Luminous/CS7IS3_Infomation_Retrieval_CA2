FR940224-1-00036 FR940224-1-00009 EPA has also developed proposed base fuel specifications for alternative fuels, based on California Air Resources Board (CARB) definitions and other available information. EPA requests comments on the proposed base fuel specifications, discussed below for each alternative fuel family. At this time, much less in-use data is available for alternative fuels than for conventional fuels, and some of these fuels and their associated vehicle/engine technologies are still under development. EPA thus proposes to allow some flexibility (with specific EPA approval) in the base fuel formulations specified for the alternative fuel families, if necessitated by technological changes occurring after final promulgation of the specifications. Such changes might be particularly necessary in regard to the additives specified to be used as part of the base fuels. For example, the proposed M100 base fuel (see below) is specified to contain no additives. This proposed specification reflects EPA's understanding that M100 fuel is currently used without additives in heavy-duty buses in California. However, as experience accumulates and/or if other M100 vehicle technologies become predominant, the need for a minimum complement of additives (such as agents to increase the lubricity or auto-ignition characteristics of M100) may become evident. In such cases, EPA would review and (if justified) approve requests from alternative fuel manufacturers to modify the base fuel (and/or additive) specifications. Such requests would generally be deemed to be justified if consistent with the associated vehicle manufacturer's recommendations for operation of the vehicle. Public notice of any approved changes to the base fuels (and/or their additive components) would be published in the Federal Register . 1. Methanol As proposed in the NPRM, the baseline category within the methanol fuel family would contain two F/FA groups: the M100 group (to include methanol formulations with at least 96 percent methanol by volume) and the M85 group (to include methanol formulations with 50&hyph;95 percent methanol by volume). Each of these baseline methanol groups would have its own base fuel. These base fuels would contain no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine. The chlorine (as chloride) would be permitted as a contaminant remaining from methanol production, and would be limited to no more than 0.0001 percent by mass. The sulfur content may not exceed 0.002 percent by mass in the M100 base fuel and may not exceed 0.004 percent by mass in the M85 base fuel. The M100 base fuel would be required to consist of 100 percent by volume chemical grade methanol. The M85 base fuel would contain 85 percent by volume chemical grade methanol, blended with 15 volume percent unleaded gasoline base fuel (as described in Table 1). No additives other than those contained in the gasoline base fuel component would be allowed. Specifications for the methanol base fuels are presented in Table 3.
