A smeltery official said that the Zhuzhou-based factory is the only Chinese enterprise listed in the London Metal Exchange for the trading of lead and zinc. The smeltery is preparing to launch a multinational company in an effort to broaden its market in other countries. The smeltery's production of copper, lead and zinc has risen at an annual rate of 10,000 tons since 1991, topping 200,000 tons for the first time in 1993, he said. Also since 1991, the smeltery has scored an annual increase of 15 percent in earnings from sales and an annual rise of 20 percent in profits and taxes. In 1993 the smeltery earned 1.25 billion yuan (about 14.4 million U.S. dollars) from sales, and generated 170 million yuan in profits and taxes, the official said.
