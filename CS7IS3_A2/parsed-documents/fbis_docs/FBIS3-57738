Vasiliy Lipitskiy already moved in one of the first parliament sessions that this question be included on the agenda, but his motion was rejected. In the opinion of Duma Deputy Ivan Anichkin, the failure of Vasiliy Lipitskiy's first attempt to secure the release of the Lefortovo prisoners is explained only by the lack of coordination in the actions of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] group of deputies, who voted against the proposal. "But we will be able to agree on this question with Zhirinovskiy," Ivan Anichkin thinks.
