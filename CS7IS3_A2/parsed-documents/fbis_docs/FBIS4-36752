In its Monday issue, the paper says that if a French magazine's report on the flow of Iranian military aid to northern Yemen is true, this would be an extremely serious development, boding ill to the Gulf area, the Arabian Peninsula, and perhaps to the entire Middle East. The paper points out that current signs give credence to the French magazine's report. These signs are apparent in the growing influence of the extremist groups in the ruling structure in Sanaa, as the Reform Grouping is the main partner in the ruling People's Congress. Other signs are manifest in the facilities given by the Yemeni extremists to their fellows from other countries. They give them, among other things, shelter and transit facilities. This cooperation brings together the extremist wings in Yemen and their counterparts in Iran on the other shore of the Gulf. AL-AHRAM asserts that the covert sectarian substance of this war definitely indicates that Iran has a hand in the war, particularly in view of the existing evidence affirming that Iran supports the Shiite az-Zaidiya sect, which historically dominates Yemen. Concluding its editorial, AL-AHRAM voices hope that the two parties to the conflict in Yemen will be reasonable and spare their country and their Arab and Islamic nation from the evil looming on the horizon.
