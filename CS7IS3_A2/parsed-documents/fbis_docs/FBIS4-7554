The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Union both reported this week that while the Czech Republic is ticking along with optimism and steady economic reform, Slovakia is hampered by government policies and the outlook of its public. The OECD report on the countries' economic conditions and prospects rules out the possibility of economic growth in Slovakia in the near future and puts the blame squarely on the shoulders of politicians. The government's slowdown of economic reforms, which the report contends took place in the first weeks after separation, has eroded the country's stability and been the main culprit in this year's ballooning state budget deficit and depletion of hard currency reserves. The OECD judges that the uncertain situation has limited the flow of foreign investment, and that the economy will be at best stagnant in 1994. It predicts a likely drop in gross domestic product and a 3 percent rise in unemployment, to 18 percent. The Czech Republic, on the other hand, is pronounced a miraculous example of a country that has liberalized and privatized its economy without any appreciable unemployment. But more significant restructuring lies ahead, the report notes, and a doubling of the unemployment rate to 8 percent in 1994 is likely as workers in newly privatized companies are laid off. The report also faults the country's banks for buoying unprofitable state enterprises and predicts the imminent failure of several state-owned and private companies. The OECD's findings were supported by the European Union's EuroBarometer report, which surveyed more than 1,000 people in 16 Central and East European countries. Figures showed the Czech Republic outdistancing the other Visegrad countries (Poland, Hungary and Slovakia) in all of the four studied indicators: country direction, support of the market economy, satisfaction with democracy and human rights. Slovakia is having the most difficult time, surveyors note, with all of those indicators in decline. Confidence in the country's direction increased 28 percent in the Czech Republic over 1993 while dropping 32 percent in Slovakia. Most Czechs in the EU report said they believe their current path is a correct one, while an absolute majority of Slovaks feel the opposite. A majority of Czechs believe that creating a market economy is the best route for their country's future, while Slovaks are divided: Support for the market economy has fallen 11 percent in Slovakia since last year's survey. By the same token, Slovaks registered the highest degree of dissatisfaction with the speed of economic reform, with 15 percent more than last year saying it should be moving faster.
