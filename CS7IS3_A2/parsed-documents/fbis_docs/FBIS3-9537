Petrus said the demonstration of 25 February 1948, also in Prague's Old Town Square but in support of the communist coup, "was not done by the unions. The victorious Communist Party abused the unions." He said he promised Klaus that the "unions would not let themselves be abused again by any victorious party for a new February." Petrus rejected Klaus's statement yesterday that the demonstration had been organized by "a partial group of people". The trade union leadership was not a partial group, he said. He said the unions regretted the incidents surrounding Minister of Employment and Social Affairs Jindrich Vodicka's attendance (Vodicka was prevented from addressing the demonstrators). But Vodicka had not been invited was himself to blame. The demonstration, attended by 40-50,000 people according to union estimates, was a watershed in the work of the unions, Petrus said. "We realized discussions alone were impossible because you can only talk with somebody who wants to listen," he said. Petrus did not comment on the unions' next moves, saying it was for the congress to decide. Demonstration participants appealed to parliament to consider their demands concerning the making of repeated contracts, the position of pregnant women and mothers with small children, the increase in the pension age, the management of money set aside for pension insurance and the ban on trade union activity in the civil service.
