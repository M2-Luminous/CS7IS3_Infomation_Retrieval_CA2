As an AZERTADZH correspondent was told in the State Property Committee, the draft envisages privatizing over the current year about 8,000 enterprises in the services sphere, trade, and health care, as well as a number of unfinished construction projects and enterprises engaged in production. Privatization of large and medium-size enterprises will be done through conversion to joint-stock holding; the rest will be sold into private ownership--individual or collective. To distribute state property among the population it is envisaged allocating each citizen of Azerbaijan, regardless of age, a certain amount of money, or shares, through special accounts in banks, the amount of which will be indexed in keeping with inflation. The owners will be able to use them only for privatization purposes--buying enterprise stock. They will be able to purchase the latter both directly at enterprises or through state or private investment funds, which will be set up as soon the privatization program is adopted. The State Property Committee staff expressed the hope that the deputies will speedily approve the privatization program, which will give an impetus to real reform of the Azerbaijani economy.
