"The groups of experts are already finishing their study of Russia's approach to joining 'Partnership for Peace,'" Grachev pointed out. "Basing our approach on Russia's particular needs, we will be ready to join the initiative already by the end of the month", he reported. The public will soon be able to have a look at the fundamental propositions of Russia's relationship with the partnership programme, he stated. ITAR-TASS asked the defence ministers to comment on reports that the Pentagon in the near future intends to approve the allocation of funds to Russian and American corporations which will specialize in constructing housing for military personnel transferred to the reserves and in converting military enterprises to civilian production. The American Defence Secretary announced that he would be discussing this topic with his Russian colleagues on Thursday and Friday. These talks should lead to the implementation of a joint programme which should require 60 to 100 million dollars in the next year, Perry said. The defence secretary stated that his talks with Grachev focused on three global problems. First, the two sides had a good, positive discussion about the deepening of their working relations. Second, the partnership for peace initiative was discussed. Third, they discussed ways of improving Russian-American cooperation in Bosnia in order to speed up the peace process in that region, Perry explained. During their discussion of the Bosnian question, the two sides agreed to cooperate as equal partners, he said. The aim of their cooperation in bosnia is the continuation of talks with the Muslims, Croatians, and Bosnians in order to hasten the development of a peace agreement for the region, Perry said. Such an agreement would be in the interests of the United States, Russia, and all the countries in southeastern Europe. Both ministers emphasized the importance of relations between their two departments in determining the character of relations between their respective countries. That is why a lot of attention during the meeting was paid to personal contacts between representatives of the two ministries, they said.
