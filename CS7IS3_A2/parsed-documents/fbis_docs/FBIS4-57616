"The Honduran position has always been to unconditionally support the reinstatement of democracy in Haiti, a brother country which suffers an ignominious military dictatorship," Paz stated when recalling the military coup perpetrated against the Caribbean island's president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on 30 September 1991. During an interview with a local radio station, Paz said eventual Honduran participation in a multinational military force would have to occur within the framework of UN or OAS peace-keeping operations. The foreign minister said, "Honduras is currently participating in a similar operation in the Western Sahara" at the request of the UN. The head of Honduran foreign affairs emphasized Honduras has been "firm and categorical" when defending democracy in Haiti and in all countries where human rights are being violated.
