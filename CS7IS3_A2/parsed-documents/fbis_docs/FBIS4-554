On Saturday [9 April], the law was promulgated. In particular, it offers the opposition a 10-day period in which to present a consensus prime minister accepted by presidential circles. Etienne Tshisekedi, the prime minister elected by the National Conference, will not necessarily be reelected to his post because the text adopted does not refer to that National Conference. However, the latter considered that the prime minister is an institution on the same basis as the president of the Republic, the president of the HCR, the courts and tribunals. For Tshisekedi's supporters, the adopted text betrays the spirit of the former CNS [Sovereign National Conference] and gives too prominent a role to presidential circles and hence to Mobutu himself. According to these people, the responsibility for this betrayal rests mainly with HCR President Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo. On his way to Rome, where he will spend a month taking part in the first synod of African bishops, he made a brief stopover in Brussels. This provided an opportunity to ask him for some clarifications on the latest political developments in Zaire. [Grogna] The HCR-PT has just ended its work and the text has been promulgated. Has the best solution been found? [Monsengwo] We needed a transitional constitution that satisfied the whole political class. The first constitution, stemming from the CNS and adopted by the whole political class, experienced some difficulties. That led to consultations. The agreement reached in the past few days on a constitutional law based on the same fundamental principles and the same institutional order as the CNS is a very important event. This document, accepted by all, will make it possible to put the country back on track. [Grogna] You say "accepted by all." However a section of the opposition does not seem to support it.... [Monsengwo] As far as I know, the document has been adopted in an entirely valid way from the legal viewpoint and according to the parliamentary customs. The famous Article 76 with the formula that gives the opposition the initiative in choosing the prime minister and requires it to inform presidential circles of this, was voted on in the normal way. That left a minor point of disagreement on the fact that the HCR takes control of the issue if there is disagreement within the political class; it has been removed because we found a compromise wording which satisfied the concerns of all sides. The disputed phrase has become: "Once this period is over (10 days -- L'ECHO editor's note), the HCR takes control of the issue." This document has therefore been adopted in an absolutely proper way. I think that there is not the slightest doubt and that the document will not be resubmitted to the plenary session because the latter has given full powers to the office to verify that the text is in order. That has been done. The document has therefore been adopted by everybody and even the USORAS [Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition], which left during the vote, came back for the closing ceremony. [Grogna] You spoke of difficulties encountered by the transitional document adopted by the CNS. Some importants points from that document seem to have been excluded, like the one making provision for the prime minister to be one of the transitional institutions.... [Monsengwo] Certain points were not excluded. We simply left it to those who refer to the CNS institutional order to act accordingly. It is for them to say what they believe. [Grogna] Knowing very well that, if they continue to support Tshisekedi, there will be deadlock.... [Monsengwo] I do not see why there should be deadlock. The question is why some people express reservations about Tshisekedi. They must have a motive and the opposition can try to find a solution to this problem. The opposition should respond to the reasoned views of the various sides to reassure them. Dialogue is vital. We aim to create a government of national unity. It cannot be formed without consultation and dialogue. This dialogue must start at the level of the appointment of the prime minister in order to encourage the formation of the government. It is not enough to impose a prime minister, those who are appointed to work with him must agree to join his government. The problems connected with the formation of such a government can be cleared up during discussions relating to the prime minister. We must succeed in reassuring each other. I do not see things in terms of deadlock but in terms of consultation during which each expresses his viewpoint and reassures the others. Zaire's real problem is a problem of mutual guarantee. It serves no purpose to try to impose things. [Grogna] The scenario therefore makes provision for the opposition to present a candidate accepted by presidential circles. Does that rule out Etienne Tshisekedi? [Monsengwo] It does not automatically rule him out. But it is important to understand what has happened. We were faced with two camps which were based on a different institutional order. For some, there was a power vacuum at the top and it was therefore necessary to elect a prime minister; for the others, there was no vacuum. We wanted to prevent this problem of the power vacuum handicapping the work of the HCR. Indeed, the power vacuum is a constitutional problem which falls within the scope of the Supreme Court of Justice. Resorting to it would have taken time because of the legal procedures. That is why we asked each side to withdraw its demands. Some were asked to stop talking about electing the prime minister; others to stop referring to election during the CNS which was no longer vital. The constitutional problem of the power vacuum was therefore left to one side and it was left to the opposition, which invokes the CNS' institutional order, to act accordingly and appoint the prime minister. This order makes provision for the prime minister to be able to leave his office. This means in general that the opposition can confirm him or change him according to the situation. [Grogna] Has the president given you guarantees? This is not the first time that he has announced his involvement but has done nothing. [Monsengwo] The president is an institution on the same basis as the HCR-PT, the government, the courts and tribunals. Each of us must shoulder his responsibilities, in accordance with the constitutional text which governs us. The head of state is a participant in the dialogue. He has no special guarantee to give, other than those stemming from the constitutional text. [Grogna] Do you have assurances that he will adhere to that text? [Monsengwo] I do not see why he should not. He has followed the discussions relating to this text and the principles which underlie the texts have been accepted by his political family. [Grogna] This would not be the first time that he had failed to follow the recommendations of his political family. There have been precedents in recent years and especially during the CNS.... [Monsengwo] I do not think there have been precedents aside from the institutional order which has not been accepted because presidential circles had left the CNS debating hall. It is important to know whether or not it left at the president's behest. [Grogna] Your theme has always been "no winners or losers." Have you succeeded in ensuring that? [Monsengwo] Yes, I think so. We have arrived at a series of points of agreement which have been drawn up into an institutional system accepted by everybody, because even those who left the hall returned. We hope that the appointment of the prime minister will take place in the same spirit of cooperation with a great degree of concessions on all sides. [Grogna] Do you think that the political class will succeed in appointing a prime minister in 10 days? [Monsengwo] I do not see why it should not succeed. If it is not possible, we will assess the situation in the HCR and ask the question of how a solution can be found. [Grogna] If Etienne Tshisekedi is not the opposition's candidate, who is now likely to resist the president's pressures? [Monsengwo] I do not want to concern myself with this question of candidates. I am dealing with principles, not individuals. I have never had anybody in mind. [Grogna] The press is accusing you of betrayal.... [Monsengwo] There are two possibilities. Either these people who are saying that do not understand the subtlety of the approaches or they are insincere. Or perhaps they have never read the mechanisms of the institutional system which we have just set up. Anybody who knows these texts cannot claim that the CNS' institutional system has been betrayed. [Grogna] You are going to spend one month in Rome; Joseph Ileo, the HCR first vice president is very ill and is receiving treatment in Belgium. This therefore means that the HCR will be chaired by the second vice president who is a member of presidential circles.... [Monsengwo] First, I think that the HCR settlement is fairly clear. I do not have to be there for the prime minister's appointment. The office is organized in such a way that my absence does not present any problem. With regard to the second vice president acting as chairman, I think that everybody must realize that the HCR office is everybody's office and not just a bipolar body. [Grogna] What are your thoughts on the events in Rwanda? [Monsengwo] These are very painful events. I hope that the situation can return to normal as quickly as possible in the framework of a democratic system. [Grogna] Could the Rwandan lesson benefit the Zairians? [Monsengwo] I think that we have always avoided violence. I hope that the Zairians will continue to rely on nonviolence for the solution to the problems facing us because our country must get back to work.
