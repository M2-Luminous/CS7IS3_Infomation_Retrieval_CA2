The circular said that recently illegal gold markets cropped up in some regions and some enterprises and individuals produced, purchased and sold gold without authorization. It said that these led to the disorder of state supervision over gold and silver, and severely disturbed the smooth operation of state purchasing and selling of gold. Because of that, the circular said, the amount of gold purchased by the state decreased by a big margin in recent months. According to the gold and silver administration regulations, gold should all be purchased and sold by the People's Bank of China. However, Cui Dewen, vice-director of the State Gold Administration under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, said that since last year, big-numbered illegal gold markets appeared around almost all China's major gold mines in Liaoning, Shaanxi, Henan and Shandong Provinces. The circular ordered that all the gold markets in operation or in preparation to set up must be closed down before the end of this month. If illegal gold markets are found in some regions after July 1, concerned staffs and major local officials will be punished according to law. The circular also asked the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and gold industry administrative departments at all levels to strengthen supervision over gold production and sales. It reiterated that gold production enterprises must sell all the gold they produce to the People's Bank of China. The circular said individuals will still be strictly banned to mine, process gold and resell gold ore. The circular asked the public security, procuratorial, industry and commerce departments and also the customs to intensify investigation and handling of cases concerning illegal purchasing, reselling and smuggling of gold. It said that any cases seizing a total of more than 50 grams of gold, will be dealt with as big cases. The circular said that the duty-free shops conducting retail sales of gold or silver ornaments with approval should only sell the ornaments to the customers with foreign passports, home-returning permits for compatriots living in Hong Kong and Macao, and residence permits for overseas employees, with the payment of foreign exchange. The circular also said that the gold and silver products produced in bonded zones should be exported. When they need to sell the products outside the bonded zones, the operation should be dealt with as imports. The circular also prohibited gold futures trading, and the setting up of all kinds of gold futures trading centers. Branches of the People's Bank of China were asked to strengthen gold-purchasing work. They were asked to readjust gold purchasing and selling prices according to the changes on international gold market.
