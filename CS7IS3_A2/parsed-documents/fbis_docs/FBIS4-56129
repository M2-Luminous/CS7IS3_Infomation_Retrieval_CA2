In an interview with CTK Baudys thus reacted to a statement by parliamentary Deputy Tomas Fejfar who said that Baudys had confirmed that the lustration or screening law had been violated in the army in the case of at least two high-ranking officers. Baudys told CTK that both he and Fejfar had been separately briefed on the "suspicion that there are officers in the army who though being found to have collaborated with StB were granted positive or clear lustration certificates. "I have ordered the checking of all documents concerning the lustration law and nothing of the kind had thus far been proved," Baudys said. Nova television, which today broadcast an interview with Fejfar, reported on Monday that the lustration law was being grossly violated in the Czech Army High Command and that positively lust rated officers produce negative lustration certificates.
