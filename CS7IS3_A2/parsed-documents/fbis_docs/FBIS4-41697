Narasimha Rao, scheduled on June 29-July 2, will be an important landmark in the development of traditionally friendly relations between the people of the two great states, said the Indian ambassador to Russia, Ronendra Sen, in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday. The ambassador noted that the importance of the visit is manifested by the fact that during the Indian prime minister's visit two political documents will be signed devoted to a broad range of problems of cooperation between Russia and India in the international arena and reflecting mutual interests of the two countries. The ambassador pointed out that favourable prospects for mutually advantageous bilateral cooperation will be outlined in a package of agreements pertaining to such important spheres as economy and defence, science and engineering, exploration of space and environmental protection. The ambassador said that at present, Russia and India are witnessing the process of successful restructuring of their relations, which began as a result of the visit to India by the Russian President Boris Yeltsin in January, 1993. The ambassador pointed out that he was convinced that Narasimha Rao's visit to Russia would render a new meaning to this process. As for bilateral cooperation in the military sphere, it develops in the framework of an agreement signed by the Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev during the Russian president's visit to Delhi at the beginning of last year. The total sum of contracts signed in this field exceeds 500 million dollars, the Indian ambassador said.
