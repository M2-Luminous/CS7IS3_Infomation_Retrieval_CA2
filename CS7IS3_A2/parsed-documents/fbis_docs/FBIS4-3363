Provincial party committee Secretary Li Changchun delivered an important speech in which he first and foremost expounded on propaganda and ideological work's important position and role in the new historical period. He stated: In the new historical period, propaganda and ideological work is at once an important guarantee for implementing the party's basic line and an important way of uniting the broad masses of people. The propaganda and ideological work is of great importance to such overall interests as grasping opportunities, deepening reforms, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability. It should submit to and serve the overall interests of the province's work and aim at unifying the ideology of the broad masses of party members, cadres, and people with the help of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and mobilizing the broad masses of people to build a socialist market economic structure. This is the major theme. Secretary Li Changchun pointed out: In accordance with the requirements laid down by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at a recent national propaganda and ideological work conference, and in light of the realities in Henan, we should firmly adhere to "one basic principle" and publicize "one major theme," striving to accomplish five major propaganda and ideological work tasks at the moment. By "one basic principle," we mean Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which governs party work in all domains. We should firmly adhere to this basic principle in conducting propaganda and ideological work. By "one major theme," we mean grasping opportunities, deepening reforms, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability, the overall interests of the whole party's work. Thus, all types of work should submit to and serve such overall interests of the whole party's work. The propaganda and ideological work should aim at publicizing this major theme. The five major work tasks to be accomplished are as follows: 1. To arm the broad masses of the party members, cadres, and people across the province with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; 2. To correctly guide public opinion to create a favorable public opinion environment for reform and opening up; 3. To train a new generation of people with lofty ideals, moral integrity, cultural accomplishments, and a sense of discipline; build spiritual civilization more vigorously; and to serve socialism and people; 4. To adhere to the principle as letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend in order to bring about cultural and artistic prosperity; and 5. To further strengthen foreign-related propaganda work. Secrertary Li Changchun emphatically noted: We now have a clear- cut guiding ideology for propaganda and ideological work as well as long- and short-term goals and tasks to fulfill. Moreover, we have also acquired objective conditions under which we are able to open up new vistas for the province's propaganda and ideological work. The party committees at all levels and the broad masses of propaganda and ideological workers should therefore brace themselves; strengthen confidence; work in a down-to-earth manner; implement to the letter all the relevant policies; and strive to open up new vistas for the province's propaganda and ideological work and contribute more to the province's reform, development, stability, and the building of two civilizations. Yesterday's conference was presided over by Song Zhaosu, provincial party committee deputy secretary. Zhang Wenbin, provincial party committee standing committee member and propaganda department director, relayed the spirit of the national propaganda and ideological work conference.
