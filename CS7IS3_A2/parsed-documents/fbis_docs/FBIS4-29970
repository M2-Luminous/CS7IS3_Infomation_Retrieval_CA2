The decision to admit the two parties, which broke away from the PBS [Sabah United Party], was made at a meeting of the BN Supreme Council this evening. However, the BN refused to admit Setia [Sabah People's United Democratic Party] into its fold. The meeting, lasting over one hour, was chaired by Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and attended by leaders of all the 12 BN component parties. Also present were UMNO [United Malays National Organization] Deputy President Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim and BN Secretary General Datuk Mohamed Rahmat. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Dr. Mahathir said the leaders of all the BN component parties unanimously approved the admission of the PDS and the PBRS into the BN. "The BN Supreme Council considered the request of the three parties to join BN during its meeting today. After lengthy discussions, we decided to admit the PDS and the PBRS, but not Setia. [no closing quotation marks as published] "The two parties were admitted unconditionally as full BN members," he said. The PDS was established by former PBS deputy president Datuk Bernard Dompok, while the PBRS is led by former PBS secretary general Datuk Joseph Kurup. The PDS currently has 12 state assemblymen, while Kurup is the sole PBRS state assemblyman. On 31 May, the Sabah BN agreed to admit the PDS and the PBRS into its fold. A day later, Datuk Mark Koding, president of Akar [People's Justice Front], stated that his party remained opposed to the entry of the breakaway PBS groups into the BN. The PDS and the PBRS were established after the PBS, led by Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan, lost power when some of its state assemblymen quit the party and joined the BN. The Sabah BN now has seven parties with the admission of the parties. They are the UMNO, the Akar, the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party], SAPP [Sabah Progressive Party], the MCA [Malaysian Chinese Association], the PDS, and the PBRS. Dr. Mahathir also said that he will discuss with Sabah Chief Minister Tan Sri Sakaran Dandai the filling of the post of the deputy chief minister reserved for the non-Muslim indigenous Sabahans and several other posts. "I think the admission of the two parties will not cause any problems because the decision was made unanimously. All the BN leaders agreed," he said. Concerning Akar's opposition, Dr. Mahathir said: "That party gave its opinion. After listening to all opinions, we made a decision and all agreed."
