A previously scheduled meeting was held today with the Israeli side with the objective of setting the crossing into motion. However, the Israeli side said it could not let the entry of the Palestinian police force go ahead, citing political reasons. However, we managed to smooth over some snags holding up the entry. For our part, we informed them we were poised to crossing at the very moment we were holding talks with them. [Dhiyab] What were the most important points you agreed on in your talks with the Israeli side? [Jabr] The Israeli side said it would refer to its command for clearance to start the crossing. As I have said, we told them we were ready to move as of yesterday.
