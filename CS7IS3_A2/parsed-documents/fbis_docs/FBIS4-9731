Obviously, this turn in business transactions has caused turmoil in the City. Stockbrokers found a new explanation for the debacle in stock prices: namely the conflict between [National Securities Commission Chairman] Martin Redrado and [Economy Minister] Domingo Cavallo. Financial circles are visibly confused, and cling to any domestic or international event to explain the decline in share prices. Given this state of affairs, bankers do not dare forecast when the present crisis will be over. The drop in public securities parities is severely affecting the pockets of a number of stockbrokers, who had gambled on a bull market. This gamble did not turn out as expected, and they now have to pay off their debts. During the days of euphoria at the Stock Exchange at the beginning of the year, when it seemed there was no ceiling for bonds, many of these brokers closed futures transactions (purchase of papers to be paid for at the end of the month) at prices considerably higher than those current. When it was time to settle their debts in February, stockbrokers rolled over their transactions with the hope that they would be able to reduce their losses this month. But things became worse, and now losses are much greater. Bankers have already stated that this time there will be no extension of the deadline for settling outstanding debts. Stockbrokers will thus have to pay their debts in the coming days. Many of them will have to part with some of their capital. This situation has obliged many stockbrokers to liquidate their positions, which in turn caused share prices to plunge even more. Analysts from the City have noted that the uncertainty prevailing in the leading international stock markets is affecting the Argentine Stock Exchange. They also point out that the decline in Argentine papers is greater than that of other emerging markets because of the unbridled speculation in futures transactions. The stockbrokers that have been able to withstand all this are in no rush to purchase bonds and shares. They are awaiting the forced liquidation by those who are in tight spots financially, so that they can put in an appearance at the stock exchange when prices bottom out. This strategy was reflected yesterday in the slack trading at the stock exchange -- only 38 million pesos, the smallest volume of the year. It should be pointed out that among the blue chips Tabacal was down by 8.3 percent, followed by Acindar, Bagley, Celulosa, Indupa, and Telefonica, which dropped by 5 percent. YPF [Government Oil Deposits) shares, for their part, closed at 24.20 pesos, thus registering a 3.8 percent decline. The sale of dollars by the Central Bank did not help at all to calm stockbrokers down. Even though experts assert that the current drain on reserves (the Treasury has lost $514.1 million so far this month) stems from the great liquidity prevalent in the system, financial circles dislike major interventions by the Central Bank as the selling party on the exchange market. In any case they state that this issue will be a cause for concern if at the beginning of April the Central Bank does not start to recover part of the dollars it is now selling.
