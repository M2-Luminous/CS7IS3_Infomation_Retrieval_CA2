A former high-ranking Oil Ministry official who requested anonimity told the bilingual weekly 'KAYHAN HAVA'I' that Saudi Arabia was producing about 9.5 million barrels per day, 1.5 million more than its official OPEC quota. "If Saudi Arabia abides by the OPEC agreement and reduces its oil output, oil prices will jump up", he told the weekly. Brent North Sea crude oil last week crashed to a low of dlrs. 13.5 a barrel, its lowest level for six years. Oil prices further plummeted last week after OPEC members of the (Persian) Gulf Cooperation Council ended a meeting without reaching agreement to reduce their oil output. "There is no evidence to prove that Saudi Arabia will agree to a lower quota in the upcoming OPEC meeting", the former Oil Ministry official said.
