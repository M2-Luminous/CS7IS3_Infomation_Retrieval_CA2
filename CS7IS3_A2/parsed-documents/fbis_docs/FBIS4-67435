Tankers, anchored at the moorings of "Zvezda" works, are filled up to the rim with the waste and cannot take new deliveries of the dangerous shipment. This was stated today to an ITAR-TASS correspondent by Vladimir Ignatenko, the Russian presidential representative in the Maritime Kray. He said that the government should have allocated funds for building a waste processing installation. However, not a single ruble has been earmarked for this purpose as yet. In the meantime, one tanker with 794 tonnes of waste on board urgently needs repairing. So, one should either stop the works, in order to [word indistinct] the already critical mass of the radioactive liquid accumulated here, or dump the liquid in the sea. But this can't happen unless agreed by the Russian president, Vladimir Ignatenko said.
