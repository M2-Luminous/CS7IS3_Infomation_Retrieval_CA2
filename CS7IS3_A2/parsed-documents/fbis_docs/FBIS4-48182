This is a necessary step that has been taken by Tanzanian Government, because the youth-wingers have been committing atrocities against humanity, and should be arrested anywhere in the world. Apart from this, the youth-wingers are murderers who pose security risks to other Rwandese refugees in Tanzania, and security risks to the entire nation of Tanzania.
