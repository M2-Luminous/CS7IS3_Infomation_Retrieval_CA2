Rakhmanov, under the "Interlocutor of the Day" rubric, by Colonel Anatoliy Ladin; place and date not given: "Inappropriate To Hold Talks on Battlefield"] [Text] Calling Card Imamali Sharipovich Rakhmanov was born 5 October 1952 in the village of Dangar in Kulyab Oblast's Dangarinskiy Rayon. He began his working life as an electrician at an oil mill. He served in the Army. He is an economist by training, graduating from Tajik State University in 1982. At the 16th extraordinary session of the Supreme Council in Khudzhand (November 1992) he was elected chairman of the Tajik Supreme Council. [Ladin] Esteemed Emomali Sharipovich, the situation in Tajikistan is still complex. However, there are noticeable signs of a move away from a military to a peaceful life. What is the republic's leadership doing to speed up this process? [Rakhmanov] We have been trying to secure peace and tranquillity from the very first days when the republic's new leadership was elected. Over a year has already elapsed since that day but there is of course still a long way to go until we have total tranquillity in political life as well as order in the economy. The main thing that we have tried to achieve is to unite the people, channel their efforts into reviving our ravaged economy. In our bid to secure civil peace and harmony between the various political forces and public associations, we have declared an amnesty on three occasions. Those people who were embroiled in the armed struggle against the legitimate government by deception have been able to revert to a peaceful life. Those who did not want to lay down their arms have crossed the Pyandzh River over the border into Afghanistan. Now they are destabilizing the situation there, causing concern for the Afghan leadership. [Ladin] At one time there was a great deal of talk about separatist sentiments among the leaders of certain regions of your republic. Is there a problem of disunity today between Tajikistan's oblasts? [Rakhmanov] Some people would very much like this problem to materialize. I can assure you that separatist sentiments are not as strong in our republic as some writers are claiming. The central authorities have already established total mutual understanding with Leninabad Oblast. Admittedly, some difficulties have arisen in relations with Gorno-Badakhshan. This was attributable to the fact that some hard-line opposition thugs went there via the Pamir passes. They were afraid of taking responsibility for crimes committed in the south of the republic and in the capital and it paid for them to incite the civilian population of the autonomous oblast to disobey the center. What is more, the thugs blockaded the Dushanbe-Khorog high-mountain road, which immediately made it difficult to deliver economic freight to the oblast, as well as fuel and food. They were also able to exploit this situation.... The blockade has now been lifted. A decree adopted by the Council of Ministers has made provision for 22 billion rubles [R] in early preferential credit to be allocated to the oblast. Aid is being provided to improve medical, trade, and transport services and build housing. Naturally, this is no easy matter since the republic's economy is in the throes of profound crisis. [Ladin] But Dushanbe is nonetheless not laying down its arms. Nevertheless there is the opinion that the situation in Tajikistan can only be stabilized once and for all by political rather than military means. What would you say to that? [Rakhmanov] The very question holds a reproof directed at the republic's leadership. But I cannot agree with it. We are forced to use force against an armed adversary. And you will agree that it was inappropriate to set up a negotiating table on the battlefield. The bloodshed had to be stopped first. Which was what we did in late 1992. We spent the whole of last year establishing mutual understanding and cooperation with frightened peasants and wavering representatives of the intelligentsia. Had we not done this, today we would not have the strategic program for economic reform, the new draft Constitution, and a number of fundamental laws adopted by the parliament. All that is to the credit of academics, lawyers, writers, and highly-qualified specialists. They put their trust in us and followed us. But the time has now come for active political dialogue with leaders of the former opposition, those who did not take part in the armed struggle. [Ladin] What is your opinion of the role played by Russia and the other CIS states in defending Tajikistan's independence? What effect is the presence of the collective peacekeeping forces having on the situation in the republic? [Rakhmanov] I would like to pay my profound respects to the relatives and friends of those guys who died in the summer of 1993 in the Russian 12th Border detail. It is hard to find words to express both grief and admiration for the magnitude of the sacrifice! We are sincerely and cordially grateful to the peoples and governments of all the CIS states.... Regrettably, internationalist soldiers are still dying in armed clashes with intruders on the Tajik-Afghan border. It is also the task of the CIS collective peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan to put an end to this. It is my profound conviction that their very presence will have a favorable effect on the moral climate in the republic and on the population's mood. The peacekeeping forces' mission is to stabilize the situation on the border. But they are performing a task of general significance for all the CIS peoples, in particular those living in the Central Asian region. [Ladin] Is Tajikistan today able to set up its own armed forces? In your view, what are the prospects of military cooperation with Russia and other CIS states? [Rakhmanov] The Tajik people have not made ready to fight anyone. There are no major troop formations stationed on our territory. Only the numerically "reduced" 201st Division, now a Russian division. We therefore found ourselves in an extremely difficult position when the need arose to rebuff large armed gangs infiltrating the border. We have been creating our own people's army in a combat situation in the direct sense of the word. The republic's Supreme Council has already adopted the Laws "On Defense" and "On the Armed Forces of the Republic of Tajikistan." But we do not have enough money to perform this task. The state budget deficit now totals R130 billion. In view of this, even the upkeep of the collective peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan is today split as follows: Russia has taken on one-half of all expenditure associated with the collective peacekeeping forces, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are responsible for 15 percent a piece, while Kyrgyzstan and our republic are responsible for 10 percent each. [Ladin] How do you see the republic's army in the future? Is Tajikistan interested in recruiting officer cadres from other states? [Rakhmanov] What have we got today? According to the figures of the Defense Ministry, which, incidentally, is also barely a year old, we have formed the Fayzal Saidov 11th Special Purpose Brigade, a special purpose detachment, a helicopter squadron, and a military hospital. There are very few Tajik officers. Historically a military career has not appealed to my compatriots. However, now it is necessary for us to train national military cadres. The Sangak Safarov Military College has been set up in Dushanbe and a training brigade is being formed. A military lyceum on the lines of the Suvorov School is being organized in Khudzhand. I would like at least one-half of our army to comprise indigenous nationals. But that is a thing of the distant future. We are counting on aid from Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and other friendly states in training highly professional officer cadres, particularly in the middle-level and top echelons of command. As for the conditions of service in our army for officers from other states, we will follow universally accepted international norms in this. But that is, I repeat, a thing of the future. For the time being let us say a big thank you to the glorious men of the Russian Federation and the other CIS states who are defending the southern borders of the CIS together with our republic's troops.
