He is on the phone to the studio from Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin's news conference. Over to you. [Kiosa] Thank you. The prime minister was actually expected above all to sum up the results of his visits to Italy and to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, but of course we could not do without issues from back home. Let us be chronological, however. First of all, the Russian prime minister singled out the talks on the possible expansion of G-7 into a G-8 -- by the addition of Russia. But -- and this is, I would say, a new element in the prime minister's standpoint -- he stressed that we should realize the difficulties of this issue. These include the prices -- it is against our interests too to bring them down; and also the customs rules. So possibly one should start from the political aspect of Russia's inclusion in G-7, and then pass on to the economy. In the prime minister's words, there is a certain degree of understanding from our partners. As for relations with European countries, Viktor Chernomyrdin emphasized again that Russia was not laying claim to any special status, but that it had a right to have the same status as anyone else. Here too there are lots of questions. For instance, we produce so much aluminum that, as Viktor Chernomyrdin put it, one could bury half of Europe in it, while their works would have to stop. So this is a delicate issue, and all the details have to be worked out carefully. Another problem is our debts. Our partners say: First you pay, then we'll have cooperation. Russia, however, believes that through cooperation it will get the opportunity to pay off its debt. Here too some progress has been made, but talks are continuing. As I've said, however, we could not possibly do without issues relating to Russian internal matters. A question was asked about Georgia's possible membership of the ruble zone. Viktor Chernomyrdin expressed a certain degree of surprise, and said the question had not been raised at the talks, and Russia was not ready for this. As for the ruble zone in general, the prime minister stressed that many dozens of documents on the economic union were being prepared now, including various fiscal policy options. In any case, though, and here I quote Viktor Chernomyrdin, the government will not do anything to the detriment of Russia. Talking about his short-term plans, the prime minister singled out first of all his preparations for an important government session, which is to take place not on 17 February, as originally planned, but on 24 February. The date was agreed only today, after a meeting with the Russian president, to whom Viktor Chernomyrdin, at the start of the news conference, wished a happy birthday. He said he had handed Yeltsin, on behalf of the government, the best bunch of flowers of all those that will appear in the president's office today. That is about all I can tell you about the prime minister's news conference.
