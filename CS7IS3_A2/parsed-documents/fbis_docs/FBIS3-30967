This was the most closely guarded secret of the left. Most probably it is an SLD man, even though this information, passed by Reuter (which quoted Aleksander Kwasniewski) was denied by Zbigniew Siemiatkowski. It is also certain that no one queries SLD's right to appoint its own man to this position. It is not at all known, however, whether, just like Marek Borowski, he would be simultaneously a minister and the deputy prime minister responsible (even theoretically) for the entire economy. On Monday [7 February] evening Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said on television that he would accept the resignation submitted by Marek Borowski, despite signals on the part of SLD discouraging him from doing so. He did not say, however, when the finance minister would stop work. It is not known, therefore, whether the Tuesday session of the Council of Ministers is the last one with the participation of the deputy prime minister and finance minister. It is just as possible as the version in line with which he is supposed to stay at this post until the Budget Law is passed by the Sejm. As we have learned, such doubts are also expressed by other government members as well. The politicians of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] voiced the opinion that Borowski should remain in his position until the work on the budget is completed, which seems to be a logical solution: The prime minister confirmed that the government would defend the budget in the version that has been submitted in the Sejm. It is easier to answer the following question: Who is SLD's candidate for the successor of Marek Borowski? We have learned that Professor Grzegorz Kolodko, with whom talks were held when Waldemar Pawlak was selecting people for his government, is out of the question. At that time, the conditions submitted by Kolodko were not accepted; it would be even more difficult to agree to them now. It is also hard to suppose that he would himself be interested in taking over this difficult post in a situation that is far more complex than it was last autumn. SLD will also not propose Henryk Chmielak for this post. Right now he is the first deputy of the finance minister -- he holds the rank of a secretary of state. The list, which was not agreed with SLD and which Aleksander Luczak submitted to the Belvedere in October 1993, included the name of Chmielak as a candidate for the head of the Finance Ministry. However, SLD probably wants someone who would be linked with the party as much as Marek Borowski; this condition is not met by the present deputy minister. For the very same reason (as well as a few others) none of the members of the present leadership of the ministry come into play. The natural cadre reserve for any party are its deputies. However, as early as last autumn it was clear that the reserve bench of both coalition members was rather short; it has become even shorter since that time. However, on the list of SLD Sejm deputies it is not easy to find someone who could fill the position vacated by Marek Borowski. Among the members of the Budget Committee, who are naturally most familiar with the problems of the state's finances, only Professor Jozef Kaleta is an acknowledged economist; however, this acknowledgement is rather related to the previous epoch. He is probably not a sufficiently strong candidate as well, but according to the information that we have obtained, SLD leaders believe that it is a character of considerable authority that can constitute a counterbalance for the PSL-dominated part of the government. Perhaps it will be Ireneusz Sekula, head of the Main Customs Office? He once was a deputy prime minister (in the Rakowski government), responsible for the economy. Aleksander Kwasniewski met with him yesterday morning. However, we learned from a well-informed source that Sekula is not the politician that the SLD leaders spoke about.
