One of the participants, ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], has again been split by factional fighting. Krahn supporters of Roosevelt Johnson have been battling with Alhaji Koromah's Madingo forces at the Po River bridge just northwest of Monrovia. It follows last month's assault on ULIMO headquarters at Tubmanburg by Johnson's forces. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this report: Factional fighting continued this morning with skirmishes at (Krombatkam), a village 300 yards from the Po River bridge, sparking off a wave of panic-stricken residents behind ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-fire Monitoring Group] checkpoint south of the bridge. One of the fleeing residents, Joshua Schneider, who appeared terrified, said that the villagers took to their heels as the sound of gunfire neared the center of their village. Troops of the peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, deployed south of the Po River bridge, have sealed off the area to normal traffic. ECOMOG troops on the Po River highway today told journalists that one of their sergeants had been killed in crossfire in yesterday's gunbattle at the bridge. Commanders of the Koromah faction still in control of the Po River bridge said seven Krahn soldiers were killed in yesterday's fighting around the Po River alone. ECOMOG troops near the bridge confirmed that 35 Krahns were rescued and taken to the headquarters of the peacekeeping force. A commander of Alhaji Koromah's Madingo faction said there are still pockets of the Krahns in the forest and we will institute a systematic mopping-up exercise to rid the area of any threat.
