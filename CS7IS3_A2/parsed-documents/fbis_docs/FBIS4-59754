It also denied that any unit of the forces of unity, democracy, and modernization, or any of their members, had surrendered as alleged by the military sources in Sanaa. The official source in the Ministry of Defense confirmed that the forces of unity, democracy, and modernization are waging heroic defensive battles toward Karish and al-Rahidah, and are achieving sweeping victories, about which we are not boasting as is the information media of the criminal al-Ahmar family. It is our intention, however, to confirm to our Yemeni people, the Arab public, and the world that we are waging a battle of defense against [as heard] our people's dignity, their honor, and their right to a free and dignified life.
