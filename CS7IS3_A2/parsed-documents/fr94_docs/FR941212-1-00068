FR941212-1-00068 FR941212-1-00016 10. Arizona, Pinal and Graham Counties: approximately 69 km (43 mi) along the Gila River, from the confluence with the San Pedro River downstream to the Ashurst-Hayden Dam. 11. Arizona, Graham County: approximately 10 km (6 mi) along Bonita Creek, from the boundary between Section 36, Township 5 South, Range 27 East, and Section 31, Township 5 South, Range 28 East, downstream to the confluence of Bonita Creek and the Gila River. 12. Arizona, Maricopa County: approximately 27 km (17 mi) along the New River, from the boundary between Sections 3 and 4, Township 7 North, Range 3 East, downstream to the boundary between Sections 19 and 20, Township 6 North, Range 2 East. A total of approximately 467 km (290 mi) of stream and river, including the 100-year floodplain and 100 meters laterally adjacent to the 100-year floodplain, is being proposed as critical habitat. The areas described were chosen for critical habitat designation because they contain historical and/or current locations for the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl, and/or have the potential to support nesting cactus ferruginous pygmy-owls. All areas contains, or with recovery will contain, suitable nesting habitat. All areas contain some unoccupied habitat or former (degraded) habitat, which is needed to recover ecosystem integrity and support larger numbers of the owl during its recovery. The areas proposed for critical habitat are on lands owned and managed by the Service, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Forest Service, the Fort McDowell Indian Reservation, the Salt River Indian Reservation, the State of Arizona, and private parties. The majority of proposed critical habitat is on lands owned or managed by the Bureau of Land Management, the State of Arizona, and private parties. The Service is required to base critical habitat proposals on the best available scientific information (50 CFR ยง424.12). In determining what areas to propose as critical habitat, the Service considers those physical and biological features that are essential to the conservation of the species and that may require special management considerations or protection (primary constituent elements). Species requirements include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) Space for individual and population growth; (2) food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or physiological requirements; (3) cover or shelter; (4) sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring, germination, or seed dispersal; and, generally, (5) habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historical geographical and ecological distributions of a species. Primary constituents elements of critical habitat may include, but are not limited to, the following: Roost sites, nesting grounds, spawning sites, feeding sites, seasonal wetland or dryland, water quality or quantity, host species or plant pollinators, geological formation, vegetation type, tide, and specific soil types. The Service is proposing to designate as critical habitat areas which provide, or with rehabilitation will provide, the above physical and biological features and primary constituent elements. In determining biologically appropriate areas to propose for designation as critical habitat, the Service focuses on the primary constituent elements that are essential to the conservation of the species, without consideration of land or water ownership or management. The Service is required to list the primary constituent elements for any critical habitat that is proposed. For all areas of critical habitat proposed here, the above features and elements are provided or will be provided by thickets, forests, woodlands, thornscrub, and desertscrub that are inhabited or potentially habitable for the primary biological needs of foraging, nesting, rearing of young, roosting, and sheltering. Constituent elements include riparian forests, riverbottom woodlands, and xeroriparian thickets within or bordering the designated drainages. Woodlands, thickets, and desertscrub associations adjacent to these floodplain areas also provide primary constituent elements. Specific plant associations include those dominated by cottonwood, mesquite, and Sonoran Desertscrub/Thornscrub. These plant associations are characterized by, but are not limited to, the following plant species, in any combination: cottonwood, willow ( Salix spp. ), ash, mesquite, paloverde, ironwood, saguaro cactus, organpipe cactus, cresotebush ( Larrea spp. ), acacia, and hackberry, and areas where such vegetation may become established. These associations attain their greatest development, and support the highest numbers of pygmy-owls, in the approximate 100-year floodplain zone of river drainages. The presence of surface or subsurface water is critical in maintaining the majority of pygmy-owl habitat. The thicket, woodland, and forest communities described above are largely dependent on availability of groundwater at or near the soil surface. Surface or subsurface moisture may also be important in maintaining various species comprising the pygmy-owl's prey base.
