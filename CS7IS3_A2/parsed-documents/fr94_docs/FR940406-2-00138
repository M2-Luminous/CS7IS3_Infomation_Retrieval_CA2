FR940406-2-00138 FR940406-2-00087 Internal Revenue Service Nonconventional Source Fuel Credit; Publication of Inflation Adjustment Factor, Nonconventional Source Fuel Credit, and Reference Price for Calendar Year 1993 AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury ACTION: Publication of inflation adjustment factor, nonconventional source fuel credit, and reference price for calendar year 1993 as required by section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 29). SUMMARY: The inflation adjustment factor, nonconventional source fuel credit, and reference price are used in determining the availability of the tax credit for production of fuel from nonconventional sources under section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. DATES: The 1993 inflation adjustment factor, nonconventional source fuel credit, and reference price apply to qualified fuels sold during calendar year 1993. INFLATION FACTOR: The inflation adjustment factor for calendar year 1993 is 1.8918. CREDIT: The nonconventional source fuel credit for calendar year 1993 is $5.68 per barrel-of-oil equivalent of qualified fuels. PRICE: The reference price for calendar year 1993 is $14.24. Because the above reference price does not exceed $23.50 multiplied by the inflation adjustment factor, the phaseout of credit provided for in section 29(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code does not occur for any qualified fuel based on the above reference price.
