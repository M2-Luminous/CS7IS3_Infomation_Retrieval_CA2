A top-ranking employee of the RSA reported to Interfax that the text of Yeltsin's letter which explains the need to ratify the agreement as soon as possible should be prepared by Friday. The RSA representative underlined that "the presidents' signatures dated March 28 are not enough to hand over the cosmodrome for lease."

"If this does not take place Russia will remain without Baykonur," he said.
