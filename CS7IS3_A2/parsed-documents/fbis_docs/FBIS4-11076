Lacle said that "we have enjoyed good relations" with the United States, despite "certain discrepancies" following the expropiation of a farm in northern Costa Rica from a U.S. citizen who asked that the United States apply sanctions against Costa Rica. This sanction aimed freezing a $250 million IDB loan at the beginning of 1993, an idea that was finally vetoed in Costa Rica's favor following intense diplomatic efforts by San Jose. The Santa Elena Hacienda, comprised of 15,000 hectares, is now part of a national park bordering Nicaragua. The property is claimed by John Hamilton. By mutual consent the case has been submitted to international arbitration in order to establish its true value 15 years after its confiscation. Another incident that created tension between Costa Rica and the United States was a claim by U.S. trade unions about alleged labor right violations by Costa Rican authorities. Following negotiations, Costa Rica managed to have the charges dropped, which had been filed with the U.S. commerce secretary. In exchange, Costa Rica promised to support a series of labor reforms, some of which are still being discussed by the Legislative Assembly, where they face strong opposition from certain deputies and chambers of commerce. The Costa Rican Government, headed by Social Christian Rafael Angel Calderon, ends its tenure on 8 May when Social Democrat Jose Maria Figueres takes office. Today, Figueres ends a visit to the United States where he has met with authorities.
