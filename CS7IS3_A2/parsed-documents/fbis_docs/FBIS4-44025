It happens almost immediately, five minutes into the interview, and it comes as a real surprise. Interior Minister Roberto Maroni, the League's least typical exponent, grasps -- to use a well-worn metaphor -- the sword of Alberto da Giussano [medieval leader of original Lombard League] and says: "As far as I know, there will be no election. There is not a single reason for going back to the polls. Berlusconi, as we are well aware, is toying with the temptation; he wants to make the most of the wave of elation and govern by himself.... But Sunday [reference to 19 June League rally] made it more difficult for him to bring his plan off. Much more difficult." [L'UNITA] More difficult? Why? [Maroni] Because on Sunday, at Pontida, Bossi made things quite clear. He spoke of a legislative government, and that obviously puts Berlusconi on the spot. Indeed, the prime minister is trying to set himself up as the sole guardian of the principle of governability. Bossi has decided that this will continue no longer. The League wants to govern. No traps, no subterfuges: Bossi's speech was an unambiguous declaration of intent. [L'UNITA] And the independentist soul? What do League members who see Berlusconi as [former Prime Minister] Bettino Craxi's old buddy have to say about it? [Maroni] On Sunday, the League formally acknowledged its two tendencies, and for those of us who are in government, that takes a load off our minds. At the beginning, my job was a dual one: working with our government ally and, at the same time, keeping my eye on him. Not any more. Others will take over the monitoring role now. To put it plainly, we have shared the workload between us, between the two tendencies. [L'UNITA] The two tendencies, sure. Are they not a figment of the imagination? The only way to avoid being absorbed, politically speaking, by Forza Italia? [Maroni] They are not a political fantasy. The League's "proletarian" soul does exist, and it is a force to be reckoned with. It is a phenomenon that I noticed two years ago. Part of the League's grass roots criticized our entry into local government. It wanted to be in opposition: against the old system and in support of federalism. That is the source of the difficulties encountered by the administrations that we lead. There were some League city councilors, in Varese, who stopped calling me by my first name when I became a councilor with departmental responsibility. [L'UNITA] Let us get back to Berlusconi. His plan can be easily summed up: new electoral laws, back to the polls, Forza Italia wipes the board, devouring the League and, to some extent, National Alliance. One gets the feeling that Berlusconi has his mind on the operation that [former Prime Minister] De Gasperi pulled off after the war: Dumping his more cumbersome allies and recycling the old governing classes. [Maroni] You sound just like Bossi.... I believe that Berlusconi is toying with this idea, because he wants to govern on his own. Governing as such is more important to him than the mode of government. But, after the Pontida rally, it is not so easy for him to say that the majority is not united, the League is unreliable, and we must go back to the polls. Bossi has said in no uncertain terms that the guiding principle of governability is what guides us too. In this respect, we can even outshine the image of Forza Italia: It strikes me, indeed, that governability is its sole guiding principle, and we do not intend to hand over exclusive rights to that. That gives Berlusconi the jitters, of course. [L'UNITA] On the subject of the electoral law. Berlusconi would like a one-round, uninominal system along British lines. Bossi does not seem to agree. What about you? [Maroni] A single round. That is the League's official position, and has been for a long time now. We want to do away with the relics of proportional representation still surviving in the electoral system. [L'UNITA] Do you not run the risk of extinction that way? [Maroni] We would run the same risk with a two-round system. If we went to the polls today, how many of the League's candidates would get through to the second ballot? [L'UNITA] Not many. [Maroni] Quite. But apart from these considerations, be they selfish or matters of principle, I think that the government should have no say in the electoral rules. It is a matter for parliament. So neither the prime minister nor I.... [L'UNITA] Point taken. In recent times, you seem to have been the League member most susceptible to Berlusconi's charms. The most malleable, in other words. [Maroni] If we are talking about soccer, yes: I would like to play in the forthcoming cupwinners' cup final, at least for five minutes. But otherwise, no. My bond with Bossi is born of a longstanding friendship, not political calculation. If I continue in politics, it will be in the League. There are no alternatives for me. My political career began in the League and will end in the League. [L'UNITA] When he was a deputy, Roberto Maroni had it in for the [Interior] Ministry, he depicted skeletons in the Viminale's [Interio Ministry] closets, he criticized [Police Chief] Parisi, the secret services, you name it.... But not any more. Quite the contrary: He praises Parisi and defends Salazar, the head of the secret service. Were you naive before or are you smart now? Is the Viminale swallowing you whole? [Maroni] If the pair of you were appointed to the Fiat board, what would you do? Would you revolutionize the whole top management? Would you start shouting that they are all corrupt or accomplices to corruption? For Fiat it would mean paralysis, bankruptcy. I do not want to bring the Interior Ministry to a standstill, I do not want total paralysis. It is not in my interest to halt police action against the Mafia. That is what is behind my "soft" approach. I have given myself six month's breathing space. In those six months, I will try to understand the people and see how the offices work. For the time being there will be no changes, but in October or November there will be. I arrived here with a reputation for being a revolutionary: I have had to put my slippers on to prevent the structure falling apart. [L'UNITA] Was it you who saved Salazar after the allegations of political espionage made by [former President] Cossiga? [Maroni] I saved no one, because no one asked me for Salazar's head. [L'UNITA] You have publicly praised the chief of police; [cabinet spokesman] Giuliano Ferrara has criticized him heavily. A government split on Parisi? [Maroni] Ferrara demanded Parisi's head after the jail break by [crime boss] Felice Maniero. The chief of police had nothing whatsoever to do with it. On the contrary, he had issued a warning about the break. [L'UNITA] Ferrara's demand did not seem to be dictated solely by Maniero's escape. His tone revealed a marked political dislike of the chief of police. [Maroni] If that is the case, Ferrara played his hand badly, as he forced me to defend Parisi publicly, and now Parisi is in a stronger position than before. [L'UNITA] Stronger or impregnable? [Maroni] No one's position is impregnable, not even the minister's. We shall see in six months. I defend no one as a matter of course. I will cover nobody. [L'UNITA] Let us talk about the Mafia. The majority is sending out ambiguous signals: daily attacks on the front-line magistrates, fierce criticism of the turncoats. To take two examples, Tiziana Maiolo, who chairs the Justice Committee at Montecitorio [Chamber of Deputies], casting doubt on the measures prescribing special jail conditions for the bosses, and Berlusconi's lawyer, [Defense Minister] Cesare Previti, accusing [former Parliamentary Antimafia Committee chief] Violante, Public Prosecutor Caselli, and Provincial Police Chief De Gennaro, in an interview granted on 1 April, of hatching some sort of communist plot. [Maroni] I should first like to make one thing clear: Nobody, inside or outside the government, can force me to do things against my will. If the line that I adopt in combating the Mafia were not endorsed, if it were contested, I would leave, I would resign. [L'UNITA] We were talking about the many ugly signs.... [Maroni] I would ask everyone -- members of the government, the majority, and the opposition parties -- to let this debate on jail conditions and Mafia turncoats drop. The rules on turncoats are off limits, and so are jail conditions for Mafia bosses. We are looking into ways of enhancing these measures, not watering them down. Be that as it may, certain discussions and statements by individuals must not be allowed to give the Mafia grounds for hope that the government intends to treat it kindly. That is why I call for greater caution on all sides. [L'UNITA] Caution? Previti attacked no less a person than De Gennaro, head of the DIA [Anti-Mafia Investigation Directorate], the body directly engaged in fighting the Mafia.... [Maroni] I have met De Gennaro. He is a very capable man. It is true that he, too, has to cope with contradictions, but they are objective, physiological contradictions faced by the DIA due to the fact that it is a new structure. De Gennaro is doing a good job. I can break the news that he will be promoted at the next cabinet meeting. Yes, a promotion, because he is doing a good job. [L'UNITA] In recent months, the papers have carried the news that a turncoat is talking about Berlusconi and his right-hand man, [Publitalia CEO] Marcello Dell'Utri. The latter is said -- by the turncoat -- to have had links with the Cosa Nostra bosses in the past. That is a serious allegation: Is it not an embarrassment to you, as interior minister in this government? [Maroni] I have discussed the matter with Berlusconi. He has assured me that neither he nor Dell'Utri have ever had links with the Mafia. [L'UNITA] And you trust him? [Maroni] How could I remain in his government otherwise? How could I shake his hand? I await the conclusion of the matter with equanimity. I must emphasize, of course, that no charges have been made. Berlusconi has no problems with the law. [L'UNITA] Anti-Mafia Attorney Siclari fears more massacres. [Maroni] I have no particular information on that score. There are no specific reports. I hold Siclari in high esteem, and I believe him. His reasoning is convincing: The harder the government fights the Mafia, the higher the risk of attacks will be. I do not underrate that risk. [L'UNITA] Let us turn to another issue: the introduction of an antitrust bill. Bossi has said he would be prepared to join forces with the opposition parties. Do you agree with him? [Maroni] We in the League have our principles, and one of those is to combat monopolies, all monopolies. That is why we are prepared to fight alongside anyone, inside or outside the majority, who takes up the cudgels on this issue. [L'UNITA] Europe is closing the doors on immigrants. [Maroni] I will take no steps to have the European Union resolution adopted. Parliament will decide. Anyway, the principles set out in the resolution are the same as those embodied in the Martelli law. The fact of the matter is that this law has never been fully implemented. [L'UNITA] One last question: The Ustica disaster [unresolved air crash in early 1980's]. You said something very surprising on the Maurizio Costanzo Show [TV talk show]. To all intents and purposes, you said that we would never get at the truth. [Maroni] Before I arrived at the Viminale, I thought that the secret services were hiding the famous top secret file stating: "The aircraft crashed for the following reasons, the following people were responsible." But it is not true, that file does not exist, although that does not necessarily mean that it has never existed. In my opinion, a lot of papers disappeared between 1980 and 1990, 10 years.... There is someone in Italy who knows the truth. The problem is that this someone cannot be forced to talk. No examining magistrate can penetrate his conscience and his memory. If I knew who it was, I would do everything within my power to get him to talk.... The United States and France have certainly not helped the investigators. I wholeheartedly support Judge Priore's formal requests to the judicial authorities there, but I am pessimistic. We still do not even know what caused the crash: a bomb, a missile.... [L'UNITA] What impression have you formed: Was it a bomb or a missile? [Maroni] In my view, the plane was hit by a missile. That is an impression I have formed in the light of the information I have received and the documents I have read. The bomb theory may be useful to those who want to prevent the truth from getting out. Perhaps not for ever. Perhaps only until the truth will no longer have a negative impact on international relations.
