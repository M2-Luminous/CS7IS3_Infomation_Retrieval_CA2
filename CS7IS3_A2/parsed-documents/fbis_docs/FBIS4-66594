Summit"] [Text] New Delhi, February 18--India has declared its commitment to the "eradication of poverty by the end of the century," emphasised the importance of the "political sustainability of economic reforms" and has called for the shift of "power to the people" in its presentations at the first substantive session of the preparatory committee of the world summit for social development at the United Nations headquarters in New York last week. In its statement on "A vision for the summit," India stated that poverty was a challenge for all mankind, and not merely the problem of the developing countries. India reiterated its commitment to human rights and emphasised that the concept must include "human security" which implied the rights to work, food and nutrition, education, health and shelter. Significantly, the Indian statement also added: "While talking of sustainable economic growth, recognition must be given for political sustainability of economic reforms in the context of social consequences if the essential aspirations of the poor and the deprived are not pari passu taken care of, for fulfilment of these aspirations are absolutely fundamental to the stability of the developing world." The U.N. social summit is scheduled for 1996 in Copenhagen. At last week's first PrepComm meetings in New York, Indian interventions were on five themes, namely, on the political declaration, on eradication of poverty, on expansion of productive employment, on social integration and on the role of the UN and the international financial institutions. The Indian statements were drafted with the concurrence of the Prime Minister's Office. Emphasising the vital role of decentralisation of governance, the official Indian position underscored the role of the panchayati raj institutions as well as non-governmental organisations in "empowering people." The statement says: "The lead role of the national governments in the developing world at all times in the matter of poverty eradication, in promoting social integration and sustained and sustainable full employment, and in creating the emvironment needed in terms of resource allocation and relevant policies should be emphasised but with the knowledge that the state and government structures cannot successfully handle all problems of social development and that, therefore, at all times their vision should keep the people at the centre of the strategies of implementation so that people themselves are enabled and empowered through organisations of the poor, on the basis of awareness generation and empowerment techniques, assisted by the support structures provided by non-government and voluntary organisations, to deal with their own problems. In other words, a bottom-up approach with people at the Centre, with power to the people." While acknowledging the helpful role that the World Bank has played in supporting social development programmes in India, the Indian statement on the role of the UN and its agencies is also critical of the impact that Fund-Bank inspired adjustment programmes have had on social sector spending. "We have a suspicion that the Fund or the Bank do not overly bother how deficits are cut so long as they are indeed cut. That is no way of helping the poor while simultaneously pleading lack of resources for new programmes, especially on the soft window--the IDA resources," says the statement. In a hard-hitting passage read in New York but clearly intended for audiences at the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, D.C., the Indian delegate said: "There can be no deliberate, cold, dispassionate divorce of the micro needs of the poor from the macro needs of the economy. They have to go hand in hand and hence there is need for additional resources on soft terms for social development programmes. "The Bank should not win battles while losing the war. For, the war against poverty is about 50 percent of the people of the underdeveloped world, while the main thrust and results projected from the economic reforms at least initially--initially could even mean a decade--seem to be about 15 percent to 20 percent of the population of the developing countries. Let us not have souths and norths within the south itself." Drawing attention to the problem of mass unemployment in a populous developing economy like India, the Indian statement emphasised the role of "labour-intensive" industrialisation, of land reforms, peasant agriculture, self-employment schemes and the growth of the informal sector. "But all this will have to be supported by productivity-raising technology," says the statement, adding: "And hence the importance of the role of governments and of support structures, including the giant corporations, which could play a very fulfilling and, in enlightened self-interest, perhaps also a profitable role as support structures." India has asked for a special fund to be created by the Bank to assist governments tide over the problems of adjustment, poverty-eradication and creation of full employment. While the government will allow foreign investment to replace public investment in industry, it still requires international aid to enhance public expenditure on social sectors, says the Indian statement.
