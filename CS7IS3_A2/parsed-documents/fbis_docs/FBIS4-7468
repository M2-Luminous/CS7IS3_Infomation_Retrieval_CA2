On his way home from London, Albania's President Sali Berisha stopped in Vienna to give a news conference. In London he did not only discuss bilateral relations with the main focus on the economy, but he also submitted the proposal that a relaxation of the UN sanctions against Serbia should be linked with a solution to the Kosovo problem, the president stressed. Berisha stated that Prime Minister Major and Foreign Secretary Hurd had shown understanding.
