He said that due to general warming the high-mountain passes have become easily accessible to the opposition militants and that Tajik opposition military formations daily shell border posts from the rear and from Afghanistan. Attempts to cross the border have also become more frequent, he said. He announced that on Thursday morning, footprints of about 40 people who had penetrated into Tajikistan had been discovered in the section controlled by the Khorog border-guard detachment. "The trespassers have not be found yet," he said. Bessmertniy believes that preparations for the Muslim sacrifice festival, marked on 20 May, is containing a large-scale offensive by Tajik militants. He also noted that the situation was particularly serious in the section running along the Ishkashim, Khorog, and Kalaikhum regions of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. The peacekeeping forces are not strong enough to block the mountain passes and roads linking Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Although Kazakhstan signed the agreement on participation in the peacekeeping forces twice -- on September 24, 1993 and on April 15, 1994 -- it has not yet sent in its contingent, said Bessmertniy. He announced that according to border guards, the armed opposition is concentrating forces in the Ishkashim direction. These forces are extremely mobile, well-prepared for warfare in the mountains, are equipped with the most up-to-date radio-communication equipment, know the terrain very well and have guides. He said that no attempts had been made lately to start talks with the armed opposition, as was done last winter. He also said that the peacekeeping forces were ready to participate in the inter-Tajik talks, which, he said, would only benefit the parties concerned. He said that the armed opposition was accumulating forces and armaments. "Only Allah knows what will happen in this region in the near future. Judging by all accounts, the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border will deteriorate," said Bessmertniy.
