"Even brothels have their own rules. However, Bosnian Serbs do not recognize them and are "raping" the poor Gorazde in the eyes of the whole world," the diplomat said. According to him, the preparedness of many Russian parliamentarians to defend Bosnian Serbs only proves that they are using the Bosnian crisis as a trump card in their domestic political games. "Russian parliamentarians state they are ready to wage a war in Bosnia until the death of the last Serb. However, this does not make them differ from Serbs who are ready to fight until the death of the last Russian," the diplomat suggested.
