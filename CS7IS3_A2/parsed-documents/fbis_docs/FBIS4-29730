FBIS4-29730 "dreas119_m_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-119 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 Thailand Phalang Tham Votes To Remain in Coalition Phalang Tham Votes To Remain in Coalition BK2106013794 Bangkok THE NATION in English 21 Jun 94 pp A1, A4 BK2106013794 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] All 15 Phalang Tham [PDP] hardliners resigned en masse from the party's executive committee last night as a crucial party caucus resolved to remain with the Chuan coalition. The resignation of the majority of the executive board effectively warrants a new election of the executive line-up, which observers said would have to decide again on the question of whether the party should stay with the government. Yasothon MP Sombun Thongburan said he and 14 other hardline members of the board submitted letters of resignation to party leader Bunchu Rotchanasathian during yesterday's meeting. An election of the new board must be held within a month. Sombun said the resignations were motivated by "total political failure" of the party's executives. The decision to remain with the government was adopted after a marathon debate lasting six hours, during which the hardliners lambasted the performance of Phalang Tham's executives. "We resolved not to pull out of the coalition and to continue to give the government our solid support," Phalang Tham leader Bunchu Rotchanasathian told reporters at the end of the meeting. Earlier, party members voted in a split decision to revive its controversial motion on charter reform for this week's House deliberation and to ask the coalition to allow a free vote. Twenty-four participants approved a proposal for Phalang Tham to renew its push for the motion seeking to establish a House committee to draft a new Constitution. Twenty others, including party leader Bunchu Rotchanasathian, voted against it. The decision means Phalang Tham will seek to push the motion up the parliamentary agenda this week. It coincided with a government whips' resolution allowing Phalang Tham to continue pushing unilaterally for the motion. The coalition whips agreed that the motion, submitted by 21 Phalang Tham MPs sympathizing with radical pro-reform activists and shelved last week because of pressure from Phalang Tham allies, can be debated in the House on Thursday. "If necessary, the motion can be moved forward and the Phalang Tham Party can have a free vote on it," PM's [Prime Minister's] Office Minister and chief whip Thoetphong Chaiyanan said. But he added that the four other coalition parties would not support the motion. A resolution by whips not to support the motion sponsored by 21 Phalang Tham MPs outraged Phalang Tham hardliners, who vowed to push for their party's withdrawal from the coalition at yesterday's meeting. The whips' pressure last week prevented Phalang Tham from asking the House of Representatives to move the motion up from the bottom of a 28-motion agenda. Thoetphong said the whips had not decided to try to help the PDP solve its crisis by allowing the party to move the motion up on the agenda. Phalang Tham members were divided over the issue of pulling out of the coalition. But tension within the party could subside if the controversial motion was debated in Parliament. Thoetphong dismissed speculation that whips resolved last Friday to expel the PDP from the coalition if its rebel faction pushed for an early debate on the controversial motion. Solidarity Party secretary general and deputy Commerce Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap said his party would support the motion. [Text] Thoetphong said government whips agreed that if coalition parties wanted to vote for the motion, they would have to inform him first. Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit said it was a "misunderstanding" that government whips had prevented the rebels from having their motion debated last week. "The motion can be moved forward, if necessary," he said. PDP Secretary-General Udon Tantisunthon said it was now up to Phalang Tham members to decide if they want to move the motion up on the agenda. The Phalang Tham meeting, chaired by party leader Bunchu, was held under tight restrictions. Non-MP and non-executive members of the party were not allowed in. Participants were subject to body searches as part of a ban on tape recorders. Earlier yesterday, the pro-Bunchu faction seemed to have scored a morale-boosting victory when the Interior Ministry approved the new official line-up of Phalang Tham executive members. The approval effectively barred the most outspoken hardliner, Chaiwat Sinsuwong, who was a member of the old executive board, from yesterday's meeting. Earlier, members of both old and new executive boards were invited to the meeting. Thamrong Saengsuriyachan, another hardliner, claimed there was a conspiracy between the "ministerial wing" of the PDP, party member holding Cabinet positions, to bar Chaiwat from the crucial meeting. Normally, it took the ministry a least a week to approve an executive line-up of a political party, said Thamrong. He added that the Phalang Tham line-up was approved in only two hours. Before and during the meeting Chaiwat and a few other former Phalang Tham executives held serious discussions in another room of the hotel and kept monitoring the meeting through Bangkok MP Sudarat Keyuraphan who kept shuttling between the meeting room and Chaiwat's group. Before the meeting, Phalang Tham founder Chamlong Simuang told reporters it was Bunchu who would set the direction for the discussion. Bunchu, meanwhile, vowed to allow an "open debate" on the party's future. The meeting was held as activist Chalat Worachat, whose hunger strike to press for controversial pre-reform demands triggered the current political crisis, returned to his protest site in front of Parliament to continue his fast. He gave himself up to police last week to face charges of sedition and lese majeste but was released on bail on Sunday night. Chamlong yesterday refused to comment on Chalat's new move. Earlier, the "ministerial wing" had seriously questioned Chalat's motives and said the activist had been "used" by groups bent on toppling the government. The 21 MPs who submitted the controversial motion seeking to establish a House committee to draft a new charter insisted they did so to save Chalat's life. Bangkok MP Sutin Nopphaket, who initiated the motion, said before the meeting yesterday that even though the issue of whether the motion should be moved forward was settled, the party must consider whether it should remain with the government. "We want the party to stay with dignity, not under the influence of others," Suthin said. The opposition last week promised to vote for the motion. But after it was shelved last week opposition leaders backed down from the pledge.
