What has happened? [Shakhray] There is just one answer: There has been no universal brotherhood and love. Man's soul is an entire world. And we hate, remembering someone in a cloth cap at the market or with an assault rifle. But in that same soul there is also love for people of another nationality, for their culture and history. What Russians do not have, incidentally, is a recognition of themselves as a national great community. After all, there are 150 million Russians. And for this reason it is harder for us to consolidate as some national "ego." Tolerance of the ideas of other peoples is strong in Russian man. Russians are the sole nation not to have swallowed up all other nationalities, even the smallest. We looked for the same attitude, naturally. And national unity with us emerges only as a necessity, as a blow in retaliation for a threat. [Zhelnorova] But what is happening now? Russians in the role of social odd-men-out outside of Russia. Russian soldiers fighting for the sake of others' interests and dying on the territory of the former Union republics. And the "great nation," which should be displaying concern for its fellow citizens, is essentially betraying them. People do not feel that there is a native state which is defending them. You, as a minister, more, deputy prime minister, what are you doing to ensure that Russians recognize that they are protected? [Shakhray] This is what I am working for. At the diplomatic level within Russia I have sought to ensure and will continue to seek to ensure that Russia, as the successor of the Union, bear responsibility for all people carrying the passport of citizen of the USSR. Not simply in spirit--the sense of blood and kinship--but legal responsibility. It is a question of the conclusion of treaties and agreements on citizenship and on aid to Russians who live in other countries. The delivery of humanitarian freight. The settlement of interethnic conflicts, which is saving the life of Russian people. Finally, we will adopt a program of their reconstitution and settlement in Russia. For this work to be effective, not only in the form of intentions, we need to revive Russia as a powerful state. [Zhelnorova] This will take some time. They are living today. And suffering today. [Shakhray] Your question presupposes that some people are sitting on a moneybag and not giving money to Russians. [Zhelnorova] You represent the authorities. Both party and state. You should, therefore, be prepared to bear responsibility for all that happens. Many people were unaware that in switching from one economic system to another we had to negotiate an era of cynicism. Crime is on the rise, morality is declining, wealth is being exported from the country. You here, behind these strong walls, are less aware of this, perhaps; we, however, find ourselves beneath a barrage of grievances and disappointments. People hate both you and us for the fact that we are not, allegedly, showing the real picture. They are asking: Who do we believe, on whom do we pin our hopes? [Shakhray] I personally believe that our news media are "exposing and revealing" by force of inertia. Only those who are shooting, blowing up, and burning are being shown on the screen. People are already tired of this. But what is the greater cynicism: what is happening now in open form or what was for decades driven inward and has, as a result, exploded? Where has the lack of faith come from? At one time we were building communism, then, developed socialism. People of the 1920's-1940's went on believing everything.... And by the 1960's-1970's did not believe in anything. This is where the roots of our cynicism lie. Nothing with us is sacred. Religion, spirituality, and culture were eradicated, and nothing was given in exchange. And now added to this are the problems of the transitional period.... We are moving from one era to another. And the lancing of the abscess could either be cleansing or will lead to gangrene. [Zhelnorova] You take offense at us showing scenes of violence. This, of course, jars on me also, as an average person. But the journalist cannot, after all, remain silent about the fact that children, playing near entrance ways, die as the result of the detonation of automobiles containing some "stern" uncles. Children are being abducted and sold, people are demanding money for them. Is there in Russia no force capable tackling this insane crime? [Shakhray] The authorities and the state still have to be created. Society has been left to its own devices. Thank God that the force of inertia is strong in our society, that Russian man could not give a damn. Where are the authorities? There are none--understand this. An agonizing process of recovery or extinction is under way. Recovery, I hope. It was so that there be order in this society and so that the individual and his family be protected that society invented the state and authority. But we have still a long way to crawl before we reach this. [Zhelnorova] Society to crawl or the authorities? [Shakhray] Society. There are no authorities without society. [Zhelnorova] You mean that society will have a long time to wait while there is a change in political elites? [Shakhray] Not simply a change--a war--of elites--economic and political. And there will be such until these groupings share property. And they will either destroy one another in this war or will reach an understanding. Why are people being killed and automobiles being blown up? Because the elites are at war with one another. Because society has no mechanisms for resolving such conflicts in civilized ways. [Zhelnorova] And what about on the inside--THIS is approaching an end or not? Everyone has obtained what he wanted or not yet? [Shakhray] The contradictions have already been revealed, in any event. As always, there has in Russia been a noncoincidence in terms of phase: Society wants transformations, the authorities are not prepared for this. Social revival and renewal peaked in the period 1987-1989, but the authorities missed it. This curve of social assertiveness has now turned down, and the curve of arousal of the authorities, up. Whence the conflict. The restoration of authority and order cannot now rely on public forces. The utter apathy at the last elections was evidence that authority can no longer be revived at referenda. That's it, gone. These elites fighting one another have now been left to their own devices. We need now to pray and to work. While there is a parliament, a president--their interests are known. There are now no incidental votes, no incidental documents, believe me. The situation is heating up, and all parties need to sit down at the negotiating table. Because if these elites, God forbid, switch to a war with weapon in hand, society will suffer. And a new wave of clarification of relations will begin. The tragedy of our society is that political and economic groupings whose power is based on exports and the groupings whose financial and economic power is based on industry, on native technology, have different political signs. Conditionally speaking, some are democrats, others, communists. [Zhelnorova] Was it worth having this whole "perestroyka" and all the demonstrations and congresses to clear the way for new power-lovers.... [Shakhray] We have to find parallel levers of influence. This is why parties are being formed, to assemble forces in the face of danger. The concept of civil reconciliation was created for this also, so that not only the senile and idiots sit at the table. Although both those who manipulate them and those who are standing behind them with money and with their own interests will sit at the table, all the same. So a shareout has taken place, not everyone is happy with what he has received, but if the shareout continues, this will mean simply war. We have now approached the line at which we need to agree: 30 percent for you, 30 percent for him, and so forth. And, with regard to this division of property and power, to start to live peacefully. This is what the concept of civil reconciliation amounts to. [Zhelnorova] And what, then, in your opinion, will everyone agree? [Shakhray] For many of them, inasmuch as they are actual proprietors, there is no other way. Otherwise, open confrontation and, as a result, a chance to suffer and lose everything. [Zhelnorova] It has been the case that many questions of regional and national policy have been decided without you. Is this becoming the norm? [Shakhray] It is not a question of me but of the general chaos. The federal institutions of power should, particularly in respect to the regions, operate in concerted fashion. I have attempted to achieve this. And I have been more or less successful. People harbor illusions: It seems to them that another's problem is easy to resolve. But this proves not to be the case. [Zhelnorova] You are not afraid for your life? [Shakhray] I am, of course. I have two small children. A politician has to be afraid. I have no accounts in banks overseas. Nor do I have any relatives there. I live here and make policy here. This is how it should be. [Zhelnorova] What do you fear most? [Shakhray] That the self-preservation instinct and common sense will cease to operate in society. [Zhelnorova] What might operate in place of this? [Shakhray] An emotional outburst of hatred. An attempt to resolve all our problems at a stroke. The most important thing the authorities must do is to speak with people honestly. People are tormented not only by prices, crime, housing. The main thing is the unknown, the unpredictability. Everyone is now expecting of the authorities calm and peace, therefore. [Zhelnorova] Do you consider yourself a person with power? [Shakhray] I consider myself a person with authority. The functions of authority are sometimes very close to the functions of power. I believe that no one has power with us at this time.
