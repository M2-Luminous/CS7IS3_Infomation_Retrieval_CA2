After four months since the signing of Ireland-Britain peace initiative this is the first time ever that the two countries' senior officials have launched a fresh effort for overcoming the existing obstacles. Britain, which is one of the old parties to the Northern Ireland dispute, through setting certain preconditions for the participation of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, at their peace talks has resulted in prompting this army to view their future peace talks with pessimism, thus continuing its armed struggles [sentence as received]. Britain, through setting a precondition for the Irish Republican Army for putting an end to the armed struggles without determining any obligation for London in connection with the withdrawal of its forces, has drawn these talks to a stalemate. Political observers believe the presence of 12,000 British troops as well as a 7,000 strong Ulster police in Northern Ireland, which are considered as major opposition forces antagonizing the IRA, are regarded as major obstacles to the continuation of the peace talks process. The British Government, contrary to its claims, based on its interests in resolving the Northern Ireland dispute, still insists on certain stands which are typical of the continuation of Britain's dominance in Northern Ireland. The British Government has hinted at the issue of self-rule for Northern Ireland in its plan for peace initiative which means that London refuses to accept the right to sovereignty for Northern Ireland and is attempting to keep Northern Ireland as a region under British dominance. Meanwhile, the Protestant majority residing in Northern Ireland, that enjoys all-out support and protection of Britain, is yet another obstacle to the process of peace talks. In order to overcome it, Britain has to adopt a stance taking into consideration the existing realities. Assuredly the British Government is no longer able to resort to the past methods to suppress the IRA and seek to exercise military power for the materialization of its political objectives. In the meantime, one should note that the IRA, in turn, now does not see continuation of the armed struggle to be enough for achieving its goals. That is because the Conservative and Labor Governments in Britain have demonstrated that they have made themselves invulnerable to the blows of the army and will neutralize the effects of such measures and the government's political decisions. With regard to the fact that the two sides have obtained great experiences during more than two decades of struggle, and also in view of the difficulties faced by each side, it appears that one can assess the future of these talks optimistically through the presentation of peaceful views by each side.
