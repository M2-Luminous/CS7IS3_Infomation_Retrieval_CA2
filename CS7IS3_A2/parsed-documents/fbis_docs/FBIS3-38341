FBIS3-38341 "drweu022__a94008" FBIS-WEU-94-022-A Document Type:Daily Report 2 February 1994 ANNEX International Affairs Experts Doubt Reports of Cesium 137 on Crashed Plane AU0102203594 Prague CTK in English 1933 GMT 1 Feb 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0102203594 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Vienna Feb 1 (CTK) -- Hans Meyer, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), today confirmed to CTK that Cesium 137 was generally available on international markets and can be legally purchased. He said this radioactive material cannot in any case be used for the construction of nuclear weapons. Trade in cesium is monitored due to a high danger of radiation, Meyer said at the IAEA's Vienna headquarters. He said Cesium 137 is used for medical purposes and reliable firms purchase the material legally, thus obtaining necessary data about the intensity of radiation. The material is therefore not suitable for smuggling, Meyer said. He said he could imagine illegal trade in cesium only in case of lay people who want to enrich themselves very quickly and who apparently have no idea about the danger. He said that a layer of water of seven to eight metres was enough to absorb all the radiation, provided the cover of such a delivery is not destroyed. If suppositions that Cesium 137 was being carried in the small Czech Cessna plane that is believed to have crashed into Lake Constance eight days ago are confirmed, Swiss authorities are prepared to immediately expand investigation eastward. However, experts considered the hypothesis that 70 kilogrammes of Cesium 137 are lying at the bottom of the lake to be very unlikely. The hypothesis was voiced today by the Austrian Press Agency (APA), citing Swiss sources. The Cessna was flying from Prague with five people on board. Although a busy but "non-transparent" trade in radioactive materials is going on in Switzerland, no substances that could be used for the construction of nuclear bombs have been discovered thus far, Roland Hauenstein, spokesman for a Prosecutor's Office in Bern, said. Swiss experts considered the possibility that 70 kilogrammes of Cesium 137 were carried in the plane to be practically out of the question. They said that without special protection, a person in such close proximity to these materials would receive a fatal dose within seconds. The pilot could not have survived the trip from Prague to Lake Constance which is located on the German-Swiss border, they said. The transportation would have been possible only with a strong protective layer which would have weighed several tonnes, which that type of plane was not capable of carrying, they said. If any radioactive material was carried on board the plane it would have been only several grammes rather than kilogrammes. Hans Eggenberger, spokesman for the police in St. Gallen, who are investigating the airplane's disappearance, said that the rumours that the plane did not crash into the lake but landed somewhere outside the reach of radar were "very unlikely." He said that although it was possible for the plane to fly at a low altitude and thus avoid to be seen on radar in Zurich, the weather at that time made such a flight impossible. That is why Swiss authorities continue to believe that the plane crashed into the lake.
