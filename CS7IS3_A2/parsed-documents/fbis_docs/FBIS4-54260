Datuk Sri Rafidah Aziz, minister of international trade and industry, said this to British Trade Minister Mr. Richard Needham, who called on her in her office this afternoon. Speaking to reporters, Datuk Sri Dr. Rafidah said Mr. Needham, who also called on the prime minister, made a long-term proposal aimed at further enhancing Malaysia-Britain relations because Britian considers Malaysia an important trading partner. Meanwhile, during her meeting with Mr. Peter Sutherland, chief director of GATT agreements, she said they agreed that the international community is uneasy over the U.S. Congress' reluctance to approve the agreement which was signed in Marrakech, Morocco. The U.S. action in delaying the approval could create new problems which could result in the dissolution of the decision reached at the Uruguay Round. This would negatively affect all trading nations.
