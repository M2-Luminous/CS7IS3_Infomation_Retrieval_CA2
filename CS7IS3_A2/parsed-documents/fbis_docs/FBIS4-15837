At three depots, boxes containing outdated detonators for infantry mines and artillery missiles (the latter contain approximately 300 grams of explosives), as well as long powder sticks were left behind. This oversight was immediately taken advantage of by youngsters, who took away everything that caught their eye, and over the next few days the area around the seaport shook with loud explosions. Thank Goodness, until now the "taking over" of the depots has not inflicted a toll in human life, but teachers at a nearby school are often shocked when they have to run after first-grade students carrying enough explosives to blow up the entire class. Naturally, the rest of the inhabitants feel as if they are on the front line. "I am ashamed to report on this example of irresponsibility," the military prosecutor of the Russian Army in Liepaja, Vitalijs Pobedonoscevs, told DIENA during an interview. "Along with evacuating the ammunition depots, the armed guards were also removed, leaving only an emergency fire brigade, but no one at the headquarters knew that explosives have been left there. The fact was overlooked by officers responsible for transporting the ammunition. The result was that over four or five days, the depots could be entered by anyone who so desired. Presently, a criminal investigation is being conducted, supervised by the commander of the garrison, Valerijs Stalevs." V. Pobedonoscevs also stated that it is now necessary to form a unit of explosives experts, because it is not possible to hand the depots over to municipal authorities in such a state. With regard to these events, head of the Liepaja Police Department, Janis Lidaks, told DIENA the following: "This is an example of extraordinary irresponsibility. If military personnel were ordered to evacuate the ammunition depots, they should have been in full control of the operation. Presently, we are catching the boys, but this really only represents a fight against the consequences of the action. Actually, we have traced a few boxes, but this is nothing in comparison with the great amount of explosives that have already been spirited away from the depots. Of course, we have warned the National Guard, as well as the municipal police. But it is not within our capabilities to guard the 60 hectares on which the depots are situated. Surely, Russian armed sentinels have been placed there now, but according to unofficial reports, some soldiers are ready to close their eyes for a pack of cigarettes and let anyone in, if somebody would like to see what is inside the depots." J. Lidaks is of the opinion that an intense trade in the explosives can now be expected, and whoever is interested will be able to purchase them freely.
