FBIS4-52173 "dreas089_h_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 4 May 1994 Brunei, Malaysia & Singapore Singapore Group Signs Regional Paging Deal With U.S. Firm Group Signs Regional Paging Deal With U.S. Firm BK0705141694 Singapore THE STRAITS TIMES in English 4 May 94 p 2 BK0705141694 Singapore THE STRAITS TIMES English BFN [Text] The NTUC [National Trade Union Congress] Voice Cooperative Society has entered into a joint venture with CUE Network Corp. of the U.S. to launch an international paging service in Singapore in about six months' time. Called CUE SE Asia, the venture has an authorised capital of $1 million [Singapore dollars], said Choo Wee Khiang, chairman of NTUC Voice and an MP for Jalan Besar GRC [Group Representatives Committee], yesterday. The company will develop the use of FM subcarriers already present with the two frequencies FM 100.3 and FM 91.3 used by NTUC Radio Heart. FM subcarriers are the sidebands that separate various radio frequencies and are largely unused. Cue SE Asia will make use of FM radio stations around the world that are signed on the CUE network to transmit paging signals internationally. Subscribers to the service can choose the countries with which they want to be linked. Subscribers can be contacted in North America, Canada, China, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. Right now, there are about 100,000 subscribers in the U.S. and Canada. Subscriber numbers in Southeast Asia are expected to hit the same figure. Subscription rates have yet to be worked out. Negotiations are under way with other countries in the region, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam to be hooked up on the network in one to two years, and NTUC Voice and CUE intend to make Singapore the service hub of the region. The international paging will work only with pagers developed by CUE. These will be available in the market soon and are expected to retail at U.S. $190, the price at which they are sold in the U.S. As only Telecom can provide paging services locally until 1997, negotiations are under way for CUE SE Asia to operate the service locally. In the meantime, a satellite dish will be set up nearby, possibly on Batam, to receive and transmit signals internationally. If talks with Telecom do not come through, the pagers will only be for international messages and not local signals. Besides the international paging service, CUE SE Asia will offer other telecommunications services, the most significant of which is the differential global positioning satellites or DGPS service. This uses the same FM sidebands as the international paging service for the transmission of differential correction information. This is useful for work that involves the pinpointing of accurate locations -- navigation for instance. Talks are already under way with NTUC Comfort. DGPS can record the location of a vehicle and broadcast it back to a despatch centre. The equipment required to receive and transmit DGPS is simply a special piece of software that is attached to the CUE pager's docking platform. Mr. Choo said this use of the FM sidebands makes sound commercial sense.
