FBIS3-18995 "drweu048__a94008" FBIS-WEU-94-048-A Document Type:Daily Report 11 March 1994 ANNEX Inter-European Affairs Arianespace Announces Inquiry Into Launch Failure BR1003090794 Evry ARIANESPACE NEWSLETTER in English Feb 94 p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR1003090794 Evry ARIANESPACE NEWSLETTER Language: English Article Type:BFN [Unattributed article: "After Flight 63"] [Text] On January 25, 1994, fourteen hours after the failure of Flight 63, Arianespace Chairman Charles Bigot held a press conference in Kourou. His initial comments were: "Flight 63 was interrupted after a perfect sequence of preparation, checking and launch operations, after normal functioning of the first and second stages and strap-on boosters, after equally correct separation and ignition of the third stage, followed by normal operation for approximately 80 seconds. Then the third staged stopped. The two satellites could not be placed into orbit, and the stage and satellites fell into the Atlantic Ocean, a few thousand miles from the African coast. ``We would like to report our apologies and regrets to our two customers, for an accident which deprives them of the services expected from their satellites, TURKSAT 1A and EUTELSAT II-F6. We deeply share their disappointment (...). ``After 26 highly-successful launches over close to four years, we have placed 40 satellites into orbit in a most satisfactory and, in most cases, remarkable manner. Today, Ariane meets with a failure. We take this failure very seriously, but also calmly, because we know that our launch system is reliable. We also know that it is not perfect. We will therefore actively look for all causes of the accident and correct them. This will make our system stronger and more reliable. ``As of now, our analysis of the initial parameters is as follows: The third-stage engine stopped because the liquid oxygen turbopump stopped after about 80 seconds of operation, thus ending the oxygen flow. The turbopump itself stopped functioning because of abnormal heating of a turbopump shaft bearing. ``Naturally, it is now up to the Inquiry Board to thoroughly analyze and understand the reasons for this excessive heating. ``The nature of this event allow us to hope for a diagnosis and the definition of corrective measures without delay. With the help of the entire industry, the French space agency CNES and the European Space Agency, Arianespace is determined to make all efforts required for a quick resumption of launches. ``We maintain our launch objectives over the duration of our order book, as Arianespace's priority is always to serve its customers. Naturally, all further information will be given to them in priority, in accordance with the policy of total transparency which presides over all our customer relations.'' [Box, p 1] Appointment of the Inquiry Board Following the failure of Ariane's 63rd flight on January 24, 1994, Arianespace, in liaison with ESA and CNES, has set up on January 26 an Inquiry Board composed of independent experts. Its mandate is to establish the causes of the failure of Flight 63 and to recommend all the necessary measures to be taken to correct the anomalies found. The Inquiry Board is composed of the following members: - President: Jean-Paul Herteman (SNECMA, France) - Vice-president: Eric Slachmuylders (ESA) Carl-Helmut Dederra (DASA, Germany) Mauro Varetti (FIAT, Italy) Jean-Paul Bozet (Universite de Liege, Belgium) Michel Pons (CNES, France) It is requested that the Board submit its initial conclusions in mid-February.
