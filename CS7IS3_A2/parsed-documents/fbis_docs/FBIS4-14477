"The Kazakh president seeks to replace the moribund structures of the Commonwealth of Independent States with new organisations resembling more the European Union than the USSR," the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes. Praising "the reasonable, realistic and vital" idea of creating the EAU, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA daily stresses that this initiative "was recently agitating the minds of politicians in post-Soviet space". The PRAVDA newspaper shares this appraisal, noting that "the euphoria of sovereignties has passed". The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper forecasts that "the idea of reforming the CIS will be amplified at the next Commonwealth summit. Summing up the results of the Kazakh president's visit to Moscow, which ended on Wednesday, PRAVDA stresses that the sides at the talks "made real headway to bring the two republics closer together". Commenting on the results of the Russian-Kazakh summit, the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper dwells at length on duel citizenship which the Kazakh side refused to discuss. According to the newspaper, "this question was postponed: the problem of Russians in Kazakhstan still remains". "The CIS development will be stable if all the Commonwealth members take into account the principles of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to a greater extent," CSCE Secretary-General Wilhelm Hoeynck said in an interview with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. He sees the CSCE's task in 1994 "in creating stability in the region between Vancouver to Vladivostok" and favours the development of contacts between the CSCE and the CIS. Newspapers single out, among other topics, the survival of Russian science. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI notes that scientists are at the bottom of the list of civil servants for the remuneration of their labour. According to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, this causes the outflow of specialists to other spheres of employment, which means the doom of fundamental science. "There will be no top-notch specialists in Russia by the year 2013," the newspaper cites calculations by the institute of social and political research of the Russian academy of sciences. "Medical science will not survive, if authorities brush it aside," president of the Russian academy of medical sciences Valentin Pokrovskiy said in an interview with PRAVDA. He substantiates the need for state investments in medical fundamental science. According to the scientist, it "takes the 32nd place out of 35 as to its financing". Speaking of non-payments in industry, Economics Institute director Leonid Abalkin claims in his article in NEZAVISMAYA GAZETA that "non-payments were provoked by the Finance Ministry's actions". The author examines in detail questions of employment and investments in the Russian economy. The Russian President's special representative Vitaliy Churkin commented in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on particulars of an agreement concluded on Wednesday between Krajina Serbs and Croats at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. According to Churkin, "a new round of talks on economic issues between Croats and Krajina Serbs can be arranged" in Zagreb in two weeks' time. "Work on reorganising security bodies has been completed. A new Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCIS) has been established in Russia," FCIS director Sergey Stepashin told KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. He described activities of Russian secret services. Lithuania "has no such service as counterintelligence" Vytautas Petkevicius, chaiman of the Lithuanian parliament committee on national security, said in an interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. According to Petkevicius, the small Lithuanian Army "has not even regulations, let alone a military doctrine" and will be used for "putting down conflicts". Writing in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, Sakha (Yakut) President Mikhail nikolayev opposed the dumping of the federal treaty which has not become a part of the Russian constitution. Regarding the treaty as "a long-term document", Nikolyaev calls for "making it an object of every-day policy".
