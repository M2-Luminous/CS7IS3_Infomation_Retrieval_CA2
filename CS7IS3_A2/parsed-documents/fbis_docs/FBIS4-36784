FBIS4-36784 "drnes114_c_94002" FBIS-NES-94-114 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 Egypt Continued Relations With Sudan Urged Continued Relations With Sudan Urged NC0306142494 Cairo MENA in Arabic 0610 GMT 3 Jun 94 NC0306142494 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH has affirmed that President Husni Mubarak has defined clear and stable principles governing Egypt's Arab and international relations. It said that some of the most important principles are mutual respect, non-interference in the internal affairs of others, and respect for the privacy of each state. The newspaper clarified in a comment today that Egypt is keen on extending bridges of friendship and cooperation with all countries and people within the framework of these principles. The newspaper said that throughout history, Egypt has maintained relations of cooperation and brotherhood with the fraternal Sudanese people as a result of an imposed geographic reality that cannot be changed. However, there is also a joint factor that has preserved the lives of the two peoples since time immemorial: the immortal Nile River. The newspaper added that Egypt has always cooperated with the successive Sudanese governments in private projects to maximize use of and benefits from the waters of the Nile to serve agricultural development in the two fraternal countries. The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH continues: And as the great Nile River kept its promises throughout history and provided the two fraternal people in Egypt and Sudan with their water needs, Egypt also kept its promises in cooperating with Sudan to exploit the waters, irrespective of who took over power in Khartoum. Egypt always adhered to a firm principle which is that when it deals with Sudan, it deals first and foremost with a fraternal people. The newspaper affirmed that Egypt has always stood alongside united Sudan, from the deep south to the extreme north. Egypt believes that Sudan is the natural hinterland of Egypt without any discrimination, and perhaps also without any account-keeping. The newspaper expressed its regret that many things have changed in Khartoum, particularly inside the Sudanese Government, which is in coalition with the former Oxford student-transformed imam, who wants to rule Sudan with fire and steel in the name of Islam and religion, while Islam has absolutely nothing to do with it. Concluding its comment, the newspaper said that we view our relations with Sudan in a grander way than Imam al-Turabi views this relationship. He wants to destroy relations with Egypt. The paper affirmed that these relations are relations between two fraternal people linked geographically and historically with each other. The two peoples will not allow these historic and geographic relations between them to be harmed in any way.
