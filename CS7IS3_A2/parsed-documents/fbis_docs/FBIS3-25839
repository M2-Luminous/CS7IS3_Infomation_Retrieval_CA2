And city businessmen also signed more contracts to build engineering projects in foreign countries. The city's industrial achievements in other sectors during the past year were also remarkable, said Shen. The city has sped up its infrastructure construction and renovated buildings to provide a sound investment climate in 1993. The efforts have paid off. Four State-level development zones have received 377 projects worth $941.8 million. Construction of three provincial-level economic and development zones is also underway, he added.
