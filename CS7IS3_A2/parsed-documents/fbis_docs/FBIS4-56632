In 1993, the Consultative Group granted Peru aid worth $900 million to fight poverty, of which $500 million have already been disbursed. In his stopover in Washington, Camet will meet with Manuel Estela, Peruvian delegate before the IDB [Inter-American Development Bank] and director of the National Compensation and Social Development Fund (Foncodes), who will travel with Camet to Paris. During the group's meeting on 9 and 10 May, the Peruvian representatives will explain how the funds provided by the World Bank are being used. A study will also be made of a report prepared by an IMF mission which recently visited Peru to evaluate the degree of poverty, Peruvian financial needs, and the functioning of the government organizations in charge of the struggle against poverty. According to an Economy Ministry source, the main goal of the Peruvian delegates will be to commit the group to act as a promoter of foreign investment in Peru, and especially investment for the social sector. The Paris meeting will also be attended by World Bank directors; representatives of the governments committed to the aid approved last year, such as the United States, Japan, and Germany; and delegates from the IMF, the IDB, and the UN organizations linked to the struggle against poverty.
