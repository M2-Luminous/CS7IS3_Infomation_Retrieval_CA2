There were definite achievements and serious shortcomings in the military-technical policy of the Soviet state. In our country, concern about arms development and the technical equipment of the army and navy was considered to the most important state task and all national economic activity was subordinated to the interests of carrying out that task. However, for some time expenditures for military needs exceeded all reasonable limits, as a result of which not only the economy but also the technological base of defense itself turned out to be undermined. The absence of a systems approach to the resolution of defense problems was one of the primary causes of this: political, economic and military-technical issues were resolved in isolation from each other in a number of cases. The absence of an integrated military-technical policy concept that takes into account all of these factors resulted in the fact that many arms development issues were resolved without the proper foresight and were extremely extravagant in an economic sense. And the fact that a military-technical policy concept is being developed for the first time in the Russian Federation is a definite guarantee that the task of the technical equipment of the army and the navy in subsequent years will be carried out in a more intelligent, purposeful, and rational manner. However, the problems that must lie at the foundation of military-technical policy so far remain unclear. Let's cite two examples. The 7th Russian Federation Congress of People's Deputies Decree tasked the Armed Forces with the following main missions: deterrence from unleashing any wars that are directed against Russia through the presence of strategic nuclear forces; and, efficient neutralization of military conflicts using highly mobile general purpose forces. The decree does not provide for the readiness of the Armed Forces to repel large-scale aggression. But under that approach, the armed forces must be capable of inflicting a retaliatory strike with unacceptable losses for the enemy for deterrence "from unleashing any wars". This will be impossible with the planned strategic nuclear forces reductions and the weakening of our antimissile warning system and especially in the event of the development of an antiballistic missile (ABM) defense system on the territory of the United States. Therefore, we will have to, as some people suggest, shift to the concept adopted in the United States and in NATO as a whole which envisions that a nuclear first strike will be inflicted in response to any aggression (including with the employment of conventional weapons). Then we need to review our military doctrine and military-technical policy which is inadvisable for political and other considerations. It is advisable to also take into account the readiness to repel large-scale aggression in order to prevent having to resort to such extreme measures and at the same time to guarantee the country's military security. Even though the direct threat of large-scale aggression does not exist right now, it is impossible to completely exclude it. Another example. The draft military reform program is unambiguously oriented toward the preservation of the five-service system of the Armed Forces and the shift to three Armed Forces services is envisioned only at the second-third stages of military reform. But each Armed Forces service will develop command and control systems and equipment for all of these years, while proceeding from the existing organization. Already right now the Air Force, PVO [Air Defense], and the Ground Forces automated command and control systems do not connect to each other. What will occur in the future? The more time that passes, the more difficult it will be to emerge from these dead end situations. Therefore, already right now we need to lay the foundation for and develop a command and control system for the future Armed Forces organizational structure and we don't need to accomplish that task by Armed Forces service, but centralize it in the hands of the General Staff and the first deputy minister of defense staff. These and other examples attest to the fact that not everything is being coordinated with military-political and strategic considerations in the military-technical policy that is being developed. Therefore, we need to precisely define some military-political tenets on some issues (for example, from the point of view of Armed Forces readiness to repel large-scale aggression) and on others -- bring military-technical policy into compliance with these precepts. Special scientific-research work is needed to comprehensively research what kind of real threats to Russia can emerge, what missions its Armed Forces must be prepared to accomplish, and what the nature of armed combat could be. Only while taking this into account will we be able to judge what kind of Armed Forces are needed and what their technical equipment should be. It is impossible to judge the criteria of the sufficiency of defense and the substantiation of the military-technical policy in the abstract. We can specifically resolve these issues only once we have determined what strategic missions the Armed Forces will have to accomplish. While proceeding from the future missions and actual economic capabilities of the state, it is advisable to concentrate the primary efforts in military-technical policy on the resolution of two interrelated tasks. First of all, in the near future we must make our main emphasis on the creation of a cadre nucleus of well-equipped, flexibly-commanded and controlled, and professionally trained Armed Forces that have been reduced in effective combat strength and, in military-technical policy -- on increasing the effectiveness of scientific-research and design work that is targeted at the development of highly effective types of weapons and military equipment. Second, in the future we need to be prepared to mobilize and deploy larger Armed Forces, to create the required reserves of weapons and to transition the defense industry to a wartime footing for the technical equipment of the army and navy with the calculation of ensuring readiness to repel large-scale aggression. While considering the incomparability of our national income with the world's leading states, in military-technical policy it is important not to embark on a course of weapons and equipment development that is dictated by other states and not to attempt to develop everything that they have as it frequently occurred in the past. It is desirable to determine our own, more advantageous for us, path based upon a scientific prediction of arms development. The primary task in this sphere is to determine the direction of development and the primary specifications of new generation weapons which will occupy a dominant position in the future. While taking this into account, as a minimum we need to terminate the development and design of those types of weapons, command and control and support systems that do not meet contemporary effectiveness requirements. We also need to gradually retune the production of the defense sectors of industry in that direction and, naturally, there must be a thorough accounting of military-economic considerations to achieve a decisive concentration of our technical and production efforts to priority future weapons. In our country, there previously was an obvious overestimation of the effectiveness of our defense industry, especially from the point of view of the economic indicators of new types of weapons and equipment and unjustifiably large expenditures for the maintenance of numerous KB's [Design Bureaus], NII's [Scientific Research Institutes] and test ranges. And the lag behind the NATO countries that exists right now in intelligence, communications, navigation and weapons guidance systems and in computer and electronic equipment in general is still not being properly assessed. There has long been a need for a comprehensive study of the state of affairs in the defense sectors of industry by a special qualified commission with the subsequent adoption of the appropriate measures not only with the goal of conversion but also for increasing the effectiveness of the operations of enterprises for the country's defense. Defense enterprises could earn more resources for the resolution of future defense tasks, without resorting to additional state appropriations, with the rational implementation of conversion, the reduction of the gross output of weapons being produced, and an increase of the production of scarce civilian goods. We first of all need to eliminate the lag in circuitry and other modern technologies in order to overcome our lagging behind in the sphere of electronics, computer equipment, detection and command and control systems, and precision-guided weapons. To do that, major government decisions are needed on the concentration of financial resources and scientific forces. At the present time, the scientific-research institutions that operate in the defense sphere are dispersed and not powerful. Major research centers are needed with the concentration in them of the most talented scientists and the provision of the maximum material incentives for their activities. We also need new organs in the system of government and the military industrial complex (MIC) which would head this work. In a word, half measures or the ordinary improvement of existing structures are inadequate in this sphere. Such fundamental steps and such a concentration of financial, material, administrative and scientific efforts are needed that would ensure a quantum leap in the sphere of mastery of the most important technologies for the development of future types of weapons and military equipment in the next 5-10 years. We would like to once again direct attention to certain aspects of military-technical policy. First of all this is the improvement of military-technical information, coordination of the process of its extraction, and dissemination of innovations in the sphere of promising technologies and weapons both within the country and abroad to scientific and industrial organizations. In the developed capitalist countries, many private firms and corporations, along with the intelligence services, conduct industrial espionage. In our country, we will not be ready to do that very soon. Therefore, we need to step up work to extract needed information in the sphere of leading technology. It is impossible to collect information in an abstract manner. Military-technical information is needed to resolve certain tasks for the development of industrial technology and arms. The most qualified special organs are incapable of completely knowing and taking into account all of the information requirements on various spheres of activity and of ascertaining to which question they need to provide an answer. All the more so that general information (which is occurring right now) is not needed in scientific and practical work but information is needed first of all on such problems, the resolution of which comes up against the absence of new knowledge and the search for ways to resolve them. The need for such information, its deep essence and various nuances are revealed only with the specific examination of some or other issues in the course of their scientific research and practical resolution. And they are best of all seen by those who are directly involved with them. While considering all of this, it is exceptionally important that the interested organs of rule and NII's, while proceeding from actual requirements and in accordance with their competence, assign the tasks, define the requirements or requests, and submit requests for the kinds of information they specifically need. Further, in contrast to the United States, the underestimation of the modernization of existing types of weapons, the production and supply of spare parts to the troops, and the coordination of technical support and operation of weapons and equipment was a weak spot in our military-technical policy of past years. The number of failures, accidents and catastrophes significantly increased, weapons and equipment operating periods were shortened, and their combat effectiveness was reduced as a result of the inadequate training of compulsory service military personnel. With the examination of the issue on the coordination of Armed Forces technical support, it is desirable to ensure that we overcome the main deficiency in this sphere -- the artificial interruption of the development of weapons, weapons orders and responsibility for weapons operation and maintenance in the troops and in the fleets. This permitted the military industrial complex to force everything that they produced on the army and navy. We need the organs of rule that are involved with the development of weapons to be responsible for the operation and maintenance of weapons and equipment. Then they will more responsibly and strictly approach their orders and purchases. Right now a quite well substantiated policy is being conducted toward the formation of a Russian Federation independent military-technical policy. At the same time, we need to take into the account the cooperation that has developed in the production of the most important types of weapons within the CIS. Therefore, it is advisable for the military-technical policy concept to provide for, on the one hand, measures for the maintenance of cooperation and the founding of joint ventures with the CIS countries and, on the other hand, to conduct, in the future and when possible, a policy toward the restoration on Russian territory of the most needed enterprises without which we cannot get by. The creation of new shops under plants which need component items that were previously supplied from other republics appears to be most advantageous. While considering the enormous significance of military-technical policy, the Russian Federation President -- the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and the Government -- needs to define it in accordance with the state's military policy and economic capabilities based on the Law on Defense and the Law on National Security that were adopted by the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet. The primary military security issues must be resolved while taking into account national security interests as a whole and be examined in the Security Council within these limits. The problems of defense are scattered and cannot always be adequately resolved in a purposeful manner in the overall mass of many issues (economic, information, ecological security, and others). Therefore, besides the Security Council, it is advisable to have a Defense Council under the Russian Federation President that is made up of the highest officials who are responsible for defense matters. We could have, under the Defense Council, a team of consultants (experts) to render skilled assistance from among the experienced military leaders who lead designers and scientists. We should also preserve state rule of the defense industry. Obviously, it will be impossible to totally transfer to a market economy in the defense industry in a short period of time. The primary defense enterprises will remain state property for a long time yet as it is being done in certain Western countries. Therefore, a government organ is needed (of the military industrial complex type with more limited functions than previously) which would be involved with the coordination of the activities of defense enterprises. The Russian Defense Industry Committee that exists at the present time is incapable of accomplishing this task in a full-fledged manner. The Ministry of Defense, jointly with other state organs and representatives of the defense industry, should actively participate in the development of the military-technical policy and play a leading role in the determination of the prospects for arms development, their production programs, and the priorities for the technical equipment of the army and navy. Right now, in principle, the correct course has been taken that the Ministry of Defense is becoming the customer of all types of weapons and equipment. This will permit it to overcome the former weak spot in the implementation of military-technical policy when the military industrial complex in a number of cases forced on the Armed Forces not those weapons and command and control systems that were needed but those that were more advantageous to produce. The monopolistic position of the industrial enterprises and the absence of competition resulted in price increases for military products and a technological lag behind the leading Western countries. Under conditions of the market economy, the transition to the new system, when all arms orders will be carried out through the Ministry of Defense, requires a more powerful and ramified staff which would develop the arms program, coordinate military-technical research and development of new types of weapons, track the work of various design bureaus and the production capabilities of enterprises, distribute orders, conclude contracts, participate in the testing and selection of new models of weapons, implement financing of NIOKR [scientific research and experimental design work] and military orders, and resolve many other issues. For example, in the United States, the staff that accomplishes these tasks numbers over 25,000 people and, along with lawyers and temporarily hired experts -- up to 50,000 people. For decades we have proceeded from F. Engels' provision that the development of weapons and equipment determines the development of military art. In principle, this provision is correct. However, now when weapons are increasing in cost, a more active role of military science itself is required which must more objectively determine the main directions of arms development and substantiate specific operational-strategic and tactical requirements and the description of the weapons of the future. The impact of the operational-strategic aspect must increase. Therefore, at the present time, one of the most important problems consists of organizing coordinated work on the elaboration of the operational-strategic and military-technical ideology of arms development while taking into account the military-economic considerations. Only on this basis can we implement real program planning of arms development which has never occurred in our country and which, unfortunately, still hasn't occurred. As we know, in the United States the assignment of program-target tasks is carried out at the strategic planning level. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, jointly with the leaders of the Armed Forces services and other Department of Defense agencies and while relying on DARPA (a strategic planning agency) research, accomplishes that task. Under our conditions, it is desirable to consolidate the leading role of the General Staff in operational-strategic aspects and the role of the First Deputy Minister of Defense and the chief of weapons on military-technical issues, which must be continuously resolved while taking strategic considerations into account. With this goal, it appears to be advisable to: have an Armed Forces High Scientific Council in the Ministry of Defense under the leadership of the Minister of Defense which would examine the most important operational-strategic and military-technical problems; unified planning of scientific work in the Armed Forces is needed while taking into account strategic, military-technical and economic aspects. The General Staff's military-scientific directorate, jointly with the chief of weapons directorate and other organs of rule, should accomplish this task. In the sense of the implementation of scientific research, the High Scientific Council must rely on the Armed Forces Structural Development and Reform Directorate, on the General Staff Strategic Research Center and the lead military-technical scientific-research institute. Reorganization of the entire network of scientific-research institutions is also needed. As a result of the elimination of the former ministries of the defense sectors of industry, we should study the feasibility of uniting the more important NII's of industry with the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense NIU [Scientific Research Directorate]. According to the data of League of Defense Sectors of Industry President A.N. Shulunov, at the present time there are approximately 3,000 defense enterprises, scientific research and design organizations in the Russian Federation. Right now all of them to some degree or other are experiencing difficulties with finances and are conducting a struggle for survival. This is leading not only to the dispersal of resources. Gradually the entire defense industry could collapse. Therefore, no matter how painful it might be, we need to painstakingly weigh everything, assess actual capabilities and make fundamental decisions: what NII's, KB's and enterprises to retain and, consequently, to help them more and to completely terminate the financing of which enterprises, NII's and KB's. Then we can at least save the most important. Several words regarding the formation of the military budget. In the Soviet Union, it was customary that Gosplan, the Ministry of Finances, the Ministry of Defense and other sectors associated with defense production would compile the requests (proposals) on the formation of the defense budget. Then, after a complex system of processes and a struggle among themselves for the priorities of the various Armed Forces services, the proposals that were coordinated with the appropriate departments of the CPSU Central Committee and military industrial complex were submitted to the Politburo (Defense Council) where the decision was ultimately made on the amount and allocation of the defense budget. But many expenditures for defense needs (for example, on nuclear power engineering and others) went to different ministries and were not included in the defense budget. Therefore, it would be difficult to judge just how much is actually being spent on defense. Only four men practically knew the true picture of the military budget: the General Secretary, the Council of Ministers Chairman, the Minister of Defense, and the Chief of the General Staff. This has impeded a correct assessment of the cost of defense and has resulted in each department attempting to grab as much as possible for itself. The military industrial complex managed to gradually place its own people on the staff of the Central Committee, the Council of Ministers, Gosplan and other organs and they defended the interests of their "native" sectors of industry in isolation from the interests of the matter as a whole, sometimes without taking into account the General Staff's proposals. The procedures for the formation of the military budget that were recently established mainly ensure that the former narrow spots are being negotiated and, in principle, appear to be acceptable. But three weak spots still remain. First of all, an integrated and substantiated assessment of defense expenditures that encompasses all needs and requests has not been totally attained; quite a few incidental, unanticipated expenditures are emerging; the criteria for accounting for the rate of inflation and indexing planned expenditures have not been elaborated which disorganizes the entire budget system and impedes the conclusion of contracts with defense enterprises. Second, the policy that is being conducted, that is oriented first of all on sending resources for the maintenance of the army and navy and only that which remains is utilized to purchase arms, is implementable in practice only until certain limits are reached, and exceeding those limits will result in the destruction of the defense industry's viability. We need to take into account not only the current but also the future needs of the army and industry. Third, and the most dangerous -- is the reduction of expenditures for NIOKR. Despite the recognition of NIOKR priorities in words, as before we are not attaining the concentration of scientific forces and finances for priority tasks associated with the development of future weapons. In the United States in the 1970's, the advanced research agency's (DARPA) budget was doubled every four years and, in the 1980's, every two years. The widespread involvement of the most talented civilian scientists on contract only for the time of the accomplishment of specific research tasks permitted them to increase the volume of research work without expanding appropriations. In the United States, a new weapon is developed only when an existing weapon is not subject to modernization. This provides a great savings. For example, the installation of cruise missiles on an obsolete B-52 aircraft transformed it into a new strategic weapon with minimal expenditures. It is also desirable to separate a weapons and equipment modernization program in our country, having tied it to the tasks of repairing and supplying spare parts and in general with the problem of extending the operating periods of weapons and equipment. In our view, these are some considerations and steps that should facilitate the improvement of work on the formation of the military-technical policy.
