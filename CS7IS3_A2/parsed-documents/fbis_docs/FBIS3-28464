The White House officially confirmed Friday that it has received Kim's message through American envangelist Billy Graham, who visited Pyongyang last week. White House Spokesperson Dee Dee Myers declined to disclose the content of the message. She said she simply did not know anything about the message delivered to anthony lake, national security adviser to Clinton. Many diplomatic sources are said to believe that Kim's message could very well contain his "general wish" to see an improvement in bilateral relations between Washington and Pyongyang, rather than any concrete proposal on resolving the North Korean nuclear problem. Nevertheless, a feeling of vague expectation was rising that a dramatic breakthrough may come in the stalled negotiations on the North Korean nuclear issue between Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Regardless of Kim Il-song's message, both hawks and doves in the Clinton administration and politics are proceeding with their respective preparations for measures on the North Korean nuclear question. On the day the Kim message was delivered, for instance, the U.S. representative to the United Nations briefed the five permanent members of the security council about the latest on the North Korean issue. The briefing was apparently aimed at preparing the security council for possible reference of the North Korean question in case Pyongyang and the IAEA fail to reach agreement on inspection of North Korean facilities. Billy Graham met with Kim Il-song and conveyed a brief and general message from clinton that the United States hoped there would be progress in the nuclear talks, sources said. In response to this verbal message, Kim Il-song took the unprecedented step of replying to the U.S. President and Graham, who had volunteered to act as a messenger, apparently sensed the importance of the situation and dispatched an aide to Washington ahead of him carrying Kim's message. The message was deivered to the White House on Friday morning and as of Friday afternoon, the U.S. State Department had not relayed its content to the South Korean side. Many diplomatic sources say that if North Korea was to make a proposal accepting comprehensive IAEA inspections of all its nuclear facilities, it would do so through diplomatic channels. Therefore, they speculate, the chances are slim that Kim's message contained important and specific proposals on the nuclear problem. Rather, Kim Il-song would probably have reiterated North Korea's position that it has neither the intention nor the ability to develop nuclear weapons, and instead spelled out ways to improve U.S.-North Korea relations, sources believe. It goes without saying, the sources say, that Kim's message would not have contained the kind of "hardline tone" as an earlier statement by the North Korean Foreign Ministry that called for either "dialogue or war." After all, they say, it was a message from the president of one country to another. In any event, the North Korean nuclear issue has reached a crossroad from where it can proceed either to resolution or U.N. sanctions. If North Korea and the IAEA fail to reach agreement on inspections by Feb. 21, when the IAEA convenes a meeting of its board of directors in Vienna, the United States will have no choice but to take the issue to the Security Council. Friday's U.S. briefing of the five permanent Security Council members was seen as an expression of the United States' determination to resolve the nuclear issue. At the same time, the United States apparently wanted to convey "the hardline current" of the international community on the matter to China, Pyongyang's only remaining ally, which has been opposing U.N. economic sanctions against North Korea. But North Korea is well aware that it faces further isolation from the international community if it fails to reach some kind of compromise with the IAEA. South Korea and the United States, for their part, also realize that there is a limit to the effectiveness of U.N. economic sanctions against North Korea. As a result, the United States and North Korea will do their utmost to avoid confrontation and reach a compromise. In other words, North Korea is likely to make another proposal before Feb. 21 so that its negotiations with the IAEA are not broken off completely. Or, the United States and North Korea may resume contacts in an effort to keep their dialogue going. From this point of view, Kim Il-song's message could be part of the process.
