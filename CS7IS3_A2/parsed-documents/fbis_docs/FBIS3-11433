The presidential decision was immediately understood as a political solution aimed at pleasing a party that had recently decided to join the new government alliance. After the announcement all sorts of controversies have risen in the country's political and legal circles. A decision which in the beginning seems to have originated as the result of the new government election coalition has now turned into a real conflict in which all sorts of legal theories have developed. As a consequence of this situation, the National Assembly Board of Directors has proceeded to deem President Endara's appointment as unconstitutional before the Supreme Court of Justice. As a result of the National Assembly's position, President Endara has said he has ample authority to carry out this or any other appointment he may seem fit. Nevertheless, in short, the national Constitution is quite clear with respect to the distribution of duties between ministers of state. First of all, it demands the existence of a law. No one can deny the president's right, granted by the Constitution, to carry out the appointment of ministers of state. Likewise, it is also true that right is in effect when the National Assembly has approved the establishment of the position and apportions sufficient funds as part of the nation's income and expense budget. President Endara's supposed freedom to appoint officials as established in Paragraph One of Article 178 of the Constitution, supporting grounds of that appointment, is not enough, not even given an analysis of budgetary and personnel administration regulations. Much less is it justified prior to an electoral period. If after four years of government for whatever reason the president decided the creation of a new position in the state bureaucracy was necessary, this must have been included in the state's budget. Even if the appointment was that of a presidential adviser, as they have tried to justify, it must have been made through the signing of the president and the corresponding minister. The appointment of the minister without portfolio or an adviser was legally and fiscally validated through one single signature, that of the president of the Republic. What is even worse, the presidential measure has entailed other important consequences such as the decisions of the Cabinet Council, which should be signed by the new member. This holds particularly true given there is no law creating this post, and the minister without portfolio does not have functions. It would be legally an appointment without a specific objective, which could border on a criminal offense against the public administration. We believe the appointment of a minister without portfolio is another of the so many bloopers President Endara has made during his administration. The minister without portfolio will be a minister without specific functions, receiving a high salary and without a justification. Should the figure of the minister without portfolio be maintained, the Cabinet Councils would include the body of advisers, making its functioning inoperative. This would also adversely affect the economic policy of reducing the government payroll, for which so many lower-ranking public employees were sacrificed. Regardless of the Supreme Court of Justice's ruling on this issue, the appointment made by President Endara to please a political demand represents an unpardonable sneer at the Panamanian people, particularly the thousands of Panamanian people who are unemployed and the very public servants who have struggled for a wage hike. While government leaders have said they do not have enough money to meet the demands of thousands of fellow Panamanians who yearn for a job in the government or higher wages, the government proceeds to appoint a minister without portfolio without any legal or fiscal basis. In an attempt to analyze the legality of this issue, it must be asked "What annual report would the new minister present? What report would be explained before the Assembly? What would be the obligations and rights of this new public servant, and has he previously filed a declaration of his properties?" That is why the announcement on the reaction of the Legislative Assembly, which has filed an unconstitutionality writ against the appointment, is so important. This decision is not the result of an individual's feelings, rather, the institutional reaction of that important state branch. This represents a forewarning against the actions of the president of the Republic. The state is not a private farm in which decisions are made arbitrarily. The legal order must prevail not only in the defense of the state but also out of respect for those holding government offices. Consequently, given the above presumably legal justifications, the principle of legality, which does not permit the creation of an arbitrary figure, must prevail.
