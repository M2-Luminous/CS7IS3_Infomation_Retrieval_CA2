In many places bad weather reduced the number of people wishing to demonstrate on the streets under red banners. The number of demonstrators in Novgorod amounted to no more than a thousand. In St. Petersburg there were two simultaneous rallies. The first was a rally of the Russian Communist Workers' Party together with the "Working Leningrad" movement. About 3000 persons took part in it. Only a few dozens arrived to take part in the rally of the united independent trade unions. The procession in Yaroslavl was small. In Arkhangelsk, Kaliningrad, and Makhachkala there were no more than 150 people listening to the speakers, although it did not rain there. In Tver and Kaluga, Mayday was celebrated by up to 2000 citizens, mainly veterans. In Bryansk and Petrozavodsk, approximately 500 people took part in the rallies. In every case the main organizers were the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the Russian Communist Workers' Party, the All-Union Communist Party, and all-Russia and local trade union organizations. In Tula the largest rally for the last two years was held in the center of the town. Ulyanovsk and Voronezh were exceptional: In the first 10,000 people took part in the rally, in the second there was an exceptionally large number both of demonstrators and of organizers of the Mayday demonstrations. The latter included the Federation of Independent Trade Unions, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the trade union of small entrepreneurs "Solidarnost", the Russian Communist Workers' Party and the "Trudovoy Voronezh" [Working Voronezh] movement. At the rallies, along with slogans about the reinstatement of the USSR and the transfer of power to the Soviets, there were demands to put an end to the economic chaos and chronic non-payments, to put an end to crime, unemployment, and the infringement of citizens' social guarantees. The demand for the Russian Government to resign and for a change in the course of the reforms was common to all the towns. In St. Petersburg, Yaroslavl and Kaliningrad the recently signed Treaty on Public Accord was criticized. At the rally in Voronezh, where various political forces presented a united front, a resolution was adopted which contained a number of radical demands addressed to the Russian president, the government and the Federal Assembly. The special feature of the St. Petersburg rallies was the unwillingness of the trade union organizers to have anything in common with the communist rally, a situation that almost led to a clash. The veterans in Kaluga were unanimous in voting for an anti- government resolution. At the same time in Tver their meeting was not particularly emotional. The speakers stressed that they would not support a civil war but were in favor of the revival of Russia. Signatures were collected at the same rally for the repeal of the Russian-American military exercises at the "Totskoye" test range in the Orenburg Oblast. A peaceful atmosphere reigned on Mayday in Belgorod. The oblast trade unions' council and the administration of the oblast center invited the citizens to a celebration of the spring and of labor. The motto of the holiday was: Workers' solidarity. Its program included a brass band concert, performances by the best amateur artists' groups, a circus performance, meetings of veterans, and a festival "Sport for everyone".
