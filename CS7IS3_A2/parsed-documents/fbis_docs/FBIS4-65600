The Foreign Ministry and the Defense Ministry take different views on whether one should comply with a UN request for the dispatch of German blue helmets to Rwanda. They would mainly be medical soldiers. Last week, the FRG Government received a relevant inquiry from Kofi Annan, UN undersecretary general for blue-helmet issues. While the Foreign Ministry is advocating participation in humanitarian actions, the Hardthoehe [Defense Ministry] and the Chancellor's Office reacted reservedly. On Tuesday [17 May] evening, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) and Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) agreed for the time being only on the dispatch of an Air Force Transall transport aircraft to the country shaken by civil war. In this way, they reacted to a request of the United Nations, which urgently needs a replacement for a defective Canadian plane. However, before the dispatch of the Transall, the hazards of the situation are to be analyzed. So far, the Canadians have flown relief flights throughout Rwanda as well as to the capital, Kigali. Apparently, the ministers have not yet discussed in detail the inquiry from the under secretary general of 12 May. It not only asks for the dispatch of an Air Force transport unit, but also for a medical contingent. Apparently, the United Nations is thinking of participation similar to that in Cambodia, where the Bundeswehr operated a hospital. Since the mission in Somalia, the armed forces have also been in possession of a field hospital. In the inquiry the dispatch of 50 armored personnel carriers is also requested. Thus, the Bundeswehr would be able to take care of refugees and to attend to a large number of injured people. After the positive decision on the dispatch of the Transall aircraft, it was stated in the Chancellor's Office that it has to be carefully examined whether the employment of medics is also possible. On Monday, the Security Council decided to increase the UN contingent in Rwanda to 5,500 men. Three African states -- Ghana, Tanzania, and Nigeria -- already want to provide contingents. The United Nations knows from its experience in Somalia that only armed forces with a highly sophisticated technology come into consideration for transportation, supplies, and medical help. Thus, the African states depend on help. In the Foreign Ministry, participation in the support for humanitarian aid is advocated. However, details have not yet been discussed. Foreign Minister Kinkel talked of the inconceivable figure of 500,000 murdered people. This is a tragedy of an unimagined dimension. In its rather positive attitude, the Foreign Ministry also seems to be guided by the consideration that the FRG, as a candidate for a permanent seat on the Security Council, must not shirk from helping. Apparently, however, there is no intention to make an offer overeagerly either. A quiet environment is important as the prerequisite for a mission, it was stated. Kinkel said that he is personally in favor of helping Rwanda. Genocide is taking place there. According to his assessment, however, "boundless disappointment" is prevailing in the states that might intervene in Rwanda. The outcome of the mission in Somalia and the helplessness of Europe and the world in Yugoslavia are depressing. He is noticing "immense caution" everywhere. The Hardthoehe, however, reacted to the inquiry with great reserve. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe stressed again and again that he rules out another UN mission before the judgment of the Constitutional Court on the "out-of-area" missions. Military circles also point out that the Bundeswehr is overtaxed regarding materiel and staff. Moreover, German interests cannot be perceived in a mission in Rwanda, since the military situation is confused and therefore dangerous. For every medical soldier, three paratroopers are needed as protection. Their dispatch results in endless unclarified questions that already caused great difficulties for the coalition before Somalia or the AWACS mission over former Yugoslavia. After all, one does not exactly notice any pressure from the United Nations. Rather, the excitement is homemade, it was stated.
