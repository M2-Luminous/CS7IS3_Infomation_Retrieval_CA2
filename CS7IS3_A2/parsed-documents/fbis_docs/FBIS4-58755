In an interview with AL-JUMHURIYAH published today, 'Arafat says that President Mubarak made phenomenal efforts to accomplish this and that he has always been the best support, authority, and honest adviser to the Palestinians. 'Arafat affirmed that the Palestinians are fully prepared to enter Gaza and Jericho, pointing out that he will enter Jericho in May to do his job as chairman of the Palestinian National Authority. President Mubarak has been our refuge whenever we encountered obstacles. If it were not for his endurance, his good experience with the Israelis, and his firmness we would not have been able to restore the lands, 'Arafat said. Asked why he refused to sign the maps at first, 'Arafat said that he trusted that the Palestinians would be bound by what they signed and that the same would apply to Israel. The text was inconsistent with the maps; they brought the blue file with the amended text and annexed to it the old maps with the Israeli viewpoint, he said. But after negotiations and with President Mubarak's mediation, I agreed to sign. But I noted in my handwriting that: "Jericho's borders and area and the Gaza coast are under consideration." 'Arafat said: I trust that President Mubarak will back our serious efforts to implement what we have achieved and to settle later on the problem of inconsistencies between the maps and the text. Asked about the first decision he had made after signing the agreement, 'Arafat said: In my capacity as chairman of the Palestinian National Authority, I issued general instructions to all Palestinian self-government authorities and other organs to respect the rights of Palestinians wherever they might be and regardless of political orientation. Commenting on reports that the Palestinians are not prepared to enter Gaza and Jericho in implementation of the agreement, the Palestinian president said: We are fully prepared. He affirmed that he will enter Jericho during May and that he will do his job as chairman of the Palestinian National Authority from his headquarters in Jericho. 'Arafat affirmed that every Palestinian citizen is entitled to enter Gaza and Jericho. We will prevent no one from entering and we will coordinate with the Israeli side in this connection, he said. The Palestinian president revealed that a large number of Arab and foreign states, as well as the United Nations and all its affiliated organizations have made requests to establish accredited representation offices in Jericho. He added that the European Union, the Islamic Conference Organization, and the Arab League have also requested permission to open representation offices. He welcomed all these organizations to Palestinian national soil. Touching on international assistance to the National Authority, 'Arafat said that the World Bank has decided to grant the Palestinians $2.2 billions to assist them in development efforts and in arranging their household from within. On the area of Jericho, 'Arafat said: We have reached a compromise solution on the area of Jericho. As for the Gaza coast, it will all be under the Palestinian National Authority. We agreed to give the Israeli side an opportunity to exploit some 7 kilometers for oil-related and other services. The Palestinian navy will begin operating along the coast, where we will have two ports along Gaza's Mediterranean coastal stretch. Asked about the absence of any reference to a Palestinian state in the agreement, and about the absence of any such reference in Israeli officials' statements, 'Arafat said: In spite of this, there will be Palestinian autonomy on our national soil. No people in history who obtained the right to rule themselves did not eventually establish a state.
