[VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] What changes are occurring in the Strategic Missile Troops [SMT] as a result of the reform of the RF Armed Forces that have begun and what are the prospects for the near future? [Dvorkin] The changes that are occurring in the Strategic Missile Troops have been caused mainly by the consequences of the disintegration of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, by the disintegration of the cooperation of missile weapons developers that had developed over the decades, by the difficulties of the country's economic situation, and also by the limitations established by the START treaties. Today the Missile Troops number 1,260 ICBMs in fixed and mobile basing variants that are equipped with 6,300 warheads and which are organizationally deployed in 27 position areas (PR) on the territories of Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine. In the process, the SMT formation located outside the Russian Federation numbers 361 ICBMs and 2,361 warheads in seven position areas. There are 176 launch silos (13%) located in Ukraine in two position areas near the cities of Pervomaysk and Khmelnitskiy. Missile complexes with two types of missiles are deployed in the first position area: 40 launch silos with RS-18 ICBMs and 46 launch silos with RS-22 ICBMs. There are 90 launch silos with RS-18 missiles deployed in the second position area. There are 104 launch silos (8%) of RS-20 heavy ICBM's deployed equally in the two position areas of "Derzhavinsk" and "Zhangis-Tobe" in Kazakhstan. In Belarus, by the beginning of 1993, 81 (6%) launchers with RS-12M ICBMs were deployed in the three position areas of "Mozyr", "Lida" and "Postavy". At the present time, nine of them have been redeployed onto Russian territory. There are fixed missile complexes with RS-20, RS-22, RS-18, and RS-16 missiles that are equipped with multiple independent reentry vehicles (MIRVs) and with single-warhead RS-10 and RS-11 missiles, and also mobile missile complexes in the Missile Troops inventory: rail complexes with RS-22 multi-warhead missiles and ground-based complexes with RS-12M single-warhead missiles. The share of fixed missile complexes in the SMT formation by number of launchers is approximately 70% and, by number of warheads -- approximately 90%, and the share of mobile missile complexes is 30% and 10%, respectively. The fixed missile complexes support accomplishment of retaliatory-counterstroke strike [otvetno-vstrechnyy udar] and retaliatory [otvetnyy udar] strike missions. Mobile missile complexes play a main role in supporting the SMT formation's effectiveness in a retaliatory strike after bringing pressure to bear against the position areas. The existing SMT formation consists of 64% of the warheads and 57% of the weapon platforms of our strategic nuclear forces. A large portion (60%) of the missiles of fixed missile complexes (RS-20's modifications 1 and 2, RS-18's, RS-16's, RS-10's and RS-11's) were placed on combat alert duty at the beginning of the 1970's and at the present time the duration of their operation totals 11-19 years. Approximately 15/% of the missiles of the fixed missile complexes (RS-20's modification 3 and RS-22's) are the latest generation missiles that were developed by "Yuzhnoye" KB [Design Bureau] (Dnepropetrovsk). Of the 278 RS-20 heavy ICBMs deployed, 196 missiles of the first two modifications were placed on combat alert duty in 1976-1980. The process that has begun to withdraw them from the effective combat strength will be completed in the next 10 years. Of the 82 RS-20 modification 3 ICBMs that were deployed in 1988-1991, 24 missiles are deployed in Kazakhstan and 58 -- in Russia. They must be removed from combat alert duty by the expiration of the prescribed operating periods, that is, no later than 2005 and, when the START II Treaty is taken into account -- by the year 2003. By 2005, it will be necessary to scrap the RS-16 and RS-22 light ICBMs that are deployed at the present time and we also will have to scrap the RS-18 missiles if we don't manage to extend their maintenance periods. In 1987-1991, 92 RS-22 10-warhead ICBMs were deployed in the rail and fixed variants. Based upon operating periods and treaty limitations, they will also be removed by 2003. Single-warhead ICBM's are represented in the SMT by three types: RS-10's and RS-12's -- fixed basing; RS-12M's -- mobile basing. Deployment of the first two types of missiles was carried out in 1971-1981. At the present time, they are being removed from combat alert duty. We propose completing this process during the next three years. Highly-survivable mobile ground-based complexes with RS-12M ICBMs have been introduced into the effective combat strength of the SMT since 1985. Assessments indicate that, regardless of the START I and START II treaties, we will need to remove and scrap approximately 1,200 missiles, which are 95% of the existing SMT formation, by 2005. According to the terms of the START I Treaty, the effective combat strength of the Missile Troops is authorized to have up to 1,000 launchers and 3,000 warheads. We planned to ensure the development of this formation through modernization of the RS-12M single-warhead missile and its deployment in mobile ground-based and fixed variants, and maintenance of the RS-20, RS-22 and RS-18 missiles in the effective combat strength until the year 2000 with the extension of their operating periods and subsequent augmentation of their strength using the latest modifications of RS-20 ICBMs and the modernized RS-22 missile. The breakdown of the cooperation of SMT weapons manufacturers has disrupted these plans. Reproduction became impossible and the possibilities for extending the operating periods of the newest ICBMs with MIRVs have been restricted. With the preservation of the START I Treaty and under the new conditions, it would be necessary to conduct experimental-design work in short periods of time (3-4 years) and create the cooperation of developers and manufacturers of Russian ICBMs with MIRVs for the timely replenishment of ICBMs with MIRVs in order to begin their deployment in the SMT formation to replace the RS-20's and RS-22's by the end of the 1990's. However, obtaining the required financing to conduct experimental-design work, and testing and deployment of the required number of ICBMs with MIRVs under the conditions that have developed is quite problematic. I need to say that the terms of the START II Treaty permit us to substantially smooth over the negative consequences for our country of the breakdown of the cooperation of SMT weapons developers since it is easier to create the formation of the SMT and strategic nuclear weapons as a whole that is comparable in combat capabilities with the U.S. strategic offensive forces formation and thereby ensures maintenance of the military strategic balance at a lower level of nuclear confrontation. The START II Treaty limitations provide a fundamental capability to the Missile Troops to have up to 1,200 or more single-warhead missile launchers, depending on the development of the naval and aircraft components of the strategic nuclear forces. The specific distribution of the number of warheads and weapon platforms among the components of the strategic nuclear forces triad must be determined by the military-political and domestic economic situation in Russia that is taking shape. We propose carrying out the deployment of the formation in the 19 existing position areas on RF territory. In accordance with the provisions of the START II Treaty, a significant portion of the single-warhead missiles in the fixed variant can be deployed in reequipped heavy missile (90 silos) and light ICBM with MIRV launch silos. In accordance with the terms of the START II Treaty, the number of Missile Troops position areas is being reduced in relation to the current number by eight positions: seven position areas in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan and one in the Russian Federation. In the process, the personnel strength of the RF SMT must be reduced insignificantly which is associated with the increase of the SMT's mobile formation. In contrast to fixed missile complexes, several times as many personnel are required per launch crew in mobile missile complex subunits. Under conditions of the deep reductions in accordance with the START II Treaty, the SMT will be capable as before of playing the role of a leading component of the strategic nuclear forces which is caused by its high combat capabilities. Assessments indicate that, despite the reduction of the share of the SMT per number of warheads from 64% to 30% at the present time in accordance with the START II Treaty, their contribution in a strategic nuclear forces potential retaliatory strike even increases as a result of the increase of the formation's survivability and better operational specifications for the functioning of the SMT combat command and control system. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] What is occurring with the SMT large formations in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine? [Dvorkin] The positions of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine with regard to the nuclear weapons deployed on their territory is having a definite impact on the prospects for SMT development and implementation of the START treaties. In accordance with the Lisbon Protocol that is an integral part of the START I Treaty, the Republic of Belarus, Republic of Kazakhstan and Ukraine reaffirmed the USSR's obligations in accordance with the START I Treaty and were obligated to accede to the 1 June 1968 Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons as participating states that do not have nuclear weapons. Taking into account the state obligations that have been assumed in accordance with the START I Treaty and also the bases of CIS nuclear policy that are recorded in the Agreement on Joint Measures With Regard to Nuclear Weapons (Alma-Ata, 21 December 1991) and the Agreement on Strategic Arms (Minsk, 30 December 1991), packages of bilateral agreements that regulate all of the aspects of the activities of the nuclear forces that are temporarily deployed on the territory of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine have been prepared and partially signed. Our mutual relations with the Republic of Belarus with regard to nuclear forces have been completely defined. The process of withdrawing mobile complexes with RS-12M ICBMs has already begun. Kazakhstan, just like Belarus, has ratified the START I Treaty. However, the state affiliation of the nuclear weapons and the status of the nuclear forces on the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan have not been determined at the present time. The Republic leadership's position with regard to the time periods for the elimination and withdrawal of strategic nuclear weapons is not completely clear. Nevertheless, the missile weapons specified combat readiness is being maintained, scheduled maintenance of the missile complexes is being conducted, and the first 12 missiles (six in each of two position areas) have been removed from combat alert duty. The greatest uncertainty is being preserved with regard to the nuclear weapons in Ukraine, whose parliament has still not ratified the START I Treaty. Ukraine has established administrative control over the ICBMs located on its territory. At the same time, centralized combat command and control of all ICBMs, including those deployed in Ukraine, is being maintained and carried out only from Russian territory. The Agreement Between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on the Procedures for Implementation of Warranty and Inventor's Supervision [avtorskiy nadzor] Over the Operation of the Strategic Missile Complexes Located on Their Territories was signed at the beginning of September of this year at Yalta and entered into force from the moment it was signed. In this agreement, the parties, guided by the need for nuclear and ecological safety, the exclusion of unsanctioned employment of nuclear weapons and maintenance of the missile complexes in the proper technical state, have agreed to conduct work on warranty and inventor's supervision using specialists of developing and manufacturing enterprises without regard to on whose territory they are deployed. At the same time, an Intergovernmental Agreement on Scrapping Nuclear Warheads and the Basic Principles for Scrapping Nuclear Warheads of the Strategic Nuclear Forces That Are Deployed in Ukraine were signed and have equal force. These documents define the procedures and conditions for removal and transportation to Russian territory and for scrapping and dismantling of all types of ICBM nuclear warheads and also warheads of air-based nuclear cruise missiles. I am far from the thought on the unimpeded implementation of these agreements. Quite a few barriers have quite rapidly appeared and will continue to emerge in the future. We must apply significant efforts. However, it is important that the parties have reaffirmed their adherence to the 1 July 1968 Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the START I Treaty. According to U.S. State Department associates, evidence exists that Ukrainian specialists are undertaking attempts to establish operational control of the ICBMs on their territory. However, first of all, the data we have does not confirm that and, second, attempts to implement these plans would cancel out all of the international and bilateral agreements and treaties with the participation of Ukraine, leaving it in a state of isolation. In my opinion, Ukraine understands the senselessness of such steps. Under any development of the political situation, the elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine is a question of time since Ukraine does not have at its disposal the capabilities to manufacture nuclear munitions and to test ICBMs and, consequently, to renew the strategic offensive weapons formation. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] What are the prospects for further reductions of strategic offensive weapons and how will this affect strategic stability? [Dvorkin] Maintenance of the capability to maintain a balance (equilibrium) of forces both for the potential for deterrence (the effectiveness of retaliatory operations) and also for counterforce potential (the capability to destroy strategic military targets in preemptive operations) can be the criterion for the maximum depth of strategic offensive weapons reductions. There can also be other criteria based first of all on the required level of damage in retaliatory operations but this is a separate topic. In accordance with the START I Treaty limitations, up to 4,900 warheads can be deployed on ICBMs and SLBMs [submarine launched ballistic missiles]. It has been assumed that the United States will carry out the reductions with the simultaneous accomplishment of strategic offensive forces modernization programs under the terms of the START I Treaty: deployment of new Minuteman IV missiles in the launch silos of existing Minuteman II and Minuteman III missiles and acceptance into the inventory of mobile Midgetman small ICBMs; and, completion of the construction of 18 Ohio Class SSBNs [nuclear ballistic missile submarines] and equipping them with Trident II SLBMs and others. As a result of reductions in the effective combat strength of the U.S. strategic offensive forces, the number of ICBMs and SLBMs must be reduced by approximately 25% (from approximately 1,656 to 1,200 missiles) and, the number of ballistic missile warheads -- by approximately 30% (from 7,954 to 4,900 weapons). However, qualitative changes in the formation would have a substantial impact on the increase of its combat capabilities. The ballistic missile formation's counterforce potential would increase by a factor of 1.3 and potential for deterrence -- by a factor of 1.1-1.35, with regard to 1992. By the time of the completion of the implementation of the START I Treaty, the United States would surpass Russia in these indicators by approximately a factor of two. Under the terms of the START II Treaty, approximately 932 ICBMs and SLBMs equipped with 2,228 warheads could be in the effective combat strength of the U.S. strategic offensive forces. Furthermore, during the course of preparations for the Treaty, the American side carried out unilateral steps for the termination of the Midgetman Small ICBM development and deployment program and terminated production of W-88 warheads for Trident II SLBMs. In the event the enumerated measures are implemented, the CIS missile formation's counterforce potential will be reduced by a factor of three with regard to the current level after elimination of the MX ICBM, reduction of the number of warheads for the Minuteman and Trident II missiles, and termination of equipping the latter with W-88 warheads. The deterrent potential will be reduced by approximately a factor of two. Under the terms of the START II Treaty, the counterforce potential of the RF strategic nuclear forces is also being reduced by approximately 45% with the elimination of ICBMs with MIRVs, however, the superiority of the U.S. strategic offensive forces (by a factor of 1.2) is noticeably less in contrast to the terms of the START I Treaty. The reduction of the U.S. strategic offensive forces' offensive capabilities and the increase of the portion of mobile complexes in the Missile Troops formation from 30% with the limitation of strategic offensive arms at the level of 6,000 warheads to 50...60% with deeper reductions causes an abrupt increase of the survivability of the domestic ICBM formation. Under conditions of the implementation of the START II Treaty, the potential of an SMT retaliatory strike increases by a factor of 1.5 and, of all strategic nuclear forces -- by approximately 20/% and levels out with the American potential. Comparison of the terms of the START I and START II treaties indicates that, with the directions and trends of development that have taken shape for Russian and U.S. strategic offensive weapons, the counterforce and deterrent potentials of the sides are coming closer together as the number of warheads is reduced. The trend toward the combat capabilities of the sides' strategic forces coming closer together is strongly manifested at the level of 5,000-6,000 strategic offensive weapons or less. This is occurring for a number of reasons. First of all, according to the START I Treaty, the number of warheads is being reduced significantly more radically than weapon platforms (from approximately 2,400 to 1,600) which is promoting the increase of the stability of the formations' combat systems since the average number of warheads per weapon platform is being reduced from 4.5-6.3 to 3.5-4.0 in accordance with the START I Treaty and the terms of the START II Treaty generally do not envision a further reduction of the number of weapon platforms (the average number of warheads on weapon platforms can be 1.9-2.2). Second, the portion of warheads on mobile ICBMs is increasing in the ground component of Russia's strategic nuclear forces which, along with the reduction of the other side's counterforce potential, is drastically increasing survivability and, consequentially, the deterrent potential of the SMT formation. So, an analysis of the correlation of the combat potentials of the existing and future U.S. strategic offensive weapons formations and RF strategic nuclear forces indicates that a reduction of warheads promotes the strengthening of military-strategic stability and meets Russia's national security interests. The equality of the offensive and defensive potentials of the United States and Russia can be preserved with further reductions of strategic offensive weapons (below 3,000 warheads) and maintenance of a rational structure for the strategic nuclear forces. However, as strategic offensive weapons are reduced, the absolute significance of these potentials is also reduced which could reduce the significance of nuclear arsenals as a tool for maintaining military-strategic stability. The employment of various approaches, while taking into account the impact of the most significant factors that are capable of having a negative impact on the military-strategic balance in the period until 2010 (joint employment of nuclear forces of the coalition of states, utilization of precision-guided weapons during the course of a non-nuclear period of military operations for strikes against CIS targets, the employment of tactical aviation nuclear weapons in a nuclear missile strike that is coordinated with strategic forces, or deployment of even a limited U.S. territorial ABM [antiballistic missile] defense), indicates that, from the point of view of the stability of the military-strategic balance, the possibilities for further reductions of strategic offensive weapons without neutralization of destabilizing factors is quite limited, although it does exist. In my view, the transformation of the Triad into a Dyad by reorienting all heavy bombers to the accomplishment of missions in war with the employment of conventional weapons could be one of the possible directions on this path. Strategic aviation with nuclear weapons would certainly play a priority and quite independent role in the nuclear strategy if the sides did not have ICBMs and SLBMs. However, the contribution of heavy bombers to the accomplishment of the nuclear deterrence mission with the availability of adequate ICBM and SLBM forces is, in my view, beyond the threshold of discernibility. Obviously, therefore nothing is known about the U.S. plans to conduct air operations in the process of and after conducting massive nuclear strikes using ICBM and SLBM forces. With the shift from the Triad to the Dyad, the sides' strategic offensive weapons could be reduced in the manner being examined, for example, to a level of 2,500 warheads.
