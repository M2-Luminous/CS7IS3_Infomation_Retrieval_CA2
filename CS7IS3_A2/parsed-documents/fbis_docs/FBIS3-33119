Copaz President Hector Rosada today denied a local media report that the two generals and a colonel were going to be replaced before the next meeting with the guerrillas, which will be held in Mexico soon. The appointed officers are General Marco Antonio Gonzalez Taracena, current deputy chief of defense general staff and Copaz member under the previous government; General Victor Manuel Argueta, commander of the Honor Guard; and Colonel Victor Manuel Ventura, director of the Polytechnic School. Rosada asserted that the defense minister had reported his intentions to replace one of the military representatives for health reasons and not "to find new participation mechanisms." The sociologist [Rosada] who met last week with the UN mediator in the peace process said: "Yesterday I asked President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and Gen. Enriquez not to change them because they are doing a good job." The peace delegation is chaired by Rosada who is the author of the peace proposal presented by de Leon last year. The proposal includes three military and three civilians who will negotiate the end of the armed conflict that was initiated in 1960. This is the only armed conflict that prevails in Central America.
