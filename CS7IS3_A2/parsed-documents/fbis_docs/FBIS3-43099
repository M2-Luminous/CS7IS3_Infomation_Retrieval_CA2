I. Nefed ov, A. R Tagalayev; UDC 621.372.85] [Abstract] Emphasis is placed on the development of a higher quality of information processing based on existing domestic hardware. In this case, a VHF or UHF radio signal is used for processing in systems with t hree-dimensional integrated circuits. The use of three-dimensional circuits decreases size by 1-3 orders of magnitude and incre ases speed by 1-2 orders of magnitude. The system consists of control devices, phase shifters, attenuators, and various types of transmission lines. New and improved wideband UHF and VHF control devices are needed to foster development of these systems. An application program package has been developed to design control devices. Methods of increasing the bandwidth of the system are discussed. Various types of control devices are described. Equations are derived which may be used to analyze the charact eristics of the devices. Various types of trnasmission line junctions are discussed. Equations are presetned which can be used to evaluate the amplitude-frequency characteristic and phase-frequency characteristic of various types of junctions. Synthesis of circuit junctions is addressed. Figures show various junction topologies. Figures 12; tables 2; references 10: Russian.
