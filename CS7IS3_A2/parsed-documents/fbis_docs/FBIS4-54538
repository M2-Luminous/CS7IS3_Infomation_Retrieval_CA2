The report discusses in detail the legal and economic conditions of investing in Poland. It was authored by Ewa Sadowska Cieslak, Jozef Biskup, and Wojciech Burzynski. On the basis of studies by the report's authors, it can be concluded that the biggest incentives for investing in Poland are, in this order: prospects for our economic growth (about 53.5 percent of the respondents); the size of the Polish market (47.5 percent of the respondents); manpower costs (44.7 percent of the respondents); the availability of manpower (33.9 percent); the possibility of reducing production costs (31.6 percent); price level (27.9 percent); advantageous conditions for investing (27.5 percent); and the possibility of repatriating profits (27 percent). A Potentially Attractive Country Thus, in the opinion of the report's authors, Poland appears to be a potentially attractive country. Another advantage is that Poland can become a big importer of manufacturing capital in view of its capacious market, so-called deferred (and unsatisfied) demand, and the enlargement of that market, owing to the free-trade zone shared with the other Visegrad countries [Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary]. As a result of the still low efficiency of most Polish enterprises, considerable profits can be derived from selling in this country products whose manufacture in highly industrialized countries by now yields only below-average profits. Foreign investors considering the possibility of capital investment in our country attach considerable importance to the very fact that a market economy is being built here. This factor was ranked first by 86 percent of U.S. investors, 82 percent of Swedish and Dutch investors, and 80 percent of French investors. The second-ranking attraction was identified as privatization (67 percent of British and U.S. investors, 63 percent of Swedish investors, and 76 percent of French investors). In its turn, to 46.7 percent of French investors, 45 percent of U.S. ones, 39 percent of Dutch, and 38 percent of German, a major factor in their decisionmaking was the possibility of purchasing land and real estate. A Good Policy Contrary to traditional belief, about one-half of the investors viewed positively the policy of the Polish Government regarding foreign investments. Most respondents were of the opinion that the political situation in Poland did not affect their activities. Nearly three-fourths of major investors planned to expand their operations in this country, but nearly as many hold a very low opinion of the taxes binding in our country (83 percent of Italian investors, 88 percent of Swiss, 67 percent of German). And they are not satisfied with the operating procedures of commercial risk insurance, either. They also hold an unfavorable opinion about the credit insurance system. Hungary Is Better The foreign investors answering the questionnaires shared the opinion that Poland is among the countries with the most favorable conditions for investment by foreign capital. Nevertheless, they ranked Hungary first in that respect. This is also proved by the amount of capital invested in that country. By the end of 1993, more than $5 billion had been invested in Hungary compared with only half that amount in Poland, although declarations for further investment plans suggest an amount three times larger. As known, the Americans are the biggest investors in Poland (on average, they invested $23 million in each of the companies they decided to buy shares in), followed by Italy, with third place held by four transnational corporations (including ABB, Hewlett Packard, and the issuer [as published] of Cambridge Holding) and three international financial institutions. The Japanese were a big disappointment, but they were not interested in investing in our country until the completion of our negotiations with the Club of London. Capital investment was too expensive for them in a situation in which, for every dollar invested, a matching dollar had to be deposited in a bank. The IKC report mentions, however, several companies, including Toyota, Nisho Iwai, and Itochu, which committed themselves to selling in our country Mazdas, Toyotas, and Hondas, as well as several other companies, including Mitsui. However, altogether Japanese companies account for n 0.3-percent share in investments in Poland. In a situation in which Poland is experiencing a major foreign trade deficit, it is important that investors also manufacture for export. Thus, while in 1989 the value of exports deriving from their enterprises amounted to $179.9 million, in 1990 it rose to $516 million, in 1991 to $631 million, and in 1992 to $1.3 billion. Exports per company with participation of foreign capital averaged $230,000 in 1992. Even so, as many as 75 companies are geared to sell their products on the domestic market, and the value of their exports did not exceed $37 million altogether. Furniture and wood products are the best exports, followed by garments, with products of the pulp and paper industry ranking third and those of the electronics industry fourth. According to the data gathered by the report's authors, companies with the participation of foreign capital offer higher wages, and, in general, their existence has improved the situation on the job market. Such companies also are characterized by higher labor productivity. It also often happens that, while employment increases in the foreign branches of these companies, including their branches in Poland, it decreases in their mother countries. At any rate, in 12 countries of Central and East Europe a year ago (latest available data), 65,000 companies operated with the participation of foreign capital.
