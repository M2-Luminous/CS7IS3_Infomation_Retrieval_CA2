Mr. Advani, reading various reports from talks with several people, said that he has learned officials in the state government are, one way or another, encouraging terrorism in the state. He said that such disgraceful persons should be uprooted without haste. Mr. Advani was addressing a public meeting at the parade grounds. Comparing the situation in the valley with Punjab, Mr. Advani said that the most important step needed to improve the situation in the valley is to give a free hand to officers in dealing with terrorism. He said that when such an arrangement was made in Punjab, the situation had improved rapidly. Additionally, the Central Government was watching Punjab closely during the terrorism era. Mr. Advani said that the situation in Jammu-Kashmir is very different. Even the governor's mandate is not obeyed in the valley. The BJP leader told the Central Government that it should not hesitate to take strict action in Kashmir. Mr. Advani reminded his listeners that the Indian Government, despite international objections, had taken steps to test nuclear weapons in Sikkim, Goa, Hyderabad, and Pokhran. India has never bowed down to international pressures. Why, then, should it bow in the context of the valley? *
