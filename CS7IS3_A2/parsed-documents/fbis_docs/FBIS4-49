FBIS TRENDS-25Apr94-Russia Local Executives Push for Legislative Influence Local Executives Push for Legislative Influence SUMMARY In several regions local administration heads took advantage of their ability to set the rules for local elections to promote executive influence in local legislatures by allowing executive officials to run for legislative seats and simultaneously retain their executive branch positions. Despite official protests over these attempts--charging that the constitutional principle of separation of powers is being undermined--the central government does not appear to have censured or tried to rein in the local executives involved. The Yeltsin administration may hope that the local executives' presence will counterbalance hardline communist influence in the legislatures, but the administration may also find that, having won voter mandates and a legislative seat, these local executives will be in a stronger position to counterweigh demands from Moscow. END SUMMARY In the absence of action to set nationwide rules for local elections from either President Boris Yeltsin or the legislature, local executives ended up with a very large say in setting procedures for the recent local legislative elections in their regions. According to Central Electoral Commission (CEC) Deputy Chairman Aleksandr Ivanchenko, "the election procedure in the provinces is determined by the heads of administrations, according to Article 77 of the [federal] constitution" (See Note 1), and the CEC "has no right to impose rigid standards on the regions" (Izvestiya, 3 February). In addition, local executives may have been prompted to take matters into their own hands at the failure of the State Duma to flesh out constitutional provisions regarding the conduct of local elections. Three State Duma resolutions on local elections--two calling for presidential revision of local election procedures and one proposing the cancellation of local elections--were defeated (Segodnya, 10 February). (Note 1) Article 77 of the Russian Federation Constitution states that "the system of organs of state power of the republics, krays, oblasts, cities of federal significance, the autonomous oblast, and autonomous okrugs is established by the components of the Russian Federation independently in accordance with the fundamentals of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the general principles of the organization of representative and executive organs of state power established by federal law" (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 10 November 1993). Executive Branch Invades Legislative In several regions, local administration heads took advantage of their ability to set the rules for local elections to attempt to ensure--in disregard of the constitution's pronouncement in favor of separation of powers (Article 10)--that administration officials hold a large share of the seats in those legislatures: -- In Kursk Oblast, 21 of the 36 deputies elected on 27 March were rayon administration heads, "meaning that they themselves will write the local laws as well as executing and monitoring them," according to Rossiyskaya Gazeta (30 March). -- In Vologda Oblast, 18 officials from the oblast and rayon administrations have been registered as candidates for the 15 deputies' seats in the oblast duma, according to a 5 March Izvestiya article. -- In Rostov Oblast, "all eight heads of rayon administrations registered as candidates for the local City Duma" (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 3 March). In the 27 March oblast duma election, executive branch officials won roughly two-thirds of the 45 legislative seats (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 30, 31 March). -- In Orenburg Oblast, executive branch officials ran for the oblast legislature despite an appeal from oblast Head of Administration V. Yelagin to rayon administration leaders not to run. Eleven were subsequently elected to the oblast duma (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 29 March). In some cases, the chief executives extended their influence over local representative bodies more directly, seemingly unwilling to chance the ballot box. Vologda Oblast Governor Nikolay Podgornov issued an electoral decree and statute reportedly allowing the heads of administration, which he appoints, to chair the Vologda and Cherepovets city dumas and smaller rayon assemblies (Izvestiya, 5 March). Podgornov also reportedly "abolished" city councils entirely in the cities of Velikiy Ustyug, Totma, Belozersk, Ustyuzhna, and Kirillov (Izvestiya, 27 January). A 22 February Komsomolskaya Pravda issue asserted that, in the Tula Oblast electoral statute, oblast Head of Administration Nikolay Sevryugin has reserved for himself the power to appoint "a section" of the deputies to the oblast legislature. The phenomenon of local executives running for local legislative seats was widespread and apparently was supported by the voters. A 1 April Rossiyskiye Vesti analysis of local election results reported that "a total of 463 [heads of administration] took part" in local election campaigns, and in some regions they comprise "up to 40 percent of the representative assemblies." The analysis lists that "in Voronezh Oblast 18 of the 45 elected representatives are heads of administration at all levels; in Irkutsk Oblast--10 out of 45; in Kaluga Oblast--21 out of 45; in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast--14 out of 45; and in Novgorod Oblast--11 out of 27." An 11 March Trud article reported that following the 30 January elections in Penza Oblast, the 45-member local legislature consists of 20 heads of administrations or their deputies. Silence From the Kremlin The Yeltsin administration apparently made little effort to prevent heads of administration from invading the legislatures. Deputy Chief of the administration's Directorate for Work with the Territories Sergey Samoylov conceded that, despite Yeltsin's commitment to the operation of the principle of separation of powers, virtually all organizational questions regarding local legislative power are being settled by executive structures. He emphasized, however, that normative acts of executives regarding local elections undergo "mandatory expert analysis" in the president's administration and are "invariably coordinated" with the CEC. Samoylov attributed local executive frequent successes in the balloting to the voters' taking a greater stake in local affairs, saying that voters have "entrusted mandates to the people who control the real levers of power, and who therefore will be able to do something for them." He also noted, however, that some localities--as in St. Petersburg and Nizhniy Novgorod- -banned the administration heads from running (Trud, 11 March). Tacit Approval? The Yeltsin administration's failure to mount a stronger protest against the heads of administrations suggests that they may have viewed the prospect of the administration heads extending their influence in local legislatures as a desirable counterweight to a communist or hardline nationalist presence in those bodies. Rossiyskiye Vesti correspondent Gennadiy Belotserkovskiy wrote that the electorate has "no alternative" but to choose between the entrenched bureaucrats and diehard communist opposition in the regions. Rostov Oblast Head of Administration Vladimir Chub defended the registration of all eight heads of rayon administrations as candidates for the oblast legislature, reportedly stating that "if the executive is not allowed into the representative branch, it will indeed be dominated by the communists." Checks Unbalanced Despite the absence of a clear stand by the Yeltsin administration, some local officials and others objected to the intrusion into legislative affairs: -- Vologda Oblast Duma candidate Albert Volkov condemned oblast administration employees' running for legislative positions as a violation of the constitutional principle of the separation of powers. The oblast prosecutor's office and local leaders of conservative and reformist parties alike protested Podgornov's acts subordinating city dumas and rayon assemblies to his appointed heads of administration, charging that these provisions contradict the federal constitution. Podgornov reportedly "rejected" the oblast prosecutor's protest and has not been observed to have addressed the concerns of the other complainants (Izvestiya, 5 March). -- Rostov Oblast presidential representative Vladimir Zubkov was reportedly "concerned" at the trend of combining executive and legislative posts, asserting that when the question of combining posts was discussed in February by the Public Chamber "virtually everyone from Sobchak to Zhirinovskiy agreed" that combination was "inadmissible" (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 3 March). Implications "Name recognition" will likely continue to carry local executive branch officials into legislative seats, though this trend at the same time significantly diminishes, if not snuffs out entirely, any local system of checks and balances on the executive branch of local government. It is still unclear, however, whether local administration heads will be consistently open toward implementing the center's reforms. Although some may be amenable to reform, many may continue to resist-reform at the local level in order to soften the effects of reform on their constituents. The Yeltsin administration's laissez-faire policy toward local self-government will probably prove costly as local executives are likely to use their new bases and popular election mandate in the legislatures to press for greater autonomy from Moscow. BOX Heads' of Administration Checkered Background Although the local heads of administration are appointed by President Boris Yeltsin, they have a mixed record in supporting the president and reform policies. In the months following the August 1991 coup, many local administration heads began to distance themselves from Yeltsin by pursuing policies geared more toward local rather than Yeltsin's interests. After Yeltsin threatened a showdown with the old Supreme Soviet in a 20 March 1993 television address, few heads of administration gave him unequivocal support*. In like fashion, many regional leaders took a cautious or negative stance following the Moscow crisis of October 1993.** After each incident, Yeltsin replaced a number of administration heads that did not firmly support his views. * See the Trends of 29 March 1993, pages 1-23. ** See the Trends of 6 October 1993, pages 15-19.
