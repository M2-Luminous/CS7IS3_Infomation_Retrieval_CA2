Brother Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the great al-Fatih revolution, had metings with the guest presidents, and intensive talks were held between them on relations between their countries in the political and economic spheress, and on regional, African, and international issues of common interest. The leaders expressed satisfaction at the tangible development of relations and cooperation between them, and they stressed the importance of relations between their countries in the political, economic, and security-related domains, and the founding of the appropriate organs toward this end. The leaders expressed their great concern over the situation in Rwanda. They condemn the massacres being repeatedly perpetrated against civilians in Rwanda. In this respect, they stressed the importance of an immediate cease-fire between the parties to the conflict, and the need to find a radical solution that would bring security and stability to Rwanda. With the aim of bolstering collective relations between their states, the leaders underscored the importance of activating the group of states bordering the Sahara, and of promoting cooperation between them in order to secure stability and security, and to resolve the problems in the region, which would become an element toward a linkage and not separation between the north and south of the Sahara, and in order to secure collective cooperation between them in harmony with the historic, social, and cultural ties between their peoples. The leaders reviewed the efforts being made to carry out the national charter in the Republic of Mali, and the talks underway in order to put an end to the armed rebellion in northern Niger. They stressed the importance of finding a final solution to these questions out of their commitment to preserving security throughout the region. Therefore, the leaders agreed that a meeting be held by the foreign ministers of the concerned states in the Republic of Mali in order to prepare for the convening of a summit in the RSPLJ. Toward this end, the foreign ministers have been assigned the task of intensifying contacts and meetings and exchanging information. The leaders also reiterated their solidarity and that of their peoples with the people of the RSPLJ in facing up to the measures imposed on the Arab Libyan people. They expressed their support for the Arab, African, and international efforts being made in order to find a just, honest, and rapid solution so as to put an end to these measures, which affect all the peoples of the region. At the conclusion of the visit, the presidents expressed their thanks and gratitude to brother leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the great al-Fatih revolution, and the Arab Libyan people, for the warm welcome and hospitality offered to them.
