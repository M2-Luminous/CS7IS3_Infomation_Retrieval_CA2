Ethiopian Airlines flight ET972, with 32 passengers and 11 crew members on board, touched down at Rome's Ciampino airport at 0335 (0235 GMT), after which lone hijacker Getachelw Mulat, 25, give himself up to police without offering any resistance. Passengers and crew reported that the man entered the cockpit without anyone noticing and threatened the pilot with a 10-centimetre blade, ordering him to fly straight to Rome. "We had been in the air for 30 minutes when the captain told us that there was a hijacking going on," said Gertjan Storm, the Dutch ambassador to Senegal who was amongst passengers on the flight. "Half an hour later the captain, who like all the crew remained perfectly calm and professional, told us that we were heading for Rome. Everyone remained calm and the hostesses continued to do their job, handing out food and drink." According to well-informed sources, Mulat told investigators at Ciampino's immigration police station that he was a former soldier who now fished for a living. He said that the hijacking was a political gesture but denied belonging to any political group. He put his actions down to a protest against "a dictatorship which has deprived us of our freedom," the sources said. The hijacker was allowed to talk to Ethiopia's ambassador in Rome, Alem Balemah Mradis, who told journalists "he seemed desperate to me. He said he had been an officer in our armed forces but is currently unemployed. He also said that he did this for political reasons but that he does not belong to any political party. He wants political refugee status." Rome aviation authorities granted permission for the Ethiopian Airlines craft to land when they were informed that the plane had fuel left for only 10 minutes in the air. This is the second time that an Ethiopian Airlines craft has been forced to change its flight path and head for Rome: in August 1992, five men armed with two hand grenades hijacked a flight from Addis Ababa and demanded asylum after persuading the pilot to take them to Ciampino. The five were sentenced to four years and eight months in prison for hijacking and possession of weapons.
