With the encouragement of you, fellow countrymen, I have returned after explaining to the people of the two countries the vision of the ROK, which is leaping forward afresh by making changes and reforms. My just concluded visits have given the ROK an opportunity to open an Asian-Pacific era with Japan and China. I have opened a new horizon in ROK-Japanese cooperation and ROK-Sino cooperation. During my visits, I sincerely discussed with Japanese and Chinese leaders security and prosperity in Northeast Asia, the North Korean nuclear issue, and other practical matters concerning common prosperity. I tell you, my fellow countrymen, that as a result, I have won much sympathy from those leaders. I held two rounds of talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa in Tokyo. We extensively discussed ways to expand bilateral cooperation in a changing world. I presented the future of new good-neighborly relations in a speech at a banquet hosted by the Japanese emperor and speeches to the Japanese Diet and Waseda University. I proposed opening an era of ROK-Japanese cooperation to shape the future based on historical lessons and mutual trust. I won absolute sympathy from them. Looking toward the 21st century, ROK-Japanese relations have entered an era of cooperation. Following my visit to Japan, I visited China, one of our three major trading partners. I held talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and frankly discussed with him bilateral cooperation, peace and prosperity in the Asian-Pacific region, and the North Korean nuclear issue and other matters concerning security and peace on the Korean peninsula. President Jiang Zemin and I agreed that peace and security on the Korean peninsula is a prerequisite, not only for the interest of the two countries of the ROK and China, but also for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia. We also agreed that peace and security on the Korean peninsula will greatly contribute to world peace without fail. My visit to China further promoted the exchange of friendly relations between the two countries. Moreover, it was an opportunity for coexistence that provided a basis for active economic cooperation. In particular, we agreed to carry out active industrial cooperation in various fields, including the automobile, electronic exchanger, airplane, and high definition television industries. When considering the infinite potential of the ROK and China, this kind of escalated cooperation will indeed guarantee a bright future in the relations between the two countries. While making a speech at Beijing University, I emphasized the importance of mutual complementary cooperative relations between the ROK and China. To achieve this, I stressed the fact that establishing peace and reunification on the Korean peninsula are very important for peace and prosperity in this region. The professors and students of Beijing University expressed consensus through enthusiastic applause on my speech. In Japan and China, I was able to confirm an extensive consensus on our reform. Dear fellow countrymen: During my visits, I met with many fellow countrymen living in Japan and China and our businessmen. They had great pride in the fatherland's status, which was further enhanced through change and reform. They were overflowing with patriotic enthusiasm for the fatherland's development and for internationalization. When I visited the ROK provisional government building in Shanghai, I felt all the more keenly the will of the patriotic forefathers' spirit of independence and proud construction of the fatherland. During my visit to ROK businesses in the Tianjin development zone this morning, I could keenly feel their resolve to advance into the open Chinese continent and thus promote ROK-PRC cooperation. Fellow countrymen: We should all turn our eyes to the future and the world without delay. We should all rise up to pioneer the national fate. During my visit I saw Japan, which is ahead of others, and witnessed that China is about to burp [yongturimulhanun]. I also actually felt that the world is rapidly changing and saw countries striving to survive severe competition. They are all heading toward the future with a determined resolve. In particular, I saw the youth of China and Japan throwing off the old and leaping forward to the future. I desperately feel that to win the economic and technologic war in an era of limitless competition, we should look directly at the ROK's present situation and redouble our efforts. In the current world, which is rapidly changing, stagnation means self-destruction, not retreat. If we do not change, we will remain as an eternal straggler. The efforts for change, reforms, and internalization should be continued without a hitch. We should not miss the opportunity to reform. We cannot survive severe competition if we remain as a frog in a narrow well. We must start fresh with a new resolve toward a ROK that stands proudly on the international arena. We must build a great country. We must hand over a proud country to our sons and daughters. Our fellow countrymen have the courage, latent energy, and self- confidence to build such a country. Tomorrow will be too late, we must start today. Fellow countrymen: We should renew our march. Thank you.
