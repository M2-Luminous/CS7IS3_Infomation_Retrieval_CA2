It taught us not to believe in coincidences, not to trust promises of politicians, edicts of the president or actions of the government. This is why hasty adoption of Russia's new military doctrine evoked a large number of questions in the minds of servicemen, and not only them. And, although all political analysis best serves its purpose before the fact, even now it still probably not too late to analyze the essence and meaning of the document that has become the basic formula for the country's defense. Such a document has, of course, been needed for a long time. This need arises directly from the state's desire to change its internal structure, ideology, and mutual relations. In addition, all of Russia's citizens need to finally be given an idea of what is happening with the military in our country, and of what the authorities intend to do, and not to do, in shaping our new military policy. And obviously the process of fundamental transformations in all spheres of state activity should be reflected in military doctrine. Such a document was drafted, according to plan in some respects, and spontaneously in others. Military doctrine matured gradually in staff work in the forces, in seminars held by military VUZ [higher educational insitution] departments, and in the research programs of scientific centers. Thousands of people worked on it, and just in 1993 six doctorate and over 20 candidate dissertations were defended, a number of scientific discoveries were made, and hundreds of interesting proposals were offered in the course of preparation of the new military doctrine. The doctrine's authors had probably been tasked to gather together and generalize the results of the labor of military specialists. However, the document accounts for none of the proposals originating at the local level. The convictions and interests of the people who are to implement the doctrine--the military themselves--were left unaddressed. Which is why it has come to be widely held in Moscow's academies that the new doctrine was adopted so suddenly that, by the very fact of its existence, it would keep any other concept from making an appearance--for example, one proposing a professional army. As we know, any army can man itself by two principles--voluntarily or by compulsion. The Russian Army has traditionally formed on the basis of the compulsory principle. Following the lead of journalists and scientists, three years ago many generals began boldly saying that it is impossible for a compulsory army to become a professional one. But now, the idea of a professional army is brought to mind at the top with increasing rarity. Cozy offices in the staff buildings of the old, tested army, which preferred to fight not with ability but with numbers, have been found for all of the progressive generals. The idea of strict selection and high quality training of servicemen has been reduced to clumsy half-measures, like service by enlisted men on the basis of contracts. Supported neither socially nor economically, the contract service program has transformed into a joke, discrediting the very idea of a professional army in Russia. Contract service has attracted chiefly those who are seeking easy money or are at odds with the law. Both the special and the general educational training of these soldiers is so low that the textbooks commanders usually use for training in the troops are over their heads. Pressing people into contract service, the military commissariats fulfill the plans dictated to them from above "at any cost," even going so far as to deceive both the contract soldiers themselves and the officers under whose leadership these people will have to serve. Something said by one of the commanders of a battalion manned by such a "contingent" has now swept through a good half of the Army: "So what did that military commissar do, make a deal with a prison camp chief?" The so-called combined principle of manning the Armed Forces proclaimed in the new military doctrine enables the military leadership to enlist the state's human resources without any sort of quality control, taking its cue not from conscription needs but from a reluctance to complicate its life The generals don't understand that signing contracts with willing persons isn't enough--the entire system of selection and combat training of soldiers has to be changed fundamentally. Such a requirement conflicts with the fundamental, historically evolved method by which our troops have waged war. Russian generals have never paid attention to losses, generously fertilizing the future with the bones of their soldiers. And this "science of winning" is perhaps the only thing in which the continuity of the generations of Russian generals clearly expresses itself. However, there is one other, more important circumstance: The subconscious notion that the Army serves as a prison for a part of our people continues to foil attempts to create professional armed forces in our country. The isolation potential of the barracks has been expertly utilized in Russia since day one. When in past centuries a revolutionary situation evolved in Finland or Poland, the emperor defused it by mass conscription of youngsters from the restless regions into the army. But we went even further: Conscriptions are conducted regularly, from all regions. It has gotten to the point where all of our men serve in the army, and all are made equal in the ranks. And it was only in our country that the word "simple" sounded so much like praise, while "complex" ("special") was perceived as something negative. The individual was compelled to conceal his uniqueness, and was ashamed of his individuality. Keeping his opinions to himself, gradually he lost his ability to hold an opinion, he forgot how to think, he ceased thinking. The ideal warrior! How could you refuse such easy-to-manage soldiers? But let's return to the military doctrine. First of all, let's define the location of this document in the coordinates of the country's sociopolitical life in 1993. Let's consider the chronology: October--the tragedy at the White House; November--the presidential edict approving the "Fundamental Principles of Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation"; December--the national referendum on the new Constitution and elections to the Russian parliament. Such a sequence of event makes you wonder. The question that arises right away is this: What should come first? The fundamental law of the state, or its military doctrine? The answer is obvious. First we adopt the constitution, and then the military doctrine. If that were what happened, we would certainly have heard loud demands to reconcile the fundamental principles of the military doctrine to the constitution's postulates. It would not be easy to ignore such demands at any level of authority. But were the sequence of adoption of the documents to be changed, as was done in our case, the military doctrine would become a given, claiming priority of its principles over constitutional principles. The hands of politicians in military actions have been untied for all time, the Armed Forces turn out to be independent of the constitution, and military affairs are dependably screened from public scrutiny. The inconsistency between the actual tenor of Army life and constitutional norms is so astounding that it requires separate discussion. The new Russian Constitution, no matter what criticism it may endure, nonetheless does devote a sizable amount of room to the individual, declaring the rights and liberties of the individual. But real military life is characterized at the moment objective lawlessness and lack of freedom. The military doctrine takes no account at all of human rights in any of its premises. "Labor is free. Each shall have the right do whatever he wishes with his working abilities, and to select his nature of activity and occupation.... Compulsory labor is forbidden," states Article 37 of the Constitution. But, in the meantime, the Army continues to stand on involuntary labor, and the military doctrine confirms manning predominantly on the basis of the compulsory principle for the foreseeable future. Or, "...each shall have the right to freedom and inviolability of the person. Arrest...shall be based only on court rulings," declares Article 22 of the Constitution. Reading this, we would have to assume that our Army' disciplinary regulations have now been rescinded. And once again, "...the home is sacred. No one shall have the right to enter a home against the will of persons residing therein." This is from Article 25 of the Russian Constitution. But according to the disciplinary regulations, the barracks (officers' dormitories) are not homes, and privates and NCOs (officers) residing therein are not protected by the Constitution. There are many examples of this sort. Also among them is a highly significant one. According to Article 27 of the Constitution, "...anyone who is lawfully present on territory of the Russian Federation shall have the right to travel freely." To people knowing what military service is like, any comment would be superfluous in this regard. A strange picture develops. With one hand the state gives normal rights and liberties to the military as well as the rest of the citizens of Russia, but with its other hand it confirms a document in which these rights are not foreseen. Which document is to be followed by a military chief? And by subordinates? Perhaps Article 45 of the Constitution, which states that "...each shall have the right to defend his rights and liberties by all means not prohibited by law"? Our Army will become a strange spectacle when some will be lawfully infringing upon the rights of others, while those others will be lawfully defending them. After all of this, I have this great urge to call the military doctrine a political propaganda document oriented on objectives far from those of strengthening the country's defense capabilities. But let's wait a little. Let's think on this a little more. First let's agree on the basic concepts. Military doctrine is defined as a system of views, adopted by the state for a given period of time (stipulated in the doctrine itself), upon the essence, nature and goals of possible war, and upon the program of preparations for it by the state and the armed forces. The fundamental principles of military doctrine are based on the society's social and political structure, the state of its economy, and the geopolitical situation of the country and its probable adversaries. The military doctrines of all states have been written on the basis of this matrix, which is then filled in with the content of the political programs of the governments and ruling parties of these states. Military doctrine takes on a meaning of its own only when the concept central to it comes into being--a probable adversary. Then the defense program acquires its special military orientation. And, developing with regard for the forces and resources of the potential opponent, it establishes what forces and resources it needs for war and in preparation for it. Military doctrine simply has no meaning when a probable adversary is not defined. You can't prepare for war against an unknown adversary, without knowing the direction from which the blow might come. It is impossible to organize military professional training, carry out defensive measures, select armament systems, position the forces, determine their combat readiness, and assign military reconnaissance tasks. It is impossible to set the upper limit of the material needs of the state and the Army for preparing and conducting warfare. When the probable adversary is left unnamed, claims by the general officers and leaders of the military-industrial complex upon any given percentage of the national income would be justified. But in the new Russian military doctrine the probable adversary isn't even defined approximately. The authors of this document believe "...wars and military conflicts to be the main danger to stability and peace." But almost all officers with whom I've discussed the doctrine shake their heads at this in bewilderment: Does this mean that war is what creates the danger of war? But looking at things objectively, can we really say that Russia is threatened by no one? Have absolute tranquility and international harmony really settled over the world? Are there really no countries, with interests opposite to those of our state, making territorial, economic and even political claims upon us? And where, I'd like to know, are the nuclear missiles of the USA, France and England still aimed? And what about China's? Aren't they still aimed at us? Isn't this also true of conventional missiles as well? Once upon a time an adversary did attack Russia, catching our people and Army by surprise because the political ambitions of certain individuals precluded the possibility of a professional military approach to defense. The one true lesson of history is that no one is learning anything from it. The Soviet Union's military doctrine believed the developed capitalist countries, and chiefly the United States, to be the probable adversary. This provided the possibility for purposefully developing the economy and military science, and carrying out political training of the troops. The corresponding army mentality evolved, and the professional skills of fighting a specifically indicated adversary were practiced over many long decades. By inertia, many commanders continue to develop these same skills in their subordinates, while realizing deep within their souls that such independent activity contradicts all of the state's policy today. But what are commanders to do? Nothing new has been proposed to them. Nothing different is being taught to them. Nothing specific is being said. When asked in a recent training exercise in a certain Siberian division whom they would most likely go to war with, one out of every three privates didn't have an answer, while one out of every five, after some hemming and hawing, finally named the United States, or Iraq, or Germany, or China, or Georgia, or Abkhazia. The most interesting thing is that all of them could be right. After all, in addition to the traditional missions, the new military doctrine presupposes peacekeeping operations--stationing the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation outside the country. Such actions are already a reality, and there are serious apprehensions that they could occur with much greater frequency in the future. And then our youngsters will be going to new Afghanistans, new Angolas, new Karabakhs. They will go to render international assistance, to rescue some government, to correct someone's mistakes. They will go to their deaths, "rectifying death by death." Why is a probable adversary not indicated in our doctrine? Could it be that the country's leadership knows who he is, but is afraid to anger him, while not being afraid to anger its own army? Or, having accomplished a unique, radical revolution in all military science, could it be that the president of Russia and his Ministry of Defense have decided to the keep this opponent secret from their own army? Or could it be that having no political course to follow, no ideological values, our politicians are hoping to be good friends with everyone in the international arena? There are many suppositions, but there is still only one question: Do the authors of the new military doctrine realize that by not indicating a probable adversary in it, and thus asking their country and army to prepare for war with any old state, we are willingly or unwillingly putting the entire world on our list of potential foes? Military doctrine has two sides--sociopolitical and military-technical. The former embraces issues pertaining to the economic, social, and legal principles of accomplishing the goals of a future war. This side is determined by the society's main political objectives. But we didn't have such objectives at the moment of approval of the doctrine. They were formulated later on in the Constitution. Therefore, the military doctrine was unable to express the views of the state on the possible nature of wars and military conflicts, or define the principles and directions of development of the Armed Forces. We will find nothing on the list of measures to be carried out up to the second millennium that would offer evidence of the seriousness of plans to reform the Army and "get combat-capable, modern forces as a result." The military-technical side of doctrine is a more utilitarian concept. It includes questions of the strategy and tactics of combat activities, the equipment supplied to the Armed Forces, and their professional training. This side of doctrine legalizes the complex mutual relations of army structures with the military-industrial and scientific complexes, and with the central and local administrations, and in a sense documents processes that have been taking shape over the course of years and decades. The military-technical side of doctrine cannot objectively come into being before all of these relations are fully evolved and stabilized. Have they already stabilized in the Russian Army? Are all ties set up and working in exemplary fashion? Can the quality of the personal and financial support provided to the Army today be taken as the model? But the section of the doctrine that expounds the concept of activity in the military-technical area is especially surprising. This section is presented in the new military doctrine as if its authors bear not even a suspicion of the state economy's devastation, of the extremely deep financial crisis, or of the social cataclysms. Had economists gone over this document before it was cast in stone by politicians and the military? Had they asked their traditional question: "What's the bottom line?"? What is the bottom line of operational restoration of the extremely expensive military infrastructure--the new airfields, the transportation net, the components of the air defense and missile systems, the military posts? What will be the cost of withdrawing forces back into this country and accommodating them, of introducing a new manning system, of participating in regional military conflicts, of making personnel changes in the Armed Forces, and of maintaining retired military personnel, whose numbers are continually growing with the Army's reduction? And that's far from everything. Every item, every word of the new military doctrine means billions upon billions of rubles. Having lost much of our order of battle with the disintegration of the USSR, our Army is presently in a woeful state. There was a time when it was built upon the principles of integration, of supporting all theaters of military operations with unified air defense systems and air forces, of conducting combat operations with regard for the possibilities of the Navy and Strategic Missile Forces. These principles have now been violated. Such an army no longer exists. Troops and equipment of the strongest first-line districts departed together with Ukraine and Belarus, which totally devastated the complex structure of the country's entire defense, and laid bare the Western Sector. The tragic events in the Caucasus, in the Dnestr region, and in Azerbaijan and Tajikistan severed all lines of communications almost entirely, thus depriving the dozens of units stationed in these regions of the possibility of conducting combat activities. These formations are feeling the shortage of personnel more and more keenly. In turn, the absence of resources and of proper personal conditions makes it impossible for the Ministry of Defense to relocate ground forces and form some sort of workable system out of them. The Strategic Missile Forces have found themselves in a situation in which a significant fraction of their launchers are on the other side of Russia's borders. Moreover, all such facilities require the constant attention of specialists, whom no CIS country but Russia has. Imagine what awaits the launchers in the absence of constant maintenance. And how is such maintenance to be carried out abroad? How are these facilities to be transferred to the other country if they are controlled from a single center? How much resources will it take to reorient the flight assignments in order to plug the holes formed in our country's nuclear missile shield? Still, despite everything, and owing exclusively to the heroism of their own officers, the Russian missile forces are maintaining their combat readiness. The country's air defense system, which has been ravaged by numerous reorganizations, is in dire need of radical improvement of all of its technical resources, and of more effective coordination of its actions with other armed forces. Strategic aviation suffers from a shortage of fuel and personnel, and it chronically lacks the resources for practical training of specialists. Torn apart by conflicts, the navy is desperately trying to preserve its unity and fighting capability, and to reject the old combat equipment others insist it must accept. The Army has been strangled by housing and personal problems. Officers haven't been paid for several months. There are not enough enlisted men, and "mestnichestvo," "dedovshchina," harassment and favoritism flourish in the units. Servicemen uprooted from Russian soil have lost all hope of returning to their motherland. The are in despair. The one thing they have been capable of is armed defense of their children, their wives, and their families against bands of nationalists. In these times, having taken upon itself the inordinate burden of maintaining order along the borders of the former USSR, Russia is currently maintaining more troops abroad (including border guards) than any other country in the world. After the Civil War, at the beginning of the period of the New Economic Policy, Lenin reduced the Army from 5 million to 550,000. That is, by almost 10 times. But this took more than just a single year. As of the moment of their establishment by an edict of the Russian president dated 7 May 1992, the Armed Forces numbered around 3 million persons. By 1995 their numerical strength is supposed to be not more than 2 million. But such a downward progression is not to be observed. On the contrary the administrative machinery of the Russian Ministry of Defense seems to have already surpassed that which existed in the Soviet Army in terms of both number of workers and quantity of general-grade positions. The equipment situation is also critical. Of the five and a half thousand tanks in the Russian Army, around a thousand are practically unusable. During the next year half of the tanks will become obsolete from a military standpoint. There is nothing with which to replace them. Of 7,000 infantry fighting vehicles and 6,500 artillery systems, over a third require immediate overhaul. The full thousand of our helicopter gunships require immediate repairs and maintenance. This list can go on and on. And even so, these are nothing more than the general statistics. Behind each one of them stands the tragedy of people deprived of the possibility of doing their work. In many of the units, all of this is believed to be the result of intrigues by our enemies, conspiracies, and betrayal. Here and there, we hear appeals for action: "...could it be that our commanders have an aversion to rending foreign uniforms with Russian bayonets?" Young, hot-blooded lieutenants can't understand why everyone is calmly watching as things of value that had taken years to create are being destroyed, turned inside out, and sold for a pittance in a single moment. How many packs of chewing gum can you get for a gyro-stabilized strategic nuclear missile launcher, or for a mobile army command post? That's not an idle question. Such deals have been made. Yes, Russia has always traded in arms. Just in the 1980s for example, the military-industrial complex sold over 6,000 tanks, 20,000 guns, 17 submarines and thousands of airplanes to foreign countries. Through its weapon sales the USSR controlled the geopolitical map of the world, shored up and set up regimes, and maintained or relieved tension in certain regions. But the process was kept under meticulous control, and the weapons were carefully accounted for. Each cartridge was accountable. The loss of a single pistol was considered to be an incident of the gravest import, one to be reported to the Main Command. Following disintegration of the USSR, the Army wrote off around a third of all of its military equipment and armament within a year. It was scrapped, hidden, and stolen for subsequent sale. But in order to sell weapons thoughtlessly, you first have to sell your conscience. Who knows how many tens of dollars the conscience of a Russian officer costs today? Whether the authors of the doctrine like it or not, the individual, along with his own philosophy and interests, remains the decisive factor of modern warfare. It is no secret to anyone that all of the world's large armies invest enormous resources into shaping a sense of patriotism in their soldiers, a system of spiritual values and particular political convictions (no matter what anyone says about depoliticizing the Army). All of this is accomplished through a system of indoctrination, which exists in every army of every state. Indoctrination is an attribute of an army, a means of controlling the armed forces. I know of very few exceptions to this rule, and when it gets down to the large armed forces and countries, there is but one exception--Russia. The destruction of our old system of military indoctrination is almost complete, and it is continuing. Listen to what I'm saying--it is not being changed, it is not being reworked, but it is being destroyed. The former system was of course oversaturated by ideology, it totally excluded creativity, and it was built on a purely Talmud-like foundation. But at least it was well-conceived, and army indoctrination consistently shaped the army's culture, which was rooted in Soviet traditions and customs. They were expressed in the form of numerous military customs and courtesies, from the simplest--saluting--to the most complex--the military oath taken in a solemn situation, holiday parades, and so on. Having become divested of the ideological principles of communism, the once perfect system of troop indoctrination immediately lost meaning, and transformed into the tattered clothing of the army. This process was helped along considerably by organizational measures directed at the former Main Political Directorate: hatchet-job reorganizations and personnel changes in the Directorate for Educational Work With Personnel, persecution of political workers in the forces, and many other clumsy actions by Armed Forces reformers. Together with the old system of indoctrination, the Army reformers did in all of military culture. No one gave any thought to what was to replace it. The Russian Army does not have its own internal military culture. It is attempting to unconditionally inject new political meaning into old army customs and courtesies, and it is trading Soviet flags for Russian ones, but all of the customs, all of the courtesies are rigidly determined by their traditional communist content, and nothing new is being added. And without internal army culture, it would be naive to discuss organization and combat readiness of the armed forces. No one has yet suggested a system for the army under which people would be brought together not by a dependence upon an idea, but by the idea itself. And without unity, without unity of thought, it is impossible to have a modern army. Let me also add that all indoctrination is inseparable from the training process. Because officers and generals didn't know how to indoctrinate their subordinates, or in what, they have lost their possibility for teaching them military affairs per se in organized, high quality fashion. How did it happen that the undermined socioeconomic and moral tenets of the Army went unreflected on the pages of this important state document? How is the highly important formula of defense going to work? How about the formula of victory? The important thing now is, who's victory over whom? What makes the new military doctrine fundamentally different is that it gives the president and government the right to use the Armed Forces to fight not only a foreign but even an internal foe. To put it simply, this military doctrine gives the Army permission to shoot at civilians, to use mighty army weapons against them. It may be possible that they will now begin giving combat decorations for this. The unprecedented level of freedom that the authors of the doctrine give to the military-political leadership (or leader) in independently choosing the adversary both outside the state and within it is simply frightening. The military has been given unlimited possibilities, and it has been shown unprecedented trust. But thank God, this is no joy to officers. They have no wish to shoot at civilians, no matter what their convictions, no matter what their behavior. If someone violates the law, we have the militia, the OMON [Special Purpose Militia Detachments], and the security service. Why the military? The Army is supposed to fight another army, and not anyone else. This unique feature of the military doctrine explains to some degree all of its preceding contradictions. If the Armed Forces are to be used to fight an internal enemy, the absence of many concepts from the doctrine familiar to military people is fully natural and justified. A ministry that is bent on force, and takes aim into its own country, has need of neither the sociopolitical nor the military-technical side of policy. A ministry of this kind has other objectives, a different system of preparation. True, in civilized countries the army does not perform internal functions. In Czarist Russia for example, such functions were performed by a gendarmerie. And it did quite well without military doctrine. But even in instructions followed by the gendarmerie, the probable adversary, the potential violator of the peace, was clearly defined. He was an anarchist or a social-democrat, a socialist-revolutionary or a Bundist. Do those who wrote this present doctrine realize that by not indicating any probable adversary within the country, they have thus wittingly or unwittingly fingered all political parties, all social groups as the probable adversaries of the Armed Forces? And doesn't that mean all of the Russian people?
