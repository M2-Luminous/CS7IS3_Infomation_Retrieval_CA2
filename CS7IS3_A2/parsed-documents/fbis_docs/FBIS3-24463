Khaustov: "At the Shipyards"] [Text] Almaz Shipbuilding Company The Almaz Shipbuilding Company in St. Petersburg, under contract to the Morskiye Sistemy Sukhogo Joint-Stock Company, has begun construction of the prototype of a series of passenger vessels with a small waterplane area (SMPV) -- the first ship of this type in domestic shipbuilding. The Agat Design Enterprise drew up the technical design (A-4) in 1992. The work documentation is specified for total completion in the 3d quarter of 1993. Basic Elements and Statistics Overall length, m -- 32.5 Overall width, m -- 11 Board depth, m -- 5.6 Draft, m -- 2.2 Displacement along summer load mark, t -- 139 Deadweight, t -- 24 Payload, t -- 17 Passenger capacity, persons -- 186 Speed, knots -- 25-29 The choice of the company to build the first SMPV with all-welded hull and superstructures made of high-strength aluminum-magnesium alloys was not a random one. For more than one decade, the enterprise has specialized in building naval ships and special ships with dynamic support principles, in particular, surface-effect vessels with steel and AMg-alloy hulls. Some of the naval ships built have no analogs with respect to performance and structure in domestic shipbuilding and even in the world. The new passenger ship, developed in accordance with the conversion program, is distinguished by its irregular contours, particularly those of the subsurface hulls, powerful main power unit with Z-shaped drive to two engines, unique system of reversing the ship and moderation of pitching. There are many new, non-traditional engineering designs in the structure of the SMPV. The passengers are ensured comfort when the sea conditions are five points on the scale. Among the suppliers of the ship's basic engineering equipment, gear and finishing and building elements are such well-known firms as MTU (FRG) -- main engines; Sperry Marine (United States) -- complete control system; NPO [Scientific Production Association] imeni N.Ya. Klimov -- angle reduction gears; ANTK imeni A.N. Tupolev -- passenger lounge equipment. The collective of engineers and specialists of the Almaz company, headed by A.P. Korolev, general director, has confidence in the successful development of the prototype ship, and in the future, of series construction of various modifications of the SMPV. (Yu.N. Peresvetov). Krasnoye Sormovo Yard Production Association On 13 March of this year, the plant launched the next cargo motorship of the "river-sea" type, the Volga. This ship, ordered by the Roschart Company, has been named Myskhako. The Sormovo workers are planning to broaden the export of their ships. These are, mainly, ships of the Volga type, with a cargo capacity of 4,000/5,500 t, of the Nizhniy Novgorod type (or Ni NO-3000, design 19611), with an average cargo capacity of 3,000 t, and the Rossiya type (design 17310) with a cargo capacity of 2,000/3,000 t. The set of documents for these ships was turned over for expert examination to the specialists of Det Norske Veritas classification society, to ensure that the export orders conform to the maximum to Western standards. On the whole, the ship meets the basic requirements of foreign shipowners and supervisory bodies. Motorships of the Volga type, however, for example, were marked by a relatively low level of automated ship control, and a large crew; the radio-navigation equipment is not up to the mark and some materials not recommended in the West (asbestos-containing) are used. In the process of negotiations with the Norwegian firms, the possibility of supplying other ships, including tankers, was discussed. Yaroslavl Shipyard The search for solvent buyers has been the yard's main problem recently. The yard often has to develop new ships at its own expense, since the traditional buyers often find themselves insolvent on the financial plane. Because of this, fishing trawlers, usually supplied to domestic enterprises, are increasingly often shipped overseas. For example, a contract was concluded with an Egyptian firm to build six freezer seine-trawlers from the modernized design 503. Alexandria will be the port of registry of the first one of them. Severnoye Machine Building Enterprise Production Association The association carried out 357 measures of the re-equipment plan in 1992. As a result, labor input was reduced by 562,000 norm-hrs, and the level of manual labor was reduced to 34.1 percent. Among the most important measures carried out are preparation to put into operation a new three-roll sheet-bending machine with a laser device, development of a completely mechanized line and a new press to face the boards of cabinet-type furniture with veneer, and installation and development of nine new digitally controlled metal-cutting machine tools. The following were included among the next tasks to improve production in 1993: developing a water-screen for the gas cutting of rolled sheet metal in hull-machining production, equipping the steel-smelting furnaces with hydro-gas-purifying systems, developing a unit to purify oven gases to melt glass, converting forging furnaces from mazut to gas, rebuilding the thermal subdivision for instrument production, etc. At the same time, conserving fuel, power and material resources and solving ecological problems are also priority goals. Perm Kama Shipyard The plant is mastering the building of small freezer shrimp trawlers (design 13307). They are designed to catch tropical shrimp with beam trawls and fish with a deep-sea trawl, using a stern trawling system, and also with a purse seine and a cone net, using electric light. The catch is frozen in horizontal-slab devices and an air-freezing locker. The trawlers are designed at the Kiev Leninskaya Kuznitsa Central Design Bureau, and are built to Registry class KM "Star" 1AZ (fishing). Basic Elements and Statistics Overall length, m -- 27 Width, m -- 7.6 Board depth, m -- 3.7 Draft along load mark, m -- 3.05 Displacement, t -- 314 Cruising capacity, days -- 20 Speed, knots -- 10.5 Crew, persons -- 6 A 6VD 18/16 AL-2 diesel with 450 kW power is used as the main engine. Aksay Fleet REB [Repair-Operations Base] The Aksay Repair-Operations Base of the river fleet, located in Aksay, in Rostov Oblast, is planning to begin building river-sea type cargo ships. The technical-economic substantiation for rebuilding and expanding the enterprise was made with the participation of the Hamburg firm, Blohm and Voss. It will take about 150 million German Marks, with a recovery period of 8-12 years, to put the project into effect. The possibility of building at least seven Sormovskiy type motorships a year is specified. Moreover, only the ship hulls will be formed, and their equipment and outfitting is to be carried out with the resources of two other enterprises at Rostov-on-Don -- the RIF Joint-Stock Company and Krasnyy Don. In addition, major ship repair work is planned. In particular, the Volga-Don Shipping Company AO [Joint-Stock Company] is interested in the realization of this project, and has already invested certain funds in modernizing the enterprise. In the near future, the Aksay Fleet REB will become a joint-stock company, and some of its shares will be offered to the investors to go toward clearing off the loan. Neva Planning-Design Bureau One of the conversion projects of this bureau is a medium-sized freezer-longliner trawler (design 13010). The ship is designed to fish with deep-sea and bottom trawls, as well as with a ground line. The fish-processing equipment provides the output of frozen cut-up fish products, including filets, and ground fish for feed. The ship class is KM "Star" L2AZ (fishing). The main power unit is a single-shaft, two-machine diesel-reduction unit based on 6Ch N22/24 diesels with 2X973 kW. Two shaft-driven generators (2X630 kW) and a diesel-generator (350 kW) are also stipulated. The variable-pitch screw (196 rpm) is 2.8 m in diameter. The bow thruster has 135 kW power. The set of commercial devices for trawl fishing will be Russian-Norwegian-made (RossNor Joint-Stock Company). The cargo system includes a hydraulic crane (1.8 t with an 8-meter radius) and two cargo booms, 3.2 t each. The refrigeration equipment consists of four compressor units, ensuring a temperature of -28ï¿½C in the holds, and three horizontal-slab freezer units with a total productivity of 36 t/day. A series of ships of this design is to be built for Russian buyers at the Zvezdochka Machine Building Enterprise in Severodvinsk. Basic Elements and Characteristics Length, m overall -- 53.3 between perpendiculars -- 46.2 Width, m -- 12.6 Board depth to main deck/upper deck, m -- 5.3/7.8 Cargo draft, m -- 4.7 Displacement (T = 4.7 m), t -- 1800 Cargo hold volume, m[.sup]3[/] -- 620 Cruising capacity, days --30 Number of bunks -- 32 Speed, knots -- 12.4 Chernomorskiy Shipyard Because the yard has stopped building heavy aircraft-carrying cruisers, problems have arisen with the work load of a number of production shops, and because of this, the idea is being discussed of organizing a shipbuilding concern in Nikolayev, which would include the Chernomorskiy Shipyard, the Shipyard imeni 61 Kommunar and the Okean Shipyard. This would make it possible to load their shops more uniformly, accordingly redistributing the orders for performing work done, for example, on manufacturing hull structures or producing machine building items. This concern would also have its own bank. It is possible that scientific institutions, UkrNIITS, for example, might join this association. In jointly solving, under mutually advantageous conditions, the problems facing the enterprises, the participants in this sort of association must at the same time retain financial independence and bear the responsibility for the results of their work. Almaz TsMKB [Central Marine Design Bureau] The Almaz Central Marine Design Bureau, within the framework of its conversion, has drawn up a design for a high-speed surface-effect skeg-type passenger-motor vehicle ferry, tentatively named the Mistral. The ship was created on the basis of the missile boat, Sivuch (NATO code name -- Dergach]. Basic Elements and Specifications Overall length, m -- 65 Width, m -- 18 Draft, m --3.3/1 Deadweight, t -- 220 Power, main engine, kW -- 36,700 Speed, knots -- up to 45 Cruising range, miles -- 400 The ferry can take on board 352 passengers and 67 motor vehicles. The sea-keeping qualities are ensured at sea waves up to 6 points. In addition to this ship, export versions, based on this design, of missile, anti-submarine and patrol ships, as well as Coast Guard ships, have been developed. Their total displacement is 750-850 t, maximum speed 45 knots, cruising range under displacement conditions -- 2,000 miles, and on air cushion -- 500 miles. Kherson Shipbuilding Association The next Arctic supply ship of the Ivan Papanin type will sail under the Chinese flag. The "christening" of the new ship, which was named Snow Dragon, took place in April of this year. This ship -- the first of this type in the Chinese People's Republic -- will be used for Antarctic expeditions. Construction of the next supply ship has continued at the building berth. Its name and the port of registry have not yet been determined. During approximately the same period, the association laid the keel of a new tanker-products-carrier. This ship differs somewhat from the preceding series of tankers with a deadweight of 28,000 t, through the reduced capacity of the cargo tanks (board depth of the preceding tankers was 3 m more). Other wishes of buyers, particularly those from Norway, have also been taken into consideration. Chaykovskiy Fleet REB The Chaykovskiy Repair-Operations Base of the river fleet (city of Chaykovskiy, Perm Oblast) is planning to build, in 1993-1994, pusher-tugs with 440 kW power, using Design No 81172 of the Sudostroyeniye Design Bureau Scientific Production Association. These river ships (River Registry class "O," ice) are designed to push dry-cargo consists and bulk barges with a total cargo capacity of up to 5,000 t, as well as to tow rafts and barges. Basic Elements and Statistics Overall length, m -- 34.4 Overall width, m -- 10.3 Board depth, m -- 2.7 Draft, m -- 1.4 Surface clearance, m -- 12.45 Tractive force (8 km/hr), kN -- 68.5 Cruising capacity, days -- 10 Crew, persons -- 12 Three variations of the tug have been worked out, depending on the type of towing and coupling devices used. The means of automation used on the ship provides the possibility of the power unit operating without a constant watch in the engine room. Shipyard imeni 61 Kommunar In accordance with a Ukrainian government decision, this yard will undergo 100-percent conversion. The shipyard, founded over 200 years ago especially to build the Russian Naval Fleet, has already cut back the volumes of building new naval ships from 80 to 20 percent. Finishing work and repair is being carried out for a number of buyers. At the same time, the financial capital promised by the government to convert production to the output of civilian ships and to modernize it is being withheld. The situation with respect to supplies of completing equipment, and the introduction of Ukraine's own currency -- the karbovanets -- have become difficult. After all, the yard obtains up to 80 percent of ship mechanisms, devices and instruments, as well as materials, from Russia. Nevertheless, the yard is expanding the program for the output of products for civilian purposes. A new design of transport refrigerator is being built, and contacts with new buyers, including foreign ones, are being developed. Feodosiya More Production Association The enterprise has begun series construction of three types of sea-going passenger hydrofoils. The prototype SPK [hydrofoil], Voskhod-2M, was launched at the beginning of January this year. Ten months passed from the laying of its keel in the building berth to its launching. According to some estimates, in a few years the association will be able to produce up to ten of these ships a year. Another prototype SPK, the Olimpiya, was launched on the eve of 1993. While it took about two years to build this ship, series SPK of this type should be built at quadruple the rate. At the beginning of the year the keels were laid in the building berth for four SPK of the Olimpiya type. Diesels from the German MTU firm were installed on them as the main engine. After the successful operation of the prototype double-deck gas-turbine-powered Tsiklon on the Tallinn-Helsinki line, it was decided to continue building ships of this type, but in a modernized version. The keel was laid for the Tsiklon-M SPK on 18 December 1992. Okean Shipyard The yard has began construction of a prototype ship with a deadweight of about 8,000 t, with a horizontal cargo-processing method. This rolker, for mixed sailing, is 140 m long and 16 m wide, and has a board depth of 8 m. The two main diesels, turning the two screw propellers, make it possible for it to get up to a speed of 13.5 knots. Wheel-and-track equipment will be loaded and unloaded along a cargo ramp. The ship is also suitable to transport international standard containers, both in the holds and on the upper deck. It is built on the order of the Ukrainian Delta Scientific Production Corporation. The Okean Shipyard is developing ships of this type for the first time, and they will replace the small fish-factory bases in the building berths, after the last ship of that series is turned over. Sever Production Association Screw propellers are among the types of goods produced by the Sever Production Association. To raise the quality of the screws, designed particularly for hydrofoils, specialists of the St. Petersburg State Marine Technology University, by order of this Production Association, are carrying out research and experimental work on using a theodolite-computer system to measure the geometrical parameters of the screws being produced by the association's specialized subdivision. The ultimate goal of the work is to increase the precision of the measurements, and optimize the technology of the marking-out and control operations. * * * The enterprise has begun series production of P1-PKV crystallizers -- special devices to intensify the process of sugar crystallization. The use of these devices will make it possible to increase the production of the prepared product at sugar plants, at the same time simplifying the procedure for controlling the manufacturing process. * * * The Arkhangelsk Oblast Council of the Shipbuilding Scientific Technical Association imeni Academician A.N. Krylov, summed up the results of a competition for the best work on mechanizing and improving manufacturing processes. The following works by association specialists were commended with honorary diplomas: "An Automated System for Producing a Set of Planning-Engineering Documents, Based on a Local Personal Computer Network" (E.S. Khandanyats), "Remote Control of Power and Heating Pump Stations" (P.A. Marin, Yu.M. Kotsov, V.O. Levshin), "A Stand for Testing Automatic Devices of the Elektron Series" (I.K. Chekrygin, Ye.F. Yermolin, V.A. Shilnikov), "Introduction of an MRN 340-01 Contact Machine for Group Projection Welding of Wire Screens" (V.I. Sergevnin, V.Ye. Sherstnev, G.G. Golyakov), "Modernization of the Gripping Mechanism of an M10P.62.01 Industrial Robot, Included as Part of an RTK [Robot-Technology Complex]" (A.V. Popov, V.M. Pozdeyev). Vint Scientific Production Association One of the latest works of the association's specialists is developing the structure of an active water-jet-type rudder (ARV). This rudder is designed for installation on transport, passenger, fishing and other vessels, in order to increase maneuverability in forward and reverse motion, and also to provide low speed for the ship when the main engine is switched off. The ARV is distinguished by increased reliability and ecological safety, which are ensured by the degree to which the working element is protected against mechanical damage and auto-rotation, and by eliminating from the design seals, angle gearing or a submerged electric motor in the sea space, characteristic of traditional active rudder systems. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Specifications of Three ARV Type-Sizes | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Power consumption,|30 |47 |95 | | kW | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Diameter of rotor,|0.3 |0.31 |0.54 | | m | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rotational speed |1,475 |1,450 |975 | |of rotor shaft, r-| | | | |pm | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Traction on moori-|4.9 |7.0 |15.0 | |ng lines, kN | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- When the ARV is in operation, the water enters through notches in the side surfaces of the rudder blade, or at the ends of it, to an axial or centrifugal pump. The appropriate driving force is created by the reaction of the jet of water ejected through a nozzle in the stern edges of the rudder blade. An experimental model of an ARV with 47 kW power has now been developed to fit type SRT fishing boats. Monolit Central Design Bureau This design bureau, located in Gorodets, in Nizhegorod Oblast, is the leading organization in shipbuilding in the field of designing ships with reinforced concrete hulls, floating repair, transport and launching docks, floating and floating-stand berths for various purposes, floating workshops, floating restaurants and hotels, and other vessels. The basic advantages of ships with a reinforced concrete hull include low metal-intensity and construction cost, low operating costs (no dry-docking and painting required when in operation), good durability and simple repair. The following ships are now being series-built at various enterprises from designs of the Monolit Central Design Bureau Joint-Stock Company: floating composite and metal repair docks with a load capacity of 5,000 t (including those for docking ships of the fishing industry fleet), floating workshops with a reinforced concrete hull, floating berths, metal and reinforced concrete, 154 and 108 m long, berthside pontoons, and floating cranes with a load capacity of 5 t. Specialists of the Central Design Bureau are also producing designs for dimensional modernization of docks, and are preparing the documentation to provide marine communications for ships running along inland waterways. PeterGaz Joint Venture This Dutch-Russian joint venture (partners -- Kheerema Oil and Gas Development and the Gas Industry) will design and build an underwater gas pipeline through Baydaratskaya Bay, which will connect the large gas deposits of Yamal with the main West Siberian gas pipeline. The 70-km underwater section of the route will include eight pipelines (1.22 m in diameter each), along which 170 billion m[.sup]3[/] of natural gas a year can be transported. The first two pipelines, worth $570 million, should be laid by 1996, and the last of them is planned to be put into operation in the year 2005. A number of Russian firms will be drawn in to carry out the marine part of the project. Work will be done under exceptionally difficult natural conditions. Suffice to say that Baydaratskaya Bay, located beyond the Arctic circle, is ice-free for a maximum of 100 days a year. The total cost of the project is estimated at several billion dollars. The materials used in the reports were from the newspapers SUDOSTROITEL, OKEAN, MORE, VODNYY TRANSPORT, KORABEL, TRUDOVAYA VAKHTA, KRASNYY SORMOVICH and others, as well as from publicity brochures and materials given to the editors by enterprises and organizations.
