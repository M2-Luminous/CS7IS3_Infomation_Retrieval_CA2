FR941205-1-00011 FR941205-1-00003 Associations may not make capital distributions that would cause capital to drop below the level required to remain adequately capitalized. The OTS believes that distinguishing among savings associations on this basis, rather than the current multi-tiered structure, is more appropriate for an industry that is generally not capital deficient. Notices and Applications Under the proposal, a savings association may make a capital distribution using one of three procedures: (1) without notice or application, if the association is not held by a savings and loan holding company and received a composite rating of ``1'' or ``2;'' (2) by providing notice to the OTS if, after the capital distribution, the association would remain at least adequately capitalized; or (3) by submitting an application to the OTS. The OTS notes that the first procedure_distribution without notice or application in certain circumstances_could permit a savings association to reduce its capital significantly and quickly so long as it remained at, or just above, the adequately capitalized threshold. OTS has proposed this procedure because it wishes to allow maximum flexibility to the best institutions consistent with its overall goal of reducing regulatory burden where possible and where consistent with safety and soundness. The OTS, however, specifically solicits comment on whether the broad flexibility that this procedure allows to the institutions that qualify to use it poses safety and soundness concerns. Commenters addressing this issue are also invited to suggest alternative procedures and/or additional conditions that would strike the appropriate balance between reducing regulatory burden and ensuring prompt and effective regulatory oversight. For instance, should notice be required if the dividend will cause the capital level to fall below ``well capitalized'' or, as the discussion below describes, if it exceeds an established threshold amount? The second procedure_distribution upon notice to OTS_would be available to institutions that do not qualify for the first, that is, to institutions with a composite CAMEL rating of lower than 2 or to those in a holding company structure. The third procedure_distribution upon application to and approval by the OTS_is available in two circumstances: first, if under PCA criteria the applicant institution is undercapitalized or would be undercapitalized after the capital distribution; second, if the applicant institution is not undercapitalized under the PCA standards but is nonetheless in ``troubled condition.''
