Apart from the popular opposition to the agreement inside the occupied territories, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that there is opposition within the Palestinian leadership in Tunis, as 'Arafat's attempt to convene a meeting of the PLO Executive Committee to brief it and seek its approval of the agreement has failed. [passage omitted] Palestinian sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that three Executive Committee members -- namely, Sulayman al-Najjab (representative of the Palestinian People's Party), Yasir 'Amr (independent), and Samir Ghawshah (representative of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front) -- refused to accept the invitation sent to them by 'Arafat to attend the committee's meeting to ratify the agreement -- which means there is no longer a sufficient quorum to endorse any decision in the highest executive authority inside the PLO. [passage omitted] The refusal of al-Najjab, 'Amr, and Ghawshah to agree on the security arrangements means that 'Arafat will not be able to pass the agreement constitutionally at the Palestinian level, as the number of those who approve of it will not reach 12, the number required to complete the quorum.
