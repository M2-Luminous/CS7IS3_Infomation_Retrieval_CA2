Jayaraj] [Text] Terrorism has developed into epidemic proportion the world over causing much concern to humanity as it subverts economic development and progress of nations. Reiteration to fight this menace rightly came from the visiting Uzbekistan president, Mr. Islam Karimov, and the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, when they addressed a joint press conference in New Delhi yesterday. The two leaders resolved to fight terrorism and counter religious fundamentalism for the well-being of their citizens. They also agreed that the forces of extremism threaten the democratic and secular fabric of the two nations. This is exactly in confirmation with the erstwhile Soviet policy of supporting India's stand that recourse to violence leads nowhere and that any problem should be resolved through peaceful negotiations. As Uzbekistan discarded the totalitarian ideology and accepted the norms of multiparty system and diversity of opinion, it is now [willing] to seek meaningful cooperation with countries having the same perceptions. Mr. Karimov's three-day stay in the Indian capital as a follow up of Mr. Narasimha Rao's visit to Tashkent in May last year is a reassurance for the growing geopolitical relationship between the two Asian neighbors. During the talks, Mr. Karimov had with several Indian leaders both the countries came out with renewed vigor to tackle cross border terrorism and accelerate the pace of economic ties for mutual benefits. The six agreements signed between the two leaders on joint ventures, economic ties, trade, and science and technology are expressions of the desire for strengthening the traditional good relations for faster economic progress of the two countries. Indeed, there is an urgent need to prevent conflicts and work towards expanding and developing regional and international cooperation. The first meeting of the Indo-Uzbek Joint Commission held in July last year and the measures it devised were efforts towards achieving this goal. Economic cooperation is not simply for monetary benefits alone, but it provides a forum for consolidating views on promoting political stability and world peace. Today, a nation cannot grow in isolation. History has witnessed the Central Asian region as a major confluence of cultural and economic activity. It is hoped that the future will witness creative interaction between the two Asian neighbors.
