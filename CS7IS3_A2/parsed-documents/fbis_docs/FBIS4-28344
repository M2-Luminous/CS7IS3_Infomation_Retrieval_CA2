On 6 June, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata stressed once again the government's stand of seeking a peaceful settlement, saying that "even if the situation becomes tense, we have to remain calm." But, Japan will have no choice but to make a political decision if the United States changes its mind and adopts a hard- line stand. Nevertheless, concerned ministries and agencies, which are trying to map out concrete measures to deal with possible scenarios, are hesitating to do what they have to do because complicated factors are involved in the issue, including "the Constitution," "human rights," and "the past." It is possible that depending on how things develop in the future, the issue may have a serious impact on the political situation in Japan. Therefore, we can say that the DPRK issue has reached a delicate stage. On 6 June, the government was busy dealing the North Korean issue. In the afternoon of the same day, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara chaired a "Joint Information Council" meeting, which was attended by each ministry's responsible officials, including the International Bureau chief of the Foreign Ministry and the chief of the Defense Agency's Bureau of Defense Policy. In the evening, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, and other officials held a meeting with the chief of the Foreign Ministry's Diplomatic Policy Bureau, who returned home after attending a Japanese-U.S.-ROK meeting in Washington, to talk about countermeasures to deal with the situation. The Joint Information Council was formed in 1983 to carry out coordination regarding issues that concern each ministry. The council has been studying countermeasures to deal with the North Korean issue since last fall. The list of possible "sanctions" that Japan submitted to the Japanese-U.S.-ROK meeting on 4 June was based on the outcome of meetings of this council. The council meeting lasted more than an hour, and those attending discussed "things that they had never before talked about" (according to one of those in attendance). After the meeting, Ishihara and other attendees agreed that they would remain tight- lipped, saying: "We exchanged unofficial information.... We will not disclose it at all." Fundamentally, the government's official stand is "to settle the issue through discussions" (according to Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai). A government source, in an attempt not to irritate the DPRK, stressed that "the meeting attended by the prime minister and other officials was not meant to be a big event like discussing countermeasures." On the other hand, the government needs to explain its stand to the United States. The prime minister clarified last night the government's stand that Japan will act in concert with the United States in making a decision on sanctions. This remark reflects the complicated composition of the relations between Japan and other countries. A top government official said: "This is an issue related to Japanese-U.S., Japanese-ROK, Japanese-Chinese, and Japanese-Russian relations. A change in our relations with one country will have an impact on our relations with other countries." The government has already compiled 10 nonmilitary measures to be prepared for a possible decision to impose economic sanctions on the DPRK. Of the 10 items, the Finance Ministry is worried the most about a ban on capital flows to North Korea. A senior International Financial Bureau official said: "This is completely different in terms of the extent of the sanctions imposed in the past. We hope that we can find a political settlement, if that is possible." The United States pointed out that funds from Japan are a "major source of finances" for the Kim Il-song regime. Therefore, it is certain that the United States will demand that Japan strictly check the flow of funds from Japan to North Korea. However, the government, if it wants to be thorough in imposing regulations, will have to force North Koreans living in Japan and others who travel to the DPRK to undergo strict body and luggage checks at airports and seaports. Some officials are beginning to express their concerns, saying that "this may create confusion over the human rights issue and at airports and seaports." As for a possible ban on the export of goods to North Korea, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] is saying that "We will carry out our duties once the government decides its policy" (according to a senior MITI official). It is possible to revise the Foreign Exchange Control Order and the Export Trade Control Order and to impose a ban within a few day after notifying the people of such a revision. The MITI has already taken action in this regard, and it has almost completed its in-house coordination. On the other hand, the Defense Agency [DA] is assuming a situation will develop in which the United Nations will be forced to impose sanctions on the DPRK by taking military action, including a naval blockade. Among other things, the same agency is studying possible legal difficulties involving a situation in which the Self- Defense Forces are asked to join and cooperate in logistical support by supplying fuel and food to the military forces of the United States and other countries. However, DA Administrative Vice Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama said: "That will be difficult because, generally speaking, the Self-Defense Forces are not allowed to carry out such tasks." It is inevitable that Japan will be faced with the issue of constitutional interpretations, including exercising the right of collective self-defense, should the discussions be extended to such matters as directly participating in a naval blockade. Many DA officials take a cool view of this and say, "We cannot possibly hold such discussions" (according to a senior DA official).
