"We have been forced to establish such an organisation to counter the attempts by other states to tear away Russian Far Eastern lands," learned Secretary of the Amur Geographic Society Valeriy Simakov told a RIA correspondent. "In particular we are concerned by the fact of the publication of an atlas of China's Heilungkiang Province where as Chinese territories are marked the Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy and Tarabarovy Islands, and also by their not being included in the plan of demarcation of the border." Among the committee members are leading public and political figures of the territory, including geographers and historians.
