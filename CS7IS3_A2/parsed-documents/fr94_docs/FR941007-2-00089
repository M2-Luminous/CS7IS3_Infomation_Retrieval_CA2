FR941007-2-00089 FR941007-2-00055 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Docket No. AB&hyph;52 (Sub-No. 77X)] The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company_Discontinuance of Service Exemption_In San Bernardino County, CA The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (Santa Fe) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_ Exempt Abandonments and Discontinuances of Trackage Rights to discontinue rail service over 1.96 miles of rail line in Santa Fe's Redlands Subdivision, extending from milepost 11.40 to milepost 13.14, in San Bernardino County, CA. 1 1 Santa Fe will be discontinuing its service on this former Santa Fe line, which was found to be owned by San Bernardino Associated Governments (with Santa Fe retaining a freight service easement) in Orange County Transp._Exempt._Atchinson, T. & S.F. Ry. Co., 10 I.C.C.2d 78 (1994) ( Orange County ). Santa Fe suggests that the Commission's finding in Orange County regarding ownership of the line was incorrect and asks that, if that decision is modified, this exemption be considered to constitute authority for Santa Fe to abandon the line as of the date of such modification. If such modification to Orange County were to occur, this notice would be reopened for appropriate action. Santa Fe has certified that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) there is no overhead traffic on the line; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic requirement), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee affected by the discontinuance of service shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on November 6, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay must be filed by October 17, 1994. Petitions to reopen must be filed by October 27, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 2 2 Because this is a discontinuance proceeding only, the routine provisions for trail use/rail banking or public use conditions provided for in abandonment proceedings are not appropriate here. A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Dennis W. Wilson, The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company, 1700 East Golf Road, Schaumburg, IL 60173. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. Santa Fe has filed an environmental report which addresses the effects of the discontinuance, if any, on the environment or historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by October 12, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public. Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision. Decided: September 30, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary.
