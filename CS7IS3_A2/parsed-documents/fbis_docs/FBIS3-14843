He believes the resolution of the political and economic amnesty is "the right and timely act. It does not flare up a civil war. It is those who are trying to stay in power." Ilyukhin said that according to the Russian Constitution adopted at the referendum on December 12, the adoption of the act on amnesty is the prerogative of the lower house of parliament and "the president, and the Federation Council have nothing in common with it. [no end quotation mark as received] Speaking about the resignation of the Russian Prosecutor General Aleksey Kazannik, Ilyukhin said that he made a premature step. "If he really wants to guard legality and order, he must not resign but implement the decision of the legislative body." The State Duma, believes Ilyukhin, will confirm the act again, since most deputies voted for it. By his actions the Russian President has confirmed again that he had never respected the old Constitution and will not respect the new, presidential Constitution, said Ilyukhin.
