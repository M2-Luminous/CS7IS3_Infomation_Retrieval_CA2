Last year saw the province cancel the mandatory production and marketing plan for most products, and lift the price ceilings from 92 percent of local products, including grain, oil-bearing seeds, cotton and silkworm cocoons. "This has paved the way for more successful market operations and revitalized the province's economy," said Deputy Governor Ji Yunshi, who is in charge of economic matters. "The province has adapted itself quickly to the macro-environment change in the economy," he noted. The deputy governor explained that Jiangsu, which is short of raw materials and energy resources, has focused on the processing industry. With thousands of small enterprises, the province used to be affected and limited by market changes. One manifestation was fluctuation in provincial economic growth during the 1986-90 period. Jiangsu's economy grew at a fast and abnormal speed in the first half of last year, and the speed slowed down in the later part of the year as a result of the central government's tightening of macro-control of the economy. As the enterprises' adaptability was enhanced, they quickly adjusted the orientation of investment and their product mix in line with needs of markets at home and abroad. The rural industrial enterprises, for example, raised more than 2.1 billion yuan by developing the partnership system last year. A survey shows that Jiangsu's gross domestic product still increased at a rate of 18.5 percent last year. Its industrial output value in the first two months of this year rose by at least 20 percent over the same period of last year. Economists here agree that the market economy has helped push Jiangsu's economy ahead. According to statistics, Jiangsu's gross retail sales volume reached 107.42 billion yuan last year, an increase of 33.9 percent over the previous year, and its exports also registered a big increase. The economists noted that Jiangsu's economic growth is based on market needs and is now developing in a healthy way. In particular, the province has made rapid progress in infrastructural facilities and basic industry. The province spent 6.773 billion yuan on improving transportation and telecommunications facilities last year, up 59.3 percent over the previous year and 33.7 percentage points higher over the investment in industry. In addition, the province invested more than four billion yuan in the development of the raw materials industry last year, up 23 percent. The deputy governor attributed the economic progress partly to the service trades and the establishment of foreign-funded enterprises. According to statistics, the added value of the service trades last year amounted to 62.3 billion yuan, an increase of 20.3 percent over the previous year, and its output accounted for 24.4 percent of the province's total. So far, the province has approved the establishment of more than 20,000 foreign-funded enterprises, of which over 7,000 have gone into operation. Many of their products are for export. The ten state economic development zones in Jiangsu and a number of provincial development zones are in smooth operation, and some have already begun to make profits.
