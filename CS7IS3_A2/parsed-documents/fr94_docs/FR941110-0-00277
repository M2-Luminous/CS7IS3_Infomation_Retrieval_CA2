FR941110-0-00277 FR941110-0-00017 Federal listing will automatically invoke listing under the State's endangered species act. Hawaii's endangered species act states, ``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been determined to be an endangered species pursuant to the [Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species under the provisions of this chapter *␣*␣*'' (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;4(a)). Therefore, Federal listing will accord the species listed status under Hawaii State law. State law prohibits cutting, collecting, uprooting, destroying, injuring, or possessing any listed species of plant on State or private land, or attempting to engage in any such conduct. State law also encourages conservation of such species by State agencies and triggers other State regulations to protect the species (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;4 and 5). Two populations of Poa mannii occur in forest reserves, which have rules and regulations for the protection of resources. State law mandates the development and implementation of programs concerning the conservation of biological resources, including this endangered species (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5(a)). National Environmental Policy Act The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).
