Mr Meyer's meeting was one of several being held with the mediators. Mr Meyer would not be drawn on what his meeting was about, but the parties are trying to settle their differences on the terms of reference so that mediation can get underway. The international mediation forum said in a statement that mediators were still in contact with the parties. They have apparently given the parties until lunchtime on Thursday to settle their differences on the terms of reference.
