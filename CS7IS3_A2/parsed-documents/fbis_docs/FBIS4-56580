In the opinion of the president of the unofficial office of the upper chamber, who calls for the formation of a competent government aimed at getting the country out of the deadlock, the solution must be Haitian. The Clinton administration is divided as to the strategy to adopt concerning the Haitian crisis, according to Sansaricq, who claims Republican support for implementation of Article 149. The statements by former U.S. President George Bush bear witness to that. Article 149 is the only solution to the crisis, according to Sen. Sansaricq, who condemns possible reinforcement of the sanctions on top of an already difficult situation. The embargo has already caused irreparable damage to the country: 50,000 deaths, according to the Grand'Anse senator, who appeals to the conscience and patriotism of the Haitian head of state for the lifting of the sanctions. Let us listen to Bernard Sansaricq. [Begin Sansaricq recording, in Creole] There may be a military intervention in Haiti. This has been requested by several U.S. senators and several members of the Black Caucus in the United States. It is with this objective... [pauses] For example, the recent visit to Haiti of Reverend Thomas Ferguson, who is a Black Caucus member from the Republican Party, clearly indicates that there are several sectors within the U.S. Government; there are sectors, especially the Republican Party, that support what we are doing in the Senate of the Republic. President Bush made a statement yesterday. What he said was very eloquent. He told President Clinton: Let Haiti be Haiti. [previous four words in English] Let Haiti be what it is, let Haitians find the solution to the problem by themselves. Let us Haitians take the necessary steps to solve the problem by ourselves.
