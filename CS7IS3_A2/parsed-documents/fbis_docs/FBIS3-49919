Clinton, however, did not make any new proposals going beyond the framework of the "Partnership for Peace", and did not make any concrete offers to the group. President Lech Walesa summed up the American proposal saying that "sometimes small is beautiful and we believe, this is a step in the right direction." President of the Czech Republic Vaclav Havel emphasised that the "Partnership for Peace" programme cannot be a substitute for full membership of NATO for the states involved. Havel added that the Visegrad countries regard membership in the "partnership" as the first step on the road to full NATO membership. Havel made it clear that the Czech Republic has no interest in trying to isolate Russia, but it can make sovereign decisions concerning its alliances.
