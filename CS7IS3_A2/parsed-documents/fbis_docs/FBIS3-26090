The discussions made some progress. In addition, the two sides exchanged opinions on how to place the relevant economic topics on the agenda. Giving a briefing to reporters at the end of the discussions today, Tang Shubei said: The two sides pragmatically and earnestly discussed relevant issues concerning the implementation of the "Joint Agreement on the Wang-Gu Talks," and made progress in two aspects. The two sides confirmed the "Agreement on Establishing a System of Making Contacts and Holding Talks Between the Two Organizations," and reached unanimity on the procedure on facilitating mutual visits by personnel of the two organizations in accordance with the agreement. The two sides would strive to make the agreement effective on 4 February after the wordings are checked. The two sides agreed that ARATS Deputy Secretary General Sun Yafu and relevant personnel would hold further discussions with SEF Deputy Secretary General Xu Huiyou [Hsu Hui-yu] and relevant personnel, on the common understanding on three routine issues reached during the ARATS-SEF talks in Taibei [Taipei] and on issues concerning the Tang Shubei-Jiao Renhe talks. In addition, the two sides exchanged opinions in general on how to place on the agenda the relevant economic topics specified in the "Joint Agreement on the Wang-Gu Talks." ARATS Deputy Secretaries Zhao Zhengyu and Li Yafei, as well as SEF Deputy Secretary General Shi Qiping [Shi Chi-ping], were separately appointed to form a working group to exchange opinions tomorrow. As Jiao Renhe and his entourage visited Beijing Municipality's Zhongguan Village New Technological and Industrial Development Experimental Zone this morning, this afternoon's discussions opened with Jiao Renhe's impressions of Zhongguan Village. Jiao Renhe said he was deeply impressed by the village and felt that there was very great potential for the village's development. He said: During the visit, I saw Mr. Jiang Zemin's inscriptions for the experimental zone: "Bring into play the intelligence and wisdom of Chinese intellectuals to develop high technology industries and advance toward the 21st century." Jiao Renhe felt that the statement was well made. If the intelligence and wisdom of the Chinese people were brought into play, China would definitely develop more vigorously. Jiao Renhe said: The process of Taiwan's economic development is also the experience of the Chinese people in bringing into play their intelligence and wisdom. While the mainland may draw on some of these experiences for reference, Taiwan too needs to learn from the mainland in some aspects. Tang Shubei said: The development of the people-run Zhongguan Village's scientific and technological undertakings is an achievement of the mainland's reform and opening up. Each of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait possesses its own advantages in science and technology. The mainland has numerous achievements in scientific and technological researches but has not done enough in transforming them into commercial products. Taiwan has done a very good job in transforming scientific and technological achievements into commodities. If the two sides could learn from each other and strengthen their cooperation, it would definitely be conducive to the joint promotion of cross-strait scientific and technological undertakings. During the discussions, Tang Shubei gave a fairly detailed briefing on the mainland's advocation on developing cross-strait economy, and forwarded suggestions on ways to strengthen cross-strait economic cooperation. Tang Shubei said: We feel that all the various agenda items specified by the "Joint Agreement on the Wang-Gu Talks" should be implemented. Currently, cross-strait economic exchanges and cooperation is an important content in cross-strait relations. Last year's cross-strait economic and trade exchanges showed that increased Taiwanese investments in the mainland is helpful to the mainland's economic development. On the other hand, Taiwan's ability to maintain a foreign trade surplus is also directly due to the development of indirect cross-strait trade. It has been proven in practice that the principle determined by the "Wang-Gu talks"; that is, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should strengthen cross-strait economic exchanges as well as supplement and benefit each other, is correct. The two organizations should be responsible to the people on both sides of the strait and should hold consultations on relevant issues at an early date. During the discussions, both sides felt that cross-strait cultural exchanges should be further broadened. The ARATS thanked the SEF for warmly receiving responsible persons of seven central press units during their visit at the beginning of this year. The ARATS will continue to send responsible persons and senior journalist delegations from the mainland's press units to Taiwan for visit, and is ready to warmly receive visits to the mainland by responsible persons of Taiwan's mass media. The ARATS will also promote cross-strait exchanges and mutual visits between young people and students. Replying to a reporter's question, Tang Shubei said: The experiences in cross-strait cooperation among the mass organizations in the past three years have shown that it is feasible to avoid [hui bi 0932 6699] sensitive political issues at this stage. In accordance with this principle, the two sides signed the "Jinmen [Quemoy] Agreement" and "Agreement on the Use and Verification of Notary Certificates Between the Two Sides of the Strait." It has been proven that if the two organizations were sincere to solve problems and insisted on the principle of holding discussions on people-to-people basis, ways of solving routine problems acceptable to the two sides could be found. While giving a briefing to reporters on the discussions, Jiao Renhe said: At today's discussions, the two organizations exchanged opinions on the three agenda items in their Taibei talks. The discussions of the two sides were quite specific and their exchange of views was very thorough. The two sides expressed their wishes to find ways for solving problems. He expressed the hope that more progress would be achieved during the next two days' discussions.
