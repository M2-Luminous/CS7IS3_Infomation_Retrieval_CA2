The collegium session was attended by officials of the president's administration, the government, the Russian Procuracy, military district and fleet troop commanders, and military commissars from a number of Russian oblasts. The session participants said that the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, military district commands and staffs, and military commissariats, in conjunction with chief administrators, had made strong efforts to support the fall 1993 conscription of citizens for military service and manpower acquisition for the Russian Federation Armed Forces. Despite the measures taken, however, the military conscription target was not met completely. This was the result of a number of factors, including the continuing increase in the number of instances of evasion of military service. In order to carry out the conscription of citizens for military service and manpower acquisition programs for the Armed Forces in 1994 in a well-organized fashion, collegium members adopted a decision to request the Russian Federation government to accelerate the process of reviewing and confirming statutes on military registration, military conscription, and medical examinations for military conscripts and a schedule of rated military specializations. The Defense Ministry Collegium also resolved to make every effort to ensure the high-quality selection and recruitment of citizens for contract military service in accordance with established targets and to fill all warrant officer vacancies in the Army and Navy. The session participants called attention to the need to enlist as many representatives of labor collectives, educational institutions, and public organizations as possible in work with conscripts during the spring conscription campaign.
