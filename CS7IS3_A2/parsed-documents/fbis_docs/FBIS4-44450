Implementation of 1993 Plan for Gansu Provincial Economic and Social Development Gansu had maintained sustained and steady economic growth in 1993, while strengthening macro-regulation and control, accelerating economic restructuring, insuring the completion of major construction projects and raising economic efficiency. At the same time, various social undertakings had made progress in a coordinated manner. the gross provincial product in 1993 reached 34.9 billion yuan, up 10.7 percent over 1992, of which the primary industry grew 6.8 percent, the secondary industry 10.9 percent and the tertiary industry 13.8 percent. -- A bumper harvest was reaped in agriculture. The total grain output hit a record high, reaching 7.5 billion kg, an increase of 600 million kg over 1992. Rural enterprises made rapid progress with their output value amounting to 17.72 billion yuan. They had overfulfilled the 50 percent target for growth set by the provincial CPC committee and the provincial government. The per capita peasant's net income reached 563 yuan. The total industrial output value rose to 50.18 billion yuan, an increase of 14.7 percent. The output of major industrial products also saw vigorous growth with double-digit growth rates in the production of steel, nonferrous metal, raw coal and power generation. -- Investments in fixed assets in the province totaled 11.24 billion yuan in 1993, an increase of 32.1 percent, of which the primary industry grew 4.5 percent, the secondary industry 10.9 percent and the tertiary industry 92.2 percent. Investments in basic infrastructure from local state-owned enterprises rose to 2.61 billion yuan, an increase of 43.6 percent. Investments in developing renovations and technical transformation totalled 1.21 billion yuan, up 9.8 percent. -- The value of exports in 1993 totaled US$280 million. Contracts with foreign countries were concluded totaling US$523 million. An actual US$290 million was put into use. The number of registered Sino-foreign joint ventures, cooperative and solely foreign-funded enterprises reached 723, of which 500 started to operate in 1993. Their total investments reached US$960 million with US$400 million from foreign investors. -- New progress was made in establishing markets. More than 1,770 markets of all types for producer goods and rural bazaars were set up in the province, and their volume of business was valued at approximately 10 billion yuan. The value of retail sales in the province in 1993 reached 16.19 billion yuan, an increase of 20.4 percent over 1992; and revenues totalled 5.21 billion yuan, up 30.5 percent. At the end of 1993, the total bank deposits rose by 4.62 billion yuan and loans were increased by 6.57 billion yuan. There were more localities in the province where experiments were carried out for the development of the shareholding system. The number of shareholding enterprises approved by the relevant provincial authorities reached 125. While Gansu's economy is being developed, new progress was also made in the fields of science and technology, education, culture, public health, sports and other social undertakings. However, there remained some outstanding contradictions and problems in economic operation in 1993. 1) The agricultural foundation remained weak. Basic conditions for agricultural production had not been fundamentally improved. 2) Funds of all types were still insufficient. 3) There was a shortage of rail transportation. Sharp contradictions remained between transportation capacity and freight volume. 4) Some enterprises reported more losses and their economic efficiency remained low. 5) The product mix of some outmoded enterprises in petrochemical, machine-building and textile industries was irrational because they lacked money to carry out renovations. 6) General commodity prices continued to rise, lowering the living standards of some residents and peasants in poverty-stricken areas. II. Guiding Thought and Main Targets for 1994 Plan The guideline set by the 1994 plan is to implement the guideline laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress (Decision): work hard to carry out major reforms in all fields; open even wider to the outside world; base ourselves on both international and domestic markets, on two kinds of resources, on the two types of funds; and help enterprises change the way they operate, optimize their structure and raise their economic efficiency. We must utilize all available financial resources to develop major construction projects; continue to strengthen the foundation for agricultural production; quicken the pace in developing local industries, rural enterprises and the tertiary industry; maintain sustained, rapid and healthy development of the national economy; and promote economic and social development in a coordinated manner. The main targets and tasks set in the 1994 plan for economic and social development in Gansu are as follows: -- We should strive to increase the total production output value by 9.5 percent, of which the primary industry grows by 5 percent (agricultural production output value by 5 percent), the secondary industry by 9.6 percent (industrial production output value by 9.6 percent) and the tertiary industry by 13 percent. -- Gansu's investments in fixed assets should reach 9.69 billion yuan at the beginning of 1994, which will mark an increase of 32.1 percent over 1993. Local investments in fixed assets should rise to 7.338 billion yuan, of which 5.24 billion yuan should come from state-owned units, an increase of 51.7 percent; 991 million yuan should come from collectively owned units, an increase of 41.6 percent; and 1.1 billion yuan should come from individual investors, an increase of 22.2 percent. As for investments in fixed assets from state-owned units, funds earmarked for capital construction should reach 2.947 billion yuan, an increase of 66.2 percent; funds earmarked for technical innovations should reach 1.35 billion yuan, an increase of 17.4 percent; funds earmarked for the construction of residential houses should reach 685 million yuan, an increase of 95.7 percent; and other investments should reach 265 million yuan, an increase of 47.2 percent. -- Financial revenues in the province should increase slightly to reach 5.35 billion yuan. -- The total value of retail sales in Gansu should reach 18.5 billion yuan, up 14.3 percent, while the inflation rate should be placed under control around 10 percent. -- The plan sets the total value of imports and exports at US$472 million, an increase of 18 percent. It sets the target for exports at US$330 million and that for imports at US$142 million of which the import of technologies will reach US$43 million. -- Population in the province should be controlled within 23.85 million and the natural rate of population growth 14.9 percent by the end of 1994. -- The plan sets the per capita peasant's net income at 613 yuan, an increase of 50 yuan. By fulfilling the aforementioned targets for the provincial economy, Gansu will be able to make new progress and achieve, one year ahead of schedule, the goal set by the Eighth Five-Year Plan.
