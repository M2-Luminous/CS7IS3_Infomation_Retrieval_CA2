This is because Japan's stance of rejecting numerical targets was firm and an attempt to find a political compromise by holding ministerial negotiations fell through. On the contrary, Kantor, who had demonstrated his stance of not resuming trade negotiations unless Japan agrees to accept the numerical targets, was forced to agree to the resumption of vice ministerial talks. On the evening of 2 February, Hiroshi Kumagai, international trade and industry minister, greeted Kantor by jokingly saying: "I met with Deputy Prime Minister Hata a little while ago. His face was swollen up because you gave him a strong punch." At his meeting with Hata, deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign minister, Kantor, while hinting at the possibility of applying sanctions against Japan, urged Hata to accept the numerical targets. Kantor's appeal was so strong that Foreign Minister Hata had to call for resumption of the meeting. Hata felt that it would not be "beneficial to Japan if Kantor goes home angry." "Japan drops out of a poker game if you bluff regardless of your cards in hand." Comparing negotiations with Japan to a poker game, U.S. officials are reportedly cracking a joke, saying that the best way to carry out negotiations with Japan is to assume a hard-line stance. Kantor faithfully put this tactic into practice. However, many Japanese Government officials were saying, even before Kantor came to Japan: "All we have to do is to make counterarguments even if Kantor strongly insists on his demands." "Probably, Kantor himself does not think that he has a change to win. He must be thinking that it will be a bonus if he manages to extract a compromise from Japan." It can be said that the Japanese Government officials knew Kantor's tactic. On 4 February after the resumed meeting with Foreign Minister Hata, Kantor called his trip a "significant trip." However, some Japanese officials analyzed Kantor's remark coolly and said: "What he means is that he recognized the differences of opinion between Japan and the United States and that he confirmed Japan's stance of not making a compromise over the numerical targets." In addition to putting finishing touches to mapping out an action program (action plan) regarding government procurement, Japan is doing its best in buckling down to the task of preparing a cooperation plan, based on efforts by private companies, in the field of car and car parts as well. Members of the Japanese negotiation team are saying: "The United States will withdraw its demands at the end because Japan is doing its best. Possibility of cooperation will expand only if the United States withdraws its demands on the numerical targets." It is still unknown if the negotiations will turn out as the Japanese delegation team has figured. Everything depends on the vice ministerial talks, which will start on 7 February in Washington.
