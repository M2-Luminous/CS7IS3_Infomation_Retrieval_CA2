This was decided by Polish politicians, claims Janusz Bryczkowski, who has invited the leader of the Russian nationalists. In his opinion, ignoring a politician of this standing is proof of a lack of the self-preservation instinct. [Correspondent Wojciech Hoflik] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will be accompanied by his closest colleagues, including Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, deputy president of the Russian [State] Duma, among others. They will visit Warsaw, Krakow, Auschwitz, and Grunwald. [Janusz Bryczkowski, leader of the Self-defense National Front, identified by caption] It is not a tribute to be paid to those who were murdered in Auschwitz. This was not our aim. The motivation was simply human curiosity of a man who would like to see the Auschwitz [concentration] camp. [video shows Bryczkowski speaking at a news conference] [Hoflik] Up until now, no Polish politicians, other than the ones who support the [Self-Defense National] Front, have expressed their willingness to meet the leader of the Russian nationalists, although, according to Bryczkowski, they still have a chance to do so. It is even more worrying because this may be the last opportunity to improve the poor relations with our eastern neighbor, Janusz Bryczkowski believes. This is called for by Polish raison d'etat. [Bryczkowski] Unfortunately, after the division of Europe imposed by Stalin, we were given a part of Europe to which we have no full territorial rights, and one must openly talk about this. However, one must also openly say that, despite the fact that we have no full rights to these territories that we were given, we will, at the same time, insist that the European borders not be changed, as Mr. Zhirinovskiy and other great Russian Federation politicians have declared it. [Hoflik] Members of the Self-Defense National Front feel strong bonds with the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and are counting on close cooperation with this group. We are not Fascists, Bryczkowski stresses, unless everyone who struggles for sovereignty is a Fascist. [Vladimir Voronkov, press councillor of the embassy of the Russian Federation, identified by caption, speaking in Polish to camera] This is Mr. Zhirinovskiy's private visit. He has not been invited by the Polish Sejm but by political parties. This is all I can say. [Hoflik] Do you envisage the possibility of a scandal, like, for example, in Bulgaria? [Voronkov] We hope it will not come to that. [Hoflik] Is the embassy on alert? [Voronkov] No, not at all.
