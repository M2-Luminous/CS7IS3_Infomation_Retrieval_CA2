Mississippi has adopted drinking water regulations for the Phase V (Volatile Organic Chemicals (VOC), Synthetic Organic Chemicals (SOC), and Inorganic Chemicals (IOC)) Rule.

Frivolous or insubstantial requests for a hearing may be denied by the Regional Administrator. However, if a substantial request for a public hearing is made within thirty (30) days after this publication, a public hearing will be held. If no timely and appropriate request for a hearing is received and the Regional Administrator does not elect to hold a hearing on his own motion, this determination shall become final and effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Federal Register .
