FR941216-1-00148 FR941216-1-00012 Subpart O_Collection and Destruction Requirements for Ammunition and Explosives §184.188 General. This subpart provides safety requirements for the collection and destruction of ammunition and explosives. At this writing, the Environmental Protection Agency is developing rules which apply to each contractor beyond the scope of this part. Explosive safety should not be compromised while meeting environmental considerations. §184.189 Protection during disposal operations. (a) Operational shields and special clothing shall protect personnel in facilities with explosives materials. Fragmentation hazards require, at a minimum, overhead and frontal protection for personnel. Shelters should be located at the inhabited building distance appropriate for the quantity and type of materials being detonated. Personnel shall use such protective measures when destroying explosive materials by detonation and when burning explosive materials that may detonate. Personnel shall not approach the burning site, but shall wait until the fire is out. (b) Personnel shall never work alone during disposal and destruction operations. Warning sings or roadblocks shall restrict the area. One person, available in an emergency, should observe from a safe distance while another performs the operations. §184.190 Collection of ammunition and explosives. (a) Water-soluble materials. Enough water should be used in neutralizing ammonium picrate (explosive D), black powder, and other soluble materials to ensure their complete dissolution. As little material as practicable should be dissolved at one time. Sweeping floors before washing them down reduces the amount of dissolved material in the wash water. When uncertainty exists concerning the purity and composition of wash water, experts shall be consulted. (b) Solid wastes. Explosive-contaminated solid waste material shall be collected; placed in closed containers; and swiftly removed to buildings for treatment or holding, or to the burning ground for destruction. (c) Explosives dusts. (1) High explosives dusts such as TNT, tetryl, explosive D, composition B, and pentolite should be removed by a vacuum system. A ``wet collector'' that moistens the dust near the point of intake and keeps it wet until the dust is removed for disposal is preferred for all but explosive D, which should be collected in a dry system. (2) More sensitive explosives such as black powder, lead azide, mercury fulminate, tracer, igniter, incendiary compositions, and pyrotechnic materials may be collected by vacuum, provided they are kept wet close to the point of intake. Collect each type, representing a different hazard, separately, so that black powder, for example, cannot mix with lead azide. Provision should be made for releasing any gases that form. The use of vacuum systems for collecting these more sensitive materials should be confined to operations involving small quantities of explosives, that is, operations with fuzes, detonators, small-arms ammunition, and black powder igniters. To minimize the fire and explosion hazard, collection of scrap pyrotechnic, tracer, flare, and similar mixtures in No. 10 mineral motor oil or equivalent is required. Materials collected in the dry state shall be placed in an oil-containing receptacle available at each operation throughout the shift. The oil level should be about 1 inch above the level of any pyrotechnic mixture in the container. Containers of scrap explosive shall be removed from the operating buildings for disposal at least once per shift. Applicably rated class B firefighting equipment shall be available when oil is used. (d) Design and operation of collection systems. (1) Collection systems and chambers shall be designed to prevent pinching thin layers of explosives or explosive dust between metal parts. Pipes or ducts used to convey dusts require flanged, welded, or rubber connections. Threaded connections are prohibited. The system shall prevent explosives dusts from accumulating in parts outside the collection chamber. Pipes or ducts conveying high explosives shall have long radius bends. Systems for propellant powder may use short radius bends provided they are stainless steel, with polished interior. Vacuum application points should be kept to a minimum. Each room requiring vacuum collection should have a separate exhaust line to the primary collection chamber; if this is not possible, no more than two bays shall be serviced by a common header. Wet primary collectors are preferred. The length of vacuum line from points of application of vacuum to the wet collectors should be short. A single secondary collector shall service as few primary collectors as possible. Not more than two dry primary collectors shall be connected to a single secondary collector (wet or dry type). If an operation does not create a dust concentration potentially posing a severe health hazard, manual operation of the suction hose to remove explosives dust is preferred, since permanent attachment to the explosive dust-producing machine increases the likelihood of propagation through the collection system of a detonation at the machine. Manually operated hose connections to explosive dust-producing machines should not interconnect. (2) Two collection chambers shall be serially installed ahead of the pump or exhauster to prevent explosives dust from entering the vacuum producer in a dry vacuum collection system. (3) Slide valves for vacuum collection systems are permitted; however, there shall be no metal-to-metal contact. An aluminum slide operating between two ebonite spacer bars or similar, compatible materials will eliminate unacceptable metal-to-metal contact. (4) Dry-type portable vacuum collectors, limited to five pounds of explosives, shall be located in a separate cubicle having substantial dividing walls, or outside the building; never in a bay or cubicle with explosives. Wet-type portable vacuum collectors may be placed in explosive operating bays or cubicles, provided the quantity of explosives in the collector is limited in accordance with the requirements of §184.190(e)(1) through (e)(3). For dry collection of quantities in excess of five pounds or wet collection of quantities in excess of 15 pounds, the provisions of §184.190(e)(1) through (e)(3) also apply. (5) The design of wet collectors shall provide for proper immersion of explosives, breaking up air bubbles to release airborne particles; and for removal of moisture from the air leaving the collector, to prevent moistened particles of explosives from entering the small piping between the collector and the exhauster or pump. (6) At lease once every shift, explosives dust shall be removed from the collection chamber to eliminate unnecessary and hazardous concentrations of explosives. The entire system should be cleaned weekly, with parts dismantled as necessary. (7) The entire explosives dust collecting system shall be electrically grounded. The grounding shall be tested on a locally determined schedule. (8) Small vacuum systems positioned close to work stations shall be shielded. (e) Location of collection chambers. (1) Whenever practicable, dry-type explosives dust collection chambers, except portable units, shall be located in the open, outside operating buildings, or in buildings set aside for the purpose. To protect operating personnel from blast and fragments from the collection chamber, a barricade or operational shield appropriate for the hazardous quantities involved, shall be provided between the operating building and the outside location or separate building housing the collection chamber. At least 3 feet shall separate the collection chamber from the barrier wall.
