The 100 or so military enterprises were set up within the mountainous areas of Guizhou chiefly during the 1960s when China strengthened national defense. They are strong in technology, equipment and quality products. Nowadays, these plants, which are turning out more and more civilian products, have to break through their high walls to meet with new demands in China's developing market economy. They need more land and labor and part of their civilian products have to get necessary spares locally. Meanwhile, local rural people need technology and talented personnel to help them shake off poverty. Seeing that local counties and military plants are complementary, officials helped to bridge the two by inviting leaders of the military plants to visit township and village enterprises. As a result, 38 local counties have introduced funds, equipment and technology from the military plants. Some 130 integrated complexes have been set up to deal with the production of coal, phosphorus, lead, antimony, marble and tobacco with the help of military plants. The complexes mainly produce necessary parts for refrigerators, motor vehicles, tractors and satellite ground receivers. Last year, rural industries of the province turned out 10 billion yuan worth of products, a 30 percent increase over the previous year.
