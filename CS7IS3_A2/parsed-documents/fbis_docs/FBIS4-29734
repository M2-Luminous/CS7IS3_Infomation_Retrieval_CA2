There seems to be no clear consensus on such an important question, as the 21 dissident PTP members, apparently with the support of party founder Chamlong Simuang, threaten to withdraw their support for the government. The Prime Minister maintained on Friday that he still had the support of the PTP. But events in the Phalang Tham Party were not encouraging. A few hours before Chuan made his statement, three prominent PTP members submitted their resignation from political positions in the government. The PTP members were apparently upset by the government whip's decision on Thursday to block a motion tabled by their colleagues seeking to set up a committee to draft a new constitution. The situation is made even more complicated by early signs that tomorrow's meeting of the PTP's executive committee could develop into a resolution to withdraw from the Coalition. "We will leave it to Prime Minister Chuan to decide whether to reshuffle the Cabinet or to dissolve the Lower House," a PTP source told the press on Thursday night, after the 21 disgruntled PTP MPs held a meeting to discuss the government whip's action. Regardless of the outcome of the PTP executive committee meeting, Chuan should consider the matter from the perspective of whether his decision will be to the advantage of the people. Many PTP members have been unhappy since the party decided to join the Coalition some 20 months ago. Many of the PTP's major policy issues have not received the full backing of the government. Among these issues are the decentralization of administrative power, the traffic problems, and efforts to help defuse the "Chalat crisis" by reforming the country's democracy through the 21 MPs' motion. The end of the protest by Chalat's supporters at least offers Chuan the chance of getting back on course, of mending ties with his coalition partners. He can start by seeking a meeting with Chamlong, and try to reach a settlement that will pacify those MPs who keep the conflict burning. If there's no hope of a reconciliation with the PTP, Chuan may have to think about a new coalition lineup that may include an opposition party. The issue is whether there will be a simple conclusion to the move toward realignment. The formation of new partnerships between political parties is always easier said than done. For a start, Chuan will have to consult with the three other coalition partners, namely the New Aspiration, Seritham and Solidarity parties. More importantly, the selection of a new political partner must be carried out in the manner understood by the people. The country's economic development cannot be maintained with an endless series of political manoeuvring. The political game being played has caused people in business to feel uneasy. In forming a new government, Chuan must also ensure that the campaign for political reform -- set in motion by hunger striker Chalat Worachat and pro-democracy groups is not stopped. Learning from the Chalat fiasco, any new government must deal squarely with establishing political ethics and firm political foundations that will promote greater public participation in grassroots politics. The support of the people cannot be gained if politicians were to make efforts at forming partnership for the sole purpose of gaining control of the Government.
