Do you believe that Israel is incapable of providing security for the Palestinians or is it not interested in their security? ['Arafat] I would like to say something very important. There is full involvement by the Israeli Army in the crime that took place today, that massacre which was carried out in the Ibrahimi Mosque. The army had been an accomplice in many earlier incidents. When I say this I do not say it lightly. It is known that the Israelis have sequestered Sarah's Grotto, which was Abraham's wife's, and turned it into a synagogue. This was done inside the mosque. Therefore, there is constant guard at the entrances of the mosque and around it. That is why they cannot say that any settler could sneak in with his weapon. The settlers entered behind an army captain and under cover of the Israeli army. They committed their crime, which has resulted so far in 65 martyrs and 256 wounded people. The army covered the getaway of these criminals. It also opened fire on the people; six martyrs fell and about 22 persons were wounded as a result. The number of martyrs in Hebron has not been counted as yet. In addition, the army is staging confrontations in all areas; in Gaza, Ramallah, Qalandiyah, Bethlehem, Qalqilyah, and Nabulus, where dozens of people have been martyred or been wounded since morning. There is complicity between the army [pauses] it might not be in the army. But a considerable sector of the army command was accomplice to this crime, earlier crimes, and the crimes that are taking place throughout the country at present. I would like to remind you, Sister Shadiyah, that I clearly pointed a few weeks ago to the army's involvement in distributing and selling weapons in the territories. They think that by the time they withdraw, chaos will prevail among our people, our folk, and our strugglers. This tells us that there is an integrated plan which the Israeli Army is carrying out. Let people near and far realize the dimensions of this crime. [Riyad] Mr. President, there is an uproar among the Palestinian population, some of whom call for suspending the negotiations because the atmosphere is not appropriate. Do you think that this ugly massacre will lead to the suspension of negotiations or will it dictate continuing and speeding up these negotiations? ['Arafat] No doubt, we must understand that the main objective of these criminals is to strike at the peace process. We are now studying all possibilities. [Riyad] Does this require a revision of the concepts governing the peace process and does this development dictate new issues? ['Arafat] No doubt, it will have extremely negative effects on the entire peace process. I contacted all the international sides, the co-sponsors of the peace conference, the permanent members of the UN Security Council, and the EU members, all the European states, the nonaligned states, the Islamic states, the Arab states, the African states, and all our friends in the world. I also asked that an immediate and emergency session of the UN Security Council be convened. We demand international protection following the actions with the collusion of the Israeli army and the armed settlers as part of an integrated plan. Therefore, we urge all the honest people of our friends and all our Arab and Muslim brothers, all the peace-loving people, and all the freedom-loving people to immediately help us by putting an end to these massacres and to swiftly introduce international protection for our people inside our occupied territories. [Riyad] Mr. President, this brings me to a question about your expectations concerning the reaction of the international community. If I rightly recall, in 1990 there was another massacre in the al-Aqasa mosque in which dozens were killed, but maybe not as many as those killed today. At that time, the matter was referred to the UN Security Council, which condemned Israel. The Palestinians then called for international security, but Israel refused and the international community could not enforce such protection. Do you think that this scenario will be repeated, or are things different now? ['Arafat] Everything has become exposed. As of today, the world, the world leaders, and the world officials should shoulder their international responsibilities, humanitarian responsibilities, political responsibilities, and moral responsibilities. They must give their word. Will they leave Israel and its army to carry out acts of belligerency against the Palestinian people, against our faithful, our worshipers, women, children, and people? Will they leave this belligerency without control? I say that the entire world must know that our people will not kneel down. This is the people of martyrs. We are all martyrs-in-waiting. People far and near must understand these words. [Riyad] Thank you sir. ['Arafat] May God bless you. [Riyad] Thank you very much. ['Arafat] Thank you.
