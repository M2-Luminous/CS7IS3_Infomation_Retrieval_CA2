As far back as 1980, Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun, and other leaders of the older generation solemnly pointed out: The style of a ruling party is one concerning the life and death and the rise and fall of the party. Since then, the party Central Committee and the State Council have always listed the rectification of party and government styles and a change in cadre style as an important element that has to be grasped every year. To this end, they have approved and adopted a series of decisions and measures for rectifying unhealthy tendencies, fighting corruption, and advocating clean government. At its second meeting last year, the Central Discipline Inspection Commission put forward the tasks, requirements, and specific policies for the anticorruption struggle. At its third meeting, held some time ago, it again put forward specific requirements for the anticorruption struggle. These important decisions and measures have played an important role in the building of the party, political power, and the contingent of cadres. However, it should also be noted that the phenomenon of impurities in party, government, and cadre styles are still serious. Although the struggle against corruption has attained marked results, there is still a big gap when compared with the actual problems and the demands of the masses. How, then, should we approach the problems in party, government, and cadre styles? There is a view that, despite the efforts to rectify them annually, the problems in party, government, and cadre styles still exist, have gone from bad to worse, and have become an incurable disease. In the eyes of these comrades, there seem to be only negative and dark sides without any ray of light. This is similar to Su San's remark in "Sending a Prisoner Away Under Escort": "There is not a good person in Hongdong County." Is that so? No. This is a one-sided, exaggerated, and pessimistic view. If you challenge them to "cite the facts," they can only cite tidbits of phenomena and rumors. Although there are indeed many problems in actual life, we should make an analysis when looking at them. At the macro level, since the reform and opening up a dozen years or so ago, China's productive forces have been enormously emancipated, with the output of steel, coal, electricity, petroleum, and grain doubling and redoubling; with its gross domestic product exceeding 3,000 billion yuan and its foreign trade volume approaching $200 billion, China's comprehensive national power has grown considerably; and the urban and rural people's livelihood has generally improved. This is a universally acknowledged tremendous achievement! Even former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said with assurance that China would become a major economic power in the world in his remaining years. Looking around the world today, which country has developed at such a high speed and attained such huge achievements? Given such a flourishing and vigorous country, it is inconceivable that its leadership should be "unacceptable." "The policies of the central authorities are good and the enthusiasm of the masses is soaring." This is entirely correct. What is similarly correct is that the party and government cadres at all levels have performed meritorious deeds that cannot be obliterated in implementing the good policies and organizing and bringing into play the people's wisdom. Most cadres have made contributions and worked painstakingly in promoting reform and opening up, state progress, social stability, and economic development. "Once the line is established, cadres are the determining factor." This is a truth repeatedly proved in history. We can also make observations from a micro level. Everyone can observe the cadres and party members around him and make a fair, unprejudiced assessment. Are the good and relatively good cadres in the majority or are the bad and unacceptable ones? An objective figure can help some comrades change their excessive estimate. The conclusion will be that the mainstream of our ranks is good and the healthy tendency is predominant. Such an estimate does not in any way cover up the seriousness of corruption and the urgent need to rectify party, government, and cadre styles. There is also another view which underestimates the seriousness and urgency of the anticorruption struggle. These people believe that economic development overrides everything, that it does not count for much to have some bureaucratism, some problems of work style, and some problems of eating, using, and taking more than one is entitled to, and that we should not be too serious about them. These comrades no longer like to hear "self-reliance and hard struggle" or talk about "serving the people." They only pay lip service to the need to "maintain ties with the masses and integrate theory with practice" and act as if "practicing strict economy and thrift in all undertakings" is out of fashion. Such a viewpoint is totally wrong. Precisely due to the evil influence of such ideas, various strange phenomena, such as inviting people to dinner, presenting gifts, extorting or asking for money and goods, going in for ostentation and extravagance, and practicing fraud, have been rampant despite repeated prohibitions. Some people publicly accept bribes and invitations to dinner, saying: "Are we not practicing a market economy and compensated service. It is a matter of course that you should spend money and I do the work. Thus, the principle of commodity exchange has been brought into the government administration of state organs and the decadent bourgeois idea of "putting money first in everything" has penetrated the Communist Party. Is this not serious! If this should be allowed to spread unchecked, "a small ant hole can cause the dam to collapse." Have not some people been put in prison as a result? It is quite necessary to suggest to these comrades, especially the leading comrades: Please go among the masses and hear the satirical doggerel or ragged verses created by the masses, which vividly delineate the lamentable image of some cadres. These aspirations of the people are the good medicine that will sober up the cadres! There is a vivid saying: "People take up the bowl to eat meat but curse unceasingly as soon as they put it down." "People take up the bowl to eat meat" means that the economy has developed and that the people's livelihood has improved. This is naturally a good thing. "But curse unceasingly as soon as they put it down" means people are so discontented with some phenomena of corruption that their initiative and enthusiasm have been dampened. The various forms of corruption and the various unhealthy tendencies have seriously obstructed the course of reform, opening up, and development and seriously hampered the masses from giving scope to their initiative and enthusiasm. Rectifying party, government, and work styles, fighting corruption, and opposing unhealthy tendencies is a long-term, complicated, arduous, and urgent struggle. We should have both firm conviction and perseverance and, in line with the requirements of the party Central Committee, do a good job in the anticorruption struggle and in building clean government so that our party, government, and cadre styles can be purer and suit the needs of the great undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
