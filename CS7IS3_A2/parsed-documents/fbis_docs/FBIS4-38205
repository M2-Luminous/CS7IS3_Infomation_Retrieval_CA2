FBIS4-38205 "drnes125_m_94003" FBIS-NES-94-125 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 JORDAN Committee Head on Border, Security With Israel Committee Head on Border, Security With Israel JN2806164694 Amman AL-RA'Y in Arabic 28 Jun 94 p 25 JN2806164694 Amman AL-RA'Y Arabic BFN [Article by Caroline Faraj] [Text] Amman -- Dr. 'Abdallah Tuqan, head of the Jordanian side in the Security and Border Committee of the Jordanian-Israeli track, has asserted that a specialized team of technical experts will begin its work to demarcate the Jordanian-Israeli borders in the Wadi al-'Arabah area next July. In an exclusive interview with AL-RA'Y, Dr. Tuqan added that the primary duty of that team, which was formed in accordance with Provision A of the subagenda approved on 7 June, is to reach an agreement to prepare the necessary maps, including any additional items, and to conduct joint surveys in order to demarcate the borders between Jordan and Israel, except the line separating the West Bank and the kingdom. Dr. Tuqan asserted that discussion of Israel's pullout from the occupied Jordanian territories would begin immediately after the border maps were prepared. He also clarified that the subagenda is based on Provision B and Points 5 and 7 of the joint agenda of the Jordanian-Israeli track signed on 14 September. He added: In light of Provision C of the joint agenda, stipulating that after reaching a solution acceptable to both sides regarding the elements of this agenda, this solution is expected to be crowned with a peace treaty. This means that the treaty will be concluded after the bilateral negotiations succeed. He pointed out that the solution will cover the international border, as stated in Provision 5 of Chapter B of the joint agenda, stipulating a settlement of the issue of territories, the establishment of agreed-on marks on the international border between Jordan and Israel by using the mandate's border definition without encroaching on any of the territories that fell under the control of the Israeli military government in 1967, and the need for both sides to respect and abide by these international borders. Dr. Tuqan said that this text clearly refers to the West Bank territory occupied in 1967, including Jerusalem. We in Jordan do not recognize that Israel has anything to do with the line dividing Jordan and the occupied Palestinian territory. He said that Jordan will not agree that the Palestinian autonomous territory be subject to negotiations on Israeli-Jordanian international border. Tuqan noted that the surveys and preparations undertaken by the special subcommittee might in some cases need foreign expertise because its work will be separated from and in parallel with the other points on the agenda. Its work will be connected with the other committees, particularly regarding the projects that will be discussed after the withdrawal has been completed and peace has been established. Tuqan emphasized the need for international border demarcation before any future project is broached, adding that the proposed road connecting Jordan, Israel, and Egypt--al-'Aqabah, Taba, Elat--cannot be established without clear borders, crossing points, security and customs posts, and other basic things. These have to be documented and fixed on maps before being implemented on the ground. Tuqan noted that the border subcommittee is a mechanism or an executive body to implement points in the fifth paragraph of Chapter B of the joint agenda. The committee can also draw up a timetable to implement the necessary measures concerning everything agreed on between the two sides in terms of priority and importance. Tuqan stressed that issues of borders and future projects in the peace era should be discussed and connections between them should be dealt with in detail in the upcoming Jordanian-Israeli negotiations. He also said that the drafting of the subagenda was basically based on primary points contained in the joint agenda; namely, realizing comprehensive, durable, and just peace and stressing respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the states in the region. Tuqan added: This leads us to international provisions; namely, that the border areas of any state must be clearly defined so that security arrangements can be based on international borders. He said that Jordan will not approve of the idea of separating sovereignty from security because the two are inseparable and they are two of the primary elements of Jordanian national security. Tuqan said: It is natural that this idea of security be extended to include negotiations on the reduction of armaments and regional security, thus forming a well-connected security chain. It is worth mentioning that the areas of the occupied Jordanian territories are 380.084 square kilometers in the south and 0.83 square kilometers in the north.
