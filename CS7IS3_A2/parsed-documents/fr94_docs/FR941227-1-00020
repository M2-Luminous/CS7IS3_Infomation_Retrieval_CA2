FR941227-1-00020 FR941227-1-00006 Internal Revenue Service 26 CFR Part 1 [FI&hyph;43&hyph;94] RIN 1545&hyph;AS87 Netting Rule for Certain Conversion Transactions AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: The proposed regulations relate to the amount of gain from a conversion transaction position that is subject to recharacterization as ordinary income. The proposed regulations provide that certain gains and losses from positions of the same conversion transaction may be netted for purposes of determining the amount of gain that is recharacterized as ordinary income. These proposed regulations reflect changes to the law made by the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 and affect persons who enter into conversion transactions. DATES: Written comments must be received by March 28, 1995. Requests to speak (with outlines of oral comments) at a public hearing scheduled for April 25, 1995, must be received by April 4, 1995. ADDRESSES: Send submissions to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (FI&hyph;43&hyph;94), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. In the alternative, submissions may be hand delivered between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (FI&hyph;43&hyph;94), Courier's Desk, Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC. The public hearing has been scheduled to be held in the Auditorium, Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Concerning the regulations, Alan B. Munro, (202) 622&hyph;3950; concerning submissions and the hearing, Carol Savage, (202) 622&hyph;8452 (not toll-free numbers). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The collections of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemaking have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). Comments on the collections of information should be sent to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, with copies to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224. The collections of information are in ยง1.1258&hyph;1(b)(2). This information is required by the IRS to aid in administering the law and to prevent manipulation of the netting rules through the use of hindsight. This information will be used to determine whether the taxpayer has elected to net losses against gains before applying section 1258(a) and to verify that the taxpayer is properly reporting its conversion transactions that are subject to netting. The likely recordkeepers are business or other for-profit institutions and nonprofit institutions. Estimated total annual recordkeeping burden: 5,000 hours. The estimated annual burden per recordkeeper varies from .05 to 10.00 hours, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of .10 hour. Estimated number of recordkeepers: 50,000. Background This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 1258(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Section 1258 was added to the Code by section 13206(a) of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993. Section 1258 treats certain capital gains from conversion transactions as ordinary income. A transaction is a conversion transaction if substantially all of the taxpayer's expected return is attributable to the time value of the taxpayer's net investment in the transaction and the transaction falls within one of four categories. The four categories of covered transactions are (1) acquiring property and substantially contemporaneously entering into a contract to sell that (or substantially identical) property, (2) applicable straddles, (3) transactions marketed or sold as producing capital gains, and (4) transactions specified in regulations. Gain generated by any position of a conversion transaction is treated as ordinary income to the extent of the applicable imputed income amount (AIIA). The AIIA is equal to the taxpayer's net investment in the transaction multiplied by the applicable rate, with certain adjustments. The applicable rate is generally 120 percent of the applicable Federal rate, determined as if the conversion transaction were a debt instrument.
