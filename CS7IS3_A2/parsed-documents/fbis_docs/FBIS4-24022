The report in which a special committee recommends Johannesburg in preference to Pretoria or Midrand was tabled in the Legislature this afternoon. The Freedom Front said a condition for its support was that the ANC deal with the question of Afrikaner cultural freedom with great circumspection. The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] said it supported Johannesburg as a short-term choice, but that Midrand was more suitable in the long term. The Provincial Legislature is to discuss the question tomorrow.
