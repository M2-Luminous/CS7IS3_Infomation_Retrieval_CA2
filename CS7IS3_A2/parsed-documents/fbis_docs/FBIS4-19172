The treaties took more than a year to negotiate. The final major obstacle was removed last month when Britain removed its objections to a modification of EU voting rules to take account of the EU's first enlargement since 1986. The officials said the treaties were being sent to the European Parliament, which must approve them by May 5 if the four countries are to have any chance of joining the 12-nation union by the target date of January 1 next year. The treaties must also be ratified by the parliaments of EU countries, and by popular referendums in all four of the applicant countries. Last-minute sticking points, involving particularly fishing disputes with Norway and Sweden, were finally overcome late Tuesday, the officials said.
