It is expected that the U.S. consulate in Tibet will be set up within six months. It is said that this action by the U.S. Government has a strong political implication because there are only a very small number of Americans in Tibet and the U.S. Consulate in Sichuan's Chengdu has more than sufficient capacity to handle affairs in Tibet. Therefore, the U.S.-Chinese consular agreement on 16 October 1993 not only indicated the further improvement of bilateral relations but may also be regarded as Beijing's concession to U.S. human rights diplomacy. Moreover, after the two sides reached the consular agreement, Beijing took the initiative in expressing goodwill by returning the remains of American military personnel killed in Tibet during World War II.
