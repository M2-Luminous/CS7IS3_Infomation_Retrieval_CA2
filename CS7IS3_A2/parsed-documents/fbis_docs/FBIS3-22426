"Because the construction of facilities to store liquid nuclear waste will be completed by the end of April with Japan's assistance, there will be no need for the moment to resume dumping," Panov said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. Russia's Pacific Fleet had indicated it could be forced to resume dumping nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan in May because its tanker TNT-5, loaded with some 500 tons of radioactive waste, is decaying and the risk of leakage of the waste is increasing. The construction cost of the storage facilities will be covered by 100 million dollars Japan has pledged to provide to Russia to help it dispose radioactive waste, Panov said. Panov expressed thanks for Japan's assistance. He made the remarks before Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata visits Moscow from Saturday to Monday. Last October, Russia dumped 800 tons of liquid radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan from a vessel of its Pacific Fleet at a point some 550 kilometers west of Hakodate in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island. Russia suspended its planned second phase of dumping in the Sea of Japan following protests from Japan and South Korea. Moscow later urged the Japanese Government to shoulder the cost of construction of the land-based waste disposal facility. Russia and Japan since then have continued working-level contacts on the disposal of Russia's radioactive waste.
