He was welcomed at the airport by Mr. 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, the Majles speaker. Mr. 'Ali bin-Khalifa al-Hatm said in an interview with our reporter that the purpose of his visit to Iran was to expand relations even further and said the visit was of importance to his country's officials. Mr. Nateq-Nuri, for his part, spoke in an interview with our reporter about issues that will be discussed in talks between the two countries' officials. [Begin Nateq-Nuri recording] We will discuss economic issues, such as the issue of the transfer of potable water to Qatar, which is a very huge project; the exploitation of a joint gas field; and regional issues and issues relating to the world of Islam and Islamic countries, such as the issue of Palestine and so on. Our relations with Qatar are very sincere, warm, and long-standing. Qatar has consistently adopted very good stances in international organizations -- during the imposed Iran-Iraq war for example -- and this kind of thing means our relations with Qatar are on a special footing and of importance to us. God willing, we hope that, with this visit by these gentlemen, these relations will expand even further. [end recording]
