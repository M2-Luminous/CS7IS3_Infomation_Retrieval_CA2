The meeting, which is open to the public, will be held at the Red Lion Hotel, 3203 Quebec Street, Denver, Colorado 80207; Tel (303) 321&hyph;3333; Fax (303) 355&hyph;0103. Major topics at the two-day meeting will include mobilization and migration of radionuclides, the status of Scenario A, transportation of spent fuel, and an update from the Office of the Nuclear Waste Negotiator. On July 12, presentations will focus on mobilization and migration of radionuclides. Specific topics include solubility, speciation, and sorption aspects of radionuclides; origin, movement, and retardation of colloids; pneumatic movement of radionuclides; and the potential effects of thermal loading and engineered barriers on migration transport. In addition, time has been set aside to discuss the status of Scenario A and how it could affect the technical and scientific program. The day will end with a round-table discussion of the information presented during the day. On July 13, the majority of the presentations will concern transportation of spent nuclear fuel, including transportation planning and the Department of Energy's (DOE) institutional program, updates on projects such as the Cask System Development Program, and perspectives of the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Association of American Railroads. Time has also been reserved for an update from the Office of the Nuclear Waste Negotiator. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board was created by Congress in the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 to evaluate the technical and scientific validity of activities undertaken by the DOE in its program to manage the disposal of the nation's spent nuclear fuel and defense high-level waste. In that same legislation, Congress directed the DOE to characterize a site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for its suitability as a potential location for a permanent repository for the disposal of that waste. Transcripts of the meeting will be available on computer disk or on a library-loan basis in paper format from Victoria Reich, Board librarian, beginning August 24, 1994.
