The official pointed out that the country's economy will be sufficiently strong to bear this without major problems by 1996 when the effects of this cut will be felt in projects. He explained that economic programs for 1994 and 1995 will not be affected. Orellana pointed out that the effects of the cut will reportedly start to be felt in 1996, "but by then the country will be nearly independent due to economic development and an increase in funds sent to El Salvador by relatives living abroad." International aid "has been used to support infrastructure reconstruction projects and repair damage caused by the guerrillas during the recent conflict." Orellana pointed out that funds sent by relatives to El Salvador are a reality of the country's economy because they constitute aid sent by Salvadorans working in the United States and this amount will not decrease.
