He pointed out: Under the new situation, we should step up party building and strengthen and improve the organization and personnel work to provide a strong organizational guarantee for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. This is a major task of Tibet's organization and personnel departments this year, and for a considerable period henceforth, and we should strive to accomplish it. In 1993, our organization and personnel work was done in a situation in which we thoroughly implemented the guidelines of the 14th Party National Congress and the fourth enlarged plenary meeting of the Fourth Tibet Regional CPC Committee, and we further accelerated reform, opening up, and economic construction in this region. Under the direct leadership of the regional party committee and the regional government, and with the attention and guidance of the Central Organization Department and the Ministry of Personnel, the cadres and workers of the autonomous region's organization and personnel departments, seriously implementing the party's basic line and displaying a reform spirit and realistic attitude, worked hard and successfully accomplished their tasks. To clarify the concept and tasks, and to make organization and personnel work better in the new year, Comrade Lu Huimin pointed out: In organization and personnel work, we should pay attention to six aspects this year. (1) It is necessary to arm the whole party ideologically with the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and improve the overall quality of the party members and cadres. Under the new situation, the basic task of the party's ideological education is to organize the vast number of party members and cadres to thoroughly study Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," and arm themselves ideologically with the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is necessary to persistently integrate theory with practice and pay attention to applying in practical work what we have studied. It is necessary to enhance the cadres' ability of engaging in and managing socialist market economy. (2) It is necessary to vigorously strengthen the leading groups at all levels, with emphasis on improvement of their thinking and work style. First of all, we should raise the awareness of the leading members at all levels in the need to practice democratic centralism, so as to ensure a high degree of unity in party organization and action. We should make efforts to further enhance the ability of the leading groups in solving their own problems, particularly their unity problem. The efforts to improve cadres' thinking and work style should be combined with the anti-corruption struggle, and with the efforts to promote ethical integrity and diligence among party and government cadres, as well as with relevant measures adopted by the party organizations. In strengthening the leading groups, another task this year is to readjust and strengthen some leading groups according to the requirements of the socialist market economic structure. (3) Attention should be paid to training and selecting reserve cadres and to stepping up the training of outstanding, young, cross-century cadres. In the training and selection of young and middle-aged reserve cadres, we must do away with outmoded hiring concepts, and we must select talent without sticking to one pattern. We must correctly understand the relationship between "employment" and "retirement," and handle well the relationship between the treatment of priorities and the treatment of routines. We should pay special attention to the training and selection of the "number one man" of the party and the government. (4) It is necessary to meet the needs of deepening reforms and accelerating development, and strengthen primary party organizations. The primary party organizations are the grass-roots organizations for our party to exercise strong leadership over the socialist modernization drive and to consolidate its ruling party status. In strengthening the primary party organizations in rural and pastoral areas, the stress of our work this year is put on continuing to rectify backward party branches, enhance the cohesiveness and fighting power of the primary party organizations in Tibet, and make them play a greater fighting bastion role in light of their own characteristics and tasks under the new situation. The primary party organizations should be concerned about the wellbeing of party members and make them feel the warmth of party organizations. (5) We should actively and steadily advance the reform of government organizations and the reform of the cadre and personnel systems, and gradually establish a new system for administering cadres and personnel that meets the needs of a socialist market economic structure. This year the reform of government organizations in the region will be carried out in all spheres. In carrying out the reform of government organizations, we should aim at meeting the requirements for the development of a socialist market economy, focus on the crucial matter of transforming government functions and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, improve relationships among various sectors, strengthen the grassroots units, and heighten efficiency. On the basis of the reform of the wage system and the reform of government organizations, we should concentrate on the concrete implementation of the public service system. While energetically pushing forward these three reforms, this year we will, on the basis of carrying out and improving our existing reform measures, expand the reform of the cadre and personnel systems. (6) We will strengthen investigation and study in connection with policies and overall guidance, and improve the policy-making process of organizational and personnel departments. We will do a good job in conducting investigation and study in connection with our region's organizational and personnel policies for the new situation, attach importance to resolving practical issues, and pay attention to practical results. Lu Huimin called on comrades on the region's organizational and personnel fronts to take note of the situation, to work hard with a high sense of political responsibility and political enthusiasm, and strive to bring about a marked improvement in the region's existing organizational and personnel work.
