Although no new dates have been set, they should happen before the middle of this year. President Vieira led a one-party state in Guinea-Bissau for 12 years until opposition parties were legalized in 1992. And this morning, he summoned foreign diplomats to explain the reasons for the postponement. British Honorary Consul Ian Van Manin was there. On the line to Bissau, Alice Martin asked him what had caused the delay: [Begin recording] [Manin] The reason is that the National Election Committee has not been able to organize in time the electoral census. The electoral census is a process before the actual elections to make sure that all the voters get registered and get a card so that on the day of the election people can be identified as legal voters. It is the first time they have a big operation like this in this country, and I think they sort of underestimated the work linked with the preparation of the elections. The president announced that there will be elections before the rainy season but only after the electoral census has been completed, which is, of course, logical. We, ourselves, are sort of speculating that the last logical physical moment to have the elections will be in the first week of June. [Martin] Do you think that the electoral census can be compiled and completed by June? [Manin] I think if everybody is of goodwill the census can be done in about six weeks, making it even possible to have elections at the end of May. I think they can do it. [Martin] Given that international funds are available for this electoral census to be done, are there any other reasons why they have been delayed? I mean, for instance, is the president really willing to go ahead with the elections? [Manin] I am pretty sure he is. He sounded very serious and sounded even upset to sort of admit that there have been these problems. But, you see, to hold elections is not only a matter of money. Money can be made available easily. But, to give an example, part of the delay was that there's been a fraud already with the application of the recruitment of these people. The National Election Committee had a small fee for each application form that they issued to possible candidates, and they issued 6,000 forms. They only needed 1,200 candidates. But fairly soon, these forms were available at sort of black-market rate of 10 or 20 times the price. People applying and buying these forms had an idea they already had the job. That, of course, wasn't true. They only selected 1,200, and especially those people who paid a lot of money for these forms were very angry. [Martin] What is the opposition saying about the delay? [Manin] Well, I haven't seen Joao da Costa recently, but yesterday I had a meeting with the leader of the Bafata Movement. Well, they sort of accept that there is certain incompetence with the National Election Committee. On the other hand, they understand what is happening. Of course, I think it is the opposition's right to attack the government party on this, and say: Well, it is all on purpose and it is all done to exhaust our funds. The longer the parties have to wait for the election, the more money they spend. But if there are elections now, as I said, at the end of May or beginning of June, they would have run out of money completely. [end recording]
