Chen Jinhua, head of the National Commodity Price Inspection Leading Group and minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, spoke at the meeting. He said: With the implementation of various macroeconomic and price control measures and with the carrying out of national commodity price inspection, the excessive rises in the general levels of commodity prices have begun to slow down. Vice Premier of the State Council Zou Jiahua attended today's meeting. During the meeting, Chen Jinhua reviewed the national commodity price inspection work in the previous period. He pointed out that the work on national commodity price inspection has achieved initial results, thanks to the transmission of the circular calling for implementing price inspection, to the spreading of the news on carrying out price inspection, and to the arrangement made jointly since March by commodity price departments and other relevant departments on price inspection. He listed the following as the major accomplishments of price inspection work. -- Price inspection has helped raise the people's awareness of the necessity of regulating and controlling prices under a market economy. Since the beginning of this year, leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly stressed the need for enhancing macroeconomic regulation and control, bringing down inflation, and maintaining social order. During national commodity price inspection, the State Planning Commission and propaganda department launched a propaganda drive aimed at deepening reform, enhancing macroeconomic regulation and control, and promoting healthy market growth. This drive has helped bring about a favorable climate to stress the need for exercising regulation, control, and management over prices under a commodity market economy and marked the beginning of a change in the laissez-faire attitude over the decontrolled prices. -- Price inspection has promoted the implementation of price regulation, control, and management measures formulated by the state. Some provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) have begun establishing a grain risk fund system. The system of showing clear price-markings on commodities and of a clear listing of service charges has been promoted at state and collective-owned retail stores and at fee-charging administrative units. Private enterprises and individual vendors have also begun to show more responsiveness to the call for clear price markings and to the call for clear indications of service charges. A considerable number of provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) have worked out specific rules for supervising and reviewing the prices of daily necessities and service charges. -- Price inspection has helped investigate and deal with a number of cases involving pricing irregularities. Various localities have conducted checks on the prices of consumer goods, on monopolistic means of production prices, and service charges. According to incomplete statistics, between the period of 10 March and 10 May, over 190,000 cases of pricing irregularities were uncovered throughout the nation involving illicit gains of about 400 million yuan. So far, 100,000 cases of pricing irregularities have been dealt with and fines of over 88 million yuan have been imposed. As a result of investigating and handling cases of pricing irregularities, the practices of price gouging and of arbitrary fee collection have been checked. Localities have paid particular attention to disclosing the handling of a number of serious cases which have created a great social impact. So far, various localities have publicly handled some 1,200 cases of price irregularities. -- Price inspection has helped manufacturers and business operators to strengthen in-house price management. During the national commodity price inspection, many enterprises conducted in-house price-checks, reported voluntarily on pricing, corrected their pricing mistakes, and standardized price-setting practices of their own accord. Chen Jinhua stressed that the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the masses had attached great importance to and placed great expectations on national commodity price inspection. Price inspection tasks had been arduous and were conducted in very short time. The next task for various levels of governments, he said, is to conscientiously review previous work, sort out problems, analyze causes of the problems, formulate countermeasures, and carry out price inspection work in a down-to-earth and in-depth manner. Chen Jinhua said it is necessary to enhance leadership and to exert efforts by placing priority on checking key product prices whose sharp rises affect the general level of commodity prices and to checking prices of other products and service charges whose rises cause the masses' great dissatisfaction. The first priority, he said, should go to checking the prices of grain, cotton, and other daily necessities. The second priority should be to check rural areas' electricity rates and the prices of such means of production as steel and refined oil. The third priority is to check basic service charges. The purpose of checking key product prices, Chen Jinhua noted, is to put to a stop to the practices of pricing irregularities and to help bring stability into the masses' basic life. The guiding and supervisory roles of public opinion should be brought into full play. Deeds of advanced models should be publicized. Efforts must be made to strictly investigate into and deal with a number of typically bad cases; those who are found to have been involved in the practices of price-gouging and of making arbitrary collections of fees must be exposed to the public. This will encourage the people, help enterprises adopt proper price-setting behavior, and deter would-be price-gouging units and individuals. It is necessary to treat a disease by looking into both its root cause and symptoms. Therefore, efforts should be made to improve and perfect existing laws and regulations and accelerate the pace of pricing legislation. There is a need to persist in carrying out price inspections together with conducting an investigation and study of pricing problems; to sum up experiences; to plug loopholes; and to study measures to enhance price regulation, control, and management. He expressed the hope that departments concerned will continue close coordination, bring into play their respective advantages, and continue to help the masses supervise prices. He also said that it is necessary to strengthen leadership over pricing work, to help maintain stability at price-related organs, to increase price inspection work force, and to improve the price inspection method. In conclusion, Chen Jinhua called on all levels of governments to show greater concern and support for price inspection work.
