He said each country had to set its own priorities when confronted with a multitude of challenges and opportunities. Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said that as the economy was becoming increasingly globalised and confronted with the reality of multiculturalism, its growth was inextricably linked to factors beyond economics. Anwar told this to Finance Ministers of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) which met here yesterday. He was speaking on Malaysia's economic growth strategies. Anwar, however, told the meeting: "Trade must not infringe on the rights of peoples and nations towards their own values and cultures. If we want the pursuit of growth to be a vehicle to spread out prosperity, rather than becoming an agent for domination, it has to be conducted with the full cognizance of the diversity of our world. "The quest for stability is not an excuse for suppression and injustices." Anwar said the implementation and the continuity of pro-growth policies and market-friendly institutional reforms were only possible within a stable political environment. He pointed out that diligence, discipline, and a hardworking labour force -- qualities which had contributed to East Asia's prosperity and improved living standards -- had earned the contempt of some in the West, especially among labour unions. "Some have gone as far as to conjure the absurd nightmare of Western civilisation being threatened by low wage economies. I must say that no Government with a modicum of sense and responsibility would like to see its own people languishing in sweatshops," Anwar said. He added that for a country with full employment like Malaysia, no measures to suppress wages would be successful. The challenge was to remain competitive and to ensure that wage increases did not outstrip gains in productivity. "For us in Asia, growth through productivity and competitiveness is the only path to achieve prosperity. It has liberated millions from the scourge of poverty and destitution. It will liberate millions more in future," he added. In Malaysia's case, the high growth had resulted in the incidence of poverty declining from nearly 50 percent in 1970 to 14 percent today and per capita incomes increased significantly from a mere U.S.$250 in 1957 to more than U.S.$3,000 by 1993. He told the other 17 Finance Ministers that economic growth had enabled the people in East Asia to enjoy freedom and decent living conditions -- an indigenously-generated vision of opportunity and betterment that compared favourably with the promised idylls of the divergent package deals offered by various political persuasions. Malaysia's view, Anwar said, was that growth could not and must not be separated from the overall societal objectives. "However widely crafted and market-friendly these policies may be, consideration of the issues of distributive justice and fairness will, eventually, play their part in contributing to growth." Malaysia's success in economic development, with six consecutive years of growth exceeding eight percent, underscored the importance of political stability, sound macro-economic management and an open, market-based economy that was largely private sector driven. Anwar explained that the Government's multi-year structural adjustment programme in the 1980s down-sized the role of the public sector and promoted private initiative as the main engine of growth. On Malaysia's economic performance in 1994, he said indications were that the economy would strengthen further with growth exceeding eight percent "making this the most buoyant and longest economic expansion in Malaysia's history." Both the Government's financial and balance of payments position were looking very healthy. Inflation was low and price stability was expected to continue, he said. Prospects for the medium term were equally good and the growth target of eight percent for the Sixth Malaysia Plan (1991-1995) would most probably be surpassed. Nevertheless, there was a need to continuously focus on relieving infrastructural bottlenecks and shortage of skilled labour to enhance competitiveness. Even though East Asia had been insulated from the recession in the industrialised countries, it was not oblivious to the fact that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries were and would remain a major contributor to the global economy. Developing countries would benefit from a "rejuvenation of growth in older industralised economies. "If we can free ourselves of protectionism and reverse the movement towards the formation of new trading blocs, we can develop a new partnership, one which can operate to disperse growth and prosperity around the globe. "There is no miracle agent or quick-fix for growth, it is the outcome of hard work and diligence, continuous investment in human and physical capital and policies that promote entrepreneurship." Anwar said this had been Malaysia's experience and that there was a need to be "wary of the residual mentality of the Cold War era and outlook that seeks to exaggerate security issues and provoke tensions, thus once again diverting our energies from development." He told the Ministers that ASEAN's experience had taught that regional stability and productive relations must be earned through good neighbourliness and mutual trust.
