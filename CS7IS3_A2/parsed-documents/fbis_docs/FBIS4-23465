Abiola; who claimed victory [word indistinct] 12 June 1993 presidential election, which was annulled by former military ruler, General Ibrahim Babangida, was quoted by the Nigerian press as having requested Washington's recognition for the government he wants to announce before 12 June. In the letter to the U.S. Vice President Al Gore, extracts of which were reproduced by three Nigerian newspapers, Abiola asked for the U.S. Government to: - "Warn the military junta not to kill pro-democracy group members, labour leaders, women, students and others who plan to demonstrate or engage in stay at home activity". - "Condemn the military regime" for "arresting Ameh Ebute", a former president of Nigeria's disbanded senate. - "Sustaining the ban on visas and all official contacts with the dictators," and - "Despatch a special envoy of the President (Bill Clinton) to monitor Nigeria's final transition to democracy". In the letter which Abiola signed as "president-elect", published in its entirety by the VANGUARD newspaper, he said: "It has become clear that the military regime has no intention of relieving its gruesome oppression of the people, but rather intends to stay in power and continue the public rape of Nigeria's precious resources". But a spokesman of the American Embassy in Lagos today denied comments Monday when PANA sought clarification on the letter which Abiola reportedly wrote on 3 June to Washington. It was not clear whether the published letter was sent directly to Washington D.C., the U.S. capital. The United States and a number of European countries, including Britain have imposed limited sanctions, such as visa restrictions on Nigerian Government officials, moratorium on official aid and suspension of military assistance, following the annulment of the 1993 presidential election. Abiola, a multimillionaire businessman, who ran a similar but largely unsuccessful campaign which took him to the United States and some European countries for 53 days in 1993, has threatened to form a rival government to the present military regime of General Sani Abacha. Abacha took power on 17 November 1993 following the surprise resignation of Ernest Shonekan, head of the Babangida-appointed interim national government in the heat of political crisis unleashed by the annulment of the 12 June presidential election. On taking power, the Abacha regime dissolved all political institutions including elected local councils, national and state assemblies, and the two political parties, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the National Republican Convention (NRC). Caretaker committees have been appointed for the local councils by the regime, which plans a national constitutional convention to begin on 27 June ahead of the unbanning of politics on 17 January 1995, as part of is transition to civilian rule. But some political associations, notably, the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), are opposed to the conference and want the military to relinquish power to Abiola. The military government has responded by saying that the constitutional conference must go ahead and warned that trouble makers would be dealt with. A NADECO member, Segun Osoba, a former civilian governor of Nigeria's western state of Ogun, Abiola's home state, was arrested Friday by security agents. The VANGUARD reported that government was preparing treason charges against former Senate President Ebute. He was arrested Thursday for allegedly convening a meeting of the disbanded Senate. Ebute was reported to have issued a statement after the meeting, asking the military administration, which he described as an "illegal" regime to quit. But it appears not all pro-democracy groups are in full support of NADECO's position, judging by press reports Monday. A spokesman of human rights group, the Campaign for Democracy (CD), which led a series of crippling disobedience strikes in 1993 over the annulled 12 June presidential election, is reported in several newspapers as saying that CD's support for Abiola's cause is conditional. "If we must genuinely restore June 12 mandate and support Abiola, we must impose conditions, because the SDP and NRC have failed to justify the people's confidence. "The political class has betrayed us," Lagos lawyer and CD member Femi Falana, said. Abiola, he said, "could no longer form a government of national unity on the basis of the defunct political parties... Because the parties have become moribund while politicians have since pitched their tent with the military government." The Nigerian Labour Congress, the country's umbrella labour movement, is reported by newspapers to have opposed the idea of a rival government by Abiola. The congress' central working committee reportedly met Friday in Lagos, and resolved that solutions to the country's current political crisis could be achieved through the planned constitutional conference.
