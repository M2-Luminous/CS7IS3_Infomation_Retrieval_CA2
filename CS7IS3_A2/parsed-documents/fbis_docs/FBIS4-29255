The United States, the trustee of the IAEA ratification treaty, delivered an official document to the IAEA Secretariat on 15 June which stated that North Korea was withdrawing from the IAEA. The official document received by the IAEA clearly points out that North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam officially notified the U.S. Government of the North Korean authorities' decision to withdraw from the IAEA as of 13 June. With the receipt of the official document, the IAEA, as authorized by the United States which is the trustee country, declared that North Korea has given up its membership as of 13 June and informed the 35 board of governor states and other member states. The IAEA reaffirmed, however, that North Korea's withdrawal of its member state status does not at all effect the nuclear security agreement signed between North Korea and the IAEA in 1991.
