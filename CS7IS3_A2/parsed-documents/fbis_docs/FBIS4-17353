The State Will Maintain Only the Winners" -- last paragraph is Gleb Cherkasov report] [Text] The draft law on political parties worked out by the Duma's Social Organizations Committee was yesterday presented to journalists. The main novelty compared to the analogous law of the Soviet period, according to the draft authors, is that political parties have been separated from the general mass of public organizations. As of now, to register, a party should have a membership of 5,000 and regional branches with more than 10 members in more than half the Russian Federation components. The draft also provides for a complicated system of party re-registration after each federal elections. Only those parties that have surmounted the 5-percent barrier will have their registration automatically extended. The others must re-register for next election campaigns. The draft, furthermore, allows registration of regional parties that are expected to be barred from contesting federal-wide elections. Which, by the authors' admission, clearly infringes their interests because the "will for power" is the main objective of all parties. In full accord with this thesis, the draft builds a party state financing system. Funds will be made available only by election committees and only for purposes of conducting election battles. Funds will also be provided to the factions of those parties which have emerged victorious from these battles. Parties are forbidden to receive donations from foreign citizens or organizations as well as from the state (with the above exception). As has become known, a group of deputies has prepared an alternative draft law on political parties. According to one of the "alternative" authors, Vitaliy Savitskiy, who is a member of the Duma's Public Associations and Religious Organizations Committee, one of the main distinctions of the second draft is the predominant role of the state. Under the alternative draft, the main financing for public organizations is provided by the state while the volume of monetary infusions depends on how successful a particular party has been in the elections. According to Mr. Savitskiy, such a mechanism can contribute to the gradual evolution of large political organizations.
