Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council, by Petr Karapetyan; place and date not given: "The Army Must Have All It Needs -- and as a Matter of Priority"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Karapetyan] Vladimir Filippovich, I would like to ask the following question: Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov is constructing a 100-apartment block in Sevastopol for Russian seamen. In turn, you said during a trip to Kaliningrad Oblast that the Federation Council would act as sponsor of the destroyer Nastoychivyy and the naval garrison in Baltiysk. Sponsorship assistance for the Army is a long-standing, essential Russian tradition. Absolutely no doubt about that. But it is no substitute for a clear-cut, thoroughly thought-out state program for the Army. Do you sense the need for one? [Shumeyko] Of course. State social policy in Russia in general, and in relation to the Army in particular, is based on a plethora of uncoordinated legislative acts, working directly or indirectly, so to speak, to provide social security. This is clearly not enough. We need a social code, and I talked about this with the president. Boris Nikolayevich suggested that consideration be given to creating it. We in the Federation Council are now preparing proposals that are basically aimed at protecting those strata of the population which are dependent on the budget. And I will insist on a separate chapter in the code on state social policy in the Army. After all, it must be clearly recognized that the Army is a state institution, so who is going to look after it if not the state? I am firmly of the opinion that the military must always be socially provided for and as a matter of priority. Incidentally, the Federation Council is 67 percent representatives of regional authorities. And, believe me, their approach to this question is statesmanlike. [Karapetyan] Now you say that the Army must have everything it needs. It would be difficult to find in Russia a statesman who would not endorse what you say. But when it comes to practical action, the left hand forgets what the right hand was doing. In the corridors of power there is constant talk to the effect that it would not be a bad idea to strip the military of their privileges. In my opinion, this is no big deal. What privileges are we talking about, anyway! The need for a state program to construct housing for servicemen is being called into question; they are trying to save energy resources at our expense.... Yet the Russian military earn their daily bread in Sarajevo, Tajikistan, the Dniester Region, South Ossetia, and the Ossetian-Ingush conflict zone, as well as in the quiet provinces and the capital. Permanent danger and hardship. Indeed, the Russian Army deserves to be treated differently by the state. [Shumeyko] The state cannot exist without the Army and I believe it is a waste of time to debate the subject. So I will try to set out my own viewpoint as briefly as possible. Of course, the Army's interests will have to be taken into account when the state budget is discussed and approved, and it goes without saying that one should be guided by the principle of defensive sufficiency, rather than the residual principle. There are 10 committees in the Federation Council working on the budget, including the Defense and Security Committee. Obviously any committee is going to assert its own positions, but we will not allow the Army's interests to be undermined. Although I will allow a serious debate. The Army must be fully provided with budget money and the policy in this case must be a rigorous one. [Karapetyan] There is something else the Army desperately needs, as well as a budget. I am talking about political stability in Russia. But society is in turmoil again. This time as a result of rumors about a plot, about a new coup... [Shumeyko] All this I regard as an attempt to rock the boat. As for the situation in the country, it seems to me more stable than last year. Efforts to destabilize the situation through rumors and provocations were fine once, so to speak. But they will not work today. [Karapetyan] Nonetheless, Vladimir Filippovich, the political background to the economic reforms remains rather complex. Take, for instance, the results of the local elections. Is the nomenklatura on its way back? [Shumeyko] Since you have broached the subject of elections, I will say that they were marked by a low level of political activity by voters and a high level of activity by politicians. Take St. Petersburg, for instance. There were 750 candidates for 50 deputies' seats there. That is a very large number. The elections were "prolonged," of course, by country dwellers. In the cities people are tired of democracy, I would say. Democracy means elections all the time. People do not see results, so they do not go to cast their votes, they become less politically active. In St. Petersburg again the organizers of one particular rally were expecting to attract 15,000 people. Some 22 people turned up in the square. As for the return of the nomenklatura, I must welcome it, in the sense that the people returning are experienced people, people who know what they are at. [Karapetyan] But what influence will they have on the conduct of the reforms? [Shumeyko] Local self-government implements laws adopted at the top. A simple formula and, you will agree, a pretty reliable one -- it guarantees that reform remains a factor in Russia's development. [Karapetyan] But the problem of accord in Russian society is there nonetheless. By all accounts, work is almost completed on the agreement "On Achieving Civil Accord." How do you see this? [Shumeyko] I am familiar with the text. If we carry on refining it, it will never be signed. There is a principle: "Excellent is the enemy of good." As it stands, it is a well-tuned document and I see no reason why it should not be adopted. [Karapetyan] Vladimir Filippovich, you recently said you support the idea of reestablishing the USSR, although not in its previous form. President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan talked about creating a Eurasian Union comprising CIS states. Does this not indicate the possibility of creating a Commonwealth or Union on the basis of confederative principles on the territory of the former USSR? [Shumeyko] My vision is of the reestablishment of an integrated commonwealth of states, rather than the reestablishment of the USSR in its pre-perestroyka form. We do not want rigid borders, we must try to meet one another halfway. We should be airing this idea right now. I would not describe the CIS as the optimal form of a commonwealth. Something of the order of 400 decisions have been adopted in its context and barely one-fourth has been implemented. The states choose which they will sign and which they will not. That is not the way to go about it. We have to get together in a union, and I am not frightened of the word. Two or three states for a start, say. The rest are then bound to follow. [Karapetyan] In the event of integration, what picture do you have of the commonwealth's armed forces? [Shumeyko] Even now we could be preparing the ground for the creation of unified armed forces. But we must at least begin by instituting a council of the commonwealth countries' defense ministers. So Russia is compelled to keep 15,000 people on the territories of sovereign states, including the trouble spots. It is difficult, it is not good.
