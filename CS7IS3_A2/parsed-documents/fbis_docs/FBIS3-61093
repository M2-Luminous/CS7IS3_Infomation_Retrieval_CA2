Articles such as "Regular Religious Propaganda", "How Can We Be Muslims if We Neither Know nor Practice the 40 Duties of a Muslim?", and "Wedding Night" have been published in the press, and there has been news on television and radio on the construction of mosques, appearances before Muslim judges, and the like. A Kazakh translation of the teachings of the Koran has appeared in the national weekly SHALQAR, and materials have been provided about the Sharyat, fasting, and prayer. Last September SHALQAR familiarized its readers with teachings suggested by the ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Iran on the theme of "the Prophet Muhammad." From what has been said, we see that we are carrying out the foundations of religious measures. However, it is clear that these things will not satisfy the masses of the people, which have had their ties with religion severed for 70 years, and which have remained uninformed. In this connection there are not a few suggestions and public needs. We hope that they will, in any case, gain the attention of the appropriate religious authorities and the information media. We will touch, to the best of our abilities, on only one of these questions, the marriage question, and share our thoughts. On Marriage and Setting Up a Household Marriage is the custom whereby men and women, having become husband and wife, live jointly in one household. It is clear to all that marriage is no "art" created by the mind but something natural. If there were no marvelous manifestations of developments of this sort, the continuation of the generations would fail and human posterity would not have grown and prospered as it has at present. In simple words we can all understand, the vital meaning and valued characteristics of marriage for the life of society in general are an expression of this. However, this is not to say that marriage of men and women is an outstanding condition for life, one that is completely unequaled. Long betrothals and the dispatching of girls for marriage and the marrying off of sons have enjoyed particular importance in the life of our people. Parents have been overjoyed that "my son has established a nest, my daughter has found a home," "the two of them have become a couple," "my family has expanded," and have thanked God. Thus a line has been forged to two young people, who have become man and wife and will be happy the rest of their lives. This day is one of the happiest days for them; one that they should never forget. According to the customs of a life that has been established by our ancestors and approved by religion, a mullah carries out the marriage ceremony at weddings. He provides the blessed marriage water for the bride and groom to drink. He reminds the couple of the fact that they are taking the first steps on the threshold of a greater life. He gives them advice on how to establish a proper life and makes known his good wishes. On Mixed Marriage Mixed marriage is a fact of life that has existed since ancient times and continues to exist. Even if there is no special written literature about this, we read about it in historical documents, in travel accounts, in histories, and stories. It takes place under various circumstances. It is a major topic in and of itself. However, it is well known that our broad-minded and hospitable people experienced grief during the last three centuries while in the fetters of the white Tsarist and red imperialism, that Kazakhstan has changed from being a nation into a unique multiethnic republic. People of foreign nationalities with different languages and different religions have flowed in, spread out, taken over the administrative organs and the leading economic and cultural sectors, and strengthened the intermixing going on in daily life. Thus the necessary precondition for an increase in the number of mixed marriages arose. All in all, in social life there are distinct forms of marriage and characteristics peculiar to each. To separate them out, it would be suitable to divide marriages into three groups. Let us do so. Group One In marriages whereby the sons and daughters of Turkic brothers such as Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Kyrgyz, Uighyr, Tatar, and Bashqurt, which have related languages and the same religion, join with one another, there are absolutely no conflicts from an ethnic or a religious standpoint. We must always approve and support this kind of marriage. Group Two Until the Soviet era only a few men were married to women of other nationalities, religion, and language among the Kazakhs. However, women who in this way went off to get married had to make known their willingness by special agreement to accept the Muslim religion, learn the Kazakh language, and utilize Kazakh customs and traditions in their daily life, and only when they had given consent would the mullah marry them and they would become man and wife legally. Let me give several examples to prove what I am saying. The story of how a Russian girl Mariya Yegorovna Rykina (1887-1950) fell in love with a young Kazakh man named Duysen and went off to marry him is known to the entire Kazakh people. One out of every two knows the song "Dudaray" she produced and dedicated to Duysen. It is performed at feasts, on stage, and heard on television and radio. The famous aqyn Qalizhan Bekkhozhin has written a poem "Mariyam Zaghorqyzy" and there is an opera called "Dudaray." Mariya, who accepted without hesitation the requests and suggestions of Duysen, even though she was, in her words, "by nature Russian," became a Muslim; wore a kimeshek just like a Kazakh woman; spoke Kazakh her whole life; and had to become Kazakh by choice. We take this as a suitable example for praising mixed marriages. The wife of Akhmet Baytursynuly, the beloved figure of the Kazakh people, great scientist, famous aqyn and great social activist was from the Russian nationality and was even years younger than him. When she was married in the mosque, she called herself Badrisafa Mukhamed-Sadyqqyzy in the Muslim manner. According to what Akhmet's daughter Sholpan said, she knew Kazakh very well, wore a white embroidered scarf on her head, wore long fluttering skirts, and never mentioned the name of her husband, calling him "tore." The two lived a good life together, bore the difficulties together, and together reaped the fruits of their fate. We should notice the following lines (author Gharifolla Qabdolqayyruly) of a picture called "Akhmet's [junior] Wife" published in the paper ANA TILI (No 26, 1991). One of the village elders accompanying Akhmet and Badrisafa on a trip to the Torghay is supposed to have said: "How can you be Kazakh? If you were Kazakh, how could you marry a heathen?" Without hesitation Akhmet argued: I was pleased that Aleksandra Ivanova over there adapted her fate to mine. If one Kazakh converts one heathen to Islam, it resounds to the honor of 10. If this image seems worthy of joking about, it expresses the very truth. Let us draw the conclusion from this that if people of two nationalities love each other completely and truly, and, if they know how to keep their marriage strong, it is altogether possible that mixed marriages may be a good thing. Another example. On the eve of the 1917 October Revolution, a Kazakh village intellectual named Yermek Qulyshuly, who had learned in the old way in Aktobe Oblast, married a Russian woman named Mariya. She received the Islamic religion in a Tatar mosque, fulfilled the promises she gave there, learned the Kazakh language very well in only a year, and, dressing like a village woman, gave a Muslim blessing before eating and cooking food. During the next year at the beginning, middle, and end of the month of fasting, she kept her fast for three days, called herself "Kazakh" in the village council registry, and became a regular Kazakh woman, an honest, open-minded lady. To summarize, such were the special characteristics of mixed marriages which took place before the Soviet era and which we have heard about from the mouths of the people and seen in detail with our own eyes. We must give such marriages the appropriate approval. Such marriages conform to our national goals and interests and cause no harm to our language, our religion, and our way of life. Today's young people should learn from them. Group Three The harmfulness of this came into being after the October Revolution, year of the snake. We do not think that everything about it was poison. We are against the continual droning to the effect that "the Kazakh people live on the broad steppe, that Kazakh women and men have equality." One may be a little disturbed by what I say, but we have obtained nothing good from this. Likewise, an ax has assaulted the roots of our religion. We have been deprived of our status as Muslims. Mosques have been closed. The Koran has been burned. Mullahs, qazhis, and ishans have been persecuted. Muslim rituals such as marriage and the circumcision of children have been prohibited. Use of our mother tongue has contracted and the Russian language, praised as "the language of joy," has taken the place of honor. In addition there is the scourge of drink. As a result of such a policy of exhaustion and destruction, our spirits have begun to be destroyed, and ill-breeding, vulgarity, and anarchy have gained ground in our life. Among our stirred-up young people and empty-headed adults given to deception, meeting girls on the dance floor, at bars, and quick sex called "friendship" is becoming common. The "easily seducible," who have "forgotten" shame in the heat of the moment, have appeared. Since they know nothing about one another, and are not discriminating, they marry in a hurry. Such relations of husbands and wives cannot last. In most cases they can only end in divorce. Hitherto mixed marriages were few and far between among Kazakhs, and, when they did take place, they were, as indicated above, carried out by special agreement. Today, on the other hand, the relations of husband and wife are regarded very easily, and those marrying without thinking of the past, the present, or the future number in the hundreds and thousands. According to official information, 7.5 percent of all males marrying in our republic marry women of other nationalities and 7.2 percent of women marry men of other nationalities. In fact, the Russian language is spoken in most of these mixed marriages. Such marriages are more common among Kazakhs than among our kinsmen such as Uzbeks, Kyrgyz, or Turkmen. We cannot say that this is a good sign. While their sons and daughters, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren remain "Kazakh" on paper, in most cases (especially when the mothers are Slavs) there is no disputing the fact that they have changed their ethnic nature and character. We cannot view this in an unconcerned manner. We must support those who have fallen, extend a hand and aid those who have become lost. In conclusion, our independent Republic of Kazakhstan is a young country. While the most fundamental duty of our people today is to take the bridles of our republic in hand, strengthen the foundations, and, while developing the economy and culture as rapidly as possible, become rich and cultured, it is clear that those who will carry on are today's younger generation. For this reason, we must aim at making them citizens with lofty social sensitivities, citizens who are well founded and who will not reject the hallowed ways of their progenitors, citizens who are hardy with pure Kazakh souls, and strive to educate them in this spirit. The Islamic religion, with its humanitarian, beneficial teaching, will save them from criminal acts. However, we believe that the Islamic cultural centers, which have begun with the construction of houses of religion, mosques, will add their own contributions to this worthy goal and we hope that in this way God will provide for us all.
