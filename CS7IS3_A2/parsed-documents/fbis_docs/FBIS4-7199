His great-grandfather Kazuo Hatoyama was a former lower house speaker, while his late grandfather Ichiro Hatoyama served as prime minister and his late father Iichiro was foreign minister. His elder brother Kunio is a lower house lawmaker who has served as deputy chief cabinet secretary. Hatoyama, 45, an independent House of Representatives legislator, replaces Chikara Sakaguchi of Komeito [Clean Government Party] as labor minister. After graduating from Tokyo University, Hatoyama became secretary to the late former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. He won a lower house seat as an independent and later joined the LDP. He was noted for crossing party lines to vote against the LDP government's abortive first attempt to introduce the consumption tax. During the first administration of then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of the LDP from November 1991 to December 1992, Hatoyama served as education minister and proposed scrapping examinations prepared by the private firms, on the grounds the exams encouraged excessive competition among students to go to higher educational facilities. He left the LDP in 1992 as the party's then largest faction led by former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita broke up. Hatoyama has been elected to the lower chamber six times.
