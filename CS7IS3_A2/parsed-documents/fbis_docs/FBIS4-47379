S. Nesterov, RF Hydrometeorological Scientific Research Center; UDC 551.465.632:551.509.33(261.1)] [Abstract] The long-range prediction of ocean surface temperature anomalies (OSTA) in individual regions of the North Atlantic by use of the group analogues (GRAN) method is described. Such a prediction can be made in either a categorical or a probabilistic form. The ``Prognoz'' on-line databank of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center was used as the data source, especially the ROWS database containing information on the fields of mean monthly ocean surface temperature, surface pressure, 500-gPa geopotential surface and other parameters for a multiyear period. The basic principles for long-range prediction of OSTA as applicable to the GRAN method are outlined. A number of prognostic experiments were carried for testing the scheme. The purpose was an evaluation of the success of the prediction as a function of the makeup of the predictors. The various predictors used are discussed. It was found that the prognostic scheme gives the greatest gain in the case of quite large anomalies (in comparison with climatic and inertial predictions). The GRAN method also gives information which can be used in determining the processes involved in formation of temperature anomalies in the ocean. Predictions were prepared for 10 of the largest OSTA observed between 1957 and 1991. The results are given in a table. As a specific example, the results for one region for January 1983 also are given. The experiments clearly indicate that the group analogues scheme can be used successfully for long-range prediction of ocean water temperature and in some cases may be preferable to a categorical prediction. The method can be further improved by adjusting the predictors to the current process and varying them from prediction to prediction. Figures 2; references: 12 Russian.
