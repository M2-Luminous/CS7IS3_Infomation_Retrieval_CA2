In a discussion, which was agreed on by all parliamentary groups, it was made clear that at least 1.5 million people have been killed since 1983 in the war between the Islamic government in Khartoum and the south, which is primarily inhabited by Christians and followers of other religions. In a statement for the Bundestag debate, the Society for Endangered Peoples in Goettingen cited the figure of 150,000 Nubians who have been kidnapped; many of them have been virtually enslaved. The Society calls for UN protection zones. The United Nations has warned against an acute famine. Helmut Schaefer, state minister in the Foreign Ministry, called for a lasting peace and not just a cease-fire. Possibilities for pacification are to be searched for together with the European partners. The constant hindrances of humanitarian aid are "unbearable," Christian Democratic Union Deputy Alois Count of Waldburg-Zeil noted. Speaking on behalf of Alliance 90/Greens, Konrad Weiss recalled the constant bombing attacks by the Sudanese Air Force on refugee camps, which are continuing even now.
