These questions must be answered by Russian military doctrine, the publication of which has been awaited impatiently both in Russia as well as abroad. The doctrine finally has been published and a broad discussion and interpretation of it is under way in the West, but this document's publication essentially has gone unnoticed by the mass media in our country. The article by Igor Serebryakov (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 8 February 1994) is an exception. Inasmuch as Russian military doctrine is a reflection of our state's overall national goals and policy, then the new military policy of the United States and NATO, which is in the stage of formation, also will be built in accordance with this document. An analysis of debates being conducted in NATO and the United States on the fundamentals of future military policy attests that a rather fierce struggle is going on between proponents of a policy from a position of strength, who stubbornly refuse to see the realities of the changed world on the assumption that the cold war has not yet ended, and proponents of an alliance with Russia as a future partner of the West that is extremely important politically, economically and militarily. Depending on its content, Russian military doctrine can substantially reinforce the position of one side and largely determine the West's long-range economic and military policy toward Russia. A very important foreign policy function of military doctrine is to create a new democratic image of Russia as a state friendly toward former ideological enemies and with common interests in maintaining international stability and peace. The doctrine's political content, which spells out the state's long-range strategy in the national security area, acts as practical confirmation of the country's proclaimed political course. Of no less importance is military doctrine's internal state function, called upon to formulate principles and priorities in the building and functioning of the state's military system and to substantiate long-range military organizational development strategy, which takes into account real threats to the country's security and its economic capabilities. Igor Serebryakov's analysis indicates that the published doctrine fulfills neither a foreign policy function nor an internal state function. It is difficult to disagree with this inasmuch as the doctrine does not answer to the substance of a single one of the questions posed above. Let us refer to the political content of the military doctrine. In the traditional understanding of this term, it is absent in the submitted text of the doctrine. The document proclaims only some very general principles of state military policy irrespective of any kind of analysis of the real geopolitical situation and its development trends. Russia's place and interests in the new multipolar world are not considered; its attitude and long-range policy with respect to the former main enemy, the United States and NATO, are not defined; and the possibility of building collective security systems and of Russia's place in them is not evaluated. Without such an analysis, it is naturally impossible to indicate real and potential allies and enemies, predict threats and determine their directions and nature. All this means that there is no basis for developing fundamental doctrinal provisions such as an evaluation of theaters of possible wars and their presumed nature, likely forms and methods of warfare, possible participants of a conflict, and other provisions determining the real content of military policy and military organizational development as guides to practical activity in the national security area. Without these fundamental elements of military doctrine, the document that was submitted turned into a political declaration that is empty, but unfortunately far from safe for the country's interests. The basic reason for the absence of a specific political content of the military doctrine unquestionably is the fact that until now there has been no document spelling out the country's long-range foreign policy course. This is connected above all with the absence of a legislatively incorporated Russian political doctrine reflecting the world and political outlook of the new state authority and its views on certain trends in world development and Russia's place in this process. Military organizational development is a lengthy, sluggish and very costly process which cannot be oriented toward momentary interests of authorities and transient internal and external factors. In this context the authors' statement that this doctrine is a document for the transition period appears groundless at the very least. Provisions contained in doctrine are realized over decades, and so they must be based on a well grounded, long-range strategy comprising the foundation of state activity in the domestic and foreign policy area. I am far from thinking that the military doctrine's developers do not realize everything said above. It is quite obvious that this document is strictly opportunistic and certain circles are using it in an attempt above all to incorporate a new domestic political function of the Armed Forces, i.e., that role which they played in the national tragedy of 3-4 October of last year. Another task is to obtain maximum possible funds and the freedom of choosing directions of military organizational development in the corporate interests of the military establishment. The new military doctrine evoked bewilderment and great cauton abroad, because of its vagueness. Many western experts interpret the lack of desire to express oneself clearly concerning relations with NATO, the United States, Japan and other power centers and the absence of clearly formulated military policy priorities in the doctrine as an attempt to conceal its true goals and intentions. The change in Russia's nuclear policy causes alarm. The principle of non-first use of nuclear weapons in any possible military conflict as proclaimed in the previous doctrine was replaced by a provision envisaging the possibility of delivering a preventive nuclear strike. This is perceived as a challenge and a veiled threat to the West. There is no doubt that the published document reinforces mistrust of the foreign policy course officially proclaimed by Russia and provides weighty arguments for our ill-wishers. The circumstance that the military doctrine is equally suitable both for democrat Yeltsin and for extreme right nationalist Zhirinovskiy also causes concern. There is no trace of any kind of political orientation in it, and it would be naive to assume this is by chance. Legislative incorporation of the possibility of Army intervention in the country's internal affairs makes it a very important foreign policy factor that is potentially dangerous for incipient Russian democracy. The West sees this circumstance as evidence of political instability in the country and a result of the uncertainty of Russia's foreign policy course, which in itself represents a danger. During the cold war years a persistent defensist mentality, presuming the presence of a constant danger of enemy attack, formed both in Russia and the West. When the ideological confrontation ended, the military both here in Russia and in the West began seeking new threats and is attempting to reanimate old ones. The theory of multilateral strategic balance arose and now is being actively developed on this basis. That very same confrontation and the supposition that the one who has a military advantage can use military force to achieve its interests is the basis of this theory. The question of the substance of these interests and reasons for the possible appearance of contradictions which may lead to a wide-scale military clash or to world war is carefully avoided. The presence of several opposing alliances or countries is presumed instead of the bilateral rivalry which faded into the past. Within the framework of such a model, each side naturally attempts to change the balance of forces in its own favor for purposes of greater security, chiefly by increasing military might, i.e., with the help of that very same arms race. In other words, the new strategic stability model preserves old approaches inherent to the cold war period and again proposes a balance of power as a guarantee of security. Such a multilateral strategic balance model became the basis of Russia's new military doctrine, although it is quite obvious that this approach clearly contradicts the geopolitical situation which has been forming since the USSR's disintegration and contradicts the political course of the majority of states (including Russia), which proclaimed an aspiration for creating a collective security system based on cooperation, not confrontation in the military area. In my opinion, a fundamentally new document should be developed in place of the published text of military doctrine, free of the deficiencies examined above and unequivocally spelling out the strategy for ensuring Russia's national security and specific directions for military organizational development. Above all, the doctrine's political content should be developed not in private, as has been the case up to now, but publicly, with the involvement of a wide circle of specialists and the interested public. It should register clearly the aim of military cooperation with the West as the general goal and long-range orientation of Russian military policy. It must be realized that Russia's general line toward integration into the world market economy cannot be implemented without striving for cooperation with the West in the military area. This fundamental provision must steer the doctrine from a mythical danger on the part of the West to the real threats and possibly future threats to Russia's national interests and to its citizens. Today the main threat stems from political instability on former USSR territory and from militant nationalism and separatism. One also cannot forget the potential threat to our country in Asia and about protection of Russian interests in the Far East. Russia's entry into the world economic community makes it a natural ally of the West in the defense of common interests, but this by no means signifies that Russia does not have its own national interests, which may not coincide with or may contradict those of other countries or blocs. As a great Euro-Asiatic power, Russia represents an important part of the world balance of forces, which ensures consideration of national and regional interests in a multipolar world. Russia's basic line toward friendly relations of partnership with the United States and NATO in the military-political and military-technical area and their joint actions in defense of common interests must not contradict the independence and interests of the Russian center of power. Russia's military might should give it not only a guarantee of security, but also conditions for equal participation in world affairs and an opportunity to defend its own national interests. The new military doctrine should take full account of a reasonable balance between common interests with the West and Russia's own interests. The question of the rational degree of Russia's military integration with the West, which meets the country's national interests and geopolitical status, also must be resolved in accordance with this balance. Possible ways of building a collective security system with consideration of today's realities should be formulated from this standpoint. The Russian Army's place and sphere of possible responsibility in this system and a realistic program for adjusting military cooperation with former enemies, leading step by step to guaranteed mutual security, must be stated. An aspect of military doctrine such as excluding Army influence on society's political life and turning it into a guarantor of internal stability and a reliable tool for protecting the democratic state system from external threat also is extremely urgent. The possibility of Army intervention in the country's internal affairs should be excluded legislatively, and this provision should be reinforced by socioeconomic conditions of the Armed Forces existence. Restoring the Army's worthy position in Russian society is a very important means of accomplishing this priority task. No Russian democratic statehood will succeed in being built without this. In all times and eras, only when a good material situation was provided for officers and men was the Army a reliable support for state authority and did not intervene in politics. If this condition is not fulfilled, if officers and men drag out a miserable existence and regular personnel are not sure of their future, which is not secured materially, then the Army is quickly politicized, turning into a dangerous political force inclined to support those who promise to improve its situation. Leaders of antidemocratic forces understand this full well and are taking advantage of the situation at hand for their political goals. They unfolded broad, pseudopatriotic propaganda for returning the status of a great military power to Russia, for a special antiwestern path of Russian development, and for a totalitarian, postcommunist form of state government capable of returning the past importance and social prestige to the Army. On the right flank of this movement stand such odious political figures as Zhirinovskiy, whose totalitarian ideas have support in the Army and in a considerable portion of the population. The situation at hand is leading to the Army's moral decay and to a drop in discipline, reliability and combat effectiveness of troops. The best young officers are leaving the Army, which unquestionably will affect its future. There is no moral-political unity in the Army itself, nor can there be under the conditions at hand. Officer meetings have turned into political clubs, which contradicts the very essence of Army life and creates the real danger of Army intervention in politics. The deepening economic crisis and deterioration in the material situation of regular Army personnel objectively contribute to a growth in the number of proponents of rightist forces in its ranks. Doctrinal provisions allowing Army intervention in domestic political processes only exacerbate trends dangerous for our fragile democracy. A return to a totalitarian form of government invariably will lead to reanimation of ideological confrontation with the West and to a new cold war. Russia's path to integration into the world economic community will be closed for a long time and a real danger of war will reappear. Under conditions of international economic isolation there can be no mention of any kind of transition to a market economy, inasmuch as, rephrasing the familiar cliché of Soviet propaganda, it is impossible to build capitalism in one individual country. It is quite obvious that such a prospect contradicts fundamental and most important national interests of the country and its citizens. Under conditions of the economic crisis being experienced by the country and the rigid limitation of military expenditures connected with it, the most advisable way to preserve well supplied, combat effective Armed Forces dedicated to the regime is above all their sharp reduction to a level ensuring the most necessary security needs: security of borders, maintenance of combat readiness of minimum strategic nuclear forces, preservation of the necessary nucleus of branches of the Armed Forces, and creation of small rapid reaction forces based on the most combat effective formations of ground troops. In the military-political situation at hand, Russia can fully perform missions of defense by having an Army of no more than one million persons. A new system of the country's mobilization preparation should serve as a guarantee of security under conditions of a sharp reduction in the Armed Forces. The new military doctrine could incorporate the proposed numerical strength of the Armed Forces as one of the goals of military reform and thereby facilitate a solution both to political and economic problems of the country. A radical reduction in the Army is a complex, lengthy, painful process engendering a multitude of social problems. Great material expenditures, connected above all with provision of housing, pay and work to the officers and warrant officers being discharged, are needed to resolve these problems. But these are necessary social costs which must be undertaken for the sake of preserving political stability and future economic advantages of military reform. If the government and parliament will not undertake these expenditures, they may lose control over processes occurring in the Army, and this can have catastrophic political consequences. The problem of manpower acquisition also will disappear with a reduction in the Army, when it will be possible to call up only literate, cultured young people wishing to serve in the Armed Forces. A small Russian Army will be fully capable of beginning a gradual transition to professional principles of manpower acquisition on a contract basis, which will permit a considerable increase in its combat capabilities, political attitude and morale. Such an Army will be a reliable support for Russia's democratic statehood and will be capable of reliably protecting the country's interests.
