Finance Vice Minister Alfredo Jalilie, who appeared before the CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] Budget Commission to explain how the budget was implemented during the first quarter of the year, said that he would "clear up the great doubts" the people have about how the funds obtained from the privatization process are being used. Jalilie started off by explaining that from 1991 up to 7 June of this year, the state has obtained approximately $1.714 billion from the privatization process, in addition to $3 million in interest earned by these funds. The vice minister added: "In 1991, the state obtained $1.738 million; $45 million in 1992; $166 million in 1993; and $1.5 billion so far this year." "Important companies such as Interbanc, Continental, and Lima Electric Power Enterprise will be privatized this year. It is therefore quite likely that an additional $1 billion will be obtained." Jalilie then itemized the expenditures financed with privatization funds, justifying each expenditure with the corresponding law. He explained that to date, from the $1.717 billion (privatization resources plus interest), a total of $242 million (or the equivalent of 511.9 million Peruvian soles) has financed social programs as stipulated in the privatization law. There is therefore a surplus of $1.475 billion that has still not been used. The 511.9 million soles were spent in the following way: 6.8 million in 1992, 376.6 million in 1993, and 128.5 million in 1994. Jalilie explained that "according to the letter of intent signed with the IMF, the maximum amount we can use this year from the privatization process is $865 million." The 6.8 million soles used in 1992 were earmarked for the public universities. The 376.6 million soles used in 1993 were for the social projects designed to eradicate poverty executed by Foncodes [National Compensation and Social Development Fund], Pronaa [National Food Assistance Program], and the Education and Agriculture Ministries, among other programs, such as those to equip the universities, broaden the electricity supply network, acquire the Lima thermoelectric plant, build several schools, and repair the highway network. In 1994, the 128.5 million soles obtained from the privatization process were used for the Glass of Milk program implemented by the municipalities, Foncodes, Pronaa, and Infes [National Institute of Education and Health Infrastructure]. After this explanation, Jalilie said that social expenditure must be interpreted, above all, as an effort to improve the living standard, and this is why the state invests in schools, universities, etc. The vice minister ended his explanation by stating: "The results of this sort of social expenditure will appear in the long term." As he left Congress building, Jalilie said that "for the time being there is no need to reorganize the budget. But at the end of the last quarter of the year we will have to make some adjustment with a supplementary loan to be coordinated with the Budget Commission." In his capacity as president of the National Bank, Jalilie also referred to this institution: "A total of 2,000 employees have resigned, many more than we expected. As a consequence, the National Bank will now operate with only 2,750 employees, as an agile, modern, and competitive bank." Regarding the implementation of the budget during the first quarter of this year, Vice Minister Alfredo Jalilie, who was accompanied by Budget Director Reynaldo Bringas, said that less than expected had been spent. During this period the central government's income amounted to 2.746 billion soles, while its expenditures amounted to 2.686 billion soles, 542.9 million soles less than expected. Jalilie commented that "this is normal every year," and added that "during the first quarter the goals that were set were not attained because the disbursements of multilateral organizations were delayed until the second quarter of the year. Therefore, a series of projects that were being financed with these funds had to be postponed." Lastly, Jalilie explained that the "prospects for this year are very favorable. We are going to close the year with a 0.6 percent deficit in the GDP, which had been estimated at 1.8 percent." In 15 days' time, the Treasury will issue BCR [Central Reserve Bank] Capitalization Bonds amounting to 200 million soles, which will allow the Central Bank to withdraw the excess amount of soles resulting from the purchase of dollars to avoid the exchange rate from dropping. Jalilie explained that "with these bonds the BCR will have a valid tool for eliminating these soles and thus eliminate the fiscal deficit they were generating." The vice minister explained that the AFP's [Pension Fund Administration Companies] had insisted on the issuance of those bonds for investment purposes as they are profitable, generating a monthly interest of 1.8 percent. These 200 million soles are part of the 618 million soles to be issued as BCR funds, although the difference will not generate interest.
