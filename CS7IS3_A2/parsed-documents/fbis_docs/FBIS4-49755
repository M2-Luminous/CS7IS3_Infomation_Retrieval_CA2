Departments concerned even decided to "suspend cross-strait cultural and educational exchanges and activities," "comprehensively boycott mainland tours," and other things. What was more, after the mainland's public security department announced that the case had been solved, Taiwan's "Mainland Affairs Council" and "National Security Bureau" went so far as to spread rumors, thus deliberately deepening Taiwan citizens' misunderstandings against and estrangement from the mainland. The action of some people in Taiwan is unfavorable to the development of cross-strait relations. The Qiandaohu incident is an unfortunate and rare occurrence. After it was reported, leaders of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have paid great attention to it. The Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council; departments of public security, transportation, and tourism; the Zhejiang Provincial Government; and the Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] have coordinated with each other with all their might to deal with the aftermath of the incident. Over the course of 17 days of hard work, the public security department finally solved the case. It should be said that without the great attention from all sectors and their all-out efforts, it would not be an easy job to solve such a notably major case within such a short time. We cannot but note that some of the Taiwan authorities had ulterior motives when they turned a blind eye to such efforts and went about stirring up Taiwan compatriots' resentment against the mainland. After over 40 years of separation, the personnel contacts and trade and economic exchanges between the two sides of the strait are not only conducive to the development of cross-strait relations but also benefit compatriots on both sides during their exchanges. In the past few years, the exchanges and contacts between people on both sides have been growing frequent. The number of Taiwan compatriots coming to the mainland for tours, sightseeing, investment, and various kinds of exchanges and activities increases by the day. Taiwan compatriots have altogether made over 5 million visits to the mainland. The mainland has attached importance to cross-strait relations, cross-strait exchanges and contacts, and the guarantee of the rights and interests of the broad masses of Taiwan compatriots; the safety of the lives and property of Taiwan compatriots touring the mainland is protected by the law. Of course, there have been some incidents causing serious losses of lives and property of people on both sides of the strait in recent years. We maintain that the fundamental experience, as well as the fundamental attitude, in properly handling such types of individual incidents should take into consideration the overall state of developing cross-strait relations and maintaining the legitimate rights and interests of people on both sides; approach these incidents objectively, calmly, and practically; and never seize on the incident to exaggerate matters and deliberately harm cross-strait relations as well as the feelings of people on both sides. The mainland has been doing exactly this. In 1990, two incidents caused the deaths of 46 mainland compatriots during the repatriation of mainland fishermen by the relevant departments of Taiwan, and in recent years, Taiwan's military police repeatedly fired at and shelled mainland fishing boats in the Taiwan Strait, causing several casualties. Can it be said that the families of the dead mainland compatriots felt no grief and indignation? However, when the mainland handled these incidents, it assumed the attitude of taking cross-strait relations into account so that cross-strait relations did not regress, and the feelings of people on both sides thus were not hurt because of the aforementioned incidents. This has constituted a sharp contrast to the Taiwan authorities' attitude in handling the Qiandaohu incident. As far as the Qiandaohu incident is concerned, it should be normal that families of Taiwan compatriots and relevant departments in Taiwan might have different opinions and views on the handling of the victimized Taiwan compatriots at the beginning of the case. In an attitude of giving priority to the fundamental interests of people of both sides and through patient communication and coordination, however, it is not difficult to solve the problem rationally. As for the case, the principle of "judging the criminal case as it stands" must be upheld. The case could be solved promptly or slowly, and it is certain that the public security department will investigate the case thoroughly and catch the real culprits. This is not only an issue concerning the protection of Taiwan compatriots' rights and interests but also is a measure that the mainland must take to ensure social order. The correct action for the Taiwan authorities should be consoling the victims' relatives, so how could they intentionally take advantage of their grief and sorrow to stir up people's resentment? Moreover, such types of incident are not the fault of cross-strait exchanges, and people on the two sides will not, and are unlikely to, stop their contacts and tours because of an accidental criminal case. The Taiwan authorities, however, wanted to suspend this and hold that on the pretext of this incident, in an effort to harm cross-strait relations. It can be seen that because of different social systems on the two sides, plus 30 to 40 years of separation, there are some differences in their concepts and measures for approaching problems. But this does not matter. As long as the two sides hold frequent contacts, including contacts of high-ranking personnel such as holding the second Wang Daohan-Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu] talks, based on the common belief of promoting the development of cross-strait relations, such misunderstandings can be eliminated completely, and their common ground can be enhanced. Now, the ARATS has once again invited personnel of the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] and its experts to Hangzhou to hear the briefing by investigators of the case on the case's details. The ARATS has also agreed, in principle, to exchange opinions with the SEF on incidents involving the safety and the losses of lives and property of compatriots on the two sides in the course of cross-strait exchanges in recent years, and it has put forward specific suggestions. This is an important move to intensify communication, eliminate the negative effect caused by the Qiandaohu incident, and develop cross-strait relations. We hope that both of them will make earnest efforts to develop cross-strait relations, and we sincerely hope that the SEF personnel will depart for the mainland as soon as possible and, taking the overall state of cross-strait relations into consideration, will further eliminate the misunderstanding and estrangement through understanding and make contributions to maintaining and developing cross-strait relations.
