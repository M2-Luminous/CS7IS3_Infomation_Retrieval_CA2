FR940720-2-00143 FR940720-2-00079 [Release No. 34&hyph;34374; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;23] Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change Relating to a Fee Reduction Plan July 14, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on July 7, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated (the ``CBOE'' or the ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The CBOE proposes to amend its fee reduction plan, which has been in effect since July 1, 1992. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organizations's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend the Exchange's fee reduction plan. The plan, which was initially adopted on July 1, 1992 and subsequently amended in July 1993, provides that if Exchange volume levels exceed a pre-determined threshold at the end of any fiscal quarter, specified fees will be reduced the following quarter in accordance with the schedule. The proposed amendments are the product of the Exchange's annual budget review and are structured to accommodate the capital needs of the Exchange for the coming year. The amendments will take effect for the new fiscal year commencing July 1, 1994. The proposed rule change amends the current fee reduction thresholds and amounts. The minimum threshold for a fee reduction is raised from 525,000 to 550,000 year to date contract volume. The reduction in the market-maker fees has been lowered $.05 to $.10 for five of the eight thresholds. The member dues fee reduction of 25% to 100% is given at higher thresholds. The proposed rule change also replaces the trade match fee reduction schedule with a fee reduction schedule for floor brokerage fees. 2 In all other respects, the fee reduction program remains unchanged. 2 The floor broker fee is reduced $.05 for 600,000 to 625,000 year to date contract volume, and is reduced $.10 for 650,000 to 700,000 year to date contract volume. The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general, and Section 6(b)(4) in particular, by providing for the equitable allocation among CBOE members of reasonable dues, fees, and charges. 3 3 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) (1988). B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition CBOE does not believes that the proposed rule change imposes any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others Comments on the proposed rule change have not been solicited or received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and subparagraph (e)(2) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 19b&hyph;4 in that the proposed rule change establishes or changes a due, fee, or other charge imposed by the Exchange. At any time within sixty days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20549.
