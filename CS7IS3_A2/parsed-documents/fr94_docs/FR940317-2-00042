SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Agency has issued Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) documents for the pesticidal active ingredients listed below. Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended in 1988, EPA is conducting an accelerated reregistration program to reevaluate existing pesticides to make sure they meet current scientific and regulatory standards. The data base to support the reregistration of each of the chemicals listed above is substantially complete. EPA has determined that all currently registered products subject to reregistration containing these active ingredients are eligible for reregistration. List A - Case 0024 ␣␣ Boric Acid, Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate (Borax Decahydrate), Sodium Tetraborate Pentahydrate (Borax Pentahydrate), Sodium Tetraborate (Anhydrous Borax), Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate, Disodium Octaborate (Anhydrous), and Sodium Metaborate Case 0071 ␣␣ Butylate; Case 0032 ␣␣ Daminozide; Case 0178 ␣␣ Glyphosate Case 0172 ␣␣ Sulfuryl Fluoride; List C - Case 3110 ␣␣ Phenyl-Ethyl-Propionate; Case 3143 ␣␣ Thymol; Case 3149 ␣␣ Tris (Hydroxymethyl) Nitromethane; Case 3150 ␣␣ Wood Oils and Gums; List D - Case 4038 ␣␣ Eugenol; Case 4051 ␣␣ Inorganic Halides (Sodium Bromide and Sodium Chloride); Case 4061 ␣␣ Lauryl Sulfate Salts To request a copy of any of the listed RED documents, or a RED Fact Sheet, contact the OPP Pesticide Docket, Public Response and Program Resources Branch, in Rm 1132 at the address given above or call (703) 305&hyph;5805. All registrants of products containing one or more of the above listed active ingredients have been sent the appropriate RED documents and must respond to labeling requirements and product specific data requirements (if applicable) within 8 months of receipt, with the exception of eugenol and phenyl-ethyl-propionate. Products containing the other active ingredients will not be reregistered until adequate product specific data have been submitted and all necessary product label changes are implemented. For products containing eugenol and phenyl-ethyl-propionate, the Agency is considering these products for exemption from registration under Section 25(b) of the Federal Insecticide and Rodenticide Act. Therefore, no product specific labeling or data are being required at this time. The reregistration program is being conducted under Congressionally mandated time frames, and EPA recognizes both the need to make timely reregistration decisions and to involve the public. Therefore, EPA is issuing these REDs as final documents with a 60&hyph;day comment period. Although the 60&hyph;day public comment period does not affect the registrant's response due date, it is intended to provide an opportunity for public input and a mechanism for initiating any necessary amendments to the RED. All comments will be carefully considered by the Agency. If any comment significantly affect a RED, EPA will amend the RED by publishing the amendment in the Federal Register .
