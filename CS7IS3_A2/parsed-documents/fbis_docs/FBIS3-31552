"Some very insignificant deviations from the general trend of the withdrawal were caused by weather conditions, but we are ready to agree on that, too, and to finalize that part of the job at any moment," General Galisc said. Asked about the current situation in the zone of responsibility of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps, Galic stressed the soldiers of his corps were in a state of increased combat readiness, primarily because they expected that the Muslim forces could take advantage of the current circumstances. "Whoever attacks us is our enemy, and we shall defend ourselves to the very end," Galic added. Commenting on the arrival in Sarajevo of the Russian UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] battalion Galic said this was a case of the Russians coming back to their old, primordial friends and that the friendship ought to continue to be fostered. "We welcomed them as brothers, as people, and as soldiers. We shall do our utmost to facilitate them in performing their task of peacekeeping in the area." "The Russian battalion will be deployed between the warring parties; that is, in front of our defense lines. UNPROFOR does not have a sufficient number of soldiers to cover the whole front line, but the Russians will take certain positions from which they will be able to efficiently supervise the cease-fire," Galic said, adding that he had visited the Russian battalion with General Soubirou, UNPROFOR commander for Sarajevo. Asked what was the subject of his talks today with General Michael Rose, Galic gave a brief answer: "General Rose was doing his routine tour of the area, and he called on the command of the Sarajevo-Romanija corps for consultations over coffee, something that is a part of his professional duties and cooperation."
