Speaking to a group of monks on Thursday the monarch said that the rebel Khmer Rouge, who refused to recognize the results of UN sponsored polls last year, should be willing to test their popularity in a democratic poll if they are truly representatives of the people. The current leaders "are all sportsmen, so they must agree ... Then we can compete with each other through peaceful means. There will be no killing of each other, but we can attack each other through microphones," the king said. But in Cambodia elections are a blood sport. The country has no history of peaceful transfer of power and no tradition of parliamentary opposition. Like the Khmer Rouge now, the losers in any battle for power have traditionally taken their struggle to the jungle and there is nothing to suggest anything would change if polls were held. Even with 23,000 UN soldiers and officials monitoring last year's polls, the election campaign proceeded under a climate of fear. Scores of candidates and canvassers were gunned down, voters intimidated, and ethnic Vietnamese massacred to make a political point. And then when the ballots were tallied, the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) threatened to take a large portion of the country and secede when it became apparent the royalist Funcinpec [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party would win. The CPP and Funcinpec have since ruled in an uneasy coalition but much suspicion and acrimony remains. With much of Cambodia currently under threat from the Khmer Rouge insurgency, the timing couldn't be worse for the holding of a new election. Much of the blame for the current mess in Cambodia must rest with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) for failing to disarm the four warring factions as was required by the 1991 Paris Peace Accord. Untac military chief Lt Gen John Sanderson argued that to have used force to disarm the Khmer Rouge would have breached the mission's peacekeeping mandate. What's more, he said, it would have been martial folly in the jungles of Cambodia. But now with the Khmer Rouge threatening to impose a reign of terror over much of the northwest, the entire three-billion-dollar peace mission is beginning to look like folly. By allowing the Khmer Rouge to remain armed, dangerous and outside the peace process, left behind a dangerous legacy for the new government. It also meant Untac was never able carry out another crucial provision of the peace accord -- the establishment of a new national army. The United Nations cannot be blamed for the Royal Cambodian Army's recent crushing defeats at the hands of the guerrillas at Anlung Veng and Pailin. But the prospects for Cambodia's post-election future would have been much brighter if even a modestly trained and functioning army had been up and running when Untac pulled out. As things now stand, it appears that if Phnom Penh is ever to overcome the Khmer Rouge threat, constant military pressure is going to have to be applied. The guerrillas have shown no sign of sincere interest in King Sihanouk's earlier peace initiative which would have given acceptable members of the group positions in power in exchange for an end to their insurgency. Instead, the group's leaders continue to respond to government overtures with their anachronistic rantings about "the Vietnamese puppets, their lackies and the entente." The Khmer Rouge have demonstrated over and over again they have no interest in participating in the rebuilding of Cambodia along democratic principals. Should they accept an invitation to join the elections there is no reason to believe they would campaign peacefully or abide by the results. In last year's election, the real heroes were not the UN organizers but the voters who in great numbers defied threats of violence and death to cast ballots for their chosen party. But asking the Cambodians to take such a risk again under the current conditions would be to ask too much. The UN tried valiantly to introduce democratic concepts to Cambodia as it steered the country towards elections. But in Cambodia, it is the law of power that has always ruled and the only precept the Khmer Rouge responds to. Unfortunately for the new government in Phnom Penh, its army seems ineptly-led and ridden with corruption. The international community would be right to respond to Cambodia's appeals for assistance to help train its military. Elections, even those cleanly held, won't defeat the Khmer Rouge. Only force coupled with programs to better the lot of the population will finally rid Cambodia of this curse.
