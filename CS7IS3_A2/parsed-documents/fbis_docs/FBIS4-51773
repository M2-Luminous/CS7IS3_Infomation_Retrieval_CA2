Agricultural collectivization began in 1954 and was completed in 1958. In this period more than 3,800 large-scale agricultural cooperatives were organized, resulting in the complete elimination of the private ownership of land and means of agricultural production. In this process 94 percent of the land was converted into cooperative ownership and the remaining 6 percent into state ownership. North Korea published what they call "the Thesis on the Socialist Agrarian Question [in Our Country]" in February 1964," setting as the basic goal of its agricultural policy to convert cooperative ownership in agriculture to "ownership by all the people" . North Korea pushed "four-conversions," namely, rural irrigation, electrification, mechanization, and chemicalization, as a basic task for the immediate goal of eliminating the gaps between agricultural and industrial labor, between urban and rural areas, and between farmers and workers. As a means of conversion to state ownership, North Korea selected areas suitable for collectivization and converted them into state-run firms, while expanding existing state firms and ranches developed as major agricultural estates producing speciality crops, fruit, and livestock, and creating more of the similar firms and ranches. A great deal of investment was made in these state firms on a priority basis. With emphasis on four rural conversions, North Korea introduced the so-called "chuche farming method" beginning in the late 1970's, calling for the chucheization, scientization, and modernization of agriculture. On the other hand, it implemented a five-point grand nature harnessing program with dry-field irrigation, terraced field development, antierosion work, and marsh-land reclamation as its principal content. Present State of North Korea's Agriculture That was a brief overview of North Korea's agricultural policy for the past half century. North Korea has pursued its agriculture-first policy as part of socialist construction and implemented an agricultural policy of its own. However, the present condition of North Korea's agriculture is unmistakably in bad shape. This may be because forced labor cannot but be unproductive where the principle of market economy is brushed aside, a common phenomenon and weakness of socialism. The 21st Plenum of the Sixth Workers Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee set aside the next three years until 1996 as a buffer period in socialist economic construction during which the first priority would be given to agriculture, light industry, and trade. This may be construed as signifying that North Korea is also applying the principle of adaptation, the principle that no nation should remain left behind the worldwide trend to break away from irrationality and swim with internationalism. The following is a brief examination of the merits and demerits of North Korea's major agricultural policies. First, as far as North Korea is concerned, the land reform policy and the policy of collectivizing agricultural production may be viewed as a considerable success. Supposing economies of scale are applicable in the communist system as in the democratic system, the policy of collectivization may be viewed as a successful one in that is clearly conducive to the effective utilization of land. Rearrangement of arable land and collectivization, which North Korea considered indispensable as a prerequisite to increased soil productivity and agricultural mechanization, served as the foundation of mechanization. Let us compare this with the situation in the South. In the South it is next to impossible to carry out a bold rearrangement of arable land for these reasons: Different people own different pieces of land, different farmers use different farming methods and grow different crops, and there are numerous other problems such as those involving compensation. In North Korea on the other hand, it seems that they could complete the rearrangement of arable land without much difficulty under complete planning. Second, four conversions refers to the four tasks aimed at what they call the scientization of the rural economy in North Korean, namely, irrigation, electrification, mechanization, and chemicalization. By rural irrigation is meant building irrigation facilities on arable land. In North Korea almost all paddy fields and over 50 percent of dry fields are under irrigation. This indicates that North Korea has pursued irrigation as the first priority task in the development of rural communities. The electrification policy bore a considerable fruit in the early stage. However, the current record shows meager success as is the case in other industrial sectors, due to the gaping disparity between the ever-growing demand for energy and the current pace of growth in electricity production. Mechanization was essential to farm work in large collective farms. Particularly because it was pursued in conjunction with the munitions industry, the mechanization policy had much that warranted its seeming justification. However, in our judgment the policy has been ineffectual because of frequent mechanical failures resulting from the backwardness of the technologies used, as well as the low operating rates resulting from the energy shortage and the lack of enthusiasm to work. With emphasis on chemicalization, North Korea has rapidly increased the use of fertilizers while gradually increasing the amount of agricultural chemicals sprayed in order to increase the per unit output. Agricultural chemicals and fertilizers are double-edged swords: When used properly, they are tonic to plants, but their overdose can be poisonous. Reportedly, all arable land in North Korea has become acidified due to the policy of chemicalization, causing a decline in agricultural productivity contrary to their expectations. Third, North Korea's grand nature harnessing policy is aimed at expanding the acreage of land under cultivation. Seeing the necessity of expanding arable land as the first requisite for increased agricultural production, North Korea adopted and implemented the "five-point policy for the grand nature harnessing," namely, dry-field irrigation construction, terraced dry-field construction, land rearrangement and soil amelioration, anti-erosion projects, and marsh land reclamation. Despite its effects in increasing the acreage of land under cultivation, this policy may be viewed as typical of failed agricultural policies. To expand the acreage of arable land which was absolutely in short supply, North Korea reclaimed all mountain slopes and converted them into terraced fields while converting all land that could be irrigated into paddy fields. As a consequence, forests have been devastated and soil has been washed away so much that the level of the river bottom has risen, increasing the frequency of floods and causing severe flood damage to the crops. Apparently, this is an outcome of the irrational policy under which in defiance of common sense dictating that a mountain is where trees grow and a paddy or dry field is where crops grow, they cut trees to plant crops and call the patches of land thus created paddies and fields. Fourth, the policy of self-reliance is based on the socialist spirit of attaining self-sufficiency in food and clothing. It may be aimed at achieving a self-sufficient economy through the socialization of agriculture and the attainment of self-sufficiency in food and clothing on the basis of the chuche ideology. But clearly, the outcome of such policy has been fully demonstrated in the former Soviet Union, China, and communist Vietnam. Abandoning their self-pride, these countries have made their debut on the international economic stage and are now taking an active role among the ranks of free trade and international cooperation to achieve leaping progress. But in an attempt to increase agricultural efficiency for their much-touted purpose of "building an earthly paradise," North Korea alone is still resorting to such desperate measures as an all-out mobilization of non-agricultural labor, including clerical employees of factories and enterprises, industrial workers, students, and soldiers, in farming during the busy season. The pursuit of an arbitrary ineffectual agricultural policy based on what they call the chuche farming method, contrary to its original goal of breaking the existing impasse by giving hope to the class of disgruntled farmers and presenting bright prospects, has proven unsuccessful so far in achieving the food production goal, with agricultural productivity remaining very low. It is impossible to make an accurate assessment of the food production and supply situation in North Korea because of the unavailability of credible statistics. It is speculated that thanks to its agriculture-first policy, North Korea exceeds South Korea in terms of the self-sufficiency rate in food grain supply. However, compared with South Korea, the variety of foodstuffs supplied in North Korea is limited and particularly their quality is very poor. This may be attributable to the limits of the controlled economy under which the farmers are coerced to achieve the government-imposed numerical production goals in the absence of incentives for stimulating their desire to produce. Up till now our analysts have made pretty much the same comparisons between the relative economic strength of the North and South by toying with scanty, piece-meal statistics available. Comparisons in agricultural production were no exception. They often made their comparisons by using figures on the output of the staple grain alone as the basis of their argument. That is why North Korea overexaggerated the output of staple grain by including corn, potatoes, and so on in this category besides rice. [passage omitted] Future Prospects In his New Year's message this year, Kim Il-song said: "In the domain of the rural economy, we triumphantly executed the grand nature harnessing program designed to bring irrigation to a high degree of completion, effected a turnaround in mechanization and chemicalization, and further developed agricultural science and technology to suit the demands of the chuche farming method, thereby laying a solid foundation for an agricultural revolution that will assure a continual bumper crop for ages to come." He added: "We must bring about a new turn in the development of the rural economy by waging a vigorous struggle to complete the historic tasks outlined in the Theses on the Agrarian Question. We must consolidate our successes in rural irrigation and electrification, achieve a high degree of planning and scientization, and thoroughly implement the chuche farming method so that we may increase the rice yield and develop all other sectors of agricultural production still more. Our working class must produce a greater variety of farm machinery and materials, such as tractors and trucks, modern farm machines, chemical fertilizers, and agricultural chemicals in greater quantities and deliver them to our rural villages. Cooperative farmers and all agricultural workers must fulfill the party-assigned goals of self-sufficiency by doing their farm work meticulously and assiduously." As you see, North Korea still resorts pretty much to agitating language, but we can hardly see any signs of change in North Korea. Nevertheless, their emphasis on agriculture to achieve self-sufficiency, the importance attached to heavy industry [as published] to achieve qualitative and quantitative improvements in the production of daily necessities, their professed desire to increase exports by actively searching out and mobilizing resources for producing exportable goods and develop processing trade--all this may have stemmed from their judgment that the situation is so urgent that they have no choice but to change in one way or another in this age of internationalization. Supposing that assumption is in the realm of possibility to a certain extent, the question is: Whom will North Korea choose as its major partner? Japan, which is extending its hand in a more forthcoming manner than any among free countries, is one possible candidate. There is much possibility that North Korea will seek active relationships with other countries. But North Korea should know that the most reliable, stable, and profitable partnership can be obtained through the blood relationship between the North and South. Should North Korea's agricultural administration boldly approve of private ownership of arable land, it would stimulate the desire of the farmers to produce more and spur the development of agricultural technology suitable to the topographic and climatic conditions in North Korea; and this would enable North Korea to produce more from its land that would be neatly rearranged, and thus resolve the food shortage without difficulty. Unless the current system is boldly revamped, the farmers' desire to produce cannot but be passive and lukewarm and their productivity will fall more and more with each passing day, resulting in a slack and decline in yield in every category of cultivation.
