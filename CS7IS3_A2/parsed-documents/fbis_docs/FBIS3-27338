RENMIN RIBAO published a special editorial extending congratulations on this success. The two highways, whose combined length totaled 4,355 km were only paved with a low grade sand-and-pebble surface. Since reform and opening up, the Qinghai-Tibet highway has taken on a new look. In 1984, it was tarred and, in 1992, it was upgraded when frost-proofing materials were added. Although old China claimed to have left behind 120,000 to 130,000 km of highways, in fact, only 75,000 km could be used on the eve of the birth of New China. After more than 40 years of construction, China (excluding the province of Taiwan) had highways totaling 1.075 million km as of the end of 1993, representing an addition of exactly 1 million km. Before the 1970's, China's highway construction rested mainly with the localities and the masses and was became popular. Between 1951 and 1956, an additional 100,000 km were built and, between 1956 and 1959, and average 100,000 km were added each year. One of the reasons for the rapid development was "popularization." Despite the comparatively low grade, what mattered was that they could be used. Since reform and opening up, the principles that "the better the highway is, the richer one gets" and "the speedier one gets, the faster one becomes rich" have generally been accepted. Highway construction has integrated popularization and upgrading, with the emphasis on the latter. Of the added 1 million km, expressways account for 1,145 km and first and second grade special highways account for 7,281 km. Despite the glorious achievements made in China's highway construction over the past 40 years or more, and particularly during the past 15 years of reform and opening up, and the fact that all counties, 96 percent of towns and townships, and 74 percent of administrative villages across the country are accessible by car, we still have a large gap compared with developed countries. They are few in number: Each square kilometer of land only has 11.2 m of highway. They are low in grade: Second grade highways or higher only account for approximately 6.2 percent of the total and village highways are in comparatively poor condition. What is heartening, however, is that departments in charge of highway construction in China have already made plans accordingly. By the end of this century, the highway mileage will reach 1.25 million km. The formulation of the grand plan that four main state expressways and three important sections which form great routes linking east, west, south, and north is now being stepped up.
