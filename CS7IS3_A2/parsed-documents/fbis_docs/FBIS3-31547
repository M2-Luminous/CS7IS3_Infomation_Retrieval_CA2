The meeting was also attended by General Milivoj Petkovic and General Ante Roso. In addition to the usual topics, their meeting today was an introduction to an event that is to take place tomorrow: A cease-fire agreement which is to be signed by General Ante Roso and General Rasim Delic. [Petkovic] I hope Delic will come to Zagreb tomorrow so that we can sign an agreement which, unlike those that I have signed so far and that have not produced any results, will finally be an agreement which will yield not only short-term but also long-term results. The most important objective is that combat actions between the Croatian Defense Council formations and the Muslim forces cease. [Reporter] Tomorrow is a decisive day, as you say. Will it be successful and are you expecting real results? [Roso] Many things are changing with the spring. I would not like to add anything to what General Petkovic said, I think it is sufficient. Hopefully, this agreement will be final and in this way the Croatian Defense Council will contribute to the restoration of peace in the Balkans. [Reporter] The agreement will be signed on neutral ground. [Akashi, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] Today we had a very fruitful meeting. The result is a possibility to sign an agreement on the cessation of hostilities between General Roso and General Delic. This will be an historic moment -- the return of peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Reporter] Another topic discussed at the meeting, of no less importance, is also in connection with Bosnia-Herzegovina and the alleged presence of the Croatian Army there. Generals Roso and Petkovic put forward a proposal to UNPROFOR to carry out a thorough inspection of all formations and positions so that allegations on the presence of regular Croatian Army formations can be refuted. The important thing is that the allegation on the presence of Croatian Army in Bosnia-Herzegovina has by this been relatively neutralized. [Sarinic] It has absolutely been neutralized, and no way is that the case [changes thought], we will wait for about a week until they have collated all the details and verified them, and only then should the UN Security Council get reliable reports; it should not make any decisions on the basis of some gossip. Their conclusions can be, as I have already said, very serious and fatal for Croatia. [Reporter] In the next seven days UNPROFOR commissions are to examine the situation and send a report to Yasushi Akashi.
