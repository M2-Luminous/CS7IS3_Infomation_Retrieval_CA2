A somewhat lesser number are convinced that these changes are impossible without replacing the parliament and the government. Each person views them in his own particular way; frequently various groups of people present completely opposite and mutually contradictory positions. But almost all of us hope for something better, especially in the event that those whom we like nowadays should come to power. To be sure, our hopes for quick changes are hardly justified in any case. The process of the disintegration of the economy and the fundamental social structures has been going on for so long that "neither a genius nor a hero" will be able to rescue us from the present nightmare as rapidly as we would like. It will continue for another two or three years, even if a beginning is made on those reforms are carried out by persons who know how to implement them and who have support in the society. And are there any such persons here in our country? Even if we were to assume what is virtually impossible--namely, that the elections to the Belarusian Parliament were held by the deadline promised by the present-day deputies of the Supreme Soviet--the picture that emerges is not completely rosy. Many serious analysts have pointed to the substantial probability of acquiring a parliament that is not much different from the Supreme Soviet which we have today with regard to its intellectural development, degree of competence, as well as the capacity for moving the reforms forward and providing stability within the society. Indeed, we have been pushed in the direction of this joyless conclusion by the surprising statements made by the leaders of the most influential political groups and factions now in the running for a significant number of seats in the new legislative organ. They see as the principal causes of all our troubles the intrigues and machinations of the Russian special services, which "are exercising a free hand in Belarus," as well as the actions of the imperial-communist "Fifth Column," and the advocates of economic integration with that country which is traveling "down the path of a brutal liberal capitalism." The only thing to do is to break off from these foreign and domestic enemies, nationalize those enterprises which have been distributed and held hostage, separate ourselves from the Russian boors," and buy oil in Kuwait. Then--as a completely sovereign and independent republic--we would soon enter upon a kind of Baltic or Polish "prosperity." To be sure, before a sharper economic upswing could come to pass, it would be absolutely necessary to teach the Belarusian language to all our ministers, along with two or three other foreign languages. Other leaders--during the time free from struggling against propaganda of the "cult of violence, the dollar, and sex"--are actively advocating a reanimation of socialism, which is presently at death's door, or what they have been saying for a long time: achieving an orientation of the state structures aimed at creating well-planned and regulated state-type commodity-and-monetary relations in the interests of enhancing the people's prosperity and cultural level. Loud calls are being heard for decisive actions to be taken for protecting and defending the "indigenous interests of the working people," the Soviets, for restoring the old USSR--of course, with the Communist Party at its head. The economic reforms leading to "capitalization" are to be excluded, and the growth of the people's prosperity would, evidently, be provided by purely ideological methods--although substantial revenues from tourist activity would be possible. Belarus--the last communist preserve on the territory of Europe--would be visited by people from all over the world in order to have a look at a unique country where entirely white people live under the "most democratic, collegial, and effective" Soviet-type regime. There is also a "third force" in our republic--one which could neutralize the extreme political tendencies. But its ideas are not so popular or simple so as to enable them--as the Bolsheviks used to say--to win over the masses. And it is difficult to present this idea of liberalism with a populistic interpretation, especially under the conditions of the Soviet-type, leveling education accorded to the overwhelming majority of the members of our society. Furthermore, the mass media have already become divided over the two most powerful political factions and their variants--sometimes concealed behind the masks of "centrism." A strong side of those parties which can be provisionally relegated to the "true center" is their realistic approach to the problem of assigning priority to human rights over national and state rights. This is so because the majority of our republic's population regard implementation of the "human rights" principle as the "chief value" guaranteeing personal security and the stability of the society as a whole. It is hardly likely that a majority in parliament will be gained by one of the parties or blocs which are striving toward this goal with participants who are very close in their ideologies and programs. The polarity of views on the basic problems of structuring the society and the state held by the future party factions in the parliament will--more than likely--cause the latter to be utterly inoperable. It will be difficult to get by without making compromises, and it is necessary to seek them out even today. It is clear that agreement between the advocates of the sacredness of private property and those fighters for the most just "social justice" is scarecely possible. But it is possible in another case. For example, in the program documents of that very same BNF [Belarusian People's Front], together with some completely normal and realistic provisions, there are also many on which agreement would be difficult to reach not only with the communist-internationalists, but also with persons unburdened by Marxist pathologies. But it would probably not be too difficult to find a compromise with the more moderate political forces on these same "revival" problems, if they were approached from a position of taking into account the interests of the majority now living in Belarus, rather than resurrecting historical justice or equity with regard to past generations. Because, after all, it is fully obvious that excessive radicalism--while understandable and justified under the conditions of an armed struggle against the colonialists for the nation's independence--is completely unacceptable at the stage of a society's quite civilized development, and even at a critical moment of this stage. It frightens quite a large number of persons, pushing them into joining "pink" or "red" parties--parties which have begun to trade upon the artificially inflated, so-called nationality issue. It is possible that mutual concessions can also be achieved along with an accomodation of views on other problems. Without finding such common grounds--something on which political groups with various different program goals and ideologies could unite--the parliament would, of course, not get by. But this does not mean that replacing the Supreme Soviet with a parliament must be postponed "until later." Today we are compelled to choose between something not very good and something very bad. But tomorrow we could be left without even that kind of choice.
