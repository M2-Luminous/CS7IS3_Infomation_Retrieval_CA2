FR940725-1-00037 FR940725-1-00009 ``A State which satisfies these standards qualifies for a waiver on the basis that: (1) It has made significant progress to date; and (2) additional funding is likely to produce further progress toward compliance (54 FR 14769, April 12, 1989). The seven criteria, set forth at 28 CFR 31.303(f)(6)(iii)(D)( 2 ), provide that a State requesting a waiver must demonstrate that it: ( i ) Agrees to expend all of its Formula Grant Award except planning and administration, advisory group set aside, and Indian tribe pass-through funds, to achieve compliance with section 223(a)(14); and ( ii ) Removed all status and nonoffender juveniles from adult jails and lockups as set forth in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(A)(2)( i ) of this section; and ( iii ) Made meaningful progress in removing other juveniles from adult jails and lockups as set forth in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(A)(2)( ii ) of this section; and ( iv ) Diligently carried out the State's jail and lockup removal plan as set forth in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(A)(2)( iii ) of this section; and ( v ) Submitted an acceptable plan, based on an assessment of current jail and lockup removal barriers within the State, to eliminate noncompliant incidents; and ( vi ) Achieved compliance with section 223(a)(15) of the JJDP Act; and ( vii ) Demonstrated a commitment, through appropriate executive or legislative action, to achieving full compliance. The reference in ( ii ) above, is to regulatory provisions implementing the former ``substantial compliance'' standard, which reads as follows: ( i ) Removed all status and nonoffender juveniles from adult jails and lockups. Compliance with this standard requires that the last submitted monitoring report demonstrate that no status offender (including those accused of or adjudicated for violating a valid court order) or nonoffender juveniles were securely detained in adult jails or lockups for any length of time; or, that all status offenders and nonoffenders securely detained in adult jails and lockups for any length of time were held in violation of an enforceable state law and did not constitute a pattern or practice within the state. Currently, several States have not been awarded their FY 1992 and/or FY 1993 funds because they cannot meet criterion ( ii ) for receiving a waiver. While the numbers of status and nonoffenders are typically small, these States either lack an enforceable State law which would prohibit any violations or the State has been unable to demonstrate that the violations do not constitute a pattern or practice within the State. OJJDP does not believe that the practice of detaining status or nonoffender juveniles in adult jails or lockups is acceptable or that States should in any way sanction or permit such a practice. However, OJJDP also has to weigh the detriment that will occur if States which are close to achieving full compliance are deprived of a significant means of obtaining that important goal through the application of criteria that are inflexible. Consequently, OJJDP proposes to modify criterion ( ii ) to provide that States can meet the standard by demonstrating that the number of status offenders (including valid court order violators) and nonoffenders securely detained in adult jails and lockups is less than the numerical de minimis rate of 9 per 100,000 juvenile population in the State. This provision is balanced by the addition in criterion ( vii ) of a requirement that the State demonstrate an unequivocal commitment, through appropriate executive or legislative action, to achieving full compliance, and the proposed change in the monitoring exception for DSO to prohibit placing a status or nonoffender juvenile in an adult jail or lockup for any length of time. The proposed revisions should provide these few remaining States with a reasonable opportunity to achieve full compliance without a loss of Formula Grant Program funds while, at the same time, reiterating the Congressional mandate that adult jails and lockups are inappropriate places in which to securely detain children who have committed no criminal law violation.
