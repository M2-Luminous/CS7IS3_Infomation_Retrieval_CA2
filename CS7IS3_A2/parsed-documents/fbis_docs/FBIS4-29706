According to a report, a strike group of the United States, Japan, and South Korea has been organized in the process of the Rimpac-94 joint military exercise conducted off Hawaii. The report says that the strike group is composed of the combat ships and planes of the United States, Japan, and South Korea, with the aircraft carriers Independence and Constellation forming the basis of it, its mission being the battle against a hypothetical enemy. As has been reported, they raved, even before the Rimpac-94 joint military exercise began, that the exercise would serve as a message to North Korea. Moreover, it is a public fact that the United States, Japan, and South Korea became even stronger allies during the exercise. In view of this, the hypothetical enemy they designated is undoubtedly our Republic. This shows that the strike group has been organized for the purpose of a preemptive attack on our country, thus clearly showing how frenziedly the U.S. imperialists, the Japanese reactionaries, and the South Korean puppets are maneuvering to crush [apsal] our Republic. The world publicly admits that we are not developing nuclear weapons. It was the United States that gave birth to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. It is also the United States that is increasing the danger of nuclear war. The U.S. imperialists are threatening us with the 1,000-odd nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea, and the Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets are growing their own nuclear mushroom under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Nevertheless, like a thief turning on the owner, they who are posing a nuclear threat, went so far as to form a strike group aimed at attacking us militarily, going further in harassing us--who do not have nuclear weapons and who are under the nuclear threat--with a nuclear issue. Furthermore, not to be overlooked is the fact that the strike group was formed when the situation on the Korean peninsula was extremely aggravated and entered a dangerous phase of war. Now the United States has massively assembled its aggressive forces, including aircraft carriers, in South Korea and its surrounding areas to crush our Republic under the pretext of the so-called nuclear issue. Raving about a preemptive strike on us, the United States is aiming at an opportunity to provoke a war. The Japanese reactionaries are also attempting to take the lead in taking sanctions against us. The traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique, raving about the inevitability of sanctions against us, is persistently maneuvering, in collusion with outside forces, to harm its fellow countrymen and to drive the nation into a nuclear calamity. It is far from an unpremeditated development that the United States, Japan, and South Korea organized a strike group at a time when a grave explosive situation is being created on the Korean peninsula because of the said maneuvers. It is an advance preparation for the formation of multinational forces to be put into a war of northward invasion on the Korean peninsula when those countries provoke it. In other words, it can be said to be a trial formation of a multinational force. With the organization of the strike group, they are attempting to further expand and intensify their military threat against us and force us to submit. This is proven by the foreign press report on the organization of the strike group, which said it is a political warning for Pyongyang. They, however, are miscalculating. Our people are never frightened nor do they submit, no matter what pressure is put on them. We have already made it clear that a sanction is a declaration of war against us, and that not only those participating in a sanction but those supporting it will be duly held responsible for it. We mean what we say. Our people treasure peace, but do not beg for peace by having the country's sovereignty trampled upon. We will inflict a resolute punishment on those who set upon us to crush our socialism.
