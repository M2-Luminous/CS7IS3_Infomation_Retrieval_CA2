It was learned that the uneasiness felt by Russia over a Turkic summit was the reason for the postponement. Besides, it is being claimed that Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan wanted the summit to be postponed to avoid giving the impression that the summit is a front against Armenia. Whereas, the Azerbaijani Government stated that the summit was postponed to allow for better preparations for it. The second summit of the Turkic republics -- the first was held in Turkey in 1992 -- would have been held in Baku at the end of 1993. However, Geydar Aliyev postponed the summit until January. Ankara was surprised by Aliyev's decision to postpone it for a second time.
