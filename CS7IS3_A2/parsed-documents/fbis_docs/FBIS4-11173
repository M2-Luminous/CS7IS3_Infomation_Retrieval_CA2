The EZLN's decision to "call off the red alert" among its troops starting tomorrow and to resume consultations within the rank-and-file was announced in a communique released today in San Cristobal de las Casas. The communique says that "if the favorable climate for a dialogue continues," the EZLN will resume consultations with its rank-and-file on the agreements negotiated with the Mexican Government in late February -- agreements outlining pacification plans for Chiapas. "The EZLN affirms its desire for a political response to the just demands that keep the fire of its struggle alive. The EZLN continues to demand liberty, justice, and democracy for all Mexicans." [passage omitted] In the communique, the EZLN acknowledges the "honest and determined" efforts of Manuel Camacho Solis, mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz, and the civilian society to "make reason prevail over the use of force" and to meet the demands of the Indians. The EZLN is also pleased with the release of the 16 people who had been held since January under false charges that they were Zapatists. The EZLN "interprets this as a good sign that talks for a fair and respectable peace should be resumed." In addition, "Subcommander Marcos," the Zapatists' mysterious ideological leader, issued a communique severely criticizing those who have slandered his armed movement and who have scorned the rebels' poverty. The subcommander berated and described as "stupid" the opinions of several analysts who said the EZLN had delayed the consultations to have the peace talks postponed and to expand the armed conflict.
