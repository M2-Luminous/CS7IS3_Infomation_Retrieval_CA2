On 29 January, after listening to briefings given by the provincial Discipline Inspection Commission and relevant departments on keeping themselves honest and clean during the Spring Festival and on consolidating the achievements in anticorruption struggle, Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, pointed out: Although expected achievements have been made in the anticorruption struggle, we still need to do lots of work to consolidate and develop this hard-earned achievements. Although some passive and corrupt phenomena and unhealthy trends have been screened and straightened out, they will reappear if we slightly slacken our efforts in this aspect. Particularly, the unhealthy trends of using public funds to entertain guests and send gifts, giving money or coupons as gifts, and arbitrarily issuing bonuses or articles will occur very easily during the Spring Festival period. Party committees and governments at all levels must never lower their guard. Li Zhanshu, member of the standing committee of the provincial party committee and secretary general, also listened to the briefings. Cheng Weigao stressed: This year is for carrying out package reform with breakthroughs in key areas, and all reform tasks will be very complicated and heavy. If leading cadres at all levels can keep themselves honest and clean, maintain close ties with the masses, and have profound affection towards the masses, all reform measures that issued will be supported by the masses, and the problems that appeared will be easily solved, the political situation will be stable, and reform will be smoothly carried out. Party committees and governments at all levels should always attend to the work of combating corruption and maintaining honesty and grasp it as a political task. Currently, it is necessary to attend to honesty work during the Spring Festival period. Cheng Weigao reaffirmed: Leading cadres at all levels should strictly implement the five stipulations of the party Central Committee on keeping clean and self-disciplined and the "10 prohibitions" proposed by the provincial party committee. During the Spring Festival period, all localities, departments, and units are not allowed to send native or speical products, purchasing certificates, money or all sorts of gifts to the higher organs or leading cadres; higher organs or leading cadres should decline the offer of gifts or money from the lower levels, and should not ask for gifts from them. All units are not allowed to use public funds for lavish dining and wining or to engage in extravagance and waste; and during the Spring Festival period, all tea parties, receptions, forums, and gatherings must be held in frugal way. All localities, departments, and units must not violate the stipulations and issue bonuses, subsidies, purchasing certificates, and articles under any pretext or forms. All people are not permitted to use public funds for holding recreation activities that spend lots of money. Appropriate entertainments may be held during the festive period, but we must guard against the appearance of unhealthy influence. Party members and cadres, particularly the leading cadres, should not be allowed to participate in any kind of gambling, to engage in feudal or superstitious activities, or to drink excessively. Cheng Weigao called on leading cadres at all levels to set examples with their own conduct, take the lead in maintaining honesty, realistically attend to the honest administration of their respective localities, departments, and units during the festive period, establish the responsibility system, and enable one level to take charge of the work of the next level and assume responsibility. If serious problems emerge in a locaility, a department, or a unit, we should first pursue the responsibility of the principal leading cadres. Cheng Weigao said in conclusion: Even though the demands we have set forth are very clear and definite, some cadres who are unaware of them will still engage in unhealthy practice because the legal system is not perfect and there are loopholes in management. The discipline inspection and supervision departments at all levels should strengthen supervision and inspection, immediately organize strength to investigate the problems reported by the masses and the problems discovered, and deal with them strictly in a timely manner.
