Nicolae Vrabiescu, mayor of the Bucharest District Six, is top of the list. He was elected to this position in February 1992 on the ticket of the Democratic Convention (CDR), the main opposition coalition. Vrabiescu is member of the Christian-Democratic National Peasant Party (PNTCD), the main party of the CDR. Grave infringements of the laws by authorizing construction on land in public property, no due attention granted to payments of sums resulting from leasing or hiring, that are part of the local budget, were among the reasons given by the government for Vrabiescu's demise. The dismissal of the mayor of the Bucharest District Six has been met with a strong reaction by Mr. Vrabiescu's party, which calls it "illegal and abusive." The spokesman for the PNTCD told a press conference of this party that the move was part of a campaign "of denigration of the PNTCD, that has turned tougher and tougher" and is likely to be a sign that "the ruling Party of Social Democracy abandons the idea that snap elections would not be opportune." As for Mr. Vrabiescu, he said that the accusations against him were ungrounded. "I shall ask to be handed the dismissal decision and then I shall take legal action," said he. ADEVARUL writes in its March 21 issue that many residents of the Bucharest District Six are supposed to learn only now that "Vrabiescu was a representative of the Democratic Convention, as he made a name for himself not as a politician but as an abusive mayor, who illegally leased plots of land and commercial space in a district whose absolute master he thought he was." Bucharest, Romania's capital counts six districts, each of them with its own town hall. The city also has a general mayoralty.
