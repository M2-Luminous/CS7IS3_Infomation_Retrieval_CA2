This factory stores explosives and dangerous chemicals, and if it is blown up by the defenders or as a result of Muslim shelling everything within a 3 km radius would be destroyed. A document issued by the Vitez operational group also warns that toxic gases would affect people living from 2 to 15 km from the factory. Snow, rain, and fog could reduce the effect of toxic clouds to a certain extent, but in any case the safety zone for the population of the area would be at least 20 km away from the epicenter of the explosion, the Vitez operational group warns in the document.
