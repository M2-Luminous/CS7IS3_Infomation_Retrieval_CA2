In the SAT-1 program "Let's Get Down to Business, Chancellor," Kohl said on Wednesday [22 June] that he does not at all share the opinion of Hans Peter Stihl, president of the German Industrial and Trade Association (DIHT), who had advocated drastic social cuts, among other things. Klaus Murmann, president of the Federation of Employers' Associations, had taken up this demand and suggested cuts in the social benefits for welfare recipients who are able to work. In the television program, however, Kohl advocated that abuse and the "propagation" of social benefits "according to the pork barrel principle" be eliminated. Social benefits are reserved for those who are really poor, Kohl said. His proposal to introduce more part-time work must not be misunderstood as a panacea for the elimination of unemployment. The chancellor advocated that apprentices immediately get a part-time job after they have concluded their training if it is not possible to immediately employ them permanently. Kohl promised to reconsider the 20-percent investment allowance for enterprises owned by former GDR citizens. It is conceivable for him that this allowance will not be completely abolished, but it might be degressively shaped. The chancellor explicitly paid tribute to the attitude of the employers and trade unions when the latest collective negotiations were concluded. "In the past few weeks, we received very wise and reasonable collective agreements," he said. After an economic decline, there is "a tendency" toward an upswing. Moreover, he expects an increase in the gross national product that exceeds the forecast of 1.5 percent.
