FR940912-2-00029 FR940912-2-00026 Financial Assistance Award; United States Energy Association AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE), Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) (B) and (D) it intends to make a Non-Competitive Financial Assistance Award (Grant) through the Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center (PETC) to the United States Energy Association (USEA). The DOE's role shall be as co-sponsor along with the International Energy Agency (IEA). The purpose of the grant is for USEA to organize and conduct the conference on ``The Strategic Value of Fossil Fuels: Challenges and Responses,'' to be held in Houston, TX on May 2&hyph;4, 1995. The Conference will serve as a forum to evaluate problems facing the fossil energy community including energy security, environmental requirements, compliance strategies, R&D agendas, technology innovation and regulatory issues. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: U.S. Department of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, Acquisition and Assistance Center, P.O. Box 10940, MS 921&hyph;118, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Attn.: Mary Beth J. Pearse, Telephone: (412) 892&hyph;4949. Comments or inquires should be submitted within 14 days of the date of this announcement. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The estimated cost to organize and conduct the conference is $250,000. DOE's funding share will be $100,000. The objective of the grant (DE&hyph;FG22&hyph;94PC94024) is to evaluate fossil fuels and their responsiveness to changing economic, environmental, and institutional forces, and to develop awareness of emerging trends and strategies to respond to challenges that may be presented. The Conference will focus on the entire spectrum of fossil fuels from initial production and recovery to end-use. Non-competitive Financial Assistance is warranted based on USEA's exclusive capability to conduct the conference successfully. Furthermore, private sector funding will finance the majority of conference expenses. DOE funding on a non-competitive basis will enhance the public benefit to be derived from the conference. DOE knows of no other entity who is planning to conduct a similar conference. Dated: August 30, 1994. Richard D. Rogus, Contracting Officer.
