The first step was taken when the leadership of the New Democracy (ND) went from Konstandinos Mitsotakis to new man Miltiadhis Evert. While former ND luminary Andonis Samaras had already left the party to found his own Political Spring, it is too early to evaluate his initiative, which in the future may well be viewed as a "simple episode." Similarly, the change that took place in the Coalition of the Left for Progress with new leader N. Konstandopoulos, who claims to be a modernizer, may not have much effect on Greek political life given the party's small size, Zoulas contends. As a result, change is more noticeable in the two largest parties, he continues. In the ND, Evert initiated a new opposition policy no longer based on strident criticism at the risk of arousing his followers' ire, in the belief that similar tendencies are developing within the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). He also thinks that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will not be his opponent in the next elections, whether they take place as scheduled or in 1995 because of the Chamber of Deputies' inability to elect a new president. Evert's evaluation of the situation in PASOK stems from the "Simitis rebellion" and the "Pangalos movement," both indications that the Papandreou succession struggle is coming into the open, Zoulas writes. He quotes Minister of Industry and Commerce Kostas Simitis as making a "spectacular overture" for economic liberalization by referring to "the Scylla of statism and the Charybdis of the state's indifference." In addition, he cites Simitis as "unequivocally" condemning party choices of officials and hirings of public workers and indirectly blaming PASOK for the crisis in public administration. For his part, alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos implicitly criticized his party's economic policy and its lack of resolve in punishing tax evaders, whom he called "criminals." In Zoulas' view, both men have adopted a "modern political discourse devoid of ideological sloganeering." Above all, he remarks, both reject the strategy of "confrontation, divisions, and historical rivalry" that PASOK and Papandreou have used thus far as a "recipe for artificial polarization." It is obvious that Evert, Simitis, and Pangalos believe such methods are incompatible with the solutions to the country's problems and contrast with the modernizing course followed by all European Union (EU) member states, Zoulas concludes. Highlighting the bipolarization of Greek politics, an article in the 11 March Athens daily TA NEA lists the differences between the PASOK and ND internal structures. The article points out that the PASOK executive bureau has 10 members, all coming from the ranks of PASOK deputies, while the ND's executive committee has 17 members, 11 of whom are deputies and six come from the party. The PAS0K central committee has 141 members, 63 of them deputies and 78 nondeputies, while the ND central committee numbers 75 people, 25 of whom come from the party's parliamentary ranks and 50 from the party.
