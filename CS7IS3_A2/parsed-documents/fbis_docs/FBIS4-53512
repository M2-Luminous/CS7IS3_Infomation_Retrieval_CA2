The source welcomed the report, saying: "That is good news. They (the United States) have so far made so many unreasonable demands of us. Things must have changed a lot." But the source added: "As far as Japan is concerned, even if the United States eases (pressure on Japan), Japan should continue to push for domestic demand expansion, tax reform and deregulation." The source thus indicated the government would continue to make efforts to alleviate U.S. pressure on Japan.
