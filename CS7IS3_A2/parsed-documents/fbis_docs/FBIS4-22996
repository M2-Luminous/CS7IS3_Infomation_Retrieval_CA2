Yet speculations that nonenzymatic antioxidant protection whose action is directed at lowering the active oxygen form (AOF) is active in the blood plasma while enzymatic antioxidant protection is triggered under a deep oxidative stress where superoxide dismutase (SOD) is the key antioxidant protection enzyme prompted the development of a method of purifying superoxide dismutase from human blood plasma and carrying out a comparative analysis of the purified enzyme and Cu- and Zn-superoxide dismutase erythrocytes. To this end, superoxide dismutase was measured by Nishikimi's method with Fried's modifications, and the superoxide anion radical was generated in a system consisting of NADH, phenasinemetasulfate (FMF), and tetrazolium nitro blue. The experimental procedure is outlined. Superoxide dismutase was isolated by gel filtration on AsA-34 and AsA-44 ultrogels made by LKB (Sweden). The protein isolated from blood is classified as glycoprotein which is thermally stable up to a 75-85ï¿½ temperature; its molecular mass immediately after filtering was equal to about 147,000 D. A comparative analysis of the effect of some compounds capable of forming chelate complexes with metals contained in the active enzymes on the plasma and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity shows that the purified enzyme's properties differ from those of Cu- and Zn-superoxide dismutase and that the enzyme belongs to a new class of extracellular superoxide dismutase present in the organism's biological fluids. It is speculated that under a marked oxidative stress, superoxide dismutase plasma passes to an active state, making it possible to trigger the enzymatic protection mechanism and engage them in neutralizing active forms of oxygen.
