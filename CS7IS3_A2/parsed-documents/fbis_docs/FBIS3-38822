He spoke to our reporter, Quentin Dickinson: [Juppe] I would have liked the word ultimatum to figure in the communique, but so as not to be negative I would say that it is implied. It will be up to us in the North Atlantic Council to ensure that this resolution does not get bogged down and fade away. [Dickinson] Do you believe Dr. Karadzic's statements to be purely tactical? [Juppe] Well, we are used to so many statements, to so many meaningless cease-fires, that we cannot be satisfied with good intentions. It is true that Mr. Karadzic, probably realizing that the limits of horror were overstepped, is now speaking of demilitarizing Sarajevo. Well I tell him: You are on, do it. The best proof of his intentions would be to withdraw the heavy artillery around Sarajevo which is capable of shelling the city. If these artillery pieces are pulled back about 25 or 30 km, then what happened on Saturday in the Sarajevo market will no longer be possible. This would be far better proof of good intentions than a signature at the bottom of a document. So many signatures have proved worthless.
