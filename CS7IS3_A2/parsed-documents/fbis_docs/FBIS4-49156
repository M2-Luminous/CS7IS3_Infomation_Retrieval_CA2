Li Ruihuan, standing committee member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee; and Li Lanqing and Wei Jianxing, members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, attended today's celebration meeting. The celebration meeting started with the majestic strains of the national anthem. Zhang Dinghua, vice president and first secretary of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, presided over the celebration meeting. Wei Jianxing presented a report at the meeting, entitled: "The Working Class Should Be a Model in Promoting Reform and Development and Maintaining Stability." On behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council, he extended festival greetings and cordial regards to workers, peasants, intellectuals and other laboring people of all nationalities and to commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Armed Police and public security cadres and policemen who have heroically defended the motherland and protected the people and the socialist modernization drive. He also expressed his high respects to model workers and advanced collectives which have made outstanding contributions to reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization drive. Wei Jianxing said: Reform is the only way to make the country strong and make the people rich. It represents the interests and desire of the working class and people of all nationalities of the whole country and is the own demand of the working class. Only by carrying out reform, constantly liberating and developing the productive force, promoting economic construction, making all-round progress in society, and building China into a rich, powerful, democratic, and civilized country, can we continuously consolidate the position of the working class as the masters of the country and benefit the working class. The working class must consider reform as their own task, firmly support reform with perseverance despite difficulties, actively plunge themselves into the work of reform, and continuously push forward the reform work. The state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises are the pillar of the national economy. Only when we have successfully carried out reform in state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises can we fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system and establish a firmer material foundation for the working class and the broad masses of people to be the masters of the country. The working class should make its due contributions to deepening the reform of enterprises, accelerating the establishment of a modern enterprise system, and doing a good job in improving the state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises. Wei Jianxing emphasized: Both reform and development need a stable social and political environment. We have started a number of reform measures this year and taken a greater stride. The reforms, involving a wide range of activities, will inevitably touch some deep-rooted contradictions and encounter many unprecedentedly complex circumstances and problems. They will involve the readjustment of power and interest patterns. I hope that the working class will carry forward the fine tradition of taking the interests of the whole into account, proceed from the overall and long-term national interests, and make immediate, individual, and partial interests subordinate to long-term interests of the whole, so as to maintain social and political stability and ensure the smooth proceeding of reforms. Wei Jianxing pointed out: One of our party's consistent and fundamental guiding principles is to rely on the working class wholeheartedly. In order to deepen reform, promote development, and maintain stability, we should carry out this principle even more seriously. Any thought or deed which violates this principle is erroneous. He said: In order to rely on the working class wholeheartedly, we must fully respect the role of workers and staff members as the masters of their own affairs, protect their legitimate rights and interests, and arouse their enthusiasm and creativity. We should seriously study new circumstances and solve new problems during the course of implementing the principle, and enact adequate laws and regulations to ensure the implementation of the principle. Yang Xingfu, vice president of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, read to the meeting a "decision of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on launching among the workers and staff members across the country a campaign to learn from the `top ten outstanding workers and staff members of the country.'" Other speakers at the meeting included Bao Qifan, a representative of national model workers and deputy manager of Nanpu Harbor Affairs Company of Shanghai Harbor; Guo Linghua, a representative of national model workers and electric welder of Dalian Shipyard; and Feng Changgen, a representative of national model workers and professor of Beijing Science and Engineering University. The following leading comrades also attended the meeting: Ni Zhifu, Chen Muhua, Lei Jieqiong, Cheng Siyuan, Buhe, Peng Peiyun, Luo Gan, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and Wan Guoquan.
