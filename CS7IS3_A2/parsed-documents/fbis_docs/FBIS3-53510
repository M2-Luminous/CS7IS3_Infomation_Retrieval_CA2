In this regard, I believe that despite the great importance that President Clinton attaches to domestic affairs in his country, he has given special attention as a full partner and honest broker in order to help the parties achieve a comprehensive peace that concerns not only the people of the region, but all world nations. Today's meeting between me and President Clinton crowned a series of correspondences and telephone calls between us during the last year. I hope that our meeting today will contribute to achieving the aspirations of the region's peoples that this new year be a year for the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace that puts an end to the tragedies of violence and wars from which these peoples have been suffering for several decades. During our meeting, I had the opportunity to emphasize to President Clinton Syria's firm commitment to the bases and principles of the peace process and our strong faith that peace cannot be real and lasting unless it its comprehensive and based on the principles of international legitimacy and justice. This means serious work for a just solution on all tracks. Current and historical evidence proves that separate peace deals and partial solutions cannot secure a real peace in the region. In this regard, I would like to express my satisfaction that President Clinton is personally committed to the objective of a comprehensive peace. Accordingly, we agreed to work together in order to render successful the efforts aimed at putting an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict and reach a comprehensive and real peace that enables the region's peoples to concentrate on their development, progress, and prosperity. This meeting also gave us the opportunity to exchange views on a number of issues, including those related to bilateral relations, and we agreed that the noble objective we are working for together requires a qualitative step toward better relations. We also discussed issues related to the regional situation and all that would contribute to security and stability in the Middle East. Syria seeks a just and comprehensive peace with Israel as a strategic option that guarantees Arab rights, terminates the Israeli occupation, and enables all the region's peoples to live in peace, safety, and dignity. We fought honorably, negotiate honorably, and make peace honorably. We want an honorable peace for our people and for hundreds of thousands of those who sacrificed their lives in defense of the homeland and its rights. There is almost no house in Syria that has not lost a martyr in defense of the homeland, nation, and Arab rights. For the sake of all those and for the sake of their sons and families, we want the peace of the brave, a real peace that thrives, continues, guarantees the interests of all, and gives rights to their owners. If the leaders of Israel have enough courage to respond to such a peace, a new era of security and stability and normal peaceful relations among all will emerge in the region. Thank you. [applause] [Clinton] In pursuit of that priority I have always viewed Syria's involvement as critical. That is why from the outset of our administration, I have engaged President al-Asad in a regular correspondence by telephone and letter, and why I am now pleased to have had this opportunity to hear personally President al-Asad's views about how best to make this a year of [words indistinct] to produce real peace. The accord between Israel and the PLO marks a first step to lay the groundwork for a solution to the Palestinian problem. I have said that I believe Syria to be the key and that its role is critical for achieving a true and lasting peace between Israel and its neighbors. As you have heard, President al-Asad shares with me the goal of achieving a comprehensive peace with Israel and peaceful relations between the neighbors. Israel and Syria will have to make crucial decisions to achieve peace. Hence, al-Asad's call for a peace of the brave. You have heard him say that now, and I support this. Today we worked together to bring the peace talks that began in Madrid two years ago to a successful conclusion. There are important problems that need to be solved. There are problems related to withdrawal, peace, and security. We will try to solve the issues that are connected with peace, withdrawal, and security. But I am confident that we have laid the foundations for real progress. The heads of delegations will begin again talks in Washington next week. We also discussed the state of relations between the United States and Syria and agreed on the desirability of improving them. This requires honestly addressing the problems in our relationship. Accordingly, we have instructed the secretary of state and the Syrian foreign minister to establish a mechanism to address these issues in detail and openly. For too long, the Middle East has been denied the benefits of peace, and yet it is within our power to create the conditions that will enable Israeli and Arab -- Muslim, Christian, and Jew -- to live together in peace. Today's meeting was an important step for fulfilling that vision. We have a lot of work to do, but we are closer to our goal. Thank you. [applause] [Reporter, in English] Mr. President: Do you feel that you have a firm commitment from President al-Asad to normalize relations with Israel, and by that I mean open borders, free trade, and diplomatic relations? [Clinton] The short answer is yes. I believe that President al-Asad has made a clear, forthright and very important statement on normal, peaceful relations now. In order to achieve those relations, a peace agreement has to be negotiated in good faith and carried out. But this is an important statement, the first time that there has been a clear expression that there will be a possibility of that sort of relationship. [Reporter, in Arabic] Mr. President: All the separate agreements have proved a failure, the most notable examples being the 17 May agreement in Lebanon and the Gaza-Jericho accord. UN resolutions on Iraq have been applied firmly. To date, Resolution 425 on Lebanon remains unenforced. When will we see a commitment to UN Resolutions, including 425? [Clinton] First of all, as to the specifics of the implementation, that will be part of the process of negotiation. But let me answer the first, and more important question, I think. I think all the parties in this process recognize that it cannot succeed unless all the tracks are brought to a successful conclusion. That is, I think President al-Asad was very eloquent in our meeting today about the question of Lebanon, and Jordan, for that matter, in saying that even Syria may feel fully satisfied with its differences with Israel if they could be worked out, there would still have to be a comprehensive peace in which the issues affecting Lebanon, the issues affecting Jordan, and the issues relating to the PLO would, in addition to the Syrian issues, would all be resolved. We are all committed to that. [Reporter, in English] Mr. al-Asad. President Clinton is the fifth, the fourth American President you're meeting now. Do you think you can afford to wait for a fifth one or have you decided to sign the peace now? [Al-Asad] Yes. We are ready to sign peace now. [Reporter, in English] President Clinton. Beyond the broad assurances that you and President al-Asad have spoken of here about the willingness to seek peace and to negotiate it. Do you have, Sir, as a result of these meetings, any of the kinds of specific detailed concessions or a sense of willingness to make concessions that might make a successful negotiation possible? And if so, can you tell us in what areas they are? [Clinton] Well, as you know, I have a very strong conviction that the specifics of this agreement will have to be negotiated by the parties themselves. And even though I have in mind several things, I think that it is very important that those of us who are trying to facilitate these discussions not discuss the details of them. The parties are going to have to work that out. Let me say that an indication has been given here by the very important statement that President al-Asad has already made, stating clearly that it is time to end the conflict with Israel, make peace with Israel, that peace can be, should lead to normal and peaceful relations. I would hope that this would provoke a positive response in Israel and that the parties would get together and work these details out. That is not for the United States to dictate. [Reporter, in Arabic] President Clinton. Despite the peace talks since the Madrid conference, Israel continues to build settlements in the occupied Arab territories which, according to all international standards, are considered illegitimate and a violation of UN resolutions. Moreover, at a time when Syria signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has demanded over the years that the Middle East be a region free of weapons of mass destruction--nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons--Israel still refuses to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and continues to stockpile weapons. Mr. President, do you not think that these Israeli stands and practices contradict the concept of peace for which you are working? Thank you. [Clinton] First, sir, I believe the question of settlements in disputed areas is one of the things that clearly will have to be resolved in connection with this peace process consistent with United Nations resolutions and the concept of territory for peace. I said that in my opening statement. I expect that to work, to be worked through. Secondly, on the question of weapons, I believe the best chance we have to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction, that includes not only nuclear but also biological and chemical weapons, and indeed to slow the sophisticated conventional arms race in the Middle East is to finish this peace process successfully. I think that is, as a practical matter, the only way to do it. And we're going to, the United States will work as hard as we can toward that objective. [Reporter, in English] President al-Asad: Are you clearly stating unequivocally today that in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, Syria would be prepared to establish normal diplomatic relations with Israel, including open borders, including tourism, the same kind of peace treaty that Israel established with Egypt? [Al-Asad] All of us, foremost the United States and President Clinton, are trying to make peace comprehensive in order to make it lasting and just. Within this framework, we are trying to achieve a real peace that will secure rights for everyone and secure a stable life for everyone. In such a solution, all the region's peoples, as well as all the world's nations, have an interest. President Clinton and I were in agreement regarding our views. We will respond to peace requirements. This matter, as you know, is a subject to be tackled at the negotiating table, not during this conference. [Reporter, in Arabic] This question is posed to President Clinton: The United States has proposed itself as a full partner and an honest broker. Syria welcomed this and cooperated with this for the sake of a peace process that is of concern to the entire world. Despite this, the United States still deals with Syria in a way which is different from the way it deals with Israel, particularly in the field of financial and military aid. What is your explanation of this? Thank you. [Clinton] [words indistinct] ... with Syria over a number of issues, including our differences over questions relating to certain groups, PKK [Kurdish Workers Party], Hizballah, the Jibril group [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command], others, other issues. We talked about these differences for about an hour today without any view toward trying to resolve them. We agreed on two things, and I think this is very important. One is that if we can maintain one another's confidence working toward a peaceful solution in the Middle East, that that would do a great deal for our bilateral relations and for a better future. And the second is that we needed to have a process that had integrity, established by the secretary of state and the Syrian foreign minister. That would go beyond public exchanges to a very specific delineation of the differences between us and an honest effort to resolve them or to make progress on them. So, sir, I think the best answer to your question is that we think that the progress perhaps can be made. We've set up a mechanism to deal honestly with the differences between us, and we believe maintaining each other's confidence by a good-faith effort in the Middle East peace process is the most important thing we can do at this moment in our history. [Reporter, in English] Mr. President: If the subject is so close to your heart, but you evaded answering whether you thought that Israel could sign a Non-Proliferation Treaty, my real question is: Did you discuss and set a timetable for Israeli and Syrian troops to come out of Lebanon? [Clinton] We did not have any discussions today about the details of any face of the Middle East peace process because the other parties are not here present, and it would not have been an appropriate thing to do. [Reporter, in Arabic] [words indistinct] [Clinton, interrupting] Excuse me, I got one of those helpful little hands from one of my staff members down here. I apologize to interrupt you. I want to be perfectly forthright because I don't want to leave a false impression that might be adversely interpreted against President al-Asad. We did discuss the importance of having the Lebanese peace process go on parallel to the Israeli-Syrian process. I reaffirm my support for the al-Ta'if accord, and President al-Asad agrees that there should be a successful conclusion of a peace process which left Lebanon free and independent as a nation. So, there was no difference between us on the objective. And I didn't want anything I said to be read unfairly against him on that score. We actually, I think, reached complete meeting of the mind. [Reporter, in English] In my interview with you, on 13 September at the White House, you called for a bigger Syrian role in the peace process, and you called personally on His Excellency President al-Asad to play a personal role in forging ahead a breakthrough in the peace process. Now that you've met President al-Asad face to face for the first time, what is your impression about President al-Asad? And how do you view his personal role in achieving that breakthrough? [Clinton] Well, first of all, you know I had heard a lot about President al-Asad's legendary stamina in these meetings. [laughter] And when we called a break four hours and 20 minutes into our meeting, I can tell you that his reputation does not exceed the reality. He deserves every bit of it. Secondly, we had the opportunity, because we did talk for so long, we had the opportunity to exchange not only our views about the issues in play at present but also I had the opportunity to learn President al-Asad's perspective over a period exceeding 20 years now on some of these issues. And it reinforced my belief, as expressed in September, that there would be no comprehensive peace in the Middle East unless he were willing to take a leadership role, and that he has decided to take the risks that all these leaders, if they really want peace, are going to have to take. And so, I guess, I would have to say that that is the most important thing to me. The thing that was most impressive, I believe, that he is committed to trying to work through this as quickly as possible, and I think others will see that commitment and will respond in an appropriate way. [Reporter, in Arabic] President Clinton, if peace is an international need, and the U.S. Administration is seriously seeking to achieve it, providing that it is also a U.S., Israeli, and Syrian need, then why does the peace process stumble every now and then? How will the U.S. Administration, taking into consideration that it is the most important cosponsor, tackle the obstacles that might emerge on the road in the future? Thank you. [Clinton] Of course, it stumbles every now and then because it's difficult to do. If it were easy to do, it would have been done before. The parties have been at odds with each other for a long time, there was a lot of mistrust to overcome, there are a lot of details to be worked out. And, I think whenever there is any ambiguity at all, or uncertainty, then that is likely to lead to other problems down the road. So, there are lots of reasons why it happens. What the United States is trying to do is to take advantage of what I think is an appropriate moment in history, where you have leaders committed to getting this done--leaders who understand that the interests of their people will be served over the long run by comprehensive peace. And so what we can do, I think, is to try to keep the process going, keep the trust level up among the parties, try to be an honest broker and work through the problems, and when these difficulties do arise, as they have as you implied in the aftermath of the PLO-Israel accord, to try to help and work through them as quickly as possible and get things back on track. [Reporter, in English] Thank you. [Clinton] Thank you very much.
