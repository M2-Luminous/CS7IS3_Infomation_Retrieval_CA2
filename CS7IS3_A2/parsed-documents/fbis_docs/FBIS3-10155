This split was a result of Guzman's letters calling for "a peace accord" to end the "fratricidal war." The "II Party Congress," which will be held in March somewhere in Lima, will debate the proposals made by the opposing factions. The possibility of giving up violence in the near future, however, is discarded. One of the factions is the "Right-Wing Opportunist Line (LOD) [Linea Oportunista de Derecha]" or "Revisionist" faction, which is comprised of individuals who support the SL top leader and agree with his decision. Edmundo Cox Beuzeville, Nelly Evans Risco de Alvarez Calderon, and Osman Morote Barrionuevo, aka "Remigio" -- who are some of the subversive group's best-known members -- also are part of this faction. By adopting this position, they seek to avoid an inexorable defeat. Before this occurs, they believe they must abandon their principles to preserve the movement. The other faction is the "Left-Wing Liquidationist Line (LLI) [Linea Liquidacionista de Izquierda]," the members of which are known as "Perfidios." This faction is comprised of the so-called "Recalcitrantes," who do not support or agree with the "peace accord." They thus ignore the obedience and subordination vows they made to "Presidente Gonzalo." According to documents seized and recent SL "Central Committee" re-transmissions, as well as testimony by captured terrorists, the SL "hard" line on 7 February started the "second offensive" of the "second campaign." The escalation of violence began with an attack against the Peruvian Air Force's central barracks on 28 de Julio Avenue on that day. This faction is supported by Catalina Adrianzen S., wife of SL ideologist Antonio Diaz Martinez; and SL leaders Alberto Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano;" Margie Clavo Peralta; and Isabel Rengifo Saavedra; among others. Other terrorists who also support this faction are: Laura Zambrano Padilla, aka "Meche;" Martha Huatay Ruiz, aka "Rosa;" and Teresa Durand Araujo (Osman Morote Barrionuevo's wife); among others. Many of the criminals being held at the Chorrillos women's jail also belong to the "Recalcitrantes" faction. The same is true of a few criminals held at "Miguel Castro Castro" jail in Canto Grande. The "hardness" of the "Perfidios" in these two jails has not changed as a result of visits made to them in the last few months by high-ranking SL leaders such as Elena Iparraguirre Revoredo, aka "Miriam," or Abimael Guzman Reynoso. Guzman's Message Found Peruvian National Police [PNP] sources reported the discovery of a message Guzman handed to Martha Huatay Ruiz, aka "Rosa," when she visited him at the Navy prison in Callao Port. Huatay hid the message in her genitals and handed it to a relative who visited her at the "Yanamayo" jail in Puno. This relative was finally arrested by the PNP. The message, which was written on a small piece of paper, said among other things: "My arrest is a turn in the path. Join the masses; the people will win." This report has not been confirmed or denied by the PNP. It shows, nonetheless, the way Guzman is using the government officials who have been trying to end the violence that has been reigning in the country for the last 13 years.
