On Saturday, Armenian forces supported by 15 tanks tried to launch an offensive some 15 km north of the Sarsan water reservoir but were contained by Azeri troops. However, there was further fighting there on Sunday. The source said the Armenians lost two tanks and one artillery piece in Saturday's battle close to the towns Geranboy and Ter-Ter. However, nearby Azeri villages came under heavy artillery fire from Armenian forces on Sunday morning. Last night, a number of Azeri villages in the Belagan region were brought under rocket fire by Armenian units. But no word is given of casualty or destruction. President Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan on Saturday issued a decree to award a large group of officers and men for "successful defense operations," the defense ministry said.
