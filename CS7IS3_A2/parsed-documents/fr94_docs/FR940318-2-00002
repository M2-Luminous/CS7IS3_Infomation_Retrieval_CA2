FR940318-2-00002 FR940318-2-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Food Safety and Inspection Service [Docket No. 94&hyph;007N] Membership on the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods; Nominations Notice is hereby given of the Department's intent to solicit nominations for membership on the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods. This Committee was established in April 1988, as a result of a recommendation in the 1985 report of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee on Food Protection, Subcommittee on Microbiological Criteria, titled ``An Evaluation of the Role of Microbiological Criteria for Foods.'' The Committee provides advice and recommendations to the Secretaries of Agriculture and Health and Human Services concerning the development of microbiological criteria by which the safety and wholesomeness of food can be assessed, including criteria for microorganisms that indicate whether food has been processed using good manufacturing processes. Nominations for membership are being sought from individuals with scientific expertise in epidemiology, food science, microbiology, packaging, pathology, public health, toxicology, and other relevant disciplines. Appointment(s) to the Committee will be made by the Secretary of Agriculture after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Nominees will be considered without discrimination for any reason such as race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or marital status. Because of the complexity of the issues to be addressed, it is anticipated that the full Committee will meet semi-annually and subcommittees will meet as deemed necessary. Interested persons are invited to submit a typed resume to The Office of the Administrator, Food Safety and Inspection Service, room 2151, South Agriculture Building, 14th and Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250. Nominations for membership must be postmarked no later than March 31, 1994. For additional information please contact Mr. Craig Fedchock at the above address, or by telephone on (202) 720&hyph;9150. Done at Washington, DC, on: March 7, 1994. Terry L. Medley, Acting Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6321 Filed 3&hyph;17&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;DM&hyph;M
