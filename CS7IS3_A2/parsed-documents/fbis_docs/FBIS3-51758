In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Contino noted that the UJC has 550,000 members in its rank and file from a population of some 3.1 million youths, and this year it seeks to recruit over 600,000 new members. Contino said that even amid the difficult economic situation the country is facing, there is an undeniable tendency for the UJC membership to grow, which continues to be a selective and leading organization and continues to strengthen its mass-drawing power. Contino explained that currently the UJC seeks to reach such sectors as the farmers and services (particularly restaurants and community) due to the significance of their labor in the present situation. Contino stated that people who say that "youths are no good" undoubtedly have a very limited view while he recalled that there are over 40,000 youths linked to sugar cane harvest activities, even under inadequate conditions. Contino added that over 167,000 high school and university students volunteered to work the land for 15 days at the end of the past academic year, and another 100,000 volunteered to do the same throughout 1993. It should also be taken into account that 60 percent of Cuban scientists are among the Cuban youth as well as 70 percent of workers in the tourism sector, which is second in generating convertible foreign exchange for the country. Regarding workers in the tourism sector, Contino spoke highly of their initiative in the western Province of Matanzas, where workers donated some of the tips received to buy provisions for the young cane cutters who had volunteered for the sugar harvest. He considered particularly impressive the response to the victory caravan. The victory caravan was organized by the UJC to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the Rebel Army's entry into Havana, and as Contino stressed, it conveyed a massive, spontaneous, and voluntary support for the revolution. However, Contino, who is also a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC], conceded that there are places where little confidence is placed on youths because of their alleged lack of experience. Contino said that youths should be given room not because of their age, but because of the capacity they show. He pointed out that the UJC pays greater attention to two age groups: teenagers and young people between 25 and 30 years. He indicated that in these two cases, the UJC tries to adapt work methods to achieve a more effective approach. The UJC was established on 4 April 1961 as a leading youth organization, intended to train the future members of the ruling PCC.
