Pakistan was not interested in a gradualist approach favoured by India that sought to focus attention on what are issues more amenable to a solution, such as Siachen and Waller barrage, etc. The contention here could well be that such an approach is an unaffordable luxury given the high level of on-going repression in the Kashmir valley by Indian forces numbering over half a million. A concession in the context of Siachen, for instance, could easily be used as a ploy by India to reassure interational opinion while seeking to consolidate its hold on Kashmir through brutal force. The talks have failed to register progress but Pakistan has shown some flexibility by choosing not to rule out completely the option of continuing to use the mode of bilateral dialogue for finding a solution to the issue. It has, however, introduced a note of firmness by linking the posssibility of holding another round of bilateral negotiations with India to visible and concrete improvement of conditions on the ground, such as a reduction in Indian troop strength in the Valley, release of the large number of Kashmiri leaders jailed by India, etc. It is unfortunate that India has held on to its rigid position on Kashmir thereby reducing virtually to nought the effect of its earlier more accommodative stance illustrated by agreeing to place Kashmir as a separate item on the agenda of Pak-India talks. This, in turn, left Pakistan with no option but to stick closely to the previously stated position on Kashmir and other related issues. As for the criticism emanating from opposition quarters to the effect that Pakistan would have been better off not acceding to India's request to withdraw the proposed resolution it was to present before the UN General Assembly condemning it for gross violation of human rights in Kashmir, it appears motivated once again by a desire to score points, notwithstanding the sensitive nature of the issue. Quite apart from the fact that Pakistan has reserved its right to take up the matter at the United Nations at any time it deems appropriate, it must be kept in mind that the proposed resolution on human rights violations in Kashmir being passed in the General Assembly would not, in any way, have been binding on India. The idea was to bring the issue into focus and make that country a subject of moral censure by the international community. It can certainly be argued that in following the path that Pakistan has, international attention has, indeed, been focused on Kashmir and India has been shown up as not being entirely sincere in its desire to find a solution to the Kashmir issue. While India has thereby been put on the defensive, Pakistan is in a position to say to the international community, including the Security Council members, that it had bent backwards to accommodate India and if the talks have not yielded positive results, it should be clear where the fault lies.
