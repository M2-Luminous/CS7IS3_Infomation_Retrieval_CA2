[Colonel Jose Antonio Gallego, chief of the Narcotics Division] "I personally and professionally respect all observations made by the prosecutor general, but I cannot share that statement because it is very obvious that following the death of Gonzalo Rodiguez Gacha and Pablo Escobar, drug trafficking in Colombia was completely reduced to zero by the national government." As for the increase in the amount of cultivated areas: [Gallego] "That is not completely true because, as regards coca plantations, we have seen an increase since last year that is not more than 5 or 7 percent. The same is not true for marijuana or poppy plantations." As for the small number of drug and money confiscations: [Gallego] "We can say that we have confiscated plenty of drugs of different types in the country." As for the small number of drug traffickers in jail: [Gallego] "The National Police, alone, in the first four months of 1994, have arrested 450 Colombians and 42 foreigners involved in the trafficking of drugs." As for the increase in drug consumption: [Gallego] "An increase in consumption is relative. If it is indeed happening, it should not be in significant numbers because indicators show that at this time there is less availability of the substance than in previous years."
