Without Russia"] [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze has been faced with the temptation to agree to a new option prepared deep inside the U.S. Department of State for establishing peace in Abkhazia. In Washington it will be suggested to the Georgian president that he agree to UN "blue helmets" being sent in without the participation of Russian troops. On Monday Bill Clinton is expected to reveal to the guest from Tbilisi a U.S.-style plan for settling the Abkhaz conflict. The essence of this plan is to restrict Russia's opportunities for influencing the situation in the region. Its 2,000-strong contingent is to pull back beyond the Psou River, which forms the Russian-Georgian border. UN forces will take up positions along the Ingury River, forming a security zone between Georgians and Abkhazians. The United States is also promising to increase financial aid to Tbilisi considerably. If this is so, the situation around Abkhazia is changing radically. Until now the sides involved in the conflict have relied little on the United Nations and put their trust mainly in Russia's good will. With one voice they entreated Boris Yeltsin to hurry up and send in troops -- which would have created conditions not only for a cease-fire but also for the return of 300,000 refugees. Moscow, which recently signed a treaty with Tbilisi, proceeded from the premise that it remains the most real force capable of instilling order in this part of the Caucasus. Yeltsin made military aid for Georgia dependent on progress toward a political settlement. At the same time it has become obvious that Russia is biding its time, seeking greater tractability from Tbilisi and Sukhumi and waiting for the Security Council to invite it to play the leading part in the UN orchestra. The United Nations is in no hurry either, realizing that Russia itself will not dare to assume the role of sole peacemaker. A cooling in Russian-U.S. relations has been sensed in recent days. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that in this situation Washington can be expected to take surprise actions aimed at putting Russia in its place.
