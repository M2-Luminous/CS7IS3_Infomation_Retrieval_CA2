Regarding the participation of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the largest ruling party, in the coalition government, 31 percent of respondents said: "Its participation is desirable"; 24 percent said: "It is better for the SDPJ not to participate"; and 44 percent said: "It is hard to say." It was a shock to the SDPJ that an accord was reached on opening Japan's rice market at the Uruguay Round talks. The party has become divided on the passage of the political reform bills, and it has been questioned as to whether the party should remain in the coalition. Moreover, the party will be asked to undergo a "test for loyalty" in dealing with the issue of raising the consumption tax rate. However, the number of respondents favoring "the SDPJ's participation in the coalition" exceeds that of respondents opposing it. And yet, when a poll was held immediately following the coalition government's inauguration last August, 44 percent of respondents favored its participation while 11 percent opposed it. Therefore, when these results are compared with those of the current poll, the number of those who favor the participation has dropped by a large margin while that of those who oppose it has increased. A large number of those who support various ruling coalition parties favor the SDPJ's participation in the coalition. In particular, 59 percent of those who support the SDPJ favors its participation while only 16 percent favors its secession from the coalition. On the other hand, 23 percent of those who support the Liberal Democratic Party favors the SDPJ's participation while 37 percent opposes it. As for Japan Communist Party supporters, 26 percent favors its participation and 57 percent opposes it. Of those who support the Hosokawa cabinet, 36 percent favors its participation while 22 percent is against it. Of those who answered that it is "desirable" to have the passage of the political reform bills, 34 percent supports its participation while 24 percent does not. As for those who answered it was "undesirable," 24 percent supports its participation while 29 percent is opposed. This survey was conducted by phone on 30 January to obtain answers from 1,000 eligible voters throughout the country. With regard to this survey's results, SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said: "It reflects that the party has been forced to make an agonized choice." However, he also stated: "We are not trying to adversely influence the administration, but we must have our party's view reflected in the administration's policy."
