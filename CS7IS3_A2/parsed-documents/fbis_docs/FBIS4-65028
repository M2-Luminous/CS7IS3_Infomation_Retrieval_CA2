The commanding officers of the military forces met and assessed the situation in the General Staff headquarters yesterday. Considering Gen. Gures' determined opposition to the extension of his term of office, the military forces are convinced that Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi will be appointed the new chief of the General Staff.

Ismail Hakki Karadayi, commander of the Grand Forces; Admiral Vural Bayazit, commander of the Naval Forces; Gen. Halis Burhan, commander of the Air Force; Gen. Aydin Ilter, general commander of the Gendarmerie Forces; and Gen. Ahmet Corekci, deputy chief of the General Staff, met at 1600 and conferred for nearly one and a half hours. Sources close to the General Staff have said that Gen. Gures reiterated that his term of office will end on 30 August. The same sources said that they discussed a way to surmount the obstacle President Demirel has created against the extension of the services of the commanders of the Air Force and the Naval Forces. The term of office of the two commanders will end in 1994.
