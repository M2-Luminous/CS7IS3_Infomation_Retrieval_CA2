FR940907-0-00050 FR940907-0-00018 Amendatory Text Part 24 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: PART 24_PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES 1. The authority citation in Part 24 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 47 U.S.C. 154, 301, 302, 303, 309, and 332, unless otherwise noted. 2. Section 24.101 is revised to read as follows: §24.101 Multiple ownership restrictions. (a) Narrowband PCS licensees shall not have an ownership interest in more than three of the 26 channels listed in Section 24.129 in any geographic area. For the purpose of this restriction, a narrowband PCS licensee is any person or entity with an ownership interest of five or more percent in a narrowband PCS license. (b) In cases where a party applies for a license after August 16, 1994 or has a license transferred to it after that date, and the party has indirect ownership, through an interest in an intervening entity (or entities) that has ownership in the narrowband PCS license, that indirect ownership shall be attributable if the percentages of ownership at each level, multiplied together, equal five or more percent ownership of the narrowband PCS license, except that if the ownership percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 percent interest. Example: Party X has a non-controlling ownership interest of 25 percent in Company Y, which in turn has a non-controlling ownership interest of 10 percent in Company Z, the narrowband PCS licensee. Party X's effective ownership interest in Company Z is Party X's ownership interest in Company Y (25 percent) times Company Y's ownership interest in Company Z (10 percent). Therefore, Party X's effective ownership interest in Company Z is 2.5 percent, and is not attributable. 3. Section 24.102 is amended by revising paragraph (d) to read as follows: §24.102 Service areas. * * * * * (d) The BTA service areas are based on the Rand McNally 1992 Commercial Atlas & Marketing Guide, 123rd Edition, at pages 38&hyph;39, with the following additions licensed separately as BTA-like areas: American Samoa; Guam; Northern Mariana Islands; Mayagüez/Aguadilla-Ponce, Puerto Rico; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and the United States Virgin Islands. The Mayagüez/Aguadilla-Ponce BTA-like service area consists of the following municipios: Adjuntas, Aguada, Aguadilla, Añasco, Arroyo, Cabo Rojo, Coamo, Guánica, Guayama, Guayanilla, Hormigueros, Isabela, Jayuya, Juana Díaz, Lajas, Las Marías, Maricao, Maunabo, Mayagüez, Moca, Patillas, Peñuelas, Ponce, Quebradillas, Rincón, Sabana Grande, Salinas, San Germán, Santa Isabel, Villalba, and Yauco. The San Juan BTA-like service area consists of all other municipios in Puerto Rico. 4. Paragraph (a) of Section 24.130 is revised to read as follows: §24.130 Paging response channels. (a) The channels listed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are available to licensees of conventional one-way paging base stations licensed pursuant to Part 22 or Part 90 of this chapter as of the application filing deadline for the paging response channels. Eligibility for response channels shall be based on the authorized service area of each existing paging licensee. This service area is defined as the area within a 32.2 kilometer radius of the licensee's base stations or, in the case of ``F,'' ``G,'' ``H,'' or ``K'' class stations under Sections 22.502(c) and 90.495(b)(1) of this chapter, as the area that is within the service area radius specified in Section 22.504(b)(2) of this chapter. Existing paging licensees are eligible to bid for any response channel in any BTA or MTA which encompasses an authorized base station or which is partly or wholly overlapped by a licensee's service area. These channels shall be used only in paired communications with existing paging channels to provide mobile-to-base station communications. Until two years after the date of initial license grant, eligible paging licensees are limited to a maximum of two response channels within the same geographic area. Licenses for paging response channels are not counted toward the multiple ownership restrictions of Section 24.101. * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21844 Filed 9&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;01&hyph;M
