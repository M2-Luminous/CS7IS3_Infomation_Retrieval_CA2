The meeting was designed to promote a huge deal to export gas from Qatar to Israel and Europe. The future of the deal remains unclear. Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik is in the Tel Aviv studio with further details: Shim'on Peres arrived in London from Oslo this morning, Moshe Shahal flew from Israel. They apparently met at the Hilton Park Lane Hotel in central London and from there set out for a meeting with the Qatari foreign minister and several of his advisers. The reason for their meeting: a gigantic transaction worth over $1 billion. Qatar has natural gas which it is considering shipping in containers through the Red Sea to a special port which may or may not be constructed in Elat. From there the gas will travel through pipelines at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea to Europe. The economic viability of all this, at least as far as Israel is concerned, is extremely doubtful. Natural gas can also be purchased from Egypt. The discussions in London were not about the deal itself, but only about the possibility of conducting feasibility studies to decide whether or not doing it is economically worthwhile. Energy Minister Moshe Shahal has recently held a series of meetings on this matter, both within Israel and abroad. Shim'on Peres entered the picture because this deal may constitute, among other things, the first practical fruit of the peace process. But, to an even greater extent, Peres is getting involved with the aim of using this deal as a first-ever lever to promote further initiatives between Israel and the Arab world.
