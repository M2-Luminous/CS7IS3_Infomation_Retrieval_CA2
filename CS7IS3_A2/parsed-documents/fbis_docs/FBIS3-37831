Ames, 52, a CIA employee for more than 31 years, and his wife, Maria del Rosario Casas Ames, 41, a Colombian-born naturalised U.S. citizen, were arrested on Monday during an operation carried out jointly by CIA and FBI agents. According to the Department of Justice, the Ames couple have been spying against the U.S. since 1985 and received more than 1.5 million U.S. dollars in payoff money and deposited the money on accounts in U.S. and foreign banks. "It is a very serious case," President Bill Clinton told journalists in the White House on Tuesday. When asked whether the cold war is over or not, Mr Clinton declined comment, pointing out that the matter would be tackled in the coming days. White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said at a briefing on the same day that an Ames case probe had been launched ten months before and that the president had been kept informed of it from the very outset. Ms Myers said the president instructed the Department of State to lodge an official protest with the government of Russia. Secretary of State Warren Christopher summoned charge d'affaires ad interim of Russia while U.S. Ambassador in Russia Thomas Pickering had a meeting with senior Russian officials. The White House press secretary said National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and CIA Director James Woolsey had been ordered to lead a "coordinated examination of the national security implications of this case". "We take this very seriously. We do not like it one bit," Myers told reporters. "We are having very serious, very forthright discussions with the Russians, both in Washington and Moscow, about this incident... I think in terms of future relationship, we are having those conversations now and we shall just let those take place and see what goes", Ms Myers said.
