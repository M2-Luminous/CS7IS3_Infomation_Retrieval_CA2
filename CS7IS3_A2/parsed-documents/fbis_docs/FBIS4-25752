During a meeting with a Chinese trade official here, Sutherland said that "positive" and "constructive" changes have taken place in the negotiations on the re-entry and the momentum should be kept. The 112-member GATT will be part of the World Trade Organization (WTO) after the agreement on the Uruguay Round trade talks takes effect in early 1995. All the GATT members will certainly be WTO members while those who are not in GATT before the date when WTO is set up will have to apply for WTO membership. In his meeting with Long Yongtu, head of the Chinese delegation to negotiations with the European Union (EU) and the United States, Sutherland expressed his hope that all the sides show biggest flexibility, stressing that there should be further progress in talks on services. The meeting took place after the Chinese delegation finished a round of talks with the U.S. and the EU on the resumption of China's status in GATT. Long, also an assistant to Chinese Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi, briefed the GATT chief on Sino-U.S. and Sino-EU negotiations.
