The British Hong Kong Government, in the "White Paper on the Draft Regulations on the New Airport Corporation" it publicized on 3 January, proposes that the current provisional airport administrative office be reorganized to become a commercial corporation. Because of this, during its third meeting, the Economic Subcommittee under the PWC of the HKSAR Preparatory Committee requested the British Hong Kong authorities to send an official to the PWC to explain the draft regulations on the new airport in Hong Kong. But the British Hong Kong Government openly rejected the request. Chen-Fang Ansheng, chief secretary of the Hong Kong Government, said that there is "no need" for the Hong Kong Government to send anyone to Beijing to explain to the PWC the draft regulations because "the available channels are sufficient." In this connection, Zhang Junsheng indicated that because the issue of the new airport in Hong Kong is a matter that will extend beyond 1997, it should be properly settled by China and Britain through consultations. He said that the PWC has the responsibility to study matters relevant to Hong Kong's smooth transition and that its invitation to Hong Kong Government officials to explain the draft regulations is something that they should do because it is for the sake of Hong Kong's smooth transition. He reiterated that the Chinese Government sincerely hopes to cooperate with the British Hong Kong Government.
