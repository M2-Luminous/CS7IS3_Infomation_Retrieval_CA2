I think the meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin which has just taken place has set a clear-cut friendly tone in relations and cooperation between Russia and Italy," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyev said today at his meeting with Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Beniamino Andreatta. Kozyrev greeted the Italian minister also as a representative of the Group of Seven industrialised countries and president of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Kozyrev stressed that time was ripe for turning the seven into eight, at least in the political sphere. "It is difficult to imagine a situation where any important political problems could be now resolved without Russia's participation," Kozyrev said.
