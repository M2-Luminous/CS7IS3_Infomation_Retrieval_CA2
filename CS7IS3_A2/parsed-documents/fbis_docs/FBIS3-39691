Kohl did not cite one specific instrument to reform the social state, safeguard Germany as an economic location, and combat the dramatic unemployment. "This chancellor lacks the strength for the sober and honest determination of his position," Verheugen said in a statement. The optimism demonstrably expressed by Kohl and his party cannot cover up the CDU's glaring inability to master the challenges of the future. "It is already clear that the congress will not lead to improving the people's dramatic loss of trust in the largest government party," Verheugen said.
