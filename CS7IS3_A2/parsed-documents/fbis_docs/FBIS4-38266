['Abdallah] I believe the discussions over the past days have made substantial progress in the effort to raise funds and turn pledges into payments so that the Palestinian authority will be able to function normally. [Mu'addi] Has an agreement been reached on the mechanism of disbursing aid for the self-rule administration? ['Abdallah] The mechanisms were already agreed on. There is the mechanism of direct payment for the PLO and the mechanism of payment through the Johan Holst peace fund. [Mu'addi] What are the demands or reservations that U.S. and World Bank officials made regarding the disbursement of financial aid for the Palestinians? ['Abdallah] There is nothing new in this regard. The Palestinian side has been criticized for the delay in activating financial and tax collecting offices. [Mu'addi] Then what are the obstacles hampering the immediate disbursement of aid to the Palestinians? ['Abdallah] Aid disbursement has already started. I do not believe that there will be a problem. The problem is that the aid is still less than the needs. Up to this moment, a major portion of the deficit in the Palestinian budget is still uncovered. The other side of the problem is that the payments must be made on time so that the Palestinian authority will not face a liquidity problem. [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir 'Abdallah, does the date of Yasir 'Arafat's arrival depend on the disbursement of financial aid for the Palestinians? ['Abdallah] In fact, I have no accurate information about this issue. However, it is known that for the Palestinian authority to be able to perform its duties, the required funds must be made available and paid on time. This problem is being resolved. The next few weeks will witness activities that will resolve this problem? [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir 'Abdallah in Washington, thank you very much. ['Abdallah] Not at all.
