The UN chief made the appeal in a meeting with French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur here today. French President Francois Mitterrand and Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe have recently been considering the withdrawal of the 6,000 troops France has stationed in Bosnia. The United Nations has deployed some 45,000 soldiers in the former Yugoslavia, 14,000 of whom are in Bosnia. Butrus-Ghali also expressed the hope that the 11 French volunteers who have been detained by the Bosnian Serbs on charges of smuggling weapons for the Bosnian army will be freed as soon as possible through negotiations. Balladur said today that the French government wants the volunteers to be released unconditionally. Butrus-Ghali intends to discuss the issue with his chief advisers on Thursday and with the "group of contact" composed of the foreign ministers of the U.S., France, Britain and Russia in Geneva on Friday in an effort to find a political solution to the Bosnian conflict.
