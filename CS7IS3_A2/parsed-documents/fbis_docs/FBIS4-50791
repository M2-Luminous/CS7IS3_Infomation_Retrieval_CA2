Nevertheless, when Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, arrived at the Brynar Pharmaceutical Research Center, affiliated with Belgium's Chemistry Union, the sun suddenly broke through the clouds, coloring the green earth with golden rays. The distinguished Chinese guest brought "sunshine" to Belgian enterprises, punned Mr. (Jacob), president of the Belgian Federation of Enterprises and concurrently executive chairman of the League of Chemistry, who had been waiting for Li Ruihuan by the research center's gate. No sooner had Li Ruihuan stepped out of the car, than Mr. Jacob told him about the Chemistry Union. [passage omitted] Mr. Jacob, who has been reputed as the "boss of the bosses" of Belgian enterprises, was very good at marketing. According to him, the medicine for cranial nerve system, developed by the center in cooperation with China, has been selling briskly. Therefore, he hoped to expand the cooperation and jointly manufacture allergy medicine. He said: The world market's demand for these two medicines is growing, and the prospect for development is bright. With a sense of humor, Li Ruihuan said: "I am one of the `consumers' taking your medicine. The medicine for treating cranial nerve ailment [zhi liao nao shen jing ji bing di yao wu 3112 4070 5207 4377 4842 4014 4016 4104 5522 3670], developed by your center in cooperation with China, sells well in China," adding that China has adopted a positive attitude toward importing advanced production technology from abroad as such technology is good for the Chinese people's health. Citing the successful example of "Shike [name as received]" company, a Sino-U.S. joint venture for manufacturing anthelmintic and cold medicines, Li Ruihuan urged Belgian enterprises to develop new medicines which can cure ailments without side effects. Accompanied by Jacob and other union executives, Li Ruihuan viewed the center's production assembly lines for pharmaceutical products, showing great interest in the advanced production and packing technology. He said: China has a long history of producing traditional Chinese medicine for counter-sale, but still lags far behind Western nations in the production of Western medicine. He hoped that Belgian pharmaceutical enterprises would cooperate with China in not only technology exportation but also joint development of new medicines.
