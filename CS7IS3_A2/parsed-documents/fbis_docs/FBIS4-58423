And we wished to be gracious to those who were being depressed in the land, to make them leaders in faith, and make them heirs [Koranic verse followed by applause] President Muhammad Husni Mubarak of the fraternal Arab Republic of Egypt, Mr. Christopher, Mr. Kozyrev, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, and my brother His Excellency Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa: In the historic moments that we are witnessing today on the land of fraternal Egypt, I extend to you, Mr. President, and to the government and great people of Egypt, greetings and appreciation of your constant concern and continuing efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the entire region. This is Egypt's fate and real role as determined by its position in the heart of the Arab world and the Middle East and between the three continents, Asia, Africa, and Europe [applause]. Many happy returns on your birthday today. [applause] You are now carrying the banner that is building the structure of peace. Without your constant contribution and role, it would be difficult for us to see such an achievement. To you, Your Excellency the President, and through you to every Egyptian on this good and towering land, I extend the greetings of every Palestinian in our land and abroad, those who look with hope toward a new era of genuine, lasting, and comprehensive peace. I also thank Foreign Minister brother 'Amr Musa. [applause] I also extend greetings and deep thanks to the sponsors of the peace process, the United States and the Russian Federation, and to President Bill Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin, who are represented here today by His Excellency Secretary Warren Christopher and His Excellency Minister Andrey Kozyrev. I also thank the states of the European Union, the nonaligned states, the Islamic states, and the African countries. Their persistent efforts had a great effect on overcoming the obstacles and on bringing views closer so as to complete this first step in the Palestinian-Israeli peace course and from it, God willing, move to the Arab-Israeli peace. I also remember with reverence and respect our friend and minister, Norway's Johan Holst, who died with great hopes of sharing in these moments of implementing the first step of the agreement. He participated quietly and effectively to achieve it. I welcome here His Excellency Minister Tore Godal, appreciating his important endeavors and the Norwegian Government's constant efforts and good moves to serve the peace process in every sphere. In the name of every Palestinian man and woman, I look with great confidence and hope at our brothers and our people's friends who are participating in this historic occasion and I think of those who could not come. I thank them all and stress to them that our people today in the West Bank, Gaza, holy Jerusalem, and in all the diaspora are looking more than ever toward your role so that this first step in Gaza and Jericho will become the real start for completing the peace process, guaranteeing our Palestinian people's legitimate rights, achieving justice and equality by ending the occupation of our Palestinian territories, and building the Palestinian future based on democracy, development, and progress, a future linked with the tradition of its glorious Arab nation. Today, brothers, belongs to all our brothers who have helped to make it. It belongs to our brother President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, the president of green Tunisia, who provided the Palestinian people's leadership with all the facilities for achieving their rights. The day belongs to our brothers in the great Arab Maghreb, especially His Majesty King Hassan II and his good efforts, President Lamine Zeroual, chairman of the Arab Maghreb Union, and the other brother members of the Union. It also belongs to our brothers in the Arab Gulf. I particularly mention the role of His Majesty King Fahd, custodian of the two holy mosques, [applause] and all his brother leaders of the Gulf countries. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's planes are today carrying the Palestinian security forces who are returning to the homeland. This highlights the constant support and brotherhood, the ties of which will never be broken, God willing. On this day, too, I salute fraternal Jordan, His Majesty King Husayn, and Jordan's Government and people, who share with us a common date and a promising future, God willing. I also express to our brothers in Syria and Lebanon and to President Hafiz al-Asad and President Ilyas al-Hirawi the confidence that the ties of fate binding us will be strengthened because we are acting on the firm basis that peace will not be just if it is not comprehensive. Peace will prevail over our region when the resolutions of international legitimacy are applied to all the Arab fronts and when the eras of occupation, the eras of wars, and the cycles of violence end. I also salute the brothers in Yemen, Sudan, Iraq, and Libya for embracing their Palestinian brothers since the departure from Beirut. Allow me to congratulate the people of South Africa and struggling President Nelson Mandela and [former] President de Klerk [applause] for the victory achieved by the South African people in the democratic experience, when it vanquished injustice and racial discrimination to build a future based on tolerance, equality, justice, and respect for human rights. Respected ladies and gentlemen, we are signing the step to mark the start. It is a step linked with other steps in the West Bank during the coming few months so that our people can, for the first time, see the real horizon for establishing the just peace. The withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho is the prelude; it opens the door to removing the entire occupation and to establishing new relations between our peoples, Prime Minister Rabin, between our Israeli and Palestinian peoples, for the sake of our children and yours. [applause] Completing this step required Herculean courage after long periods of war and violence. The coming stage will require still greater courage, a thorough insight, real farsightedness, and firm patience so that we can establish a firm and unshakeable peace, the peace of the bold. The Palestinian people have lived on their land throughout history. They helped to create civilization and raise the voice of peace, the voice of the only all-powerful God, the creator, the lord of the universe and of the three heavenly religions, calling for praising God's blessings, giving, and his name on this sacred land. The people of Palestine, based on their deep historical heritage, today express their loyalty to the just and comprehensive peace. Thus our people demonstrated faithfulness to the heritage of their successive generations; to the sweat of the Palestinian people, mixed as it is with the soil of the earth; to the Palestinian maker's determination to build life and let it flourish; and to the creativity of the Palestinian intellectual, who always believes that history will never go off its track no matter how much time passes. [applause] Our people, gentlemen, have struggled long to see the beginning of the peace era. For peace to be achieved, our people offered dear sacrifices. To achieve this recognition of our national rights, the eyes of bereaved mothers and of children who were raised to know that love and loyalty to the homeland are the highest values of life looked forward. Also looking forward to this were the prisoners, whose hope of freedom, for themselves and for their people, is renewed every day, and the refugee camp residents, who never lost confidence that a new era of freedom would come. Nothing has gone in vain. Alive and great nations make their wounds, the sacrifice of their martyrs, and their long suffering the motives for the future and the banners for building a new era based on justice under the shadow of tolerance and coexistence among the three religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam over centuries. We have offered a great deal to reach this day. We confronted patiently and persistently every hindrance and doubt and we always thought that every step in the peace negotiations, despite all the pain, was a move away from the era of war and violence nearer to the era of equal rights and the implementation of international legitimacy. While today we celebrate the signing of the first step, we must all realize that all those concerned about peace, including our people at home and in the diaspora, measure the seriousness of this step by one criterion: honest and precise implementation and the change it will make to the reality on the ground. It is the right of our people and of everybody concerned with genuine peace to point to the measures isolating holy Jerusalem from its surroundings and preventing the Palestinians from entering it and the other sacred Islamic and Christian places. These measures obstruct life in the city, paralyze its economy, and separate the sons of the same family. All this is incompatible with the spirit of the just and real peace, with the course of equality, justice, and human rights that we are aspiring to adopt as the basis for free and positive relations between the two neighboring peoples, as Mr. Peres said, between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. The suffering of the city of Hebron following the bloody massacre cannot continue. It is still suffering encirclement and siege both inside and outside it. The continuation of the settlement and the attempt to impose the fait accompli in Jerusalem and in other areas conflict with the essence, clauses, and the short and long-term objectives of the peace process. The boldness of peace prompts me today to adopt the policy of frankness on peace without which we cannot end the age of confrontation and start the age of constructive and real cooperation. The Arab peoples and millions of Muslims and Christians will observe our practical steps tomorrow to pass judgment on the possibility of coexistence and of opening a new chapter in normal relations. All those who want the success of the Palestinian-Israeli peace experiment realize the importance of the great steps facing this peace, including the settlements, the refugee problem, holy Jerusalem, and the need to solve it later, as we agreed, so as to help create a new era of protecting the future of the entire region and ensuring openness between their peoples and countries on the basis of respect for the rules and resolutions of international legitimacy. Ladies and gentlemen, I am confident today that the Palestinian people will receive this new stage with a desire to provide a real opportunity for building real peace with the same desire it has for its national identity and its independent national being. Our people extends its hand to the Israeli people to start this era and end the whirlpool of violence for the sake of our real interests today and the interests of our coming generations. Coexistence is possible. It is inevitable. It is our common fate to live together as neighbors governed by the rules of justice, democracy, and national and human dignity. Hatred, bigotry, and extremism will only lead to more squandering of our creative and brilliant resources. We are proposing the alternative today, namely equality, joint building, and respect for every people's right and independent choice and security. Today again I also address our great Arab nation, leaders and peoples, on the threshold of the first step of the return to the homeland and stress to them that their pain, sacrifice, and determination to uphold our Palestinian people's national legitimate rights prompt us today to strengthen our fraternal ties in every field so that peace for Palestine will, as always, be a peace for all the Arabs. Yes, gentlemen, our peace is a peace for our Arab nation. It is a peace for Israel, for the Middle East region, for the whole world. Yes, it is a peace for the whole world. O God, you are peace, peace comes from you, and peace is for you. Blessed are you God, full of majesty, bounty, and honor. Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, and goodwill toward men. Peace be with you.
