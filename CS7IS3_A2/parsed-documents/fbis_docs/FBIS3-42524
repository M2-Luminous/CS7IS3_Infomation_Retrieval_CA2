Severtsov, Moscow; UDC 391.621.25] [Abstract] Images produced in the sensing of the Earth's surface with active and passive space-based systems are represented in binary form, with subsequently preliminary processing. Part of that processing involves local filtration. The work reported here examines procedures for recursive nonlinear filtration. A mathematical model of the procedures is constructed, and the probability efficiency of a recursive filter is compared with that of a nonrecursive filter (maximum probabilities of events are y = 1 and y = 0. With p = 0.1, the recursive filter produced a probability value of P(y = 1) = 0.0122, whereas the nonrecursive filter produced a value of P(y = 1) = 0.28 > 0.0122. With p = 0.9, the values changed to P(y = 1) = 0.9882 and P(y = 1) = 0.972 < 0.9882, respectively. By and large, a (2/3)[.sup]3[/] recursive filter produced better values than those of a similar nonrecursive filter. References 6: 4 Russian, 2 Western.
