The following is the text of the historic statement: In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate. The 50th anniversary of the presentation of the manifesto demanding independence and democracy falls on 11 January 1994. It is an occasion on which the three democratic parties--Istiqlal, the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, and the Organization of Popular Democratic Action--stand up to evaluate the conditions that Morocco faces in future years as it stands on the threshold of the 21st century after a half-century during which its people have continued the struggle to realize their goals of liberation, democracy, and social justice in the full sense. While recognition of political independence was achieved due to the struggle of the king and the people in full harmony, building a free national state in the framework of constitutional monarchy and on the principles of political, economic, social, and cultural democracy is still faltering 38 years after the declaration of independence and has not taken a decisive course toward concrete realization. Sensing their responsibilities after the crisis through which Morocco has been passing, with the tremendous challenges this has presented, the three democratic parties renew their pledge to continue the struggle to fulfill the goals of the National Charter (the manifesto of 11 January 1944) in its spirit and aspirations, to embark forcefully to save the country from the dangers that threaten it, and to establish conditions for democratic change in the framework of a sincere national agreement that lays the foundation for the elements of a modern democratic state, embodies the principle of popular sovereignty, and lays a firm basis for a strong, progressive Morocco. True democracy can free the country from perversions such as widespread injustice, corruption, bribery, exploitation of influence, illegitimate wealth, and plundering of the people's money, land, and resources. True democracy can end human rights violations, protect public and private freedoms, guarantee citizens' rights to free and fair elections and their right to food, work, education, medical care, and housing, and provide equal opportunity for all to raise the physical and spiritual level of their lives under the aegis of mutual responsibility and social justice. True democracy can confront the requirements for continued economic and social development and for enabling Moroccan society to open up to the requirements of scientific and cultural development in connection with the changes that the international community is experiencing in all economic, geostrategic, technological, and cultural areas. These things make it imperative for our country to apply democracy as an absolute necessity for winning the challenges of the future and responding to the aspirations of coming generations. Calling to mind the stages of the democratic struggle to bring about the constitutional and political reforms that the masses of the Moroccan people have never ceased hoping to achieve, the three democratic parties declare their fidelity to their previous demands. They confirm that one of the first reforms that must be made is continued work to approve new constitutional changes to guarantee greater balance of powers and firmly establish executive, legislative, and judicial structures that satisfy all the conditions for credibility, effectiveness, and responsibility. Specifically, this requires: --Electing all members of Parliament by direct, general election. --Creating a supreme constitutional body independent of the government apparatus and having full power to oversee the election process, regulate all its stages, and guarantee its freedom and fairness. --Creating a supreme accounting council to be raised to the level of a constitutional body with the role of controlling implementation of the state budget, monitoring the public sector, and combatting all forms of waste and corruption. --Founding special constitutional bodies charged with participating in defining public policy in various fields: such as the Supreme Council on Culture and Information, the Supreme Council on Defense, and the Supreme Council on Education, in addition to the Economic and Social Council whose creation has been approved in principle. As they celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 11 January 1944 manifesto with pride and steadfastness, the three democratic parties proclaim that they will remain devoted to the spirit of the independence and democracy manifesto and will adhere to united action as a way to build a democratic, progressive Morocco. They call on the masses of the Moroccan people and all its vital forces that believe in democratic change to join consciously and responsibly in demanding an end to the attempts at cheating and falsification that were behind our country's failure to achieve the cultural development we seek and to realize the ambitions of our successive generations for modernization and prosperity under a constitutional, social-democratic monarchy in which Moroccans enjoy freedom, justice, equality, and a dignified life. - Mohamed Boucetta, general secretary, Istiqlal Party - Mohamed Yazghi, deputy first secretary, Socialist Union - Mohamed Ben Said, general secretary, Organization of [Popular Democratic] Action
