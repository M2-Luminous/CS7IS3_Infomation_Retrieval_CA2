Two questions are at the center of the dispute; the presence of neofascist ministers in the government and the chairmanships of the Senate committees. Nicola Mancino has attacked the government bitterly and said that he sees the risk of an authoritarian tendency in Italy. Achille Occhetto, leader of the Party of the Democratic Left, has criticized President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro for giving the go-ahead to neo-fascist government ministers. Occhetto has also attacked Gianfranco Fini and said that the idea of changing Italy's borders is dangerous and typically fascist. However, the bitterest dispute concerns the Senate committees. The elections of the chairmen of the committees are due to take place tomorrow. Giovanni Masotti reports: [Masotti] Disputes and arguments are also raging within the ranks of the ruling coalition. The National Alliance, which is in dispute with Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio over his refusal to postpone the Senate committee contest, is threatening to vote solely for its own candidates. However, the main bone of contention is the setting up of a new opposition grouping, the Democratic Left, which withdrew from the mixed Senate group in order to make life more difficult for the ruling coalition. [Libero Gualtieri, leader of the Democratic Left -- identified by screen caption] "The mixed group could not be a neutral group at the same time as being the arbiter of a political dispute." [Masotti] This means that the numbers, which were precarious in the first place, have changed for the ruling coalition. The political positions in the Senate have now become more radical. The Northern League has vetoed the idea of having opposition group chairmen in charge of the watchdog committees and has also ruled out the proposal of Nicola Mancino. [Francesco Tabladini, Northern League -- identified by screen caption] "Today the situation with this group which has been set up in order to manipulate the votes means that the political reality and our willingness to cooperate will need to be rethought." [Masotti] Between the Northern League and Forza Italia there remains the dispute over the Senate Public Works and Telecommunications Committee, although Umberto Bossi and Silvio Berlusconi are negotiating to unblock the impasse. [Enrico La Loggia, Forza Italia --identified by screen caption] "I am sure that the problems we have had because of certain stances which were taken up by the Northern League will be overcome very soon." [Masotti] Tomorrow is the day of reckoning and agreements will be at best only limited. [Giuliano Ferrara, minister for relations with parliament -- identified by screen caption] "Each party will vote for its own candidates and the best candidates will win."
