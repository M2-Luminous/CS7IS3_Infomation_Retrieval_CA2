This change should be carried out this year but no later than next year, Major General Julius Humaj, commander of the Army of the Slovak Republic, told the TA SR yesterday. Following experience with a similar arrangement of West European armies, the change will mainly affect internal organizational structures. General Humaj described the formation of the Army Command as one of the mistakes made in drafting the concept and structure of the newly established Republic's armed forces.
