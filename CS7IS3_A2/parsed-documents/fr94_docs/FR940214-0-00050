Exhibit A&hyph;8 of subpart E is revised to read as follows: Exhibit A&hyph;8 of Subpart E_Outline of Professional Market Study Market studies which do not address all segments of this outline will not be considered acceptable and may adversely affect the processing of preapplications. Preapplications with unacceptable market studies may be returned, deferred, or rejected, as determined appropriate by the servicing office. The following information is to be used by analysts in the preparation of market studies for the Section 515 housing program. It generally contains the type and depth of information which Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) requires for evaluating the feasibility of prospective housing developments. The analyst will be expected to provide sufficient quantitative data (such as census tables), primary data (such as survey of existing comparables), and qualitative data (such as local contacts in the community) to support the conclusions reached. The analyst may present any other discussions and/or data which will help support the complete analysis of the market. The outline provides for the demonstration of historical trends and allows the analyst to project into the 2 years beyond the last actual year of record. Additional guidance is offered in individual segments of the outline. You will need to provide a statement of your experience and why you think you are qualified to prepare such a study. Determination of need and demand will be derived for prospective rental tenants only from: (1) Persons migrating into the area, (2) persons dwelling in family units who desire to move into their own units (elderly living with family members will only be considered if evidence of their interest in moving into the project is furnished with the market study), (3) conservative estimate (not to exceed 20 percent) of households living in substandard rental housing, (4) demolition of rental stock, (5) allowance for a 5 percent vacancy rate, and (6) conservative estimate (not to exceed 20 percent) of households experiencing rent overburden provided the analyst has made a determination there are sufficient households in the market area to occupy any rental units vacated by those lower income persons who choose to move into the proposed project from the existing units. Substandard is defined as (1) Units lacking complete plumbing and (2) overcrowded (1.01 or more persons per room).
