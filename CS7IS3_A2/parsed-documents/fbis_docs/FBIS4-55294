Many people suspected that the old man was right, and the Slovak Heritage Foundation demanded in vain that the coalition disclose the contents of its secret agreement with ethnic Hungarian parties. Let the Slovak public learn what promises had been made to Miklos Duray and Vojtech Bugar [chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement] for the support they give in Parliament to the fragile, actually minority coalition that is limping on both legs. As so many times before, the truth surfaced on the other side of the Danube, in the Hungarian press, in which our minority politicians tell completely different things than they say at home, things they would never dream of telling the Slovak public. On 14 March, the Hungarian left-wing daily NEPSZABADSAG (the largest Hungarian daily) carried the following scandalous information: "According to Hungarian sources from Slovakia, Hungarian parties really did not wish to be represented in the new government (as they do not want to give Meciarites and nationalists the opportunity to play the Hungarian card), but they agreed with the other parties that their view would be taken into account in decisionmaking, particularly on ethnic issues. The foundations of this cooperation have been laid down in eight points: "As [Coexistence Deputy Chairman] Arpad Duka-Zolyomi told our daily, the agreement provides for the adoption of laws on the names of communities and on the writing of family names in a form that will be acceptable to the Hungarians. Important points concern guarantees of community property and the transfer of care of schools and cultural institutions to the jurisdiction of community self-administrative bodies. It is necessary to halt the organizing of the so-called bilingual alternative schools in areas inhabited by ethnic Hungarians. The Hungarian parties expect that the process of preparations for territorial reorganization will be halted. The new government will also prepare the signing of the European Self-Rule Charter and the European Regional and Minority Charter. Furthermore, the agreement concerns the establishment of minority departments at the Ministries of Education and Culture, within the framework of which there will be separate Hungarian sections. The appointment of state secretaries at the aforementioned ministries will have to be coordinated with the Hungarian parliamentary parties. Finally, it is necessary to reconsider the composition of local state administration bodies in the minority regions and take into consideration special recommendations from the Hungarian parliamentary parties." Behind-the-Scenes Scenario for Undermining the Constitution The documents approved at the 8 January rally in Komarno, which was organized by the Association of Zitny Ostrov [Rye Island; area along the Danube in southern Slovakia inhabited by ethnic Hungarians] Towns and Communities, in close cooperation with representatives of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement and Coexistence, uncovered the cards of those ethnic politicians. They were also uncovered by a statement made by Istvan Pasztor, mayor of Komarno and member of the Coexistence leadership, after the rally: "If we do not succeed with this government with our demands, we will succeed with another one!" Even Sibyl would be pleased [as pubalished]. The Komarno documents contain exactly what Arpad Duka-Zolyomi presents as points of the agreement with the broad-coalition government. The well-written scenario of the executors of Budapest's policy in Slovakia is starting to be implemented. Cultural and school autonomy, guaranteed by the property of communities, would lead in the ethnically mixed regions to actual autonomy, also in view of the electoral law, which is based on the majority principle regarding elections to self-administrative bodies. The position of the state-forming nation, the Slovaks, in southern Slovakia is already alarming, starting with the discrimination against Slovak pupils and ending with the impossibility for Slovaks to claim their rights with city and community councils, which are controlled by [ethnic] Hungarian politicians. As can be seen, the Moravcik coalition's craving for power is stronger than its responsibility for the fate of its own nation and defense of its state interests as enshrined in the Constitution. The coming days, when the laws on the names of communities and on [birth and marriage] registers and the solution to Slovakia's territorial and administrative division will be discussed, will show how far the present broad coalition intends to go in its concessions to the already privileged Hungarian minority! Above-standard rights of minorities have never brought anything good in history. By the way, in the last "Kroky" ["Steps"; television panel discussion broadcast every Sunday morning], Vojtech Bugar swore that no agreement exists between the coalition and the Hungarian political entities. Who is actually using lies as a working method?
