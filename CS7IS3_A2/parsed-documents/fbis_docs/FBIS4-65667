In a clarion call to the UK Eurosceptics, Sir Michael Angus, who is chairman of Whitbread, accused the Commission of ignoring the views of European businessmen, and called on the UK government to "take up the cudgels" of industry. "Doubts have once again begun to set in as to whether the Community is capable of adopting an agenda that makes a positive contribution to the ability of businesses to face intense global pressures," he said. If European legislators introduced any more anticompetitive initiatives they should simply "go into a dark room, lie down, and keep taking the tablets," he said at the CBI's annual dinner. The unusually provocative speech, which marks the swan-song of Sir Michael's two-year term as CBI president, cited five main areas where the Commission had apparently failed to listen to business views. The first was the white paper on competitiveness and growth, drawn up by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president. This had been given a "disappointingly thin" follow-up. But when he had raised these criticisms with Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner, he had been shocked by Mr Flynn's "outdated" focus on industrial relations. The second target was the green paper on social policy, which was accused of paying too little attention on the need to get Europe's 20 million unemployed back to work. The Commission's attempts to introduce the directive on employee information and consultation provided another bone of contention. The directive would erode the competitiveness of European companies and leave U.S. businessmen "chortling." Fourth, the proliferation of anticompetitive state aids was undermining the European industry, Sir Michael said. He accused the Commission of undermining competitive policy in areas where the UK was strongest -- civil aviation, steel, telecommunications and energy. Finally, Sir Michael concluded, the Commission was failing to get to grips with its own spending policy, producing a "dismal catalogue of fraud and waste."
