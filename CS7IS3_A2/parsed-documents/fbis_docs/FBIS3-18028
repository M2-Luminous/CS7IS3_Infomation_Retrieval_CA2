The "Dutchbat" has been assigned this task by UN Commander General Rose. Originally, the battalion's first 300 infantrymen were due to go to Srebrenica on 6 March at the earliest. Now an attempt is being made to make this happen as soon as Tuesday [1 March], despite the transport problems with which Dutchbat is still fighting to come to terms. In his instructions for the Netherlands battalion, General Rose says that the operation must be carried out "as quickly as possible." According to Lieutenant-Colonel W. van Dullemen, by issuing these orders, the UN general is assigning the Netherlands battalion with an extremely difficult task. Most of the infantrymen arrived in Split on Wednesday, and the plan was that they were supposed to remain there for one more week. Now, the 300-man unit will have to leave on Saturday and head for the Netherlands supply center in Lukavac, from where it will continue on to Srebrenica. The United Nations wants Dutchbat to enter the Muslim enclave faster than originally planned in an attempt to make the most of the relatively flexible attitude of the Serbs at the moment. That attitude could change if the United Nations soon attempts to re-open the airfield at Tuzla for humanitarian aid. UN Envoy Akashi has named 7 March as the target date by which Tuzla must be open once again. Previously, the United Nations and NATO had not ruled out the possibility of using force, if necessary, to re-open Tuzla airfield. However, General Polle, the coordinator of the Netherlands operations, does not anticipate any armed action being necessary, despite the major objections that the Serbs have to the re-opening of Tuzla. According to Polle, the question will be solved through negotiations. Polle views the call to action by his UN colleague, General Rose, more as an attempt by the British general to consolidate the presence of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] peacekeeping forces throughout the whole of eastern Bosnia. UN troops have become somewhat "thinner" on the ground recently following the transfer to Sarajevo of a company of Scandinavian soldiers. The Norwegian battalion is being deployed mainly around Tuzla. The United Nations wants to prevent the Serbian forces from hitting upon the idea of exploiting the gap that has been created as a result.
