The documents are to be issued to Estonia's permanent non-citizen residents who can no more travel with their Soviet passports. The document will be valid only for once leaving Estonia and one entry into the country. A new document has to be applied for if the holder wants to cross the border again, the draft stipulates. The document will be valid for six months from issue and can be used only when travelling to countries which accept it as a travel document and put their visas in it. The temporary travel document is a document for the transition period until Estonia introduces its aliens' passports, said Aino Leppik, adviser to the government. Aliens' passports are currently in print and the country expects to start their issue in summer, she added.
