FR940805-0-00050 FR940805-0-00018 40 CFR Part 271 [FRL&hyph;5027&hyph;4] Wisconsin: Authorization of State Hazardous Waste Management Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Immediate final rule. SUMMARY: Wisconsin has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (hereinafter RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Wisconsin's application and has reached a decision, subject to public review and comment, that these hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to grant final authorization to Wisconsin to operate its expanded program, subject to authority retained by EPA under the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter HSWA). EFFECTIVE DATE: Final authorization for Wisconsin shall be effective on October 4, 1994, unless EPA publishes a prior Federal Register (FR) action withdrawing this immediate final rule. All comments on Wisconsin's final authorization must be received by 4:30 p.m. central time on September 6, 1994. If an adverse comment is received, EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of this immediate final rule or (2) a notice containing a response to the comment which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6929(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In accordance with 40 CFR 271.21, revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR Parts 124, 260&hyph;266, 268, and 270. B. Wisconsin Wisconsin initially received final authorization for its program effective January 31, 1986 (51 FR 3783). Subsequently, Wisconsin received authorization for revisions to its program, which became effective on June 6, 1989 (54 FR 22278), January 22, 1990 (54 FR 48243), April 24, 1992 (57 FR 15029), and August 2, 1993 (58 FR 31344). On March 16, 1994, Wisconsin submitted a program revision application for additional program approvals. Today, Wisconsin is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). EPA reviewed Wisconsin's application, and has made an immediate final decision that Wisconsin's hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Wisconsin. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until September 6, 1994. Copies of Wisconsin's application for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the ``Addresses'' section of this notice. Approval of Wisconsin's program revision shall become effective in 60 days unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is received, EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision. On October 4, 1994, (unless EPA publishes a prior FR action withdrawing this immediate final rule), Wisconsin will be authorized to carry out, in lieu of the Federal program, those provisions of the State's program which are analogous to the following provisions of the Federal program:
