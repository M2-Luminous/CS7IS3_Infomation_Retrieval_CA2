FR941122-0-00061 FR941122-0-00012 Issue 10: The Act requires the Service to consult with appropriate Federal, State, tribal, and local entities or private landowners, to the maximum extent practicable, prior to promulgating regulations. The Service has failed to meet such requirements. Service Response: It is well documented that the Service made an extraordinary effort to involve the public and other government entities in developing management practices and the experimental population rules regarding the wolf reintroduction program. During the past 3 years, the Service held over 100 meetings, open houses, and hearings. The Service distributed over 750,000 documents and reviewed and considered nearly 170,000 public comments during development of the rule. Federal agencies and affected States and tribes were active participants during the process. This final rule represents the participatory work and consensus of affected agencies and others interested or impacted by the rulemaking. Issue 11: Further discussion and detail are needed on how State and tribal agencies will manage wolf predation and ungulate population levels. The public needs to know exactly what will be done in regard to this issue. Service Response: The Service is confident in the States' and tribes' ability to evaluate the impact wolf predation may have on ungulate populations and, when appropriate, implement corrective management actions. An evaluation of possible impacts and/or actions in regard to a specific ungulate species and location is best accomplished by biologists most familiar with the situation. The Service, States, and tribes will coordinate wolf management plans to ensure that State and tribal interests in native ungulate management are met while meeting the Service's mandate for wolf recovery. Rulemaking language was added to the section on how States and tribes will manage ungulate/wolf conflicts. States and tribes are required to prepare acceptable management plans for approval by the Service. It is expected that since these management plans may affect State wildlife management programs, the States will go through a public review process as part of their development. Such plans will indicate the point at which wolf/ungulate conflicts become so critical that corrective action must be taken. A decision to translocate wolves to reduce such conflicts must serve to enhance, or at a minimum not inhibit, wolf recovery. Issue 12: The timeframe for submitting a report on the harassing and/or taking of wolves by the public should be changed (both shortened or lengthened were mentioned). Service Response: The timeframes for a person to report the harassing (7 days) and/or the unintentional taking (24 hours) of wolves were not changed. The harassing or taking of a wolf is a critical and potentially serious event. A person who harasses a wolf is best served by reporting the incident as soon as possible so agency management actions can be implemented, if necessary. Submission of a report on wolf harassment provides a record which can document the continuation of suspected or actual livestock depredations or rationale for taking a wolf. The immediate reporting of livestock depredation by a wolf also allows the immediate investigation of the incident and gathering of fresh evidence. In Montana, agency professionals who investigate livestock depredations are readily accessible during the night, weekends, and holidays. During the past 9 years in Montana, the reporting, documenting, and resolution of livestock depredations have not been significant issues. Therefore, they are not anticipated to be a problem for wolf reintroductions into the experimental population areas. The United States legal system often takes into account unusual mitigating circumstances, such as the remoteness of a livestock allotment interfering with an individual being able to report an incident as required by regulation. The Service could determine that an incident would not be referred for prosecution, when a person failed to meet the reporting requirements and could justify their action. Issue 13: The delisting criteria should be clearly identified. The delisting of one recovery area should be independent of the status of other recovery areas. Service Response: In accordance with the Act, delisting may occur when analysis of the best available scientific and commercial information shows that gray wolves are no longer threatened with extinction due to: (1) Loss of habitat, (2) overutilization, (3) disease or predation, (4) inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms, and (5) other natural or manmade factors. In addition to the above, the final EIS, states that the following criteria must be met: (1) For 3 consecutive years, a minimum of 10 breeding pairs are documented in each of the 3 recovery areas described in the revised wolf recovery plan (Service 1987); (2) protective legal mechanisms are in place; and (3) the EIS evaluation has been completed (Service 1994). After delisting, the Act specifies a species population must be monitored for a 5-year period. After delisting, if in any 1 of the 3 recovery areas the wolf population fell below the minimum of 10 breeding pairs for 2 consecutive years, then wolves in that recovery area would be considered for protective status under the Act. Delisting procedures have been discussed (Service 1994a, Appendix 11). Endangered wolves in northwestern Montana can be downlisted to threatened once 10 breeding pairs are documented for 3 consecutive years. Experimental populations of wolves cannot be downlisted because their protective status is based on the experimental population rule. Experimental population rules can be withdrawn when wolf numbers have reached recovery levels, no further protection under the Act is required, and the wolf is delisted.
