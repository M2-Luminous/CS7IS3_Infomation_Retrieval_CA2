[passage omitted] Recently, Nanjing Military Region Commander Gu Hui and Political Commissar Fang Zuqi [2455 4371 1477] presented golden plaques -- engraved with characters: "good logistics supporters of the military" -- to 13 units, including the Fujian Provincial Government office in charge of support-the-front affairs. One common understanding shared by party and government departments of Fujian, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangsu in eastern China is that they must intensify their support for the military at a time when efforts are being made to speed up the pace of reform, opening up, and the development of the socialist market economy. [passage omitted] Whenever a major reform project was going to be launched, the local party committees and governments always considered the military's tolerance for a change first. In April 1993 after the state decontrolled the grain market, the grain departments of these provinces and Shanghai, in order to ensure the military's grain supply, immediately set up 20 supply departments and hundreds of supply depots in cities and regions where garrison troops were concentrated and sold them quality grain at preferential prices on a priority basis. Despite rising grain prices, the Shanghai Municipal Government's office in charge of financial affairs and trade did everything it could to sell 200,000 tonnes of grain to the garrison troops at set prices.
