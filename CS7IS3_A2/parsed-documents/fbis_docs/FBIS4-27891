[music] Mt. Paektu forests, endlessly throb! The whole land of Korea, let us shout cheers! Sun of guidance, shine in glory! Comrade Kim Chong-il held in high esteem by people! [music] This song is being sung by our people with heart, filled with endless dignity and joy! The song, which each of our people is singing, overflowing with great dignity and joy of holding the dear comrade leader in high esteem at the head of our party and revolution [uridanggua hyongmyongui suwie nopi mosin], is reverberating throughout rivers and mountains. [music] The new era of history is advanced and brightened by the great leader [yongdoja]. For a country, for a nation, there is no other greater fortune than holding in high esteem such a leader [yongdoja], (?at the head of the era), as the one who is great in idea and philosophy, outstanding in the leadership quality and capability, and sacred in personality. Our people are holding in esteem the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the fate of the nation and the glory of the world, as the great leader [yongdoja] of our era! We recall the bygone days, unable to suppress the gushing forth of the boundless national dignity and pride of holding two great leaders [yongdoja], the most outstanding great men, in one generation. [music] One summer, the dear comrade leader took a walk for a while, attending upon the great leader [suryongnim]. The Workers Party of Korea [WPK] flag was vigorously flying at the roof of the party Central Committee building with the twilight of the setting sun. Our party flag has truly profound stories and a sacred history. The respected and beloved leader looked for a long time at the party flag flying up high in the sky . With the tone of deep emotion, he said: Time really flies. It is already nearly 40 years since we upheld the banner of the Korean revolution. He recollected the unforgettable past when he pledged, in front of the red banner of revolution, to fight with life for the realization of the program for Down With Imperialism Union while putting forth that program's proposal for building a socialist, communist society in our country. His retrospective remarks, which began with his recollections of the bygone days of the Korean revolution when he pulled up the anchor along the sea route of independence in the beginning of the 20th century, extended to today and the future. The meaningful remarks were made by the respected and beloved leader who said: The way to the revolution is still long and rough. The vast future requires great efforts. Reflected in the remarks were his profound intentions and great expectations to see his pledge, which he had made in the days of history, surely materialized in this land. This was really an emotion-evoking scene which was recorded in the history of the Korean revolution. One day after that day, the dear comrade leader met with responsible functionaries of the party Central Committee. That day, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il gave precious teachings about well carrying out their work by well upholding the great leader. He continued to say: The cause of the revolution we are carrying out is the one that the leader [suryongnim] had pioneered. Our revolutionary cause is the rewarding one that had begun in Mt. Paektu. In other words, that is our party's sacred cause for communist construction which has recorded its first glorious trace in the history since the program of Down With Imperialism Union was put forth. This remark by the dear comrade leader which involves the deep meaning of the beginning and future of our revolution was a great declaration to bring a great golden age in the socialist cause to this land by going across the past generations with his extraordinary ideological and theoretical wisdom, excellent leadership ability, and iron-like will and courage. [music] The WPK has been firmly united and consolidated as one mind under the slogan of modeling the whole party after the chuche idea! The socialist system of our own style under which the principle of independence in politics, self-reliance in the economy, and self-defending in national defense has been realized and all the people have become a large revolutionary family! The revolutionary people who are firmly united with loyalty and filial piety around their leader [yongdoja], while regarding the chuche idea and socialism as their lives and living! The matchless strong Army which has become an invincible army under the banner of modeling the entire army after the chuche idea! From these excited events which lead us to be optimistic about the future of mankind not only in the present century, but also in the 21st century; from the amazing changes and transformations which are being created; and in the noble appearance of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who has brilliant wisdom, matchless courage, tested leadership ability, and extraordinary organizational ability our people and all of mankind are witnessing the appearance of the great leader [widaehan yongdoja] of the 21st century, a new era of history. The 21st century will be more bright and prosperous in the future! Our people are indeed the happy people who live and work with high ideal and with a firm belief in the future, upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the great leader. The animated and dignified chuche socialist Korea which is upholding as the great leader Comrade Kim Chong-chol who, taking upon himself the bright future of Korea and the destiny of socialism, is leading history to vigorously advance toward the 21st century along the route of independence! Ogami Kenichi, director of the Secretariat of the International Institute of the Chuche Idea, in his article entitled "The Great Leader [widaehan yongdoja] Leading the 21st Century," admired the dear comrade leader as follows: The world will enter, under Secretary Kim Chong-il's guidance, a new era in which the chuche idea is extensively embodied and brought into full bloom. Without learning from Secretary Kim Chong-il it is impossible to look ahead to the new era of mankind. Yes, it is true. There is no people in this world who are happier than our people who are struggling to consummate the socialist cause, upholding Comrade Kim Chong-il as the great leader. This is precisely our people's glory and Korea's pride. This glory of our people and this pride of chuche Korea are echoing rivers and mountains as a great song. [music]
