Subpart A_Construction and Maintenance of Roads §170.1 Purpose. The purpose of this part is to set forth regulations to govern the planning, design, construction, maintenance, and general administration of Indian reservation roads. In compliance with 23 U.S.C. 202, these regulations have been jointly developed and approved by the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs (DOI) and the Federal Highway Administrator, Department of Transportation. Any FHWA/BIA interagency agreements relative to the administration of the IRR program shall be developed and approved after allowing tribal governments the opportunity to review and comment. §170.2 Definitions. BIA Road System means those existing and proposed IRR for which the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) owns or plans to obtain legal right-of-way. This includes only roads for which the BIA has the primary responsibility to construct, improve and maintain, and for which any changes to this system shall be supported by a tribal resolution. Construction means engineering, supervising, inspecting, actual building, and all expenses incidental to the construction and improvement of roads and bridges. Construction includes the elimination of roadway hazards, the acquisition of right-of-way, reconstruction, resurfacing, restoration, rehabilitation, sealing of the roadway, and traffic flow control or improvement. Also included are designed pavement overlays that add to the structural value and design life of the pavement, or provide identified safety skid resistance, and double bituminous surface and chip seals that are part of predefined stage construction or form the final surface on low volume roads. Force account means the use of BIA personnel to perform construction and maintenance on IRR. Program and project documentation is completed under these operations in accordance with specifications and applicable directives from the Bureau of Indian Affairs Manual (BIAM) for each project. Indian Reservation Roads (IRR) ``means public roads that are located within or provide access to an Indian reservation or Indian trust land or restricted Indian land which is not subject to fee title alienation without the approval of the Federal Government or Indian and Alaska Native villages, groups or communities in which the majority of the residents are Indians or Alaskan Natives, whom the Secretary has determined are eligible for services generally available to Indians under Federal laws specifically applicable to Indians.'' (23 U.S.C. 101(a).) Roads in the BIA Road System are included in the IRR system. Maintenance means the act of preserving the entire roadway, including the surface, shoulder, roadsides, drainages, and structures, preserving the road as nearly as practical to the original as-built condition, and providing snow and ice removal, vegetation control, traffic control devices, and other services for the safety and convenience of the user. Maintenance may also include minor improvements which could not be done efficiently with road construction funds, or the removal of safety hazards. Maintenance does not include constructing roads to a substantially higher standard. Public road means any road or street under the jurisdiction of and maintained by a public authority and open to public travel. (23 U.S.C. 101(a).)
