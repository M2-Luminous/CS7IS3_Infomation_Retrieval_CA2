Police intelligence sources believe he uses a toupee or wig. The intelligence services indicate that Feliciano, the son of a well known retired Army general, is the most influential leader in the collective national Shining Path leadership, the main unit of that organization since the capture of its founder Abimael Guzman Reinoso. Various departments of the National Intelligence System (SIN) have been unable until now to obtain any new information on the whereabouts and the physical appearance of the terrorist. Latest reports suggest he is in the southern part of the country, but this is unconfirmed. There is also evidence that his hideout is in metropolitan Lima. The PNP [National Peruvian Police] and the SIN only have two photographs of Feliciano: One is 12 years old, and the other dates back to 1988. This second photograph was taken from a video tape confiscated at the house in San Borja where it is believed Guzman took refuge. The photograph is blurred and his physical aspects are not shown clearly. Ramirez uses glasses in both photographs. He is bespectacled and is in a stage of advanced baldness. The only new aspect to now is information regarding the limp and the toupee, according to details obtained from Shining Path members captured during the past few months. No one close to Ramirez has been captured yet who could help draw an Indentikit picture of his physical appearance. It is not exactly known how he obtained the limp, but it is known that it was acquired some years ago. One police officer commented that it is possible he is now completely bald and that he uses a toupee. "It is not inconceivable for him to be walking about Lima with a false identity and new physical features," the source added. Analysts suggest Feliciano leads the hard line -- Pol Pot style -- sector of the terrorist group because his position is opposite to that of Guzman and of the main "historical leaders" of Shining Path. The hard line sector has been attributed with the most recent attacks.
