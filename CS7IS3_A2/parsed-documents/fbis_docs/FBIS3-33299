The president refused to confirm or deny such reports and noted that it will be Vera himself who will refer to this matter at a news conference that he will hold tomorrow, Tuesday. Vera, a well-known journalist and radio and television producer in his country, urged Dahik to straighten up and not "spread rumors." Vera made this remark after the vice president announced that the government is studying the possibility of convoking a plebiscite on topics that have not been disclosed by government spokesmen yet. The Ecuadoran vice president was elected to that post while ministers get appointed. According to television, radio, and newspaper reports, this explains the government hierarchy.
