Ms Sayagues said about 3,000,000 Malawians, 2,500,000 Angolans, 1,500,000 Mozambicans, 150,000 Swazi and 150,000 Tanzanians would require aid this year, the ZIANA news agency reported. "While we are not having problems transporting food aid to Tanzania, Malawi and Swaziland, Angola and Mozambique are our problem countries," she said, adding that poor roads in the two countries hampered the delivery of food aid. "Crop failure added to Angola's problems and we have been delivering about 16,000 tons of food to 1,600,000 people in need. "Tanzania has its problems and they are being fueled by the spill over of refugees from Rwanda and Burundi. Tanzania now has more than 400,000 refugees." She said.
