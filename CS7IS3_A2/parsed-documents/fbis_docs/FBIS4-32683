He said he was convinced that, with popular support, the cabinet of Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic stood a good chance of success in the implementation of the Yugoslav economic recovery programme. Serbia, together with Montenegro, forms Yugoslavia. Milosevic received Marjanovic and his cabinet on the occasion of their 100 days in office. Milosevic said the government had been consistent in the application of the economic recovery programme, which was launched on January 24 and is being implemented at federal level. Milosevic described as achievements unrivalled in years the rise in industrial and agricultural production and elimination of the budget deficit recorded in the past three months. Marjanovic, for his part, said that industrial production had risen by 18.6 per cent from January to May 1994. The stocks of finished goods are melting down, which means that the output is not being stock-piled, but absorbed by the market, he added. Milosevic said that another of the government's achievements was that it had broken away from the legacy of decades of bureaucratic rule and that the initial criticism that it was a cabinet of technocrats had turned out to be an advantage. The fact that it comprises a large number of former industry executives has led to its breaking away from the bureaucratic legacy of evading responsibility and has contributed to its creative approach to dealing with problems, Milosevic said. "I am sure that this kind of record after 100 days and this kind of experience with which the government has embarked on this crucial stage in the implementation of the economic programme give it a good chance of success," he added. Marjanovic said that the economic recovery programme was not one intended to ensure merely the nation's survival, but also a promotion of the market mechanisms and life in dignity in conditions of international isolation. Moreover, the programme lays the groundwork for an economic boom after sanctions, Marjanovic said and added that the government was giving results, that the programme had been widely accepted and the people would not agree to any solution that would take them back to the inflationary chaos of last January. "It remains for us at all times to unrequivocally defend, protect and promote the healthy dinar as the pivot of our future economic prosperity," Marjanovic said.
