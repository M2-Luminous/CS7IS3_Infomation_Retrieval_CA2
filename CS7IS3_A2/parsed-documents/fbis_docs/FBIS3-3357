Bao, 31, had recently written a letter asking Japan to apologize and pay war reparations for crimes committed during the 1937-1945 Sino-Japanese War. Bao was detained at about 10 a.m. (0200 GMT) by several police officers when he left his home, a close associate said. He had been under constant surveillance for three days, since Hosokawa arrived in China, the source said. A resident of Shanghai, Bao fought for years for war reparations from Japan and has already been to prison several times for this reason. He is also a democracy movement activist. Last Thursday, he published a letter in which he directly addressed the Japanese prime minister, asking him to apologize and to pay war reparations. On Friday, several elderly Chinese were detained for questioning when they tried to protest in front of the Japanese embassy in Beijing. Hosokawa ended his visit to China Monday in Shanghai. During the visit, he recalled that he had, at the time he took office last August, apologized for the crimes committed by the Imperial Japanese Army in China. China officially gave up its demands for war reparations in 1972.
