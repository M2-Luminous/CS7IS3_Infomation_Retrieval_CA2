"The North Korean nuclear problem, which is of ultimate importance to the survival of the 70 million Korean people, should be solved early this year at the latest," Kim said at a new year's ceremony in the presidential residence here Monday. "We have many difficulties trying to solve the nuclear issue and we need inter-Korean negotiations," he said. On the same day, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said that South Korea is getting ready for the day when neighboring countries recognize the DPRK and normalize their relations with Pyongyang, as is likely to happen this year. "We shall think about our practical interests and the people's feelings, and we plan to gradually develop government positions to prepare for talks on normalizing diplomatic relations between North Korea and neighboring countries," Han told reporters. Han's comments came as the DPRK and the United States near agreement on resuming high-level talks to untangle Pyongyang's nuclear problem.
