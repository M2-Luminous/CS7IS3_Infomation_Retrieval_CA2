FR940810-0-00078 FR940810-0-00021 Mr. Swartz also testified that brake shoes are recycled and new friction material is placed on re-used metal frames (Tr. 1871). A letter forwarded to OSHA by EPA Brian Putnam, whose work experience included 4 years of delivering auto parts to garages and service stations, stated: *␣*␣* it is my observation that auto parts employees face significant exposure to asbestos from brake shoe cores, brake drums, and clutches. Not only do they store cores for exchange with the manufacturers, most also turn brake drums which come in with a *␣*␣* coating of dust on them (Ex. 1&hyph;133). The asbestos standard 1910.1001 (k)(1) states that ``all surfaces shall be maintained as free as practicable of accumulations of dusts and waste containing asbestos,'' and subsequently in (k)(6) specifically states that items consigned for disposal which are contaminated shall be sealed in impermeable bags or other closed impermeable containers. In order to include materials which are contaminated and scheduled for recycling, not disposal, the phrase ``or recycling'' is added to this provision (k)(6), which now is as follows: Waste, scrap, debris, bags, containers, equipment and clothing contaminating with asbestos consigned for disposal or recycling, shall be collected and disposed of in sealed impermeable bags, or other closed, impermeable containers. Engineering controls and good work practices should be implemented at all times during brake servicing. Because of the health hazards associated with asbestos exposure, these actions must be considered even when the worker believes that the brake shoes do not contain asbestos. OSHA received several comments pointing out a need for training requirements for brake and clutch mechanics. For example J. Clayton of Clayton Associates, Inc supported a training requirement for brake and clutch repair workers citing as examples that New Jersey required one day training for mechanics and that Maryland requires training for those covered under its asbestos program. He estimated the cost of training at $150 and noted that certified instructors were required in both these states (Ex. 7&hyph;127). OSHA agrees that workers exposed to asbestos must be trained in appropriate ways to avoid exposure to airborne asbestos fibers. Therefore, OSHA has provided a mandatory appendix outlining the work practices to be used in performing these operations, and has included a requirement that brake and clutch repair workers receive training in the appropriate use of these work practices. Floor Maintenance Paragraph (k)(7) General Industry Standard. The 1986 standard contained no provisions specifically covering work practices on asbestos containing flooring materials. In 1990, OSHA proposed in paragraph (f)(xi) several limitations on buffing and sanding asbestos containing flooring. In the housekeeping section of the final OSHA is prohibiting or limiting three work practices relating to floor maintenance for asbestos-containing flooring materials and those assumed to contain asbestos. They are: (i) sanding of asbestos-containing floor material is prohibited; (ii) stripping of finishes shall be conducted using low abrasion pads at speed lower than 300 rpm and wet methods; and, (iii) burnishing or dry buffing may be performed only on asbestos-containing flooring which has sufficient finish so that the pad cannot contact the asbestos-containing material. OSHA had proposed to allow asbestos containing floor tile to be buffed only with ``low abrasion pads at speeds of 190 rpm or less'' (See 55 FR at 22752). However, after a review of the record OSHA believes that restricting sanding of floor materials, limiting the speed and abrasiveness of the pads and specifying use of wet methods for stripping floors, and allowing buffing only on finished floors will protect floor care workers from exposure to airborne asbestos fibers while performing the maintenance and will minimize future exposures due to deteriorating flooring caused by inadequate maintenance. Paragraph (g) Construction and Shipyard Employment Standards: The ``methods of compliance'' provisions are the core of the revised standards. They set generic, operation-specific and exposure triggered requirements for conducting asbestos work. In the 1986 construction standard, provisions dictating engineering controls and work practices for most construction jobs were contained in paragraph (e), governing the ``regulated area.'' OSHA believes that paragraph (g), the methods of compliance section, is a more logical home for these provisions.
