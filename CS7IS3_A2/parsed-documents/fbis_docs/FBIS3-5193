This is the first visit to Vietnam by the British princess, which will help promote relations between Vietnam and Great Britain. Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam gave a banquet in honor of the British princess. The princess sponsors many charity and humanitarian organizations in Great Britain. She visited and conducted many humanitarian activities in Third World countries in Africa, in the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. In June 1987, she was promoted to royal princess by the Queen. Vietnam and Britain have a long-standing relationship. The visit to the United Kingdom in June and July last year by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet opened up a new stage in cooperative ties. When chairing the European Community, Great Britain made an active contribution to promoting trade relations between the EC and Vietnam. Now more and more British organizations are doing business in Vietnam, including Oil Giant BP. During Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit to the United Kingdom, Prime Minister John Major committed to grant Vietnam development aid and financial assistance for the reintegration of returnees program. He also considered delay in Vietnam's debts. Great Britain also committed to help Vietnam train pilots and open a stock market, as well as other areas proposed by Vietnam in which Britain has much experience. Vietnam and Britain will sign an agreement on investment encouragement and protection and an agreement on avoidance of double taxation. A representative office of the Commonwealth of the United Kingdom of Great Britain [as heard] has been open in Hanoi, which was catalyzed cooperation between the two countries. It is hoped that the visit by British Princess Anne will promote Vietnam-Britain relations.
