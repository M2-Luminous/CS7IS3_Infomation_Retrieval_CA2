Talking to newsmen at the airport, Silajdzic criticized the international community for failing to play an effective role in ending the Serb and Croat aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina. He urged the international community to either act effectively to defend the Bosnian Muslims or allow them to defend themselves. He also called for an end to the arms embargo against Bosnia, which he described as illegal. He said the arms embargo against his country has caused the massacre of 200,000 Muslims. Silajdzic said renewed shelling and bombing by the Serb and Croat forces of Sarajevo and other cities has seriously hurt the process of restoring peace in Bosnia. He said Bosnia-Herzegovina is trying to restore peace, but the siege of Sarajevo is hampering this process. Silajdzic praised Pakistan's role in the Bosnian crisis and its continued support for the Muslim people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. During his stay in Pakistan, Silajdzic will call on President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and meet with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
