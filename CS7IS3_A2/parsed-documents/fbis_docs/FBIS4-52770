Only a few countries remain communist. They are moving gradually, however, toward a free market system. They are not abolishing with their communism speedily because they are ashamed before the rest of the world. These countries are Vietnam, the PRC, North Korea, and Cuba. As for our Cambodian people, they do not want communism, and especially such a communist like Khieu Samphan, in the royal government. Our people, as many as 99.99 percent, want multiparty liberal democracy. They want genuine freedom, genuine liberalism. Therefore, to serve the people and their interest, we must unite as one to eliminate the Khmer Rouge to the last man to avoid their presence in the government. We must not allow any communist to hold power in our Cambodia. If the "roundtable" accepts the Khmer Rouge, it would be tantamount to accepting a tiger, thus suicide for the government. The Cambodian people absolutely reject the Khmer Rouge. No influence can oppose this people's will! Anyone who overlooks the Khmer Rouge threat should not call himself a Cambodian.
