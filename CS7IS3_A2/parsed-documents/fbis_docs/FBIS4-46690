A. Yashin, by A. Vaganov, under the rubric "VPK [Military-Industrial Complex]": "Yuriy Yashin: `The State's Opportunities Are Limited': High Technologies in Russia: Between Past and Future"] [Text] So it worked out by force of objective circumstances that the Soviet, now the Russian, VPK [military-industrial complex] was virtually the sole creator and, at the same time, producer of high technology in our country. What this cost the other branches of the economy is a separate discussion. Regardless, today we face the real prospect of losing this "accumulator" of the most modern scientific and technological experience. If things go any further, the symbol of this process could become the spacecraft Burak, which has been turned into an attraction at Moscow's Gorky Park. For the state, in its present condition, the VPK may well be an unbearable burden. Where does the solution to the current situation lie? Answering the questions of NG's [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] correspondent is Yuriy Alekseyevich Yashin, chairman of the State Technical Commission under the RF [Russian Federation] president, laureate of the State Prize, doctor of technical sciences, professor, academician of the Russian and international academies of engineering and of the Russian Academy of Astronautics. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Yuriy Alekseyevich, aren't we having a conversation merely for conversation's sake? Won't the problems of our country's high technology be resolved automatically, as the economy stabilizes? [Yashin] First let's define what we mean by "high technology." Essentially, what this means is high priority directions for applied research and research-intensive production, the mastery of which at the present moment is what determines a country's degree of development, its real scientific-technical, economic, yes, and military weight in the world. In order to have its own high technology, a country must possess a minimum of three things: highly qualified staffs of researchers and producers; the necessary material base for science and industry; and significant funds, which are essential at the stage of research and introduction. Allow the temporary absence of just one of these conditions--that is, fail to take measures against the "brain drain," economize on research and modernization of production, or on higher education--during a period of economic difficulties and you are saying goodbye to any hope of staying on a world level. The whole process is automatic. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But maybe we really should restrict our ambitions and pretensions in high technology and attempt to occupy an acceptable place in the world division of labor, relying on less costly spheres of production. [Yashin] That kind of thinking is fundamentally wrong, and its implementation could cost our country very dearly in all respects, including the purely economic one. Only with the massive application of our country's helicopter technology (especially the Mi-6 and Mi-8 helicopters) were we able to accelerate the opening up of Tyumen oil by 10 years. Up to 30 percent of the information obtained by the Russian Defense Ministry's satellites could be used in the interests of our agriculture, whereas at present no more than 5 percent is being used; 60 percent could be used in the interests of lumber, but only 2 percent is. Generally speaking, a lot of high technology is vital to Russia. Our transport system would simply collapse without air transportation. No other country needs satellite systems for communication, ecological monitoring, and resource investiation more than ours. Here an extremely important dilemma arises: what do we need to develop and support more, our own high technology or purchase the appropriate output abroad, create jobs here at home or support another country's prosperity, complain of the ever-present "price scissors" of resources and manufactured output or take our own "place in the sun" on the world market? [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Is the issue really that serious? [Yashin] Unfortunately, yes. Let's look at the situation in civil aviation. In the next 5-10 years we are going to have to replace the overwhelming portion of our aviation fleet--about 1100 of our 1400 long-range airplanes. The creation of these airplanes is provided for in the current "Program of Development for Civil Aviation Technology." The Tu-204, Il-96-300, and other airplanes that have already been developed fully meet world standards. At the same time, the current financing of the program comes to 26-28 percent of what is required, the finishing of vehicles and their release into serial production is being delayed, the aviation industry, which as a result of the wholesale decline in military orders has lost approximately 400,000 jobs, is not fully utilized, and one of its leaders, the Aviastar association, in order to stay afloat, is already entering into an agreement to assemble English airplanes made from English parts. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] We see that the problem is inexhaustible. Still, precisely what paths for its solution do you feel are most important today? [Yashin] Keeping in mind the framework of our interview, I will limit myself to what seem to me the three most important points. First: optimization of the process of converting defense branches of industry. Due to objective reasons, Russia's leading scientific-technological potential has turned out to be concentrated in the branches of the defense complex. The current way of implementing conversion threatens it with "erosion," if not loss, and it is essential for us that this potential be reoriented toward satisfying the demands of the economy's civil sector. Especially since a rational reorientation involves direct access to a virtually instantaneous and advantageous "open yield" from the defense surplus. For example, right now a cooperation of enterprises headed by the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology is building on experience gained in making mobile military rocket complexes to design a family of commercial, multipurpose, transportable complexes for putting lightweight satellites into orbit. Flight tests of the Start-1 complex have been going on successfully since 25 March 1993. Now several long-term programs for utilizing the Start complexes in the interests of Russian and foreign organizations have been agreed upon. There are other extremely interesting proposals as well. Second: a search for new ways to administer scientific-technical progress. We must make substantial changes in the mechanisms for administering design and research, which in large part are inherited from the old economic model and are not very effective, given current conditions. Finally, third, and perhaps most important: a solution for the problem of investments in our country's high technology. The state's opportunities are limited. We must activate all possible sources of financing, including commercial structures at home and abroad and international consortia. The state should do the minimum essential for this: ensure a favorable investment climate; offer a developed legal base guaranteeing investor interests; and create capable executive organs. So far the operations of the executive and judicial authorities in this respect have been poorly coordinated and have borne a somewhat impulsive character. One can only express one's regret, for instance, that the appearance of the RF president's edict of 27 September 1993, No. 1466, "On Completion of Work with Foreign Investments," did not stimulate any noticeable progress in this sphere. Apart from foreign investments in the country, however, we also have our own potential sources of financing for high technology and research-intensive branches. In order to get things going well, we need to join forces and bring the positions of all subjects in the investment process closer together: banking structures, enterprises, the state apparatus, and authoritative scholars and specialists. I think that a definite positive role in this could be played by the international conference on "Integration of Banking Industrial Capital," which is planned for November of this year and the national organizing committee for which is headed up by the deputy chairman of the RF government, Aleksandr Shokin. Also encouraging is the role being played in conference preparation by our own country's financial structures, especially the Association of Russian Banks, the Moscow Banking Union, Aviabank, and several others.
