On a province level, Reggio Calabria comes in first with 12 slayings per 100,000 people. Robberies were also down in the south, falling 32.4 percent in the north-western region of Val D'Aosta, 18.6 percent in the southern Calabria region, and 7.5 percent in Sicily. Sicily still leads the field as far as robberies are concerned, however, with 137 per 100,000 inhabitants. Puglia follows, with 65.
