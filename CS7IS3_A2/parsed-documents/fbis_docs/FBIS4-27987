Fujimori, who arrived in Japan on Sunday for a four-day unofficial visit, made the call in a meeting with former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, aides to the Japanese political leader said. Kaifu was quoted as saying that APEC, established in November 1989 as a loose consultative body, should be open in nature. He offered to convey Peru's desire to concerned parties. APEC, which currently has 17 members representing about 40 percent of the world's population, agreed last November to freeze new membership for three years. It links Australia, Canada, Brunei, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. Chile will be made a full member at an informal summit in November. While Japan has urged fellow members to allow Peru to participate in the forum's working group meetings, no consensus has been reached on the matter. Fujimori is due to leave Wednesday for China for an official visit.
