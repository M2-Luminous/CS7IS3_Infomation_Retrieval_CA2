UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] leader Jonas Savimbi said in an interview with AFP today that he ruled out the military victory of one side or the other. He called for a global cease-fire. [passage omitted] Still about Angola, let us go back to the situation there in the light of the visit the Angolan head of state, Mr. dos Santos, made to Paris. We heard today that President dos Santos received N'zita Henrique Tiago, the leader of the FLEC-FAC [Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave--Armed Forces of Cabinda] a few days ago, on the occasion of his official visit in France. The FLEC-FAC is one of the branches fighting for the independence of Cabinda. It is the first time that the Angolan president has met the leader of the FLEC-FAC, one of the two movements on Cabinda territory. Farida Ayari reports: [Ayari] During a 45-minute meeting with N'zita Henrique Tiago, President dos Santos suggested a cease-fire to the FLEC-FAC leader, so that negotiations on the future of Cabinda could be started. N'zita Tiago welcomed this proposal. He asked the Angolan head of state to send him an official letter to confirm his position. The FLEC-FAC leader reiterated the demands of his movement, that is, the evacuation of Cabinda territory by the Angolan political and military forces, the organization of a referendum on self- determination, and the establishment of Cabindan institutions. Jose Eduardo dos Santos pointed out that there were other FLEC branches and said that it was necessary to take everyone's opinion into account. In this respect, N'zita Tiago asked the Angolan president to withdraw his troops from the north and the center of Cabinda, so that a conference with all Cabindan political movements could be organized in the enclave. The aim of the conference would be to reach a common position, which would then be presented to the Angolan government. This meeting at the top is vital because the FLEC-FAC -- and, to a lesser extent, Jose Tiburcio Luemba's renovated FLEC -- is the most significant Cabindan movement fighting for independence. It is also the only one controlling territories in the Cabinda enclave, which produces 60 percent of Angolan oil.
