Chacal, head of the 380 Northern Front [FN-380], granted an exclusive interview with Radio Corporacion. He discussed a report, disseminated by some media, that Honduran troops had been dispatched to the Nicaraguan border. Chacal denied that the Honduran troops had been deployed because of the presence of the FN-380 and explained that the Honduran troops had been mobilized to check the actions of criminal gangs on Honduran territory. This movement is unrelated to FN-380 troops. Talavera also told us that the negotiations initiated this morning to discuss the problem of land ownership will resume in a few minutes. Here are some of Talavera's remarks. [Begin recording] [Talavera] We have no reports that this mobilization has anything to do with FN-380. We do know that troops have been dispatched to the northern border with Nicaragua to try to counter a crime wave in the area. But this mobilization has nothing to do with FN-380. The media that reported on this mobilization have been manipulating the reports. FN-380 troops are stationed in various places, the location of which has been negotiated with the government and the Army, in the area of Quilali and Jicaro. Most of our troops are gathered on the outskirts of Quilali, Nueva Segovia. We do not rule out the truth of reports on a crime wave in Honduras. There are always armed men who infiltrate, but in this particular instance there are armed bands that do not belong to FN-380. Consequently, reports in the Nicaraguan media are not objective and are rather hampering the negotiations, for which we cannot be held responsible. Just as there are criminal gangs on the border with Honduras, so there are in the center of Nicaragua. They might be either Nicaraguans or Hondurans. Anyway, these gangs have nothing to do with our organization. Such activities contravene our principles. We have always opposed and fought crime. We are responsible and honest people, intent on helping the Nicaraguan people and society. Therefore, we reiterate that these actions have nothing to do with us. [end recording] Regarding the situation in Jinotega, where the Sandinist National Liberation Front opposes the Nicaraguan Government's plan to fill National Police positions with members of the FN-380, Talavera said the National Assembly's government commission, headed by Andres Robles, has already solved this problem and that commisison members will continue to talk during a meeting set to open in a few minutes. Talavera also said that the Nicaraguan Government has made good on its promises on education by appointing a number of teachers in rural areas of the country's north, where before there were only few teachers. In health care, the Nicaraguan Government has also been complying with the agreements signed by the FN-380 and the government. A meeting will open in a few minutes that will end for good the demobilization of members of the FN-380. Talavera said the meeting will be attended by CIAV [International Commission for Support and Verification] Director General Celso Caramagna, as well as by government, INRA [National Agrarian Reform Institute], FN-380, Finance Ministry, and National Development Bank delegates. The latter will be present because the FN-380 seeks financing for the land they are demanding from the government.
