Although energy consumption declined by 7.8 percent in 1993 compared with the previous year and even by 12.8 percent in industry, energy consumption by the population increased by 30 percent. In addition, energy enterprises owe suppliers 4.1 trillion karbovantsi. According to information from the State Committee for Atomic Energy, new nuclear fuel was not purchased in the second half of 1993 because of a shortage of funds and spent fuel was not transported to Russia. Available resources should be exhausted in six months time. Plans of the Ukrainian power engineering sector for 1994 include purchasing 26 billion cubic meters of gas, seven million metric tons of fuel oil and 32 metric metric tons of coal including 20 metric metric tons through direct agreements.
