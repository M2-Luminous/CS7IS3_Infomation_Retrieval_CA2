This is the first time the head of the Vietnamese Government has paid an official visit to the CIS states since the dissolution of the former Soviet Union. For historical reasons, Vietnam economy had close relations with the former Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries. Annual import value of Vietnam from the former Soviet Union reached over $1 billion. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Hanoi quickly established relations with the CIS community to maintain the traditional economic cooperation. Since then some important changes have taken place, and the reality has forced Vietnamese leaders to adjust their external relations. In addition to actively seeking cooperation from its neighbor countries in the region to invest in Vietnam, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet also visited a number of Western European countries last year, thus obtaining significant economic benefit to Vietnam, leading to the cooperation between Vietnam and the European community. In the meantime, the situation of relations between Vietnam and Russia and other CIS countries was not as good as expected. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Vietnamese-Russian relations experienced a cold period. In 1993, the two sides began to resume bilateral economic and trade relations but only to an insignificant extent. The total trade turnover in the year was only $300 million. In addition to over 10 major projects that originated in the Soviet era, there were no new projects set up in the last two or three years. The joint venture enterprises between Vietnam and Russia and other CIS states are basically small factories. Development of cooperative relations with Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, the three developed industrialized states in the CIS community, is not only important to the development of Vietnam, but it is also the starting point for the development of cooperative relations with other states in the CIS community. Both Vietnamese leaders and the public, therefore, highly regarded the recent visit to the CIS states by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. Because of a number of concrete difficulties, both Hanoi and Kiev this time expressed wishes to step up cooperative relations. If flowers blossom in the spring, then the fruit will come in the autumn. It is just natural that the people put their hope in the visit this time of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. In Kazakhstan, both sides hoped for beneficial cooperation in agriculture, oil and gas, mining, and light industry. The visit to Russia was certainly the most important leg of the visit to the three states by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. Summing up the visit, Russian public opinion maintains that the visit and the meetings of the leaders brought the Vietnamese-Russian relations to an important period. But the Russian-Vietnamese friendship treaty has also left a profound impression. We could say that the purpose of the Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit is to reaffirm the basic conceptions of bilateral relations or to adjust the regrettable cold relations in the last several years. The Russian-Vietnamese basic friendship treaty replaces the Soviet-Vietnamese treaty signed in 1978, which announced the termination of the association between the two countries formed in special historical conditions. The new treaty stipulates that the two countries carry out negotiations only in cases of crisis, and this is likely to be the foundation for relations in the future. It is only natural that when the circumstances change the foundation should change, too. However, with a new foundation, many issues in the relations must also be reviewed. For example, the discrepancies between the two sides in bilateral and international issues include repayment of debts that Vietnam had with the former Soviet Union, the lease of Cam Ranh Bay of Vietnam to Russia, and so forth. If these issues are openly discussed, people may be anxious about whether a basic treaty could be signed. Due to many urgent public engagements, President Yeltsin could not hold a meeting with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet as previously planned, and the two sides agreed to cancel it, but the visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet was not wasted. Besides the Russian-Vietnamese friendship treaty, the two sides also signed bilateral cooperation agreements, such as the agreement on encouragement and protection of investment. Both Moscow and Hanoi believe that they have the necessary potential to carry out favorable cooperation in the fields of politics, foreign trade, science and technology, and so forth. Vietnam, Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan are all seeking new roads for economic development. The development of mutually beneficial cooperation should be their common demand and aspiration. Though they still face some difficulties, good results will eventually come.
