The reason for the PRC's relay of such a letter to South Korean companies may have been spurred by North Korea perhaps lodging a strong protest to the Chinese Government following rumors that South Korean companies are helping North Korean fugitives. A South Korean Government official said on 8 May: "We have been informed by companies in Yanbian that the PRC sent a letter to Haninhoe requesting that they neither protect nor help North Korean fugitives, but concentrate on business."
