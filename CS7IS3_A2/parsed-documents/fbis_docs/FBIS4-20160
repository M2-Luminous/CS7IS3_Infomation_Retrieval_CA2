The Catalan premier gave these explanations in Tel Aviv during a two-day stay on the occasion of the European basketball final, of which he took advantage in order to maintain economic and political contacts. Warning After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, Pujol told journalists at the Spanish Embassy that he "feels a need to point out" that the support for the government has been constant and thoroughgoing, and that an effective change has been achieved in economic policy, but as far as the turnaround in autonomy is concerned, "the results are very limited, and I would not like any member of the government to believe that the autonomy sphere is something secondary."
