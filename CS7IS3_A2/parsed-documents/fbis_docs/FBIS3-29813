Twenty-two political parties and organisations of Peru including the Socialist Political Action Party, the Communist Party and the General Confederation of Workers, released a joint statement on February 6. The statement manifested full support and firm solidarity for the cause of the Workers' Party of Korea, the DPRK Government and people for defending their sovereignty and system chosen by themselves and for peace on the Korean peninsula and peaceful reunification of the country. It appealed to all the political parties, governments and peoples of the world who value peace and justice to support and encourage the DPRK's just stand for a solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula. Seven political parties and organisations of Pakistan including the Socialist Party, the Pakistan Organisation for Afro-Asian People's Solidarity and the Federation of Trade Unions issued a joint statement on February 8 urging the United States to approach the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks with a sincere attitude and position. The statement said that if the U.S. Administration really has a willingness to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in a peaceful way, it must honestly implement the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and not drive the situation to a catastrophe. Five organisations of Tanzania, including the Youth Union and the Scientific and Technical Association in a joint statement on February 3 said that the United States must renounce the policy of strength and immediately withdraw its troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea, mindful that a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula would bring irreparable grave consequences to the Korean people and the world people. A former general of Greece, George Pattas, chairman of the Western European Committee for Korea's Reunification and Peace, in a press statement on February 6 said that the U.S. hardline conservative forces are deliberately straining the situation by threatening to deploy even Patriot missiles in South Korea in a bid to overpower North Korea militarily. This will only result in obstructing an early and peaceful solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula through DPRK-U.S. talks, he added.
