FBIS4-57973 "drlat103_j_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-103 Daily Report 22 May 1994 Panama Foreign Minister-Designate Interviewed Foreign Minister-Designate Interviewed PA2605122794 Panama City TVN Television Network in Spanish 1600 GMT 22 May 94 PA2605122794 Panama City TVN Television Network Spanish BFN [Interview with Foreign Minister-designate Gabriel Lewis Galindo by Luz Maria Noli at the TVN Network studios in Panama City; date not given; from the "Dialogue" program -- recorded] [Text] [Lewis] Thank you very much for inviting me. I am very grateful to be here with you. [Noli] Sir, what will be the foreign ministry's main goal? [Lewis] Well, Luz Maria, the main goal is to contribute to Perez Balladares' number one priority, which is to improve the living conditions of Panamanians through the creation of well-paid jobs. To contribute to this, we plan to create a new Panamanian diplomacy, which besides addressing bilateral issues with other governments, will also be an instrument to promote our country. I believe the diplomatic corps has been ill-used. I believe the diplomatic corps should have important functions in promoting investments in our country and promoting the sale of our products. I also believe it is a priority task to secure scholarships for Panamanians. Here we are always under the impression that our geographical position is our country's greatest asset. I do not share that opinion. The greatest asset of any country is the education of its people. We have to radically improve the Panamanian educational level. I do not foresee shirt-making plants here. I think we must prepare ourselves for the 21st Century so Panamanians will have skills, through education, to be able to have jobs requiring technological knowledge. [Noli] You are aware that during the seventies, Panama conducted a diplomatic offensive that put this country's name on the map. How is your diplomatic offensive going to differ from that of the seventies based on your projections for the foreign ministry today? [Lewis] Dr. Balladares believes as I do, that diplomacy should be conducted on a one-on-one basis, the same way that General Omar Torrijos carried it out during the seventies. Proof of this is that on Friday, President Perez Balladares; Jose Luis Sossa, Perez Balladares' national security adviser; and I were in Costa Rica. In Costa Rica, we discussed issues of great importance to the two nations. We are going to establish joint policies on how to fight drug-trafficking, on border disputes, and on a range of issues that cannot be solved through diplomatic notes. They must be solved, as the late Gen. Torrijos used to say, between the pitcher and the catcher. That is what I propose to do in cooperation with Dr. Perez Balladares. Tomorrow, the three of us leave for Santa Fe de Bogota to discuss with President Cesar Gaviria and his team steps for cooperation in many areas. One of them is drug-trafficking, which is one of Dr. Perez Balladares' priorities. In this way, we can try to change Panama's bad image abroad. [Noli] You have mentioned our two neighboring countries. As I recall, in the seventies there was a saying that we should have an extraordinary relationship with those countries next to which we sleep. And I remember that at that time, Costa Rican President Daniel Oduber, if I am not mistaken, said that whatever Panama says, Costa Rica will follow. Do you hope relations with our neighbors will maintain the same excellent status of that time? [Lewis] Well, of course. Without having yet taken possession of the foreign ministry, I have already spoken a number of times with Costa Rican President Jose Figueres, with whom I have a great friendship dating back to his father's time. [Noli] Also, at that time there was a relationship with another country -- the United States of America. It was a relationship of friendship and partnership, and you were a protagonist of that relationship at a time when you could enter the White House practically unannounced, something which was very difficult for other ambassadors to do. [Lewis] Luz, I am going to tell you something. Being a nobody, I lunched with President Reagan while he was president, and recently I was in the White House having lunch with some very important officials. I did not see President Clinton, who was at a news conference. But I can tell you that I have maintained the ties I made with important people in the United States when I was ambassador in 1977, and that my circle of friends in Washington has increased. They feel great respect for me and I for them. Consequently, in this atmosphere of mutual respect and dignity, I believe I can be of service to my country. As a matter of fact, I was already retired because every cloud has a silver lining. When Noriega exiled me in 1989 -- and I spent three years in exile -- my sons took charge of all the family businesses. When I returned in 1990 [year as heard], I found that my children had done a better job than I had. So I was unemployed and I retired to a life of resting and reading. Truthfully, when Dr. Perez Balladares invited me to join him -- he being a president elected by the Panamanian people with a tried and proven interest in creating a national reconciliation government -- my conscience would not permit me to reject his offer. I believe what President Kennedy said on one occasion: Ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what you can do for your country. That is why I am here today. And I have great confidence Dr. Perez Balladares will move forward. He has the best intentions to make our country morally and economically sound. [Noli] Tell me something. Let us talk about a partnership and friendship with the United States. How are you going to accomplish that? [Lewis] I think the relationship between Panama and the United States should be conducted very closely between our foreign ministry and the U.S. Embassy, and our embassy in Washington has to play a very important role. In the United States, there are different power centers. The legislative branch is a great power in the United States. That is a real democracy. One has to make contact on a personal basis and I am certain that the person proposed by Dr. Perez Balladares as ambassador in Washington will be able to fully carry out all these activities. I think our relationship with the United States needs serious attention. This has to be done with great professionalism, with much dignity, and with mutual respect. The United States is our friend, and we should perceive it as our friend. Today, it is the most powerful nation in the world and we should capitalize on the very special relationship we have with the nation. I do not in any way believe that the relationship with the United States should be conducted through blocs. We must speak with the United States as equals, with respect, but within a relationship beneficial to our interests. We cannot view the United States from a regional point of view. [Noli] Does that mean that when we talk with the United States it will not be through the Central American bloc or any other bloc? Are we are going to talk as partners? [Lewis] Talking with the United States through a regional bloc would mean losing our special relationship with the United States versus the rest of the countries. [Noli] Tell me something about speaking with partners and friends. How does that fit in with a certain part of the population that feels that the U.S. bases should remain here for economic reasons? [Lewis] Look we, and when I say we I mean the group that supported Gen. Torrijos, were determined to let future generations decide the relationship between the United States and Panama whichever way they believed was in the best interests of Panama. I remember that after the signing of the treaties at the OAS, Gen. Torrijos, who was my guest at the embassy, told me something that is still very clear in my mind. He said: Gabriel, we have fulfilled our mission. We have removed the ill-fated perpetuity clause from the treaties with the United States, and now a new generation will have to decide if it is in Panama's best interest to have the U.S. stay in the country after the year 2000. That is the prerogative of the new generation. I never expected, however, to be involved in the decision of the next generation. That makes me the oldest among the youngest. [Noli] Don Gabriel, from 1970 until 1994 -- there are 24 years in there, if my math is correct, right? -- the world has suffered dramatic changes in this period. For example, the Soviet Union is no longer the Soviet Union, the Berlin wall does not exist, and there is a situation in East European countries that is totally different from the Yugoslavia of Josip Broz Tito. To try to achieve a diplomatic offensive in this changing world and occupy the position we once held, will that not leave us a bit out of sync with the present? [Lewis] We are pressed for time, but the capacity of the Panamanian people is great. If we can assemble an adequate team and do things properly, I think that within six months of President Perez Balladares' inauguration, we should be able to change our image. This will require shock treatment. It cannot be done slowly. The change has to be dramatic. We have to do heroic things to gain the confidence of foreign investors and foreign powers. We have to make sure they are fully aware, first of all, that we can operate the Panama Canal efficiently. We have to get rid of Panama's bad name in terms of drugs. We have to do this in earnest, not just with lip service or by simply saying we want to change. We have to do it with actions. Listen, this has been a family slogan since the first Lewis arrived here at the beginning of the 19th Century: Deeds, not words. Therefore, I propose to uphold the family motto and to do precisely this. I firmly believe that Dr. Perez Balladares, more than anyone else, is interested in getting this done. We have to do it quickly, through conversations with the U.S. Government, the Colombian Government, and the Costa Rican Government, which are, for obvious reasons, the countries most involved with us in terms of drug trafficking. As soon as we begin to take positive steps and have the necessary ties to make the international media perceive our country differently, things will change quickly. Can you imagine, the other day a French banker came to see me and said, man, I feel sorry for the Panamanian people. In Paris, I heard on television that there had been honest elections in Panama. That is great, but the report added that Panama is a country whose economy depends, to a large extent, on drug trafficking. There is no one to refute this. If we do not assemble a good team made up of highly professional people, and if we do not do it quickly -- because, as I say, these things have to be changed with shock treatment -- we cannot accomplish this on a long-term basis. I believe that if Dr. Perez Balladares' government does indeed internalize what I am proposing, I think we will change our image quickly. Nevertheless, Luz, I cannot go out and say that this lady is a virgin, and then have it proven that she lives in a brothel. The internal and external image have to be one and the same. I hope we can achieve this, because Dr. Perez Balladares has great leadership abilities. He has the support of the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party], the largest political party in the country, which I think is convinced that structural changes are needed to improve the condition of all Panamanians. The world is headed toward the globalization of markets, toward a number of ecological changes, and toward the improvement of its inhabitants through education. Just take the case of Costa Rica. While we are dealing with all these issues, Costa Rica has been advancing, has been taking advantage of the situation. Costa Rica has embassies that are always looking for business prospects. They have attracted an enormous amount of foreign investments. The last time I was there, I learned that Costa Ricans estimate they have $100 million in investments for reforestation. The production of energy has become a problem for the ozone layer. When electricity is generated, certain gases are released into the atmosphere and one method of fighting this is to make the world green again. The investment in reforestation in the United States is tax deductible, and Costa Rica has skillfully managed to make investments in reforestation in Costa Rica also tax deductible. Consequently, many investors from affected companies have moved to Costa Rica with pleasure because of the peaceful atmosphere and the democracy that reigns in that country, a democracy that we have just recently acquired. So we are on the right path. [Noli] Mr. Lewis, you are an entrepreneur. You are a businessman. Now you are going to be the foreign minister. How are you going to reconcile being a businessman in the private sector and suddenly being a government official in such a delicate position as the foreign minister? [Lewis] Luz, first of all I want to say that I am going to organize a group of talented people about me. It is the same as when you are going to establish a new business. A large part of the success of a new business is the people with whom you surround yourself. This is one of the reasons I have always organized businesses by surrounding myself with specialists. I asked Dr. Omar Jaen to be my deputy minister because he is very talented, very well educated, and very respected by the diplomatic corps. He will attend to all those things in which I am ignorant but in which he has an overabundance of knowledge. I have also asked Dr. Jaen to begin a specialized study of the characteristics of each embassy, what is required, an outline of the type of ambassador that should be assigned there. I do not want ambassadors assigned because they are so-and-so's uncle, brother, or son, but people who can represent Panama in the exterior as it should be represented. I was very ashamed the other day when a very prestigious diplomat of a friendly country, who came to observe the elections, talked at length with me, and told me that his foreign office was very upset with Panama. I asked him why. He said because of the quality of ambassadors we send them. Our ambassadors are very poorly paid. They are people who wind up in all kinds of activities, all the way from drug trafficking to the illegal sale of cars. These people ruin our country's image. I do not agree that our embassies should be only for people with large resources. Of course, there are some rich people who are very well qualified, but there are also people who are not well off but who can represent Panama with pride. I do not want to reinvent the wheel. Around the world, there are diplomats from every country and you do not hear a scandal about them -- that they smuggled cigarettes into the country, that they were involved in drug trafficking, or that they falsify and sell passports -- for the simple reason that those countries pay their foreign representatives salaries in keeping with the economic situation of each one of them. And this practice is generalized. We are one of the few countries in which the ambassador to a certain country, if he is the president's friend or the foreign minister's friend, will try to get extra money from another fund or from an autonomous institution. That has to be stopped. I was talking with a Panamanian career diplomat who told me that what is important is to reorganize this ministry so that things are done as they are done in other countries. There is a report which the World Bank updates every three months, and another from the IMF which indicates the cost of living in every country. Those in charge of forwarding the salaries and representational expenses to the embassies and diplomats abroad abide by these reports automatically. If the cost of living goes up in Buenos Aires or goes down in Tegucigalpa or Tokyo, the salaries go hand in hand with these changes. You cannot send an ambassador to a certain country and have his salary be insufficient to cover his rent. [Noli] What you are saying is that the people who will represent the country do not necessarily have to be career diplomats. You are also talking about a complete reorganization of the Foreign Ministry and of the salary allotments for each post. Is that what you are saying? [Lewis] I believe we need a general reorganization. To accomplish that I need the president's support, which of course I already have, and I also need support from the legislative branch. When it is time to discuss the Foreign Ministry, they must understand that we need to include the element of floating costs, which is something we have never seen here. If we do not, we will continue to have a unrespected diplomatic corps. I need them out there as vehicles for promotion of our country. That is why I want to look at the kind of image our ambassadors will need to project to each country. I do not want to send someone just because his wife cannot stand him or because he has no way of paying for his son's university, in which case the Human Resource Education and Training Institute should offer him a grant or a scholarship. We say we are a privileged nation, thanks to our geographical position. Our geographical position means nothing if we do not have the right people. Let us prepare them. That is why I want to bring scholarships from abroad. Take Singapore, for example. They have the same population as we do and they are one of the richest nations in the world today. It has nothing to do with geographical position, that is absurd. It is because of its people's capability. This was only possible over time, mind you, as this could never be achieved overnight. I may not even witness it here, but you will, because you are quite young. [Noli] [Laughing] How diplomatic you are! [Lewis] Just think. The government of Singapore will pay all the expenses of anyone who is admitted to one of the top ten U.S. universities; MIT, Harvard, Stanford, or the like. The person agrees to return to Singapore and work for the government or private enterprise. The individual becomes a capital investment for Singapore. Frankly speaking, after a few years we could go out into the world and sell Pananamian capability, then all kinds of enterprises will set up shop here. [Noli] You spoke about the embassies and the kind of ambassadors we want. Rumor has it that Jorge Illueca will be at the United Nations; Ricardo Alberto Arias will be in Washington; Aristides Royo in Paris; Aquilino Boyd in London; and I believe the last person to be mentioned for the embassy in Spain was a woman. Is this in accordance with what you are saying now? [Lewis] Let me be a little indiscrete with Mr. Perez Balladares. Mr. Perez Balladares and I select all of those names, except for Spain, but because of diplomatic protocol we should not make any announcements until we receive the approval from the host countries. The only one I have officially announced is Jorge Illueca. Any one of the people you listed could be confirmed as ambassador. They are all prominent citizens and we can feel proud about the work they will do. I am sure all of them clearly understand what Mr. Perez Balladares wants. We have to improve the quality of life for Panamanians and to do so we must attract foreign investment. He said so in Rambala again yesterday. [Noli] You know something? Panama is known for being a country of convenience. A short while ago, in the previous segment of the program, you told me that in six months we could change this country of convenience image. How will you do this in so short a time? [Lewis] I do not think I can do what you mention about Panama as a country of convenience. I mean the image of a country involved in drug trafficking, a country with a corrupt government. The country of convenience concept originated in 1936, when Dr. Harmodio Arias decreed that ships from other countries could be registered in Panama to lower their costs. That is much more complex and I have not even thought about it. I am not thinking about Paris or Tokyo newscasts doing us harm. What I want is to portray Panama as a safe country for investment. The most important thing is to have a democratically elected government. This is a priority requirement. If this is present, I am sure that Perez Balladares' team will quickly improve the Panamanian people's condition. But we need everyone's cooperation. One other thing, and this includes you, too. In a country trying to attract foreign investment, such as Costa Rica, there are agreements among all political forces. When it comes to attracting foreign capital, the government and the opposition will work in harmony. Some things must be accomplished by the government and the opposition working together. I think Mrs. Mireya de Gruber will be the opposition leader here. At some time, President Perez Balladares will have to sit down with her and say to her: We need this strategy to improve the Panamanian people's condition, but we need your cooperation. This is what civilized countries do. Let us not throw rocks at one another because it will be the sons and grandchildren of Balladares and Mrs. Mireya who will be hurt. We must move Panama forward. It is easy, provided we work together. [Noli] Tell me something, Mr. Gabriel. How will you implement this strategy you have outlined, considering that PRD is the government's political basis and, during the last years of what Juan Materno Vasquez describes as the ancienne regime, you were one of the most articulate opponents of the government led by Noriega? [Lewis] Very simple, Luz. As in every other party, in the PRD there are very good people and there are useless people, who have not distinguished themselves in any of the ways I have mentioned to you. The majority of the PRD people, nevertheless, agree with this criterion. I have talked with many of them. Remember, I worked closely with Gen. Torrijos and I am well acquainted with the PRD people, some of whom are very good. The bad thing is that the military had taken over the PRD and had taken the party prisoner, so to speak. I think those who most benefited from Noriega's ouster were the PRD members who are now free to lead a party independently. Previously, however, the PRD people were under the military's authority. For instance, one colonel might say: This is the policy. The PRD people are full of pride and self-esteem. Now they feel free, most of them at least. [Noli] Tell me something. Has a true effort been made during the Endara administration toward Panama's integration with Central America? To what extent will this new relationship that you intend to establish affect what has been done so far? [Lewis] Fortunately, as far as I know, the pledges made by the Endara government had to do with political and cultural agreements only. There is no agreement with Central America for economic integration. I say fortunately because, should we enter an economic market with Central America, we would be at a disadvantage. We would have to equate tariffs on all products with those established by the other Central American countries. Unlike the other Central American countries, we have a hard currency, the U.S. dollar. No industry would be established here. All of them would move to Tegucigalpa or San Salvador, where labor cost are far lower than in our capital. Consequently, the social cost of our incorporation into Central America would be similar to incorporating into NAFTA for the benefits that would be provided by a truly large market. We would have to pay a high social price and no additional jobs would be created in Panama. [Noli] Pardon me for interrupting, Mr. Gabriel. I am under the impression that the new approach of industrialized countries is as a bloc. For instance, NAFTA is made up of the United States, Mexico, and Canada. [Lewis] I can tell you a story. Guillermo Chapman, the new planning minister, has always had a dream. Panama is very fortunate for his having accepted the appointment because he has devoted his life to studying everything related to improving the Panamanian people's standard of living. Dr. Chapman visited me several times while I was in exile. One of the main topics we discussed was Panama's incorporation into the U.S. market. NAFTA had not yet come into being. After the invasion took place, Dr. Chapman and I discussed in depth the possibility of proposing to the United States the signing of a free trade agreement with Panama as part of a compensation. NAFTA had not been created. Can you imagine what would have happened had we incorporated ourselves into that market as part of the compensation? That would have been quite a different story. Panamanians would enjoy stable jobs and better living conditions. And there was a good climate for this proposal. We requested the current government file a request with President Bush, who would address the Congress to ask for compensation for Panama. But Congress never responded to our request. This was very frustrating for Dr. Chapman and I. I am sure, however, that, if we act with the new diplomacy that I intend to use.... [pauses] I have come to this ministry, not to get acquainted with people, but precisely because I know people. Since I am convinced of the value of interpersonal relations, I would like Panama to have an opportunity to advance this idea, but not as part of a bloc because the reasons for including Panama in it are not valid. On the one hand, we do not have their type of economy. On the other, we do not have special relations with one of the partners, the United States. But I would like Panama to have a rapprochement with Mexico. Mexico is our big brother. Mexico has implemented radical economic changes, and it constitutes a good example for us to follow. I am confident that the Mexicans, with whom we had very strained relations until recently, will soon become our big brothers again. Hopefully, Mexico and the United States will help us make a serious attempt to establish formal relations with Canada. We have virtually no relations with Canada since this country has no consulate or embassy in Panama, and all procedures must be conducted through Costa Rica. Establishing high-level relations with Canada would be one of our priorities. We are outlining the path -- as if we were managing a business -- we will follow to attain success. Dr. Chapman will play a leading role regarding the economy. I will be one of his instruments abroad to ensure the success of this endeavor. You are going to like the way we are going to work because the media and public relations element play a significant role in this entire project. We must have the support of all Panamanians, including the opposition, the government, the media, the people, everybody, to get Panama out of this mess. [Noli] Central American integration will not take place until the EEC decides to allocate the funds assigned to specific geographic areas. The funds have been earmarked for a specific geographic area called Central America, which implies that we could be part of that bloc. If we are not in the bloc, how will relations with the EEC be managed? [Lewis] The cost of joining that group and receiving those EEC funds, which are not that substantial either, is high because it deprives us of our capacity to negotiate directly with the United States. We must seek to preserve our bilateral relations with the United States rather than join any bloc. We should not join a regional bloc only because of the money Europeans will be giving out. The United States may like Panama very much, but if they can unload us by our joining a regional bloc, I believe they would be most happy to do it. I would feel the same way if I were in charge of U.S. foreign policy. What we must do is avoid that situation. This does not mean we want to offend any Central American nation, they understand us perfectly. I have talked to former Central American presidents such as Daniel Oduber, who is a dear friend of mine. They are truly aware that our situation and that our economy is different from their economies. [Noli] How will you tackle our relations with the Far East, namely Japan, especially now that Japan's situation vis-a-vis the United States has changed to such an extent that President Clinton is doing everything within his power to make U.S.-Japanese relations as harmonious and convenient for his nation as possible? [Lewis] I repeat, we are very lucky. I have traveled to Japan on many occasions; I have very good friends in Japan. The Japanese know that Panama cannot be treated as part of a bloc because Panama has a canal. Japanese trade depends heavily on the transit of vessels through the canal. We must capitalize on this. Japan is a difficult country to deal with, but there are specialists. We must specialize people. As I said, we must define the profile of each delegation we send to a particular country. The ambassador that we will send to Japan cannot have the same characteristics as the one who has to deal with the British. We must specialize. We must take into account the idiosyncrasies of each people. Moreover, I expect PRC traffic through the canal to increase in the early 21st century. We must begin to establish the necessary links with them. The Chinese are building what is thought will become one of the world's largest merchant marines. We must update ourselves. We must look ahead, we must plan what we will be doing in the year 2010, as serious countries would. The other day, Luz Maria, I visited a learning center in the United States that is drafting a plan on how medicines will be sold in the year 2010 and the pilot for this plan cost $150 million. The world knows that the clock does not stop. Everything stopped here, absolutely everything. The self-esteem of Panamanians dropped. I do not like this at all. We must raise our self-esteem. We must accomplish this by telling the people that we will overcome our problems if we all work together. The first step was taken last week when Mr. (Harold Bernstein) of Petroterminales visited Panama, and in the company of Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares, they announced investments of over $100 million. This is the most important foreign investment in the past 10 years. [Noli] But tell me something, to do all those things we need money. High self-esteem and jobs are obtained with money, but it seems that there is a connection there. What will you do to achieve this harmony? [Lewis] When I started to work, I did not have money for gasoline for my car. I did not steal one real [five centesimos] from anyone, but I managed to provide a comfortable life for my family. Luz Maria, improving Panama's image will help local commerce because people will not come to Panama if they feel that their safety is jeopardized. No one wants to come to Panama or get established in Panama due to the links to drug trafficking. Commerce and the Colon Free Zone will benefit if we manage to clean the country's image. I mean the honest ones in the Free Zone because we must get rid of the bad ones. I am sure that if we appeal to them, we will be able to raise a certain amount of money, say 1 or 2 million [not further specified] or whatever is required to move forward and sell [words indistinct]. Our plan seeks to build a new Panama within five years. We want to ensure that we will have many things established along our coastlines come the year 1999, when we will have to takeover the canal. We need to open up to the world. President Carter, with whom I have a very great personal friendship, and who heads the Carter Research Center, told me the other day: I am quite fascinated by these elections. I have not seen cleaner elections than Panama's. I would be willing to establish a team of people to invite to a seminar, figures from around the world who have business with the canal, to let them see the birth of a new Panama, that we have allies, that there are people who love us. [Noli] Dear viewers, this was a conversation with the man who will lead the foreign policy of the Republic of Panama beginning on 1 September.
