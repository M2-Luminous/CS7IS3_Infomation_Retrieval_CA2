FR941107-2-00042 FR941107-2-00010 Depreciation enables companies to spread large expenditures on purchases of machinery and equipment over the expected useful lives of these assets. Not adjusting for the devaluation of currency due to high inflation results in the depreciation deferred to future years being understated in constant currency terms, and, therefore, distorts the Department's COP and CV calculations. For these reasons, we have adjusted Hevensa's depreciation expense to reflect amounts based on the restated value of Hevensa's fixed assets. Comment 11: The petitioners assert that the Department should not deduct Hevensa's net exchange gain on financial assets and liabilities nor its net exchange gain on client accounts in its calculation of Hevensa's interest expense. The petitioners argue that because the net exchange gains on financial assets and liabilities are not related to the production of silicomanganese, the Department should not offset Hevensa's interest expense with these gains. With respect to exchange gains and losses on accounts receivable, the petitioners argue that Department policy does not permit such items to be used as an offset to interest expense. Hevensa argues that its net exchange gain on financial assets and liabilities should be treated in a manner similar to interest income on short-term financial assets. The respondent also states that the exchange gain or loss relates to a foreign deposit in which the total return is equal to the sum of the interest to be paid and the exchange gains and losses. DOC Position: We agree with the petitioners, in part. It is Department practice not to include exchange gains and losses on client accounts receivable because the exchange rate we use to convert third-country sales to U.S. dollars is that in effect on the date of the U.S. sale. ( See 19 CFR 353.60.) Accordingly, we have disallowed Hevensa's claimed foreign exchange gains on client accounts receivable. It is Department practice to include foreign exchange gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities in our COP and CV calculations where they are related to the company's production of the subject merchandise. Financial assets and liabilities are directly related to a company's need to borrow money, and we include the cost of borrowing in our COP and CV calculations. Therefore, we disagree with the petitioners and have included foreign exchange gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities in COP and CV. Comment 12: The petitioners assert that late payment penalties paid to suppliers and net exchange losses on purchases from suppliers should be reclassified as costs of manufacturing. The petitioners cite prior Department policy in which all costs directly associated with the purchasing of materials were included in material costs. Hevensa argues that because money is fungible, late payment penalties and net exchange losses on purchases from suppliers should be classified as a general expense, not as a cost of manufacturing. Hevensa notes that by borrowing working capital from its suppliers (by delaying its payments), it freed up its remaining cash to be used in other operations, and thus borrowing from these suppliers helped finance Hevensa's overall operations. DOC Position: We agree with the petitioners, in part. Foreign exchange gains and losses on the purchase of raw materials used in production of subject merchandise relate directly to the acquisition of the input materials and should be included in the cost of manufacture. Late payment penalties, which represent interest charges for late payment to suppliers, are directly related to management's decision on the usage of capital. Because the Department considers the cost of acquiring capital to be fungible, we believe these late payment penalties are classified appropriately as interest expense. Comment 13: The petitioners assert that Hevensa misallocated the cost of silicomanganese fines and manganese ore used in the production of Grade B lump silicomanganese. Hevensa divided the total costs of fines and manganese ore for the month by the total volume of Grade B lump and fines produced during the same month to obtain a monthly cost of fines and ore per unit of silicomanganese produced. Petitioners also assert that because Hevensa reported no sales of Grade B fines during the POI, Hevensa should have allocated the fines and ore cost only over the volume of Grade B lump and silicomanganese slag produced. Hevensa contends that it properly allocated cost to the Grade B silicomanganese fines produced, even though none were sold during the POI. The costs assigned to the fines are included in the inventory value of the fines, and then included in the submitted costs of manufacture when the fines are used in production. If no cost is assigned to fines generated during production, then no cost for fines used in production should be included in the submitted cost of manufacturing. DOC Position: We disagree with the petitioners. Hevensa did not misallocate the cost of silicomanganese fines and manganese ore. The costs assigned to the silicomanganese Grade B fines generated in the production process are the same costs assigned to silicomanganese Grade B fines reintroduced into the furnace. In our view, this methodology does not distort costs. Accordingly, no adjustment is necessary. Comment 14: The petitioners argue that Hevensa should include VAT on raw materials as part of its production costs for months that were subject to VAT. To exclude VAT on cost of materials from COP and CV would be contrary to Department practice. Hevensa argues that if the Department includes the value added taxes paid on inputs in the cost of production, it must also include the VAT received from its customers in the price for purposes of the sales below cost test. DOC Position: We agree with the respondent. The amount of VAT included in the home market COP should be the same as the amount that is included in the home market sales prices. For CV and third-country sales, no VAT on raw materials should be included. If the VAT is rebated by the government upon export, no VAT is added to CV on third country sales price in any event, pursuant to Section 773(e)(1)(a).
