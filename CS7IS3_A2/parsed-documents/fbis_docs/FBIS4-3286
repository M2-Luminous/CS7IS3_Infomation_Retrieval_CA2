Li, referring to the frequent exchange of visits between leaders of China and Central Asian nations, said "this signifies that relations between China and Central Asian nations have entered a new era." The friendship between the Chinese people and their counterparts in Central Asia dates back to ancient times, he said. "The Central Asian countries, as a main passage along the silk-road, contributed significantly not only to brisk commercial and cultural exchanges between Asia and Europe, but also to the advancement of civilization and progress of mankind," Li added. Today, with increasing contact with the rest of the world, the Central Asian nations are "writing new chapters" of promoting common development and friendly exchanges of Asia and Europe, he said. China attaches great importance to its relations with Central Asian countries and, together with them, "we are willing to work for the building of a new silk-road, with a perspective towards the future and the next century," Li said. Li summed up China's basic policy on developing relations with the Central Asian nations in four points. The first point is "maintaining goodneighborly relations and peaceful coexistence." China and Central Asian nations are close neighbors, with some sharing common borders, Li noted. "it is the shared desire of the Chinese and Central Asian peoples to be friendly neighbors, for it serves our fundamental interests." "As the Chinese people are concentrating on building up their own country, they need a long-term stable and peaceful international environment, a good surrounding environment in particular," he said. "We have always cherished a good will towards the Central Asian peoples, and will remain your good friends and neighbor forever," he noted. China seeks no self-interests or sphere of influence in the world, including this region, Li stated. "Even when China becomes more developed or prosperous in the future, it will never seek hegemonism or power politics, either. Instead, China will always maintain equal and friendly relations with its neighbors." "You can be fully confident that no matter what happens in the world, China will not change this policy," he said, stressing that "we keep our words." The second point is "promoting cooperation of equality and mutual benefit and seeking common prosperity." "Economic cooperation and trade are an important aspect of our bilateral relations," Li said, adding that "a good beginning has already been made, but much more remains to be done." In developing economic cooperation with the Central Asian nations, China strictly abides by the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and attaches no political conditions, the Chinese premier said. "We would like to work with all the Central Asian countries to constantly improve the environment, expand the scope and enhance the quality and level of cooperation, and with mutual benefit, march along the path of common development," he said. The third point of the policy is "respecting the independent choice of the Central Asian peoples and never interfering in their internal affairs." As the world is diversified, the national conditions of the Central Asian nations differ from each other, Li noted. "There has never been and can never be a unified mode of development that suits the realities of all countries," he said. "We believe that the Central Asian nations, just like China and other countries in the world, are entitled to independently choose the social system, concepts of values and path of development compatible with their national conditions." He expressed the conviction that the Central Asian nations are fully capable of "handling well their own matters." The fourth point Li stated is "respecting other countries' independence and sovereignty and contributing to regional stability." China sincerely hopes to see the maintenance of long-term peace and stability in central Asia, Li said. "We appreciate and support all efforts made by central Asian countries to safeguard their independence and sovereignty, promote regional peace and stability, and enhance friendship and cooperation among nations." "The development of our relations with any Central Asian nation is not directed against any third country, and we are willing to see the Central Asian countries living in harmony with each other," he said. Also, China is ready to develop friendly relations with all countries in the world, particularly the neighboring nations, including Russia and other CIS countries, Li said. "The development of Central Asian nations depends on world peace and stability, while the world needs a stable and prosperous Central Asia," he said.
