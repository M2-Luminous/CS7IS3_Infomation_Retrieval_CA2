It is being said in its support that the education of our students will be greatly enhanced. Is cheating on examinations the main problem in our educational system? Will this problem be resolved just by quickly stopping it, or by being soft about it? People who know about the problems in our education system and those with some basic understanding of the rules and regulations of our educational system may never recognize cheating on examinations as the root cause of our educational problems. The fact is that since independence, we have been avoiding looking at the main problem of our educational system. We have been looking for some superficial resolutions. The main problem of our educational system is not cheating on examinations; it is the present educational system itself. It is a dreadful contradiction in our national life that in our independent India, the educational system of our slave days is still being implemented. All the educators who belong to Lord Macaulay's "family" are following this slave system of education continuously. They are even trying to strengthen it. This is an established circle which is sometimes altered on the surface. However, all the basic problems remain where they are. The major problem with our educational system is that it is opposed to our personal, familial, social, and national life. It does not provide solutions to our problems; it has become a problem in itself. The students spend 18, 21, 25, and in some cases, as many as 30 years of the best years of their lives to earn this education. At the end, they get a certificate written on a piece of paper, which they hold in their hands as they wander around looking for employment. After years of wandering, they are lucky if they become a cog to fit in the present system. This only increases one more parasite in our society. If anyone still has good qualities, then despite this education, he still tries to remain a moral person and to do his job honestly. In most cases, one tries to take back one's educational investments with interest from the government and the society. This is because our present educational system does not teach morals and religion. This system does not even make them capable of becoming producers and creators to help build their lives, society, and the country. This education does not stir a desire in them to take risks, become an active citizen, break away from the life-style of slaves, and strive for creating an independent, democratic, and fair human organization. What will we gain by making these superficial changes in the examination system if we keep this educational structure? When the main goal is to become a capable consumer at any cost and to earn money, and there is no hesitation in our society to do anything to achieve this goal, then expecting a student to be honest on the examinations that help him get the certificate is analogous to expecting the impossible. If we look from one perspective, there should be no reason for a student to fail after working in school for a full year. If anyone should fail, it should be either the teacher or the guardians, or both of them. Why cannot we expect a student to achieve the expected goals after studying for a year? Do not the guardians or the teachers have any responsibility? It is an accepted principle in sociology that a government is best when it is involved in administration the least. In other words, there should be a minimum number of law- and consequence-based rules in social life. The society should run by its own good deeds. Education is a process of awakening good morals in a person. When the last step of this educational process, these so-called examinations, is the punishment, the law, and the police all in itself, we have to think what goals can we achieve with this kind of education. What will our present and future generations learn? Mulayam Singh Yadav has said that a committee of experts will be established to evaluate the present system and decide on a new educational system. This is a welcome announcement. Mulayam Singh has at least responded through this announcement to the accusations levied against him for "destroying the educational system." However, the basic question is not of the testing system; it is of the whole educational system. From the president to an average citizen, everyone believes, and has announced at one time or another, that the educational system needs an overhaul. Many commissions were established after independence, and nationwide discussions were also held. All the recommendations made by those commissions are still gathering dust somewhere. The Kothari Commission had recommended some basic and preliminary steps. Implementation of these would have opened a new door for educational reform--for example, the elimination of the degree requirement for a job. When one finished an educational program, the administrator would simply write how long the student had been in the course of study, and at what level he or she finished. The employer invites a candidate to test his knowledge and abilities, and to provide employment. The basis of employment would move from getting the certificates to one's actual ability. The teacher will also have the pressure to teach on time and finish a level at a specific time. The Kothari Commission has recommended a specific school that promised equal employment opportunities to all citizens under the Constitution. This recommendation would help remove the economic discrepancy in the educational system. The Kothari Commission recommendations, however, are collecting dust in the government's records room, and our progress is being made in the area of education that prepares for various jobs, and in selling 50 percent of these positions for money. Why is it happening that even government-appointed commissions' recommendations are being put in cold storage? Public schools (the specialist of these schools is that the general public cannot get admission to them) are implementing the recommendations made by the Navoday school. In a country which claims to follow democracy and equality in society, education that irrigates the roots of differences in our society should not be encouraged. Why did not this question become a subject of the peoples' uprising? Why are the steps to implementing the anti-cheating law considered to be providing balance to education and its recall destructive to the whole education system? This is because we want to avoid getting to the root of this problem. A veteran state leader and the education minister, who were criticizing the present educational system, were once asked by a Gandhian thinker and hard-working old man, "If everyone from you to the president are aware of the evils of the present educational system, then who is running this system?" The education ministers responded: "No one is running it. It runs by itself." This incident is about 27 to 28 years old. I would like to add to this comment: All those who have a vested interest in the present system are running it. These include bureaucrats, rich people, and leaders. Perhaps, to an extent, all of us who are not able to attain our goals, but who hope that they will have the opportunity to achieve them some day are part of this problem.
