The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of HIV Infection and Immunization and Infectious Diseases. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section ``Where to Obtain Additional Information''.)

Smoke-free workplace The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people. Eligible Applicants 1. Study on Hospitalization of TB Patients. Eligible applicants are the State and local health departments who are the current cooperative agreement recipients under Announcement 211 ``Tuberculosis Elimination Cooperative Agreements'', that reported 200 or more TB cases in 1993. Tuberculosis control programs that have a caseload of at least 200 new TB cases per year will assure an adequate proportion of hospitalizations, cases with HIV infection, or cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB among patients enrolled in the study. Applicants may either choose the entire project area or a selected area thereof from which to enroll patients; however, the selected area must have access to at least 200 cases per year. 2. Tuberculin Skin Testing Demonstration Projects . Eligible applicants are the State and local health departments who are the current cooperative agreement recipients under Announcement 211 ``Tuberculosis Elimination Cooperative Agreements'', that reported 100 or more TB cases in 1993. Applicants may either choose the entire project area or a selected area from it to include as part of the study; however, the selected area must have access to at least 100 cases per year. Applicants who meet the above stated eligibility criteria may apply for one or both of the projects referenced in this program announcement. Availability of Funds The total amount of funds expected to be available to supplement TB elimination cooperative agreements is $1,250,000. It is expected that awards will begin on or about August 1, 1994, and will be made a part of the remaining FY 1994 budget period ending January 31, 1995. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. 1. Study on Hospitalization of TB Patients. Approximately $350,000 is available to fund 7&hyph;10 projects. Awards are expected to range from $35,000 to $50,000. Projects are expected to be completed within 36 months. 2. Tuberculin Skin Testing Demonstration Projects. Approximately $900,000 is available to fund 4&hyph;5 projects. Awards are expected to range from $150,000 to $200,000. Projects are expected to be completed within 24 months.

Funds may not be used to supplant State or local health department funds available for TB control, provide inpatient care, purchase drugs, or to support construction or renovation of facilities. Purpose 1. Study on Hospitalization of TB Patients . The purpose of this project is to determine: (1) the rate of hospitalizations for persons with active TB, including hospitalizations connected with the initial diagnosis of TB, (2) indications for, and the costs of, these hospitalizations, (3) the length of stay for these hospitalizations, (4) the impact of HIV infection on hospitalization and hospitalization costs of TB patients, and (5) the impact of MDR-TB on hospitalization and hospitalization costs of TB patients.
