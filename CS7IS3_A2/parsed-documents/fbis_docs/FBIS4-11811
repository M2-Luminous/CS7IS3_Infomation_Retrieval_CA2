It said that previously when other passenger planes happened to fly over the area Moscow would immediately inform the commander of Armenian forces of the scheduled flight over the airspace of Armenia to make sure that the plane would not be shot down, but that in the case of the Iranian plane none of the navigation systems in the region operated as responsibly as they should have. The commentary also noted that immediately after the news of the downing of the plane broke out on the media Moscow suggested that the Iranian passenger plane had been flying over the region for reconnaissance purposes. "The Russians having been traditionally slow in their responses to current developments, their unwonted haste in publicizing that suggestion makes their purpose all too transparent," it added. The C-130 bound for Tehran from Moscow with families of Iranian diplomats in Russia on board, exploded in mid air and crashed in Karabakh moments after it contacted Yerevan airport control tower at 19:10 hours GMT. There were no survivors among the 32 passengers and crew including 17 women on board. After due investigations by an expert sent to the site of the crash by Iran, the Foreign Ministry has confirmed that the plane was missiled down by Armenian troops. The commentary in ABRAR said "whether the downing of the Iranian plane was the result merely of negligence on the part of the systems in Armenia or it was imposed on that country as a plot, Armenia would do itself good to evaluate the mishap independent of the insinuations of the outsiders and assume responsibility for it, and do something by way of appeasing her neighbor Iran." "Or else," the paper warned, "the incident will remain for ever a thorny issue in the relations between Armenia and her neighbor Iran."
