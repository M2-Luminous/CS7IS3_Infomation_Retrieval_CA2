In compliance with the terms of the Trade Related to Investment Measures (Trims) agreement which was developed under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), the Board of Investment (BoI) is among other things cancelling the export privileges it granted to manufacturing plants located in investment Zone 2 within five years of the enactment of the Gatt agreements. In order to retain their privileges they will have to relocate their plants from Zone 2 covering 10 provinces in the central region, to more remote areas in Zone 3. During an interview yesterday Sathaphon Kawitanon, BoI secretary-general, discounted concerns about local industries. He believes the local industries should be strong enough to stand on their own feet. Moreover, BoI is considering a reformulation of the tariffs charged to the local auto-assembling industry, along with a BoI plan to make industry-wide the tax treatment granted as an exception to the Mitsubishi assembly plant. [passage omitted] Sathaphon said in 1985 the BoI had to introduce the investment incentives to promote foreign investment in order to boost the export substitution industry and the local economy after the devaluation of the baht. He said the current situation does not require such government incentives, however, because local industries have gained wider economies of scale. "The export requirement is no longer necessary," Sathaphon said. He noted, however, that the government might have to maintain the export requirement in certain industrial sectors. The new wave of Japanese investment is likely to be aimed at supporting industries, he said. The Board of Investment has forecast that American and Japanese investors are likely to focus on the automobile industry. He said the Board of Investment, therefore, plans to grant more incentives to the automobile industry. Officials have already completed a draft reformulation of a new tariff structure for the industry, but Sathaphon declined to elaborate on the plan. Sathaphon said only that the continuation of the privileges would depend on key determinants such as proper tariff rates for the auto-assembling industry and the differences between investment conditions for plants under the BoI plan and plants without investment privileges. Sathaphon predicted that the next wave of Japanese industrial investment will be mainly in small- to medium-size plants, because all the major Japanese producers already have plants in Thailand. He added that last year Japanese investments in Thailand were greater in value than their investments in any other country in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The recession in Japan should not have a major impact on its investment in Thailand, as "during the peak period, Japanese investments here accounted for only two per cent of total Japanese investment," he said.
