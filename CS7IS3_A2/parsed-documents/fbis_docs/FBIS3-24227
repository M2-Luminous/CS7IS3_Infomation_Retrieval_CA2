Our correspondent met with Morley Dupree, manager of Tengizchevroil, and conducted with him the interview that is offered the reader today. [Sutyagin] It is planned initially at the Tengiz deposit to produce 60,000 barrels of oil a day and subsequently to raise production to 700,000 barrels. The terms of the contract specify that Chevron shall in the first three years invest in the production of oil $1.5 billion, from which Kazakhstan is to receive $805 million net profit. Several vitally important facilities, powerful water-purification installations, and a boiler house have been and continue to be built, and engineering systems are being modernized in the oblast from Chevron's resources paid out as a bonus for the right to work on Atyrau land, and money has been allocated for the development of medicine. Mr. Dupree, negotiations were conducted for quite some time between the Soviet Union and, subsequently, sovereign Kazakhstan, and Chevron on the right to develop the Tengiz deposit. A contract was signed. I would like to know: What did you imagine work at Tengiz to be like and what have you encountered in practice? [Dupree] I would like to affirm first of all that our expectations of finding in the oblast people who could work at our enterprise have been borne out. When we came here, two integrated production lines (IPL) were already operating, and the construction of IPL-3 had begun. But the point is that problems of the shipment of the oil to ports with terminals had not been resolved. Our primary task was to put IPL-1 on a sound footing, fully equip IPL-2 from the safety standpoint, and find a market for the oil that could be produced and refined by the gas-treatment plant. The construction of IPL-3, say, had from our viewpoint, therefore, to be suspended, inasmuch as it would at that time have been simply unprofitable to scatter our forces. The main problem now is selling the oil that has been produced. And we have been unable as yet, unfortunately, to solve this question completely. The point being that Kazakhstan lacks its own oil line, via which it could ship the oil to the international market. All this is giving rise to a whole chain of difficulties. [Sutyagin] Would it not be better to refine the oil in situ, having engaged the capacity of Kazakhstan's refineries, Atyrau primarily? [Dupree] I am forced to remind you that from the very outset, the contract was based on all the oil recovered at this deposit being exported and the entire revenue being obtained from exports of crude. It will not be refined in situ. Gas is another matter. There could here be various options, which we are beginning to study with the government of the republic. [Sutyagin] And how do you view the idea of the construction of an oil pipeline from Iran with an outlet at the Red Sea? [Dupree] There are two very important aspects in the construction of this pipeline, I believe. The economic aspect entailing enormous expenditure and not completely weighed benefits. And the political aspect: The oil pipeline would run over the territory of Iran. Who could guarantee that Iran would not tomorrow say "no" to the oil pipeline or ban the shipment of oil for some reason or other? We are, meanwhile, on the other hand, studying more acceptable ways, from our viewpoint, of the shipment of the oil. These include, primarily, the Caspian Consortium project incorporating Kazakhstan, Russia, and Oman. A solution of the problem may be found also in the creation of transport routes to the Black Sea by Tengizchevroil directly. But I am not a utopian, and I realize that this problem will not be fully resolved in the coming three to five years. [Sutyagin] But can the joint venture reach design capacity in this case? [Dupree] This is not currently part of our tasks. The joint venture has many other unresolved problems. Everyone knows that Tengiz oil is unique in terms of its composition. I refer primarily to its very high hydrogen sulfide content. We are building a plant to treat the oil, therefore, and we would like in the very near future to have achieved a volume of production of 6-7 million tonnes a year--this is perfectly sufficient as yet. Such a quantity of oil cleansed of hydrogen sulfide and other harmful admixtures could be shipped across Russia via the Druzhba oil pipeline. After we have laid our own transport line, for which, I hope, it is planned to produce 12 million tonnes a year, the planned production of 30 million tonnes will be achieved only by the year 2010. Fewer than 1 million tonnes have been produced and shipped thus far. We hope to obtain permission for the construction of our own oil pipeline. In this case, we would embark immediately on equipping IPL-3, in order that we might increase production, raising it to the maximum. [Sutyagin] When the contract was being worked up, Chevron fired up the hopes of the inhabitants of the oblast with a promise to actively enlist in work at the joint venture the local population and to train personnel. How are these promises being fulfilled? [Dupree] Training local personnel is a tradition for us. This may be confirmed in many countries in which Chevron operates. Thus, in Indonesia, for example, more than 6,000 employees work at the company. Only 100 of them are not local specialists. I believe that this was one of the reasons why our company was invited to Kazakhstan. Even at the initial stage, we are cooperating actively with local contractors, who are offering us various services. Of course, they do not in all respects as yet conform to the high demands that we make of our specialists and workers. But at the same time, we are constantly observing a trend toward an improvement in their work indicators. [Sutyagin] I would like to hear about specific examples of cooperation with local outfits. [Dupree] I could cite as an example our experience of work with the Tengizneftestroy Trust. This was one of the first companies with which we concluded an agreement. Very useful partner relations have taken shape between us. They provide us with various services connected with the buildup and development of the shift community of Tengiz and the production complex. The main difficulty in relations with local construction workers is the fact that they are not properly supplied technically and that they lack the technology that we need. But these problems are easily soluble via the organization or rather, the creation of every conceivable type of joint venture with foreign companies. Such ventures could be supplied with various Western equipment, and the same services as we usually obtain from Western companies could ultimately be expected of them. We ourselves are extremely interested in this, inasmuch as our contract with Kazakhstan is for 40 years. Seeking partners in the West is to our disadvantage. For this reason we are closely studying the potential of local enterprises. [Sutyagin] Nonetheless, Turks, Hungarians, Slovaks, and representatives of a number of other states are today working on contract with Tengizchevroil on the rigging out and development of the field. Does it not seem to you that all the work that they are doing could be done by local personnel also? [Dupree] The process of involving local organizations in the range of tasks being tackled by the joint venture is not something that can be accomplished overnight. Although even today we give the inhabitants of Zhylyoyskiy Rayon and Atyrau Oblast priority when we are looking for a contractor. It is among them that we begin the search for the specialists we need. And only if we do not find them here do we widen the sphere of the search--to the level of the region, all of Kazakhstan, and then the CIS. Only having convinced ourselves that the search has been unsuccessful do we turn to our old partners in other countries. The basis, however, for the conclusion of a contract are the good quality of the work performed for us, observance of the deadlines specified by the contract, and a reasonable price. It is my personal opinion, incidentally, that Kazakhstan has an appreciable advantage over other countries in which we have worked. There is here a wealth of experience in oil production: The first well produced a gusher of oil in Atyrau Oblast in 1911. You have many high-class specialists, and practically all residents of the area where we are located are familiar with the process of oil and gas production. Training them is not an issue. It is simply necessary to familiarize them with our standards of the organization of labor, and with Chevron they are at the level of the world's highest. [Sutyagin] Our readers would be interested in learning, I believe, how the everyday life of employees of the joint venture who have come from America and Europe to the difficult semi-arid climatic conditions has been established. What difficulties have you encountered, and how are you resolving them? [Dupree] Chevron specialists work in Africa and Indonesia and other countries with no less difficult a climate and a very unstable political atmosphere at times. Everyone who came here, therefore, knew that it would not be easy. And all day-to-day questions are gradually being solved: The Hungarian construction workers have built quite comfortable accommodations, and we have resolved transport problems, having purchased automobiles for a number of employees, and have ourselves organized flights from Atyrau to Europe. The most painful problem is that of food. Although there are several pretty good restaurants, we cannot always find good-quality food in the oblast. But we are attempting to engage local resources as much as possible--we are concluding contracts for supplies of agricultural produce, purchasing what we can. We are trying to support our suppliers materially here and are supplying them with hardware and equipment. On just one condition--the quality of the food must be high. Unfortunately, we sometimes encounter amazing situations, which could, in my view, be avoided. Thus, we concluded a contract with the Atyrau poultry factory for the supply of broilers. We looked them over--pretty good quality. We started to talk about money, offering any form of payment in any currency. But they told us: We do not need money; supply us with gas for heating. According to the terms of the contract, however, we are not entitled to dispose of the gas--it is at the disposal of the government of the republic. We tried to explain: Buy the gas for foreign currency. The factory management is sticking to its guns. The contract is, naturally, in jeopardy, and we will be forced, consequently, to purchase the broilers elsewhere. [Sutyagin] It is no secret that many people are trying to land jobs at the joint venture, where remuneration is higher than at Kazakhstan's enterprises. Especially since earnings are in dollars. Will the system of remuneration change? [Dupree] We try to motivate people as much as possible. In principle, it is all the same to us in what currency wages are paid. We could have a mixed pay in two currencies, we could pay merely in tenge. But with the continuing inflationary processes, which have intensified as of late, payments merely in tenge could only increase the inflation and partially "eat up" the wages before they are spent, even. We will continue, therefore, to try to protect our employees as much as possible, stimulating their good work in every way possible. Especially since there is something to pay for. We are observing how the competence of the local personnel is increasing and their interest in the affairs of the venture is growing literally before our eyes. We like working with Kazakhstanis.
