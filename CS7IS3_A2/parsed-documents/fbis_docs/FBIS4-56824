There is no question that if we want to achieve a higher standard of living, we must build a sufficiently vigorous and original industrial network to take advantage of the country's natural advantages, and consequently, to contribute effectively to the growth of the gross domestic product [GDP]. Thus, it is antitechnical and even counterproductive to expect that exporting a few nontraditional agricultural products or enthusiastically supporting the assembly line industry [maquiladora], especially if there is no accompanying transfer of technology, is the way to assume responsibility for integral development, a responsibility that we as a nation must assume for the benefit of present and future generations. The assembly line industry and feeble primary-sector exports are mere bandaids that temporarily and partially alleviate the crippling problems of hunger and unemployment. A multitude of diagnoses show that the industrial sector in Nicaragua is going through a crisis, moving ever closer to extinction. Its share of the GDP has fallen from 31.8 percent in 1978 to 17 percent in 1993, and its annual per-capita GDP income is now three times smaller than it was. And regardless of the many different controversies that may arise concerning the positive or negative aspects of the historic Common Market and the catalytic cotton parameter [as published], the fact is that in those years Nicaragua's industrialization process was experiencing tremendous growth; and in spite of the "import substitution," which has such a bad reputation among certain economists today, the existing industrial system provided a solid foundation of support for the country's economic development. To be sure, adjustment policies have a direct and indirect impact on whether an industrialization process moves forward or backward. Yet it is clear to everyone that poor countries such as Nicaragua are meeting with mathematical precision all kinds of requirements with respect to eliminating subsidies and throwing the doors wide open to outsiders, knowing that no rich, developed country would destroy itself with the same restrictions. Quite the contrary, in those countries protectionism, tariffs, and technical regulations zealously guard the safety of the productive apparatus. There are examples galore, and the adjustment program was not born yesterday, even in Nicaragua. Overcoming the adjustment successfully depends on the capacity, leadership, and creativity that the government must display to be a reformer without being an exterminator. It is not a question, therefore, of repeating the well-worn excuse that the government, in keeping with its neoliberal facade, should not intervene. Of course it has to intervene, and it should intervene, but as a genuine facilitator, promoter, and leader, not as a caudillo. The policies of the World Bank and the IMF may be inflexible, some might say brutal, but the government should not blame its "limitations" on external conditions. Rather, it should be sufficiently capable and intelligent to respond efficiently to its role as an active guiding force rather than a passive observer. Examples abound: In Chile, the "Chicago Boys" promoted the free market, but substitute "production" for the Chilean state's service capacity. And in Mexico, as Dr. Salinas himself has pointed out, "the decisions are made by the people, not the bureaucrats." In that country, local councils, invoking the participation of civil society, decide how the resources derived from privatization will be used. In those countries, even though the governments are pursuing neoliberal policies, adjustment policies, or whatever, they are sensitive and astute enough to get the most out of the reforms to benefit their people. In Nicaragua, a greater effort should be made to take on a creative role under the authority of a healthy leadership that exudes confidence. In the specific case of industry, the government must subsidize and protect, with finesse and cunning, but without severely disrupting the adjustment process. There are so many forms of subsidies that can allow our industry, especially small-scale industry, to recover gradually. It is unfair to expect the productive sector to pull itself up by its bootstraps. The government must compromise and accept that it "did not determine what, how, or how much to produce," it is philosophy, and only philosophy. At first, the government must reach a consensus with industry leaders and agree on all pertinent measures to revive the sector and enable it to compete on an equal footing. Chile, Japan, Italy, and other countries did not necessarily build their industries by leaving them to their own devices. Thus, the inflexibility of the World Bank or the IMF and the adjustment are not the sole, evil cause of our industrial depression, and the overall slump in production. The secret lies, simply, in knowing how to function as a real government, a creative and steadfast promoter and facilitator. A leader, not a caudillo. And apparently, there is still time to mend its ways.
