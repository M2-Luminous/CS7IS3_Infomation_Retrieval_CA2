The ambush came two days after the Alex Boncayao Brigade (ABB) released to media its target list of 345 lawmen, officials and civilians allegedly involved in drug trafficking, kidnapping, prostitution and gambling. Killed was Carmelito G. Valmonte, 62, a retired inspector at the Western Police District Command. He died on the spot after sustaining four gunshot wounds, police said. Four men and a woman reportedly opened fire with .45 caliber automatics on Valmonte as he was driving out of the compound of UE Automotive Manufacturing, Inc. (UEAMI) where he was security officer. Paulo Ramirez, ABB spokesman, told the INQUIRER over the telephone that Valmonte was responsible for the violent dispersal of a workers' strike at the firm last year. He said three workers were shot during the dispersal, one of whom was seriously wounded and his foot had to be amputated. Ramirez said Valmonte was not on the ABB list but is considered "an enemy of the people and the revolution." Mayor Alfredo Lim denounced the killing as "cowardly" and directed Senior Superintendent Hermogenes Ebdane, Manila police chief, to place his entire police force on alert. Superintendent Romeo Maganto, Manila police chief for administration, said the 6,000-strong Manila Crusade for Peace and Democracy (MPCD) will be tapped to neutralize the ABB threat. Maganto said the MCPD will serve as an intelligence network to gather information on the activities of suspected ABB members. "We are not alarmed and we are not afraid. Mga langaw lang sila na nakadapo sa kalabaw (They are merely flies sitting atop a carabao)," Maganto said. Maganto said several ABB leaders operating in Manila have already been identified, adding it would only be a matter of time before they are captured. President Ramos himself has acknowledged the capability of ABB assassins to launch a fresh wave of attacks against hundreds of lawmen and officials allegedly engaged in crime and corruption. Mr. Ramos said he has ordered a close watch on the ABB. The Communist Party of the Philippines, led by Jose Maria Sison, ordered the ABB to disband in 1992 amid a public outcry against its indiscriminate killings. But anti-Sison cadres in the ABB defied the order.
