The issue at stake on both occasions was Kashmir. The diplomatic sparring that has been going on for the last few months between the two countries, beginning in Davos at the World Economic Forum and the Geneva events of the past one month will, in the long run, prove to be momentous for both countries. The jubilation in Indian diplomatic circles at the last minute withdrawal by Pakistan of a resolution on human rights violations in Kashmir is understandable. At no-time in the recent past has India managed to put it across to its opponent as far as diplomatic coups were concerned. In the last one month, it was heartening to see that India shed its low key diplomatic postures and launch a propaganda offensive against Pakistan as an exporter of terrorism. Having tasted success, the Indian think tank's proclivity to relax after wresting the initiative is unlikely to be seen this time around. Five years of low-cost, low-intensity conflict from across the border and the tension, uncertainty and the cult of violence that has come to grip the people of Kashmir is unlikely to be forgotten easily. Nor is it going to be easy for the Indian foreign policy-makers to forget the nerve wracking tension imposed on them till the very last minute before Islamabad bowed to the majority viewpoint of the members of the United Nations Human Rights Commission [UNHRC]. The diplomatic disaster will not go down easily with the powers that be in Pakistan. Ms. Benazir Bhutto, who so fully identified herself with the resolution will now have to face the wrath of Muslim League leader, Mr. Nawaz Sharif. Embittered Pakistanis will only see defeat in the move to table the resolution and later its withdrawal as counter-productive. They will fail to see that Pakistan has successfully managed to project the Kashmir issue to an international audience. But, for the time being, there is certain to be massive opposition criticism and a backlash effect on Ms. Benazir Bhutto's government for the loss of face at an international forum, that too, in what is seen as a victory to India. Mr. Nawaz Sharif can be expected to take full advantage of the situation and harp on the fact that the Prime Minister has let down both Kashmiris and Pakistan and had bungled the whole issue. The final result was made possible by the realistic stand taken by the member nations, particularly, China and Iran. Though the latter two countries have much to hide from UNHRC, that warrant their support to India, much the same can be said about most other nations of the world, including North America. The tactical withdrawal took place after it was agreed that a mission of ambassadors would visit Kashmir to assess the human rights situation there. It is now up to India to hammer home the advantage and press for meaningful bilateral dialogues. The foreign secretaries level meeting between the two countries held in January were a disaster. Dialogue needs to be renewed afresh with respect to `no-first-use' of nuclear weapons, `line of peace and tranquillity' along the Line of Control, demilitarisation of the Siachen Glacier, demarcation of the maritime boundary in the Sir Creek area, resolving the controversy over the Tulbul navigation project, and reviving the Joint Working Commission. The parleys between the two countries have been stifled by unreasonable postures by both countries, at different points of time, and no bilateral progress looks likely unless Pakistan drops the plebiscite, and now, the human rights violations proposals. Given the latest misadventure and the adverse fall out at home, one can only expect a hardened stand from the Pakistani side. It is thus left to India to put forth fresh proposals and wrest the initiative. Along with such confidence building exercises, the Government of India must ensure that the borders are tightly sealed and that drug trafficking and export of arms into the country are completely stopped. As far as the extremists and the militants are concerned, the failure of the resolution at UNHRC sends an unmistakable message that internationalisation of the Kashmiri issue does not work.
