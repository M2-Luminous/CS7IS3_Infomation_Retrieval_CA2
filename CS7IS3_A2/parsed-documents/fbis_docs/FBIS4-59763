The military forces of unity and democracy there are conducting decisive military confrontations with the forces of the separatist gang of the al-Ahmar clan. A responsible source at the political bureau has told the Yemeni news agency, SABA', that brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid made the tour in implementation of the resolution adopted by the political bureau that party members and leaders should tour the various axes following 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's rejection of all the national, Arab, and international initiatives and appeals to stop the bloody war he declared against the Yemeni people. Salih is targeting the southern and eastern governorates, thereby causing the destruction of towns, villages, and installations, violating homes and causing the deaths of citizens in the areas his forces have entered. This leaves the forces of unity and democracy with no alternative but to confront those forces, which have transformed unity into a bloody struggle. Full historic responsibility is borne by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih for this disaster being suffered by Yemen and its sons. It was he who during these blessed days decided to transform the joy of the sons of the Yemen attending the blessed id al-Adha and the fourth anniversary of unity on 22 May into days of grief.
