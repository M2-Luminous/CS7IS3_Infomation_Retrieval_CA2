Without this it will be impossible to fight crime," Russian Counterintelligence Service Chief Sergey Stepashin said. In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Saturday, Stepashin said that "any operational activities inevitably limit the rights of criminals. This is an axiom. In this connection I would like to say again that I am for violation of the `right' of criminals to kill, rob, rape and encroach upon the rights of other people and their life. I am for such limitations, provided all procedural norms ensuring the calm life of the citizens of Russia are observed."
