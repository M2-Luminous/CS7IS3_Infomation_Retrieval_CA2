As in past negotiations, Japan made concessions while the United States took a hard-line attitude, and the results of the negotiations are difficult to assess. Facing a U.S. deadline on the imposition of sanctions and amid growing distrust, the two governments eventually came to an agreement on opening Japan's mobile phone market. We wonder what the result would have been if negotiations had ended in failure. The United States would have announced a list of trade items subject to sanctions. Japan would have appealed to the GATT. The result would have been a further deterioration in relations between the two countries. We welcome the results of the negotiations because a further deterioration of relations between Japan and the United States would not only be unprofitable for the two countries, but would have a negative impact on the international community. Analyzing the details of the agreement, however, we cannot say "there is no problem" with it. In particular, the Japanese Government adopted a questionable line during the negotiations. One reason is the impression left that the "conventional settlement method"--in which Japan yields to U.S. Government pressure--was applied to the negotiations. The Japanese Government originally stressed that the U.S. position ran counter to previous agreements between the two countries. There is no doubt that Motorola's contention was partly unreasonable. Motorola made much of the fact its market share in Japan had not increased and that the responsibility for this lay on the Japanese side. We think that position is a bit farfetched. But the Japanese Government finally went into reverse. Immediately after the United States hinted it would take sanctions measures, the Japanese Government made concessions which contradicted its original position. We are not saying making concessions is wrong. The government said that "there is no pressure behind Japan's compromise" and discounted the view that Japan had yielded to threats by the United States. However, judging from the negotiating process, we get impression that Japan yielded to U.S. pressure. And contrary to Japan's wishes, there is the possibility that U.S. distrust of Japan will grow. For this reason, Japan should bid farewell to its conventional method of settling issues. Another reason is that the agreement on increasing ground radio stations and assigned frequencies for Motorola-type mobile phone--a focal point in the issue of opening the mobile phone market--is vague, and may provide ammunition for future discussions. The two governments are already at cross-purposes about how to interpret a statement that "the Government of Japan will take all available measures to ensure compliance with the private sector's commitments." The Japanese Government says it cannot guarantee a private contract. However, the U.S. Government interprets Japan's agreement to increase relay stations for the Motorola-formula cellular phone service as a "objective criterion," saying the Japanese Government has guaranteed the fulfillment of the agreement. It is possible the United States will apply pressure to Japan by saying "you must carry out your promise." We believe the major aim of the recent failed economic framework talks was to confirm Japan's rejection of U.S. pressure. We do not want see the government continuing to make "vague" agreements any more. Shelving important issues will only worsen the situation and increase U.S. distrust. From the point of view of consumers, the government should create a more open, transparent market by deregulation. This is what the government must do and this is the way to win the international support. The government is scheduled to come up with new market opening measures this month aimed at resuming the economic framework talks. This time, the government has to hammer out persuasive, substantial measures which will bring profit to the consumers and lead to the promotion of reform of the industrial structure. Taking advantage of this opportunity, we want to say that U.S. economic policy will lose international support if it continues its "results-oriented" steamroller attitude which ignores the economic environment. The United States needs to take a calm attitude on economic issues.
