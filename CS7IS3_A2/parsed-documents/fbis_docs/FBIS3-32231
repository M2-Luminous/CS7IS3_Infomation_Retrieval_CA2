They rejected the government's economic policies, especially the increase in fuel prices, which has adversely affected the people's pockets. Those who tried to de-emphasize the people's response did not realize that there is a social commotion throughout the country brought on by the devastating economic measures. Consequently, this preventive strike is a warning to the government that if it does not change its economic model, if its does not rectify its measures, the struggle will continue. That is the great message the Ecuadoran people, workers, peasants, Indians, housewives, and all those who actively participated in the national strike want to send. I would not describe the strike as successful. I would say it is a national plebiscite in which the majority of the Ecuadoran people assumed their responsibility and showed their willingness to continue with the struggle. [Reporter] According to the labor minister, only 50 percent of all workers participated in the strike. What is the workers' point of view? [Ponce] I believe certain officials are being irresponsible when they try to play down the workers' strike. Maybe he has different ways of measuring strike participation. Should we start suspending the pumping of potable water and oil and suspending electricity and telephone service so they will admit that the strike was successful? That is not the real way to measure the people's protest. We must point out that the media -- which, by the way, have not been very supportive of the labor movement -- had to recognize that the people were mobilized at the national level and showed signs of patriotism. The people issued a warning that if the president of the Republic does not change his ways on the economic front, if the vice president does not stop provoking the people as he did yesterday when he announced more economic measures, they will really be forcing the Ecuadoran people to react. [Reporter] What would the reactions be? [Ponce] Mobilizations, strikes, and marches. We are going to open up room for dialogue, which will allow us to move on. The workers are making a call to all patriotic sectors, to all sectors committed to the highest interests of the Ecuadoran people, to find solutions. As for the specific case of the fiscal deficit, there are solutions. Today we heard a series of political leaders, analysts, and deputies say there were solutions and that there was no need to increase fuel prices, but the arrogance of the government's economic team, their attitude of provocation, their disregard for the Ecuadoran people is unparalleled. They are really being irresponsible, therefore the struggle will continue in a much more organized manner. [Reporter] According to the reports you have received, are workers being arrested or repressed? [Ponce] We are currently collecting all the information. It is almost ready, but we can say that there has been repression, arrests, injuries, the occupation of buildings, and a series of incidents that have resulted from the actions of public order personnel. Actually, they were trying to downplay the effects of this popular, national movement.
