It has denounced the attempts of massive fraud made by the Nouakchott government. In connection with these elections, Sheikh Sadibou Camara, influential leader of the opposition, was arrested on 20 January. Sadibou Camara is also the chairman of the Mauritanian Human Rights Association. For Camara's lawyer, Fatimata Mbaye, this arrest is connected with his fight against slavery in Mauritania: [Mbaye] Professor Camara is a well-known figure whose activities are no secret to anyone. He is not only a human rights activist, but also takes part in the UN efforts to fight slavery. He is also a member of the board of administration of a nongovernmental antislavery organization. It is therefore quite normal for Prof. Camara to stand against slavery. What is really interesting is that Prof. Camara's arrest occurred around the time that the Acting Together and the International Human Rights Federation joint delegation arrived in Mauritania -- a delegation which received authorization at the Mauritanian Embassy in Paris -- only four days after getting this authorization. Like every Mauritanian who is at all aware of the Mauritanian political atmosphere, we quite understand the reaction of the Mauritanian authorities inasmuch as Prof. Camara is an influential personality who plays quite an important role in his party, the Union for Democracy and Progress, by attracting a large number of activists. This is just another violent act which the authorities have perpetrated on our new democracy. Prof. Camara's arrest has, since this morning, raised a general outcry within the international community. Here is the reaction of the chairman of the International Human Rights Federation, Daniel Jacob: [Jacob] I have sent a telegram to the Mauritanian head of state asking him to release the professor immediately because he was arrested as a result of his human rights activities in Mauritania. We are contacting immediately the UN working group on this disappearance -- on this arbitrary detention -- and on this situation which we consider as particularly serious because, according to the information in our possession, the main accusation against Prof. Camara is first, he continued to head an association that did not have the required authorization and second, and above all, he gave information to the investigation mission of the international federation which was in Mauritania last week. [Unidentified reporter] Given the fact that reports reveal that he was being detained in extremely difficult conditions, do you think you have other means of pressure that can make the Mauritanian Government soften its stand and release him immediately? [Jacob] I personally wrote to Colonel Taya asking him to understand that the international organizations that finally adopted a relatively lenient attitude owing to some progress in the promotion of freedom of opinion, are perhaps going to revise their stand and then complain to the French Government. Here is another reaction from Gaita Motou, an official of the research bureau of Amnesty International in Paris: [Motou] We launched what we call an urgent program of action in (?collaboration) with all our sections and groups of persons working on our urgent program of action asking them to contact the Mauritanian Government and demand the release of Prof. Camara since 21 January. [Reporter] The accusation often leveled against Amnesty International is that it remains in its Paris or London bureau to criticize the public authority in Africa. In this particular case, have you sent a mission to Mauritania to see the conditions in which Prof. Camara is being detained? [Motou] This accusation leveled against us is quite unfounded. In the case of Mauritania, we tried to go there to express our concern, but we have never received any answer. We think that intensifying the pressure that we have been bringing to bear on the Mauritanian Government since 21 January might make it change its mind.
