[Al-Bid] We know from where we draw our legitimacy. Our legitimacy stems from our people. The legitimacy of radio and television that is imposed on the people is transient and can last only a few days. President Salih might believe that he can impose it for 30 days. Well, he cannot, not even for a few days. Trust your cause and your people, your cohesion, and national unity and protect every citizen without discrimination, no matter from what province they come. All those who are with the pledge and accord document, with full national cohesion, and with the peaceful and democratic struggle are with us, wherever they are born or from whatever province they hail. We have also issued instructions and a camp has been opened in Lahij for our brothers who want to join us from any province. They are welcome. [passage omitted]
