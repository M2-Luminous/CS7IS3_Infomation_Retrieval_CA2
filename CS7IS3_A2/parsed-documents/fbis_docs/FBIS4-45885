Nadezhdin "Health Care on Short Rations, or Revoke the Bank's License"] [Text] For Moscow health-care establishments, the new year came with an unpleasant surprise -- no money. Blood banks were forced to turn away donors because there was no money to pay them. And this at a time when city medical facilities are chronically short of donor blood. In 1992, there were 360,000 registered blood donors; in 1993, there were only 60,000. Why is there no money? Perhaps the government stopped funding municipal health-care services. On the contrary, Moscow's city government made sure well ahead of time that medical establishments had enough money to provide a normal level of services. As early as last December, the city treasury authorized the Commercial People's Bank, where Moscow keeps its accounts, to transfer 17 billion rubles for municipal health-care needs to the checking account of Moscow's Main Medical Authority. However, MMMA received only one-tenth that amount. "Bank officials have not provided a satisfactory explanation," says Anatoliy Solovyev, head of MMMA. "I consider the bank's actions criminal. The funds withheld were not going to support salaries and overhead, but to fund vital medical services. Many of our patients' lives were jeopardized. The bank should have its license pulled for doing this."
