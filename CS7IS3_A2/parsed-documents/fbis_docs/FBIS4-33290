Today, I want to discuss certain characteristics of the Cuban military, which throughout all these years of revolution, has directly contributed with agricultural, construction, investigative, and medical services, with direct links to the people they belong to. Without neglecting their primary defensive work, the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] currently carry out a number of economic tasks intended both to reduce the state budget and guarantee troop provisions, with the surplus going to the people. I found one example of this in the Eastern Army's Chemical Defense Regiment. Beside being the best of its kind in accomplishing its fundamental work, the regiment keeps its armament and techniques in an excellent state, despite special period difficulties. The regiment cares for 20 caballerias of land to boost the troop's food program. This work goes beyond their area of responsibility with tasks that are coordinated with civilian institutions for the benefit of the population. This work is explained to us by Col. Pablo Rodriguez Meza: [Begin recording] [Rodriguez] We have participated in several assignments together with civilians. For example, the fumigation of several municipalities because of the recent mosquito outbreak in the city. We have carried out this fumigation jointly with the Public Health Ministry; we have rendered this service. We have done the same in some schools. [Samper] In these cases, you supply both the experience and the equipment? [Rodriguez] The service and the equipment. [Samper] Do you have a plan to work jointly in areas where the environment has been contaminated? [Rodriguez] No, our work it not with the environment. We are working with certain factories that use toxic industrial products; we help to neutralize these products and transport them to safe places. For this, we have detailed plans. We recently worked along these lines in the Artemisa Municipality. [Samper] When you say neutralize, is this some sort of substance you apply or is it a protection system? [Rodriguez] It is a protection system that allows us to neutralize the toxic products, ensure they do not contaminate, and transport them in containers to safe places. [end recording]
