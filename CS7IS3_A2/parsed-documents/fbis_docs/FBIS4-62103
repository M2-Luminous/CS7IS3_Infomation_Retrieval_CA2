The document emphasizes that the current government has not dealt with the tasks of taxation and budget replenishment. Administration of the budget is practically uncontrolled. People are becoming more impoverished, resulting in an oversupply of goods. Every fourth enterprise is losing money, and, at the same time, not a single one has been declared bankrupt. The major stabilizing factor of the sociopolitical situation is the slow down in the inflation rate, says the statement. It protects a wide range of the population with fixed incomes from falling standards of living. This also creates conditions for attracting investment to production. The president is now taking urgent steps aimed at improving the situation. At the same time, contractual relations related to preferential financing of economic and social reforms with international financial organizations are on the brink of breakdown. In light of the lowered living standards of working people, the government's policy, aimed at slowing down the settlement of the issue on developing gold mines and attracting foreign investment on a mutually beneficial basis, seems to be illogical. Incidentally, President Askar Akayev and deputies of the regional soviet of (?Karakol) will examine issues of the government's policy with regard to the Kumtor gold mine today. The statement ends with the words: "We are building a democratic state that is capable of implementing laws for the benefit of our people. This is our decision and we are not deviating from this path."
