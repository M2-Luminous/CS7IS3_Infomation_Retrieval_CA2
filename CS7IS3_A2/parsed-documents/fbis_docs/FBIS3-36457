Lower Chamber Expects Dubinin and Gerashchenko Today"] [Excerpts] Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin and Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko have been invited to address the State Duma today. This was confirmed yesterday by deputies from the Agrarian Party, who held a press conference "On the performance of the agro-industrial sector in 1994." [passage omitted] As the press conference was under way, the government's presidium was holding a meeting at the White House to consider a decree of the same name. Gennadiy Kulik, deputy chairman of the State Duma's budget committee and former agricultural minister of the USSR and the RSFSR, who had just returned from the White House, told his colleagues and the press some details about the meeting. Two drafts -- from the Agricultural Ministry and the Economy Ministry -- were submitted to the government for consideration. According to Mr. Kulik, although there are significant differences between the drafts, it was nonetheless decided to merge them into one document to be agreed upon. Mr. Kulik said that the Agricultural Ministry's draft required the state to buy 100 percent of grain, oil-bearing crops, sugar beets, meat, milk, and wool to be produced in 1994. The government agreed in principle, but an argument broke out about the expected amounts of the produce. Viktor Gerashchenko did not agree, however, with the suggestion that the repayment of government debts to the agro-industrial sector should be dragged out as long as possible, and said that they would be repaid in the first quarter of this year, Mr. Kulik said. Agricultural enterprises will get a total of 1.3 trillion rubles; although they insisted that the sum be indexed, however, they did not manage to push the idea through. Nor did they receive the desired credits to the tune of 8.5 trillion rubles in the first six months (including 4.2 trillion to pay for fuel) to ensure the spring fieldwork and to carry the livestock through the winter period. The agro-industrial sector will get only 1.2 trillion in credits in the first quarter. So, Viktor Chernomyrdin has so far fallen short of satisfying agricultural appetites in full, although the "agrarians" trust him and think that "the castlings in the government have made it possible to forgo the question of no-confidence in it." This was also stated at yesterday's press conference.
