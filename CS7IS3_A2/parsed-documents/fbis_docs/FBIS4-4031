Hata, elected by parliament on Monday, has failed to reach agreement among coalition party leaders on a new cabinet and appeared set to form the first minority administration in four decades. Hata will make a last-ditch effort later in the day to persuade the socialists to return to the ruling coalition. The Social Democratic Party (the socialists), the biggest partner in the eight-month-old coalition, walked out on Tuesday [26 April] in an angry reaction to the establishment of a rival parliamentary bloc grouping five coalition parties but excluding the socialists within just hours of Hata's election. The socialists' move wold deprive Hata of his parliamentary majority and raise prospects of a period of weak minority rule followed by forced early elections. Hata took over from Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned abruptly on April 8 after just eight months in office over his dubious personal finances and a Diet (parliament) stalemate.
