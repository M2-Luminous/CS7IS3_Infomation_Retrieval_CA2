Some 800 meters of the main trunk line were put out of action, the bridge over the Kura River was destroyed, and the back-up pipeline was badly damaged. As is known, as a result of the earlier acts of sabotage, no gas has been pumped to Armenia since 18 December. Experts believe that it will be a month before the gas pipeline is back in service, since the approaches to the damaged area have been mined. The Armenian side is blaming a subversive group from Azerbaijan for the sabotage.
