[passage omitted] The meeting was presided over by Governor Jia Zhijie, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee. In attendance were Hui Liangyu, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and chairman of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]; Vice Governor Chen Shuiwen; and Ping Linbo, vice chairman of the CPPCC provincial committee. Chairman Hui Liangyu delivered an important speech and Chen Shuiwen [words indistinct] on the province's development of individual and private economies. The meeting pointed out that last year, the province witnessed an expansion in the individual and private economies. [words indistinct] A number of counties and cities saw rapid development in their economies. Twenty-two counties, cities, and districts had more than 10,000 individual industrial and commercial businesses; 13 counties, cities, and districts had more than 100 privately run enterprises; and individually and privately run businesses in 46 counties, cities, and districts had an output value and business volume of more than 100 million yuan, and the individually and privately run businesses in Xiantao and Tianmen had more than 1 billion yuan in output value and business volume. Individually and privately run enterprises have become a new important force in the local economy, though the individual and private economies remain weak links in the province's economy. The meeting stressed that the guiding thinking on developing the individual and private economies this year is to further and earnestly implement the party Central Committee's policy of encouraging and supporting the development of the individual and private industries, to deepen reform, to offer specific guidance, and to combine protection of enthusiasm with guidance of development, with readjustment of the industrial structure and the product mix, with maintenance of value and appreciation of state-owned assets, and with the urbanization process. [passage omitted] 1. Principal leaders of governments at all levels and persons in charge of the departments concerned must further enhance their understanding and achieve unity in thinking. The province's individual and private economies are inadequately, rather than sufficiently developed. From the experiences of advanced localities in our province, we can see that paying attention to the development of the individual and private economies not only will help bring opportunities for their growth and innovative development,but also will promote the development of the state-owned and collective economies. The key to the development of the individual and private economies lies in leadership, and the responsibility for their development lies with leadership. [passage omitted] 2. Policies should be further relaxed, and specific measures should be implemented effectively. The policies of the provincial party committee and government for the development of the individual and private economies should be implemented from top to bottom. [passage omitted] The provincial people's congress will decide on the taxation policy toward the individual and private economies in the form of laws and regulations, and will place the task in this year's plan for enactment of local laws. The provincial government also will work out relevant laws and regulations so as to provide a legal guarantee for the legitimate rights and interests of individually or privately run enterprises. Localities are encouraged to formulate corresponding administrative regulations. 3. Production and operation links should be improved further, the principle of investors reaping the benefits from their investments should be upheld, and individual industrial and commercial businesses and privately run enterprises should be encouraged to invest in the construction of markets. [passage omitted] 4. It is necessary to further strengthen leadership, organize relevant departments to jointly manage the development of the individual and private economies, earnestly assign this year's development tasks to all sides concerned under a responsibility system under which tasks are assigned on a quarterly basis and task completion is assessed at the year's end. [passage omitted] Present at the meeting were persons in charge of the provincial departments concerned; members of the provincial leading group for the development of the individual and private economies; [words indistinct]; principal leaders of the party committees and governments of various prefectures, autonomous prefectures, cities, and counties; government officials in charge of the development of the individual and private economies; members of local leading groups for the private economy; and persons in charge of the industrial and commercial, financial, personnel and labor, auditing, banking, [words indistinct] departments.
