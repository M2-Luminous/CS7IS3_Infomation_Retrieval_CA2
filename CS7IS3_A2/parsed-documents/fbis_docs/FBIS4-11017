He believes the economic measures agreed upon with international financial organizations "will not achieve their intended goals." "The government proposal is wrong," Ortega insisted during a debate televised by Canal Cuatro. Hours earlier, during a news conference, Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said the ESAF is not a new "harsh experience" for the country but, instead, an opportunity to pay on a lower debt to the Paris Club, grant more financing to agricultural production, and have more schools and health centers. While issuing a warning about possible social unrest in the country, the Sandinist leader described the government as "blind or ill-intentioned" for imposing its policy at all costs as part of "a position that has become reckless." Ortega added, "We would be the first to support the measures if we were certain that production and employment would rise after a certain period of time." He questioned the decisionmaking process that led to these economic decisions, and he noted, "the government is responsible for taking into account the various social, economic, and political segments of the population before making a decision on such an important issue. The government failed to do this and has been applying these measures since May 1993." "These measures were decided [comprometidas] and issued from above, and this undermines government trust and credibility. They pointed a pistol at those sectors consulted," he said. The FSLN secretary general said some viable alternatives to ESAF include making more flexible the granting of loans, adjusting bank interest rates, avoiding attacks on properties through debts with the financial system [as published], protecting national production, and seeking a renegotiation of our foreign debt. The feasibility of these measures proposed by the FSLN could be accepted by international financial organizations if the government had "the political resolve to confront the international financial organizations," Ortega said. He added, "If the government had the support of political and economic forces, it would be in a favorable position to reach agreements of this sort." Ortega replied to charges leveled hours earlier by Minister Lacayo on the foreign debt acquired by Nicaragua during his tenure. The former president said one must understand the reason behind that debt, and he added that the financing terms were favorable to the country. Ortega pointed out that a good part of that financing served to supply Nicaraguan producers with inexpensive raw materials, spare parts, and machinery. Popular Support Throughout his presentation, Ortega stressed that his party is only warning about the consequences of ESAF. "The FSLN is not seeking support for its positions. It is issuing a warning about the risk of these economic policies. When a conservative segment, such as the producers, takes to the streets to protest, it is because we have a profound crisis," Ortega added. When asked about a possible wave of popular protests or violence because of these economic decisions, Ortega said: "Only a rectification on the part of the government will prevent riots and protests such as those that occurred in the past. Neither the FSLN nor I will provoke the riots; the government's policies will." The Sandinist leader said his party must support the demands of segments of the population who are hurt by the ESAF. As for limits to the popular protests, Ortega said, "This is a very complex situation, and the FSLN cannot produce some sort of catechism." [sentence as published] Defending Constitutional Order "We are defending constitutional order. Should the government break that order, there are 39 Sandinist deputies and other deputies from other forces in the National Assembly who would certainly join to defend constitutional order," Ortega pointed out. He commented, however, on violent acts such as the burning of journalist Pablo Emilio Barreto's house and the murder of 219 Sandinists in Jinotega Department, saying that such explosive incidents could result from self-defense groups. In face of this, "we must wonder whether the organization of citizens in self-defense brigades would be tolerated, whether state authorities are limited in their ability to guarantee public safety," Ortega added. The FSLN secretary general said he was not advocating the establishment of self-defense groups, but he pointed out that situations like this "leave no other option other than the creation of self-defense organizations." Ortega said the FSLN would not be at the helm of any possible social unrest. "We must take into account that social upheavals are not planned. We are issuing a warning about a situation that could be beyond our control," he added.
