It recently designated Siping, Liaoyuan, and Changchun cities and Yongji, Huadian, Linjiang, Sanchazi, Hunchun, Qian Gorlos, Qianan, Jian, Tonghua, Daan, Zhenlai, and Tongyu counties, cities [shi], and districts as the first pilot areas to test regional coordinated reform. Major parts of the reform are as follows: First, the labor contract system will be applied to all staff members and workers of all state-owned, collective, foreign-funded, shareholding, and private enterprises in these areas. Second, the wages of all the enterprises will be subject to overall regulation and control. The total amount of wages will be linked to economic performance. Enterprises have the decision-making power for their own distribution. Third, old-age pension and unemployment insurance will cover all staff members and workers of urban state-owned, collective, foreign-funded, shareholding, and private enterprises, and a new and unified pension distribution method will be implemented. Fourth, the labor force exchange markets and their service function will be improved so that the markets will fully develop their basic role in the development, utilization, and distribution of labor forces. Through the reform, enterprises' transformation of the operating mechanism will be promoted, and their quality and economic efficiency will be raised in an all-round manner. The experiment of the first group of pilot cities and counties will be completed at the end of this year.
