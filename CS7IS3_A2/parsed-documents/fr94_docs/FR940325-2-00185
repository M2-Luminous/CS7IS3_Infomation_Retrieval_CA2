FR940325-2-00185 FR940325-2-00089 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;33783; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;07] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., Relating to an Extension and Expansion of a Position Limit Hedge Exemption Pilot Program March 18, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on February 9, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The NASD is proposing to amend Section 3 of Appendix E (``Section 3'') to the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice (``Rules'') to extend, until December 31, 1995, the NASD's pilot program for exemptions from equity option position limits for certain hedged positions (``hedge exemption pilot program''). The NASD also proposes to amend section 3 of the Rules to expand the hedge exemption pilot program to provide that the underlying hedged equity position may be comprised of securities readily convertible into or economically equivalent to the stock underlying the corresponding hedging options position. In addition, the NASD proposes to add a new example to the list of examples contained at the end of section 3(a) of the Rules to illustrate the operation of the position limit hedge exemption. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, NASD, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in section (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change On February 9, 1990, the Commission approved an NASD proposal to implement a two-year pilot program during which certain fully hedged equity option positions would be automatically exempt from established position and exercise limits. 1 Specifically, the hedge exemption pilot program provides for an automatic exemption from equity option position limits for accounts that have established one of the four most commonly used hedged positions on a limited one-for-one basis (i.e., the number of shares represented by one options contract). The exempted positions are: (1) Long stock and short calls; (2) long stock and long puts; (3) short stock and long calls; and (4) short stock and short puts. Under the hedge exemption pilot program, the largest options position (combining hedged and unhedged positions) that may be established may not exceed twice the basic position limit. 2 In addition, the hedge exemption pilot program does not change the exercise limits contained in the Rules. 3 Therefore, market participants are allowed to exercise, during any five consecutive business days, the same number of options contracts set forth as the position limit for that option, including those options positions that are hedged. 1 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27697 (February 9, 1990), 55 FR 5535 (February 15, 1990). Position limits impose a ceiling on the number of equity option contracts in each class on the same side of the market (i.e., aggregating long calls and short puts, and long puts and short calls) that can be held or written by an investor or group of investors acting in concert. Exercise limits restrict the number of options contracts which an investor or group of investors acting in concern can exercise within five consecutive business days. 2 See Section 3 of the NASD Rules. 3 See Section 4 of Appendix E of the Rules. The NASD is proposing three amendments to the hedge exemption pilot program. First, because the hedge exemption pilot program expired on February 9, 1992, the NASD is proposing to re-implement the pilot program until December 31, 1995. In addition, in order to avoid future lapses in the hedge exemption pilot program, the NASD proposes to incorporate this expiration date into its Rules in a new subsection (c) to section 3.
