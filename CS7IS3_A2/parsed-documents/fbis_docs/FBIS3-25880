Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee, told reporters today that during his official goodwill visit to Germany, Switzerland and Austria on January 16-30, Qiao was given very warm and friendly receptions by the leaders of parliaments and governments of the three countries. The visit has given an impetus to the further growth of relations between China and the three countries, he added. Cao quoted Qiao as saying that China has always attached great importance to developing friendly ties and cooperation with West European countries, including Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Qiao said that China also hopes that such relationship will be developed in a durable and stable way by adopting by all sides a policy of mutual respect, seeking common ground while reserving differences, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality, and mutual benefit. Cao said the leaders of the three countries said that they place great importance on developing ties with China, which they think is exerting an important influence in the world political and economic fields. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel reaffirmed their support for China's peaceful reunification, and the resumption of China's signatory's status within the General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade. Otto Stich, president of the Swiss Confederation, said Switzerland wants to further expand cooperation with China in all fields. The Austrian leaders stressed that Austria will pay more attention to developing ties with Asian countries, especially with China. Cao said Qiao's visit will also promote China's economic relations and trade with Germany, Switzerland and Austria. During the visit, he said, Qiao briefed the parliament and government leaders of the three countries on China's economic growth and reform, as well as opening to the outside world. The leaders and industrial enterpreneurs of the three countries agree that the achievements China has made in its economic development have been great in the past 15 years. All of them expressed confidence in the future of China's reform, and showed great enthusiasm about furthering their economic and trade ties with China. They also expressed the hope for investing in China, expanding their economic cooperation and trade relations, and extending the cooperative areas to culture, scientific-technological research and education, Cao said. He said Qiao's visit has enhanced the exchanges and cooperation between the China's parliament and those of the three countries. Qiao pointed out during the visit that the NPC was facing the task of making laws for the growing socialist market economy of China. "We will initially form a frame structure of the legal system which will conform to the needs of the market economy, and also draw on legislative experiences and fruits of other countries," he said. "This requires us to strengthen exchanges and cooperation between the NPC and the parliaments of countries all over the world," he added. The leaders of the parliaments of the three European countries spoke highly of the existing friendly ties and cooperation with China, and intended to further develop relations with the NPC and to expand mutual exchanges and cooperation. Cao said that Qiao also exchanged views with the leaders of the three countries on major international issues in a frank and sincere way, thus enhancing mutual understanding and reaching more common views on a wide range of issues.
