FBIS4-20046 "drweu080_h_94020" FBIS-WEU-94-080 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 GERMANY Dasa Hopes for Positive Balance Sheet by 1995 Dasa Hopes for Positive Balance Sheet by 1995 AU2104142494 Munich SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG in German 21 Apr 94 p 24 AU2104142494 Munich SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG German BFN ["wl" report: "If Everything Goes Well, Figures in 1995 Will Be Positive"] [Text] Munich -- The measures introduced at Deutsche Aerospace AG (Dasa), Munich, structural and capacity adjustment, which are primarily linked with the reduction of about 18,000 jobs, are showing a first effect. Juergen E. Schrempp, chairman of the board of directors, and Financial Director Manfred Bischoff, had to announce a corporate loss of 694 million German marks [DM] (last year DM341) upon presentation of the 1993 balance sheet and a decline in turnover by 10 percent to DM18.6 (20.65) billion. They noted that 1994 will again be a "difficult year." However, this year a smaller loss is expected while turnover should remain relatively stable and it is hoped that in 1995, "when the political-economic surroundings do not deteriorate dramatically," profit will again be made. Looking at these figures, it is to be taken into account that last year the negative balance of Fokker NV, which showed a loss of about DM460 million -- of which more than half goes to Dasa, because of its 51-percent share -- was fully compensated. The changes in the consolidation cycle also have to be considered in connection with all other figures, e.g. with turnover (at that time give as DM17.3 billion for 1992). Apart from a surplus of DM160 (411) million achieved by Deutsche Aerospace Airbus GmbH, Hamburg, all subsidiaries suffered considerable losses. In terms of sectors, only space flight achieved a surplus of DM53 million, while aviation suffered a loss of DM327 million and defense a loss of DM258 million. Dasa AG, which does not have a contract for transferring profits with, among others, Airbus GmbH, even suffered a lost of DM994 (503) million, according to the business report of the mother company Daimler-Benz AG. Schrempp cited the "slump of our markets in the civilian and military areas, the massive disadvantages under which Dasa had to stand on its own in the internationally escalated competition, and the costs for the structural measure that have to be taken." These one-time expenditures caused a burden of DM1.1 billion on the 1993 result. After taking over Fokker, Dasa has a turnover of $12.9 billion, thus being the third largest aerospace company after Boeing ($29.6 billion) and McDonnell Douglas ($17 billion). With a view to the U.S. competition, Schrempp called for "an international reduction of subsidies" and equal framework conditions. The prospects in defense technology, the share of which will probably even out between 20 and 25 percent of turnover, is "extremely positive," according to him, if the correct political decisions are made. In the future, focal issues must be systems that can prevent wars if possible. He cited, above all, air defense and electronic reconnaissance systems. Regarding arms exports, he said: "We are not interested in exporting to countries outside NATO." However, there must finally be European harmonization so that, in particular, cooperation projects with France and Great Britain can be undertaken. Including the lay-offs, which have already been implemented this year, in 1994 and 1995 a total of 10,300 jobs are to be abolished. Schrempp: "These are the most difficult decisions in a manager's life; on the other hand, this is the only chance to safeguard jobs." Approximately 1,500 jobs will be abolished in the Bavarian factories this year. Concerning the factory in Lemwerder, which is threatened with closure, Schrempp said: "We are getting out of servicing civilian planes, because it is not possible in Germany." As outstanding events of the recent past, Schrempp cited the first flight of Eurofighter 2000 (whose serial production Schrempp expects). The Dornier 328 has been introduced on the market. In the meantime, about 100 orders and options have been received. Looking at the figures, it is striking that the orders received have doubled; from the purely arithmetic point of view they have increased almost to the turnover of two years. This is primarily due to plane construction with its long periods for orders. Schrempp pointed out that, as a result of the recession on the international plane market, the annual Airbus deliveries have to be reduced from about 200 to 120 to 123 planes and might even about at 140 to 150. Regarding the future development, Financial Director Bischoff said: "The massive reduction of costs to at least a competitive level and the increased appearance of Dasa on the markets make me very confident." Therefore, a positive balance sheet is expected again as of 1995, if no additional burdens have to be coped with. He justified the remarkable increase in liquid means by referring to cost reductions and increased efficiency in current assets, while reserves for structural and capacity adjustments increased this item of the balance sheet considerably. To met the capital need at Fokker, measures have to be taken this year to improve the balance sheet relations together with the Dutch Government, which also holds a share in the company.
