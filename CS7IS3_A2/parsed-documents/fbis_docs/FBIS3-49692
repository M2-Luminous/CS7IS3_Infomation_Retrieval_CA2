Speaking at a press conference of the government coalition Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), which he belongs to, Baudys stressed that the project had been drafted as a dynamic one, which would make possible adaptation between NATO and the countries interested in joining NATO, "...with the possibility of greatly accelerating the process if necessary," Baudys said. At the same time, it is necessary to open up the Czech Republic's defense budget, which would be subject to civil and democratic oversight, and to prepare certain military units for possible joint operations, Baudys stated. He said that the project was of a markedly individual character and did not count on the creation of regional defense associations or groups. "Of course, certain regional cooperation is counted on in the areas where it is needed," Baudys added. He appreciated the fact that at the Prague talks on the partnership program, U.S. President Bill Clinton had underlined not only military cooperation, but also economic cooperation as cornerstones of the project. The chairwoman of the opposition Left Bloc party (LB) Marie Stiborova said at her party's press conference today that Partnership for Peace did not solve the question of European security and de facto confirmed the strategic geopolitical security vacuum. The project is in line with the LB opinion that it is necessary to seek new solutions which correspond to the dramatic and dynamic development of security relations in Central and Eastern Europe. "A simple expansion of NATO cannot bring positive solutions," Stiborova said. She added that worn-out models, including NATO, presented no way of achieving European security. That is why the LB opposes the Czech Republic's joining any military pact which would be aimed against the remaining part of Europe, Stiborova emphasized. The LB favors the creation of new mechanisms of European security to be based on the principle of collective security and excluding any possibility of one European country's action against another, she said.
