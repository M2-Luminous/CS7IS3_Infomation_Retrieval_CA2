FR940202-0-00120 FR940202-0-00013 Issue 12: Prior replacement of habitat should only be required when it can be conclusively determined that existing habitat is being used at its full potential. Several commenters also expressed the opinion that the mandated replacement of vireo habitat prior to project commencement would be an unreasonable and excessive requirement. Service Response: In the vast majority of section 7 consultations on potential impacts to the vireo, the Service has recommmended prior replacement of vireo habitat, and does not anticipate changing this pattern with designation of critical habitat. Only in cases involving a relatively large acreage of unoccupied vireo habitat would such a requirement result from critical habitat designation. Because requirements for habitat replacement in advance have invariably been prompted by projects with substantial impacts to vireos or significant portions of occupied vireo habitat, it is anticipated that prior habitat replacement would be necessary in those circumstances regardless of whether critical habitat has been designated. In some cases, especially where land costs are high, project proponents have chosen to mitigate project-related impacts in advance to increase the likelihood of ``no net loss'' of wetland or vireo habitat values. This approach has also been used as a means to minimize the required amount of habitat compensation. Issue 13: Several commenters suggested that the Service should specify the criteria used to distinguish vireo quality habitat within the designated boundaries. Some suggested that the Service should have designated boundaries to more accurately reflect the actual habitat boundaries. Service Response: In establishing the approximate limits of actual critical habitat within the designated critical habitat area boundaries, the Service utilized National Wetland Inventory maps. Because the large majority of vireo habitat consists of mixed woodland or willow woodland habitats that are contained within jurisdictional wetlands and waters of the United States, these maps fairly accurately designate the extent of actual or potential habitat at a designated locale. Issue 14: The Service has not addressed the biological implications of artificially sustaining riparian habitat in the successional stage appropriate to support least Bell's vireos. What associated habitats and species will suffer from receiving a lower level of protection as a direct or indirect effect of the designation? Service Response: The Service is not advocating artificial maintenance of riparian habitat at a particular successional stage. Rather, the Service is advocating maintenance of natural systems under conditions that will be conducive to supporting vireo populations. Since the vireo was first listed by the state of California in 1980, it has not been necessary to artificially maintain vireo habitat at a given successional stage. Issue 15: Designation of critical habitat should be postponed until ongoing conservation plans to mitigate negative impacts to the vireo are in place and evaluated, or until further studies are completed and we know exactly why the vireo has declined. Service Response: On the basis of past experience with other listed species and critical habitat designations, the Service believes that the designation of critical habitat will not be incompatible with existing conservation or management plans. Current drafts of habitat conservation plans for the San Diego and Sweetwater Rivers are considered by the Service to be compatible with critical habitat designation. The designation of critical habitat may, in fact, simplify the creation and funding of area or drainage-specific management plans. Based on the demonstrated, relative success of several vireo management plans and other conservation efforts within its range and the endangered status of this species, the Service cannot justify the postponement of critical habitat designation until all management plans are evaluated or in place. Such a postponement could reduce the chances for the survival or recovery of the species. Issue 16: The Orange County Water District requested the exclusion of all lands below the 505-foot elevation in the Prado Basin from critical habitat designation because of its commitment to mitigate impacts to vireos and vireo habitat below that elevational contour. Service Response: The Corps' Draft EIS for the Orange County Water District's water conservation project indicates that implementation of the District's project will be phased. The level of the water conservation pool will be incrementally raised: (1) Once habitat above the 505-foot elevation is rehabilitated, restored, or created to replace occupied and presently unoccupied vireo habitat below 505-ft that is destroyed or degraded because of the project, and (2) it is demonstrated that the vireo population is not adversely impacted by their displacement or the destruction or degradation of preferred habitat. For these reasons, the Service did not remove lands from critical habitat designation within the Prado Basin that currently accommodate a majority of the nesting pairs representing the second largest vireo population in the United States. Issue 17: Several commenters noted that the Service should also list critical habitat for other areas (e.g., the lower Santa Ynez River in Santa Barbara County) or for all areas with populations of more than 10 pairs of vireos. Service Response: The Service retains the option to consider the designation of additional critical habitat. Designation of more critical habitat would be the subject of a new proposed rule that would solicit public comments and provide for a public hearing, if so requested.
