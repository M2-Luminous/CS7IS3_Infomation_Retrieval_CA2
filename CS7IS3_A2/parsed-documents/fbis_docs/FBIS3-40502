In the present study, the configuration of the experimental inlet is taken in computation as closely as possible. The flowfield of the inlet including the throat cavity region is discretized and solved simultaneously with the external flow regions. The numerical results demonstrate the flow behavior around the throat cavity for typical cases of mass flow-plug and wall bleed. Comparison with the experimental results for static pressure distributions and flow characteristics shows reasonable agreement and also points up the limitations of the two-dimensional analysis. 1. Introduction The supersonic intake is an important configurational element which must handle either most or all of the compression processes in air-breathing engines for supersonic aircraft. Many of these supersonic intakes have bleed holes in the walls for the purpose of preventing boundary layer separation and improving intake start performance, and throat cavities to stabilize the final shock wave. For this reason, the flow inside the intake becomes very complex, and precisely predicting flow sites is critical to the development of supersonic intakes. Meanwhile, with improvements in computer performance and advances in calculation techniques, there have been phenomenal advances in mathematical computation technology, and the range of applications broadens year after year. In the field of compression flows, in particular, it has become possible to do high-precision, stable calculations for high-Mach flow sites, thanks to the development of the TVD scheme. As a result, it has become relatively easy to analyze the flows inside supersonic and scram-jet intakes, with an increasing number of such analyses being done with each passing year. In this research, we analyzed the flows inside supersonic intakes having a cavity in the throat section, using the TVD scheme and solving numerically with the Navier-Stokes equations. We were thus able to simulate the flow conditions in the vicinity of the cavity under various conditions. We also compared the results of these calculations with the results of wind tunnel tests done on models of the same intakes.[.sup]1[/] 2. Basic Formulas, Numerical Calculation Methods 2.1 Intake Model In Figure 1 is presented a simplified view of the supersonic intake used in the wind tunnel tests selected for our computation subjects. This intake is called a mixed-compression intake which uses both external and internal compression. It performs external compression with four shock waves which are produced from the ramp, and then performs internal compression by three more shock waves from the cowl. The flow passes through the final shock wave of the throat, is decelerated to subsonic speed, and is pressure-restored by a diffuser. In a mixed-compression intake it is necessary to hold the shock wave(s) inside the channel. This means that we may expect large separation to occur with it being impossible to avoid interference between the shock wave(s) and the boundary layer. For this reason, bleed holes are positioned in the ramp wall just in front of the throat to suppress separation of the boundary layer. The cavity that is made in the upper wall at the throat is called a throat cavity and functions to hold the final shock wave stably in the throat. From this cavity there is a flow path which extends through to the outside of the intake. Part of the flow inside the cavity passes through this path and flows out of the intake. A flow plug that is provided at the diffuser exit moves back and forth to control the flow volume and thereby adjust the exhaust pressure, and is operated so as to achieve the optimum start-up condition. Figure 1. Simplified Diagram of Supersonic Intake Test 2.2 Basic Formulas and Algorithms The basic formulas used are the two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes formula in which an ordinary coordinate system (_x_, _ee_) is employed. The formula used for the viscosity factor has been thin-layer approximated. This formula can be expressed as follows. Equation [Text]where [Text]are determined as follows. [Text] where p is the pressure determined from state equations for an ideal gas, U and V are contravariant velocities, _g_ is the specific heat, Pr is the Prandtl number, Re is the Reynolds number, a is the speed of sound, and J is a conversion Jacobian. When doing the calculations, formula (1) is time-integrated with the cross-braced ADI method,[.sup]2[/] and steady solutions are obtained. The TVD scheme of Harten-Yee[.sup]3[/] is used in discretizing the convection factors on the right side at this time, so as to enhance the stability and shock-wave acquisition capabilities at high Mach numbers. In discretizing the viscosity factors, the central differences are used. The Baldwin-Lomax algebraic model is used for the turbulence model.[.sup]4[/] The cavity and external flow regions are not divided into blocks or the like so that they can be calculated separately, but handled by expanding them into a single calculation region. For this reason, we wind up having grid points in the solid regions of cowl and ramp wall also, but these grid points are restricted so that the state volume does not change even when time integration is performed. With this equation, it is not necessary to determine the boundary values algebraically because the calculation regions are connected, so the precision of the calculation does not suffer. This is also effective for supercomputer calculations. 2.3 Calculation Grid In Figure 2 is depicted the grid used in the calculations. The grid numbers are 530 x 250 including grid points in the cowl and other solid regions, and are generated algebraically. The calculation region extends to the external regions as well as the regions inside the intake. A channel extends from the inside of the throat cavity to the external region, and part of the flow inside the cavity is bled naturally to the outside. The flow plug provided at the diffuser exit does not handle the same shapes as are used in test models. Instead, the plug is simplified by providing a second throat and the calculation is done. Figure 2. Calculation grid (530 x 250) 3. Results of Numerical Calculations In this analysis, the uniform-flow Mach number was set at 3.0, which is the design Mach number for this intake. The Reynolds number was then matched with the test conditions, and the calculations were performed under conditions of 2 x 10[.sup]6[/]. The conditions of the flow plug at the exit of the diffuser are represented as Ae/At, using the throat area At and the diffuser exit area Ae, and calculations were done for three cases, with the value of Ae/At being 1.13, 0.94, and 0.86, respectively. In Figure 3 are represented the results of computations at Ae/At = 1.13. At (a) the overall flow conditions in the intake are depicted in terms of a Mach number distribution. At (b) we have an enlargement of the throat vicinity. Four shock waves are generated from the ramp wall and head for the cowl tip. Then from the cowl we have three shock waves which extend as far as the throat cavity to produce the shock wave pattern as designed. The weak swell that is seen at the ramp wall just in front of the throat cavity is due to bleeding. We can see a slightly strong swell developing from above the cavity, and thus know that the flow is circulating inside the cavity. Part of this circulating flow passes through the duct which goes to the outside of the intake and is thus bled off to the outside. A strong compression wave and swell are visible at the back end of the cavity. At (c) is seen a Schlieren photograph taken in the vicinity of the throat in the tests. In this photograph we can see the shock wave(s) coming from the cowl and the way in which they reach as far as above the cavity, as well as the compression wave and swell from the back end of the cavity. Thus we see how well the results of the numerical calculations simulate the flow conditions inside the intake. At (d) we compare the wall pressure distributions obtained by the calculations and the pressure distributions from the tests. The pressure distribution above the ramp wall agrees well with the pressure rise from the four shock waves as far as the throat cavity. Also, the pressure first declines over the cavity, and then rises again due to the shock wave which is generated from the back end of the cavity. However, under these conditions, no final shock wave exists, and the flow does not become subsonic even beyond the end of the throat, so the optimal conditions are not attained. Figure 3. Calculation Results (Ae/At = 1.13) In Figure 4 are plotted the results of calculations at Ae/At = 0.94. First of all, from (a), when we look at the condition of the flow on the upstream side from the throat, there is no change from the computed results under the conditions previously indicated. This is because the entire flow upstream from the throat is supersonic, and because the effects of the flow plug change are not propagated this far. Meanwhile, a terminal shock wave appears a little behind the throat cavity. This was not seen in the previous case(s). This shock wave appears to interfere with the compression wave from the back of the throat cavity and curve in an arc. In the Schlieren photograph at (c) we see a curved terminal shock wave a little toward the throat cavity. However, as may be seen from the computational results, this shock wave itself does not curve, but it appears to curve due to the interference between the terminal shock wave and the shock wave from behind the throat cavity. Compared to the previous case(s), the influence of the presence of this shock wave is great. Based on the wall pressure distributions plotted in (d), the pressure rise that occurs near the throat is far higher than in the previous case(s) when no terminal shock wave existed. Figure 4. Computation Results In Figure 5 is represented the flow at Ae/At = 0.86 where the flow plug is further constrained. In this condition also the flow upstream from the throat is entirely supersonic, and exhibits no change from the other cases. Basically the condition of the flow in the vicinity of the throat is the same as the Ae/At = 0.94 case, but the position of the terminal shock wave is slightly aft in this case. The interference with the compression wave near the cavity has disappeared, and a single terminal shock is formed. From the Schlieren photograph at (c) we can see that this shock wave appears farther forward than in the previous case(s), and the shape thereof is not really curved but is close to a straight line. Thus we see that the calculations agree well with the results obtained from the tests. We see a further pressure rise in the pressure distributions in (d). However, when we compare these pressure distributions against the test values, the computation results always predict higher values. The reason for this is that, in the tests, the intake is a duct with a rectangular cross-section, and is incapable of exhibiting a completely two-dimensional flow. Accordingly, we must consider the possibility of the effects of eddies which are produced in corners where separation is believed to exist which is equivalent to the separation seen above the ramp and cowl wall(s), even at the side walls. These eddies reduce the intake efficiency, and adequate pressure rise is not achieved. Figure 5. Computation Results In Figure 6 is represented the relationship between captured flow volume (Gco) and total pressure recovery rate (Pr). The captured flow volume is roughly constant up to the point where the flow plug is closed to a certain point, and the total pressure recovery rate increases as the flow plug is closed. Figure 6. Intake Characteristics The captured flow volume decreases from certain conditions because the terminal shock wave reaches a point above the throat cavity, the flow downstream from the shock wave is pushed inside the cavity, and this flows out to the outside. The test results are also noted in this graph. When we compare these to the computed results, we see that there is qualitative agreement in the trends, but the computed values for both the total pressure recovery rate and captured flow volume are higher. We can say nothing for sure about the reason for this, but a disparity appears in the pressure distributions due to three-dimensionality, and the cavity bleed hole is three-dimensional. Hence the possibility that this also is due to three-dimensionality is great. 4. Summary We simulated the flow inside a mixed compression type supersonic intake having a cavity in the throat section, using the TVD scheme to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. In the analysis, we handled the intakes of complex shape in single computational regions. This enabled us to perform highly efficient calculations. In making comparisons with test results, we found that the numerical calculations represent well the changes in flow conditions due to opening and closing the flow plug, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the numerical calculations. On the down side, these analyses also demonstrated the limitations of two-dimensional analysis. In the actual intakes, we think that there is considerable influence from the boundary layer at the side walls, but we were unable to take this into consideration with the two-dimensional analysis. For this reason, in the static pressure distributions, the computation results always predict higher values than the test results downstream of the throat where the presence of large separation is predicted. Accordingly, if more precise intra-intake flows need to be predicted, it will probably be necessary to go to three-dimensional analysis. This research is part of a joint research effort between the National Aerospace Laboratory and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries. References 1.
