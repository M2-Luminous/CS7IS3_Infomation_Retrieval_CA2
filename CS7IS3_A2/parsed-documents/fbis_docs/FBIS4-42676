A public poll conducted by the TURKISH DAILY NEWS among 2,184 people in city squares of Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir, Antalya and Bursa according to random sampling showed that 79.4 percent of the people are not pleased with the Tansu Ciller government; however, they are undecided about President Suleyman Demirel's interventions. While 51.6 percent of the interviewed said they agreed with the criticisms which Demirel directed against Ciller and the government, 51.8 percent said they did not think it necessary for Demirel to be a more active president. One of the interviewed citizens expressed his view by saying: "Demirel's statements are correct. However, if he knew everything that well, why did he give up the office of prime minister then?" Questions-Answers Four separate questions which can be answered either "yes" or "no" were asked of 2,184 people who are eligible voters and who were selected at random in five metropolitan cities. The questions asked and the replies received are as follows: Question 1: Does Demirel remain within the limits of the Constitution as he fulfills his presidential duties? Yes--941 (43.1 percent), No--1121 (51.3 percent), No comment--122 (5.6 percent). Question 2: Do you agree with the criticisms which Demirel directs against Ciller and her Cabinet as president? Yes--1124 (51.5 percent), No--981 (44.9 percent), No comment--79 (3.6). Question 3: Do you think it is necessary for Demirel to be a more active president under these conditions? Yes--960 (43.9 percent), No--1131 (51.8 percent), No comment--93 (4.6 percent). Question 4: Are you pleased with the performance which the DYP-SHP coalition government has shown under Tansu Ciller's leadership? Yes--380 (17.4 percent), No--1734 (79.4 percent), No comment--70 (3.2 percent). The following are some of the interesting reasons which some citizens gave for their answers: "Demirel is not sincere when he criticizes Tansu Ciller, whom he introduces as `his daughter.'" "It is enough if Demirel is just active on the secularism issue." "The DYP-SHP coalition under Demirel's leadership was better." "Ciller acts her own way no matter how much Demirel criticizes her." "They all look alike, God damn it." "It is Demirel who is responsible for all that has happened because it was he who introduced Mrs. Ciller." "All that Demirel has said is correct. Well, if he knew that much, why did he quit his post as prime minister then?" "Demirel is justified in his criticisms, but a president should not interfere in everything." "Demirel is now doing everything that he criticized the late President Turgut Ozal for." "With the exception of terrorism, the Ciller government has not been successful in any issue."
