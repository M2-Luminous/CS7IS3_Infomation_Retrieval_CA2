Meanwhile, in a radio and television message, de facto President Emile Jonassaint called for Haitian unity. Malval and Jonassaint spoke on separate occasions during the celebrations to mark University and Flag Day. According to Jonassaint, this unity is as important "as the unity that led to the creation of the flag on 18 May 1803." The U.S., Venezuelan, Taiwan, and Mexican ambassadors, the Canadian and French charges d'affaires, and the Papal Nuncio met with Malval at his Chante Brise home to express their support. In statements to journalists, the diplomats noted that their presence at Malval's home clearly expresses their rejection of the "supposed" de facto government and their support for President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown on 30 September 1991 by a military group led by General Raoul Cedras. The diplomats added that Aristide and Malval represent the constitutional legitimacy of Haiti.
