ACTION: Notice of availability of the model State programs for the training and certification of operators of high capacity fossil fuel-fired plants as required under section 129 of the Clean Air Act (Act). SUMMARY: This action announces the availability of training materials which constitute the model State training program for operators of high capacity fossil fuel-fired plants, and the model State certification program for these operators, as required under section 129 of the Act. ADDRESSES: The final student handbook (specify ``High Capacity Fossil Fuel-Fired Plant Operator Training Program_Student Handbook,'' EPA&hyph;453/B&hyph;94&hyph;056) may be obtained from the U.S. EPA Air Pollution Training Institute (MD&hyph;17), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, telephone number (919) 541&hyph;2498, FAX number (919) 541&hyph;5598. For qualified instructors interested in conducting the training course, single copies of the instructor's guide (specify ``High Capacity Fossil Fuel-Fired Plant Operator Training Program_Instructor's Guide,'' EPA&hyph;453/B&hyph;94&hyph;057) can be requested by contacting the U.S. EPA Air Pollution Training Institute (MD&hyph;17), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, telephone number (919) 541&hyph;2498, FAX number (919) 541&hyph;5598 at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For information concerning specific aspects of this notice, contact Mr. James Eddinger, Industrial Studies Branch, Emission Standards Division (MD&hyph;13), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, telephone number (919) 541&hyph;5426. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following outline is provided to aid in locating information in this notice. I. Background II. Comments and Responses III. Model State Training Program IV. Model State Certification Program V. Authority I. Background Section 129(d) of the Act requires the EPA to develop and promote a model State program for the training and certification of solid waste incineration unit operators and high-capacity fossil fuel-fired plant operators. In August 1993, the EPA submitted to all State air pollution control agencies the model State training programs that the EPA developed for operators of municipal waste combustors (MWC's) and medical waste incinerators (MWI's) pursuant to this requirement. To ensure the availability of at least one appropriate national certification program for these solid waste incineration units, the EPA requested the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) to develop and manage a nationwide certification program for MWC and MWI operators. As a result, the ASME developed an ASME certification program for each of these solid waste incineration industry categories. The model State training programs for MWC's and MWI's were developed by the EPA to provide a level of understanding that is adequate to successfully complete the requirements of the ASME program or an equivalent State-approved program for certification of operators of such facilities. The emission standards (40 CFR 60.50a) promulgated under section 129 for MWC's require certification of the operator by the ASME or an equivalent State-approved certification program. In October 1992, the EPA initiated development of a training program for operators of high capacity fossil fuel-fired plants. The EPA considers the term high-capacity fossil fuel-fired plants to mean boilers (i.e., devices that combust fossil fuel to produce steam or hot water) greater than 10 million BTU's per hour heat input. The group of high capacity fossil fuel-fired plants (boilers) covered in this training course includes the size range from small industrial, commercial, and institutional steam generating units (greater than 10 million BTU's per hour heat input) to large utility boilers. On October 6, 1993 (58 FR 52106), EPA announced the availability of a draft student handbook, prepared as part of a training course for operators of high capacity fossil fuel-fired plants, and EPA's intention to develop a model State certification program for these operators; and invited public comments on both the contents of the student handbook and the EPA's intention to develop the model State certification program.
