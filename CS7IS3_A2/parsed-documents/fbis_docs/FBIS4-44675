Spot-4 is an earth-observation satellite, due to be launched into orbit towards the middle of 1997. CNES announced on January 17 that an agreement had been signed with the European Commission, under which some ECU16 million will be made available to the French agency for development of the programme, in which besides the Commission, the French, Belgian, Swedish and Italian Governments are to participate. The technical work will be carried out by the French giant Aerospatiale. The EU will be financing 50 percent of the Vegetation project, which calls for development of the instrument and establishment of a centre for image processing. CNES has announced that the Commission had already made provision for "complementary financing." In tandem with another instrument, the HVIR (high resolution in visible and infra-red images), Vegetation is expected to provide daily coverage of the globe with the same spectral characteristics as other high-resolution satellite instruments, whose images can be analysed at local and regional level. Vegetation is thus expected to provide the EU with vital data on agriculture, environment, international cooperation and research.
