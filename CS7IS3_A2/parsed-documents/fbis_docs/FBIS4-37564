Is Aden taking account of this? [Yahya] Aden is complying with the cease-fire, and it is demanding day and night that the fighting be halted, because its continuation would inevitably affect Red Sea security and safety in the long term. Nevertheless, Aden has huge capabilities and an advanced naval force. But there is a need to coordinate efforts at the Arab and international levels to stop the war. Aden is standing fast and has the ability to stand fast for a long time. But the war's effects on neighboring states and the Arab region will be devastating. [Abu-Husayn] But UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi spoke at the end of his tour of progress vis-a-vis the work of the committee supervising the cease-fire. [Yahya] That is true. But we regret to say that Sanaa has denied Brahimi's statement and its acceptance of Aden's proposal regarding the work of that committee. Sanaa wants to revive the joint committee formed before the war which comprised Jordan, the Sultanate of Oman, and observers from the U.S. and French Embassies -- which we do not accept, because there is fighting going on now and its dangers are great, and it needs more intervention from the United Nations by way of adopting a strong resolution to compel Sanaa to halt the fighting. [Abu-Husayn] Let us ask you about statements made yesterday by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his agreement to hold a dialogue with southern leaders but in the framework of the Yemeni Constitution: Do you accept that? [Yahya] Yes, we welcome dialogue with president 'Ali Salih but in the framework of the constitution of the Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Pledge and Accord Document, which we consider a constitution for all the institutions of our new state, "the Republic of Yemen" [Jumhuriyat al-Yaman] [sentence as published]. However, I doubt what President 'Ali Salih says, because he contradicts himself every five minutes here and there. I think that Sanaa is trying to get around Security Council Resolution 924 lest a new resolution is adopted against it after Lakhdar Brahimi submits his report. Nevertheless, we demand that the Security Council be convened again as soon as possible to work to implement its resolution. [passage omitted]
