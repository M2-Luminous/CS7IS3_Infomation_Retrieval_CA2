Kozyrev, who last visited China in December 1992 with President Boris Yeltsin, is due to spend 48 hours in Beijing before taking a brief trip to the Shenzhen special economic zone near Hong Kong and visiting the ancient central capital of Xian, the home of the terra cotta warriors. During his meetings in the capital, the minister is due to discuss the upcoming visit to Moscow of Chinese President Jiang Zemin, which is scheduled some time within the next six months, the Russian sources said. Kozyrev is due to meet Jiang and Prime Minister Li Peng on Friday. He is also due, along with his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen, to sign an accord setting up regular consultations between the two, the Russian Embassy here said. A second accord due to be signed concerns border crossings for traders, the Russian sources said. In 1992, Russian-Chinese trade amounted to six billion dollars, 80 percent of which passed through their common, 4,500 kilometer (2,790 mile) border. Two-thirds of trade is based on barter. "Sino-Russian relations are very good and have been steadily growing," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said last week. Chinese officials closely follow the situation inside Russia, and the matter will be one of the primary topics of discussion during Kozyrev's visit. After the Sino-Soviet rift that developed in the beginning of the 1960s, the two communist giants officially reconciled in 1989 during a visit to China by Mikhail Gorbachev. Since Boris Yeltsin came to power in 1991, the neighboring countries have enjoyed strong military cooperation. A Russian diplomatic source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the military issue would be on the agenda and that the minister "is capable of broaching all issues." The Chinese leaders will most likely ask for an explanation about the delay in delivering Russian Sukhoi-27 jets, other Russian sources said. The Chinese air force ordered 24 such jets worth more than a billion dollars in 1992, but only a dozen of them have been delivered so far. The military hardware factory in Komsomolsk, in far eastern Russia, is suffering from a shortage of spare parts, the sources said. During his visit, Yetsin spoke of the great prospects for Sino- Russian military cooperation, recalling that much of China's technology and equipment came from the former Soviet Union, and thus that China needs Russia's spare parts and technological assistance. Russia constructed 256 arms manufacturing plants in China following a 1950 alliance treaty. In November 1993, the Russian defense minister Pavel Gratchev signed a five-year military cooperation accord with his counterpart Chi Haotian. The Chinese army prefers less-expensive Russian material to Western equipment because of its price. According to Western military experts, China wants to buy fighter planes, particularly MiG-31s, ground-to-air missiles, and technology for missiles, tanks, radar and in-flight refuelling. The issue of security in the Asia-Pacific region, which was broached during Gratchev's visit, will also figure prominently on the agenda of Kozyrev's discussions in China, the Russian sources said.
