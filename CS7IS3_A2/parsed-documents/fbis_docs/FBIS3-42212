Touali, 32, was kidnapped overnight Tuesday and his body was subsequently discovered, the party said. He was the second member of Attahadi and the fourth political activist to be slain by suspected Islamic extremists since the January 27 murder of another official in the party, Ferhat Chibout. The statement did not specify where Touali lived nor where the body was found. He was an employee of a state-owned company in the eastern town of Constantine. His murder followed the killing Tuesday in the Casbah district of Algiers of French journalist Olivier Quemeneur and the wounding by gunmen of the cameraman's Australian colleague, Scott Allan White. On Wednesday, White was at the Ain Nadja military hospital in a suburb of the capital, in very serious condition. [passage omitted]
