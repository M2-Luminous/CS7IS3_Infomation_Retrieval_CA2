FBIS4-48236 "drafr094_c_94012" FBIS-AFR-94-094 Daily Report 16 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 14 May South African Press Review for 14 May MB1405114994 MB1405114994 BFN [Editorial Report] WEEKEND STAR Future Pitfalls -- While South Africa still faces political problems, "the pitfalls for the future lie rather in another direction," how South Africa "addresses the majority's aspirations" as the "new South Africa will live or die by the economic decisions it takes now," an editorial in the Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on 14-15 May on page 10 notes. "Initial signs are encouraging. Mandela has retained Derek Keys as Finance Minister" and "surrounded him with solid choices" Trevor Manuel and Tito Mboweni. As "aid, as illustrated elsewhere in Africa, can become an unwelcome albatross for a young government attempting to find its feet," "the ANC's economists, in their dealings with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, have generally shown a healthy reluctance to get tied down by terms dictated to them." "Obviously it would be churlish for South Africa to turn its back on nations anxious to help it through a testing period. But the government must exercise the utmost caution before it dives into waters containing dangerous undercurrants." NEW NATION Acknowledging Sacrifices -- It was a "joyous week" for South Africa, but "it is important that we acknowledge the sacrifices that have been made by so many who have not lived to join in this feast of our freedom," an editorial in Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 13 May on page 7 states. "We must recognize that the suffering" of Mozambique "was a direct consequence of the role that country and its people played in the struggle against apartheid." Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] was "spawned by those who orchestrated apartheid's defense." And the "devasting" suffering in Angola "mainly because of the help it gave to the ANC in its battle against apartheid." UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] "continues to exist and fester in Angola only because it was expedient from the point of view of apartheid." The help of Zambia's Kaunda and Tanzania's Nyerere was not "adequately " acknowledged and "it needs to be said very forcefully" that "we might not have been in a position to celebrate a victory this week had it not been for the Cubans" who "committed their lives to defeating apartheid's defense force at Cuito Cuanavale." "While the debt we owe these nations is not one we can pretend we will be able to settle, we must at least acknowledge it." Reconciliation -- "Much has been said about the need for reconciliation" and "without a doubt" it "must be one of our priorities," the second editorial in the 13 May NEW NATION notes. However, "as important as reconciliation is, we must ensure that we do not pursue this objective with romantic enthusiasm." "We must remember that the victory we recorded was not without immense cost." While "we cannot forget that some of the most senior ministers in the GNU [Government of National Unity] were among those that sat in the State Security Council in P W Botha's government," "this is not to suggest that we need to be suspicious of those we work with. Instead what we need is vigilance." And truth cannot "become a casualty as we offer indemnity to political criminals in our pursuit of reconciliation." Murders committed to defend apartheid "cannot be pardoned or even considered for indemity." BEELD Parliament Gains New Wealth -- The Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 10 May in a page 10 editorial points out that "few generations are privileged to witness in so short a time so many highlights becoming instant history." "How different the process has been to the predictions of the prophets of doom." "Today we can look in the mirror and no longer see the monster of oppression or the skunk of apartheid, but something beautiful and just. Above all, something democratic, because that is the heartbeat of of the new beginning. No institution is holy. If South Africa had not reformed, Parliament and the Union Buildings could have eventually become the seats of a revolutionary regime, or useless museums standing as witness to the absolute stupidity of generations of Afrikaners and whites who refused to adapt. But now Parliament and the Union Buildings have gained a new use, a new wealth, new ideas which witness the diversity of the country." "South Africa has completed its transition not with revolutionary rumbling, but with dignity, courtesy, and respect for institutions representing law and order. We wish the new rulers strength and wisdom. Our deepest hope is that eventually all South Africans will enjoy the fruits of this change. Because that is the noblest ideal behind all the changes: to make South Africa a more beautiful, better, and safer place for all."
