Representatives of the coalition parties are scheduled to meet Wednesday to confirm their unity and hammer out policies for a new government. The coalition may agree to nominate Wataru Kubo, secretary general of its biggest group, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), as new chief cabinet secretary, who serves as chief spokesman and chief of staff for the prime minister, the sources said. Both houses of the Diet are expected to vote on a new prime minister early next week after Hata returns home from an international trade meeting in Morocco, they said. Hata, who is the head of Shinseito, widely regarded as the coalition's driving force, is tentatively scheduled to leave Tokyo on Wednesday and return home Sunday. The heads of three of the seven parties in the eight-month-old coalition -- the SDP, new party Sakigake and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) -- met late Tuesday to discuss the choice of a successor to Hosokawa, who announced his resignation last Friday. During the meeting, SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama told DSP chairman Keigo Ouchi and Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura that a plan has emerged to pick Hata as prime minister and Kubo as chief cabinet secretary, coalition sources said. Hata told a news conference Tuesday night that he places importance on maintaining the framework of the coalition. "During the past eight months, each of us was in a hard position but could settle difficult problems," Hata said. The coalition's compromise followed several rounds of secret talks between Murayama and Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, a key coalition strategist, political sources said. Meanwhile, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has given up the idea of leaving the main opposition party and running for the premiership, LDP sources said. His decision followed the coalition agreement to maintain unity. Watanabe has failed to garner a sufficient number of supporters from among LDP members, the sources said. After attending Tuesday's meeting of representatives of coalition components, SDP Secretary General Kubo said, "I'm pretty sure we can solve our problems to maintain and develop our coalition government." Shinseito's Ozawa told reporters, "everything is going in the right direction." The coalition had been on the brink of collapse, as divisions among the parties deepened after Hosokawa abruptly announced his resignation.
