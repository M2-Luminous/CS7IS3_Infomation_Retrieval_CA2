Stan Shih, chairman of the Taipei-based group, told a press conference that the increased interest in the Japanese market reflects growing sales of its PCs here. He said possible Japanese partners in the planned alliance will be trading houses. The group posted 400 million yen in sales in the January-March quarter this year in Japan, almost equivalent to that for the whole year of 1993. For the current business year ending in March 1995, the group expects 10,000 units of sales worth 2 billion yen. Established in 1991, the far-flung group has bases in Asia, Europe and the United States. The Japanese unit was formed in 1988 to handle marketing.
