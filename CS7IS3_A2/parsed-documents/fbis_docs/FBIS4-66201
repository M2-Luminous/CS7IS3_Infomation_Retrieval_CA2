If this assessment is right, when drawing up macroeconomic policies, we will have to act on the principle of seizing opportunities for a great leap in reform and development, while avoiding too sharp risks. We say that China now has better opportunities than other countries because 15 years of reform and development have established certain economic-system, material, and technological grounds for much future development, enabling the current bursting forth of the long-suppressed potential vitality of our ancient civilization. In particular, the long-awaited reform assault decided on by the 14th CPC Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has made it possible for the Chinese economy, through market economy development and operation, to overcome certain deeper conflicts still troubling it. If the program of the 14th CPC Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee is implemented successfully, the Chinese economy will be able in the near future to get onto a path of sustained, valid, and rapid growth. But our path to an economic takeoff and a new upsurge will not be smooth. While the change in tactics as a refuge from past storms that we have adopted through reform in the past dozen or so years had its positive aspects, it has also left blind spots in certain crucial sectors of our national economy, accumulating a number of deeprooted conflicts that are obstructing the smooth progress of reform and development. In particular, the two conflicts of inflation and the lack of vitality of state enterprises, not only are causing many public complaints but, if not dealt with promptly, could easily affect our economic and social stability. Faced with this situation, some economists are advocating the adoption of tactics that could be called "curbing recession with inflation." They say that while inflation is harmful, the losses created by currency devaluation are the same for everyone and, while everyone will complain about them, noone will be particularly discontented, nor will anyone take the lead in making trouble about them. But recession differs in that if factories operate under capacity, causing lower wages or unemployment, it will be hard to avoid a negative impact on social stability. So they favor the adoption of a "loose" monetary policy, by providing plenty of funds and market demands to state enterprises that are now in trouble, to maintain their operations and worker employment. But while those in favor of an expansionary monetary policy based on protection of state enterprises argue it plausibly and at length, it is certainly hard for me to agree with such an argument for the following reasons: 1) It is wrong to say that inflation does not have severe social consequences. While overall price rises certainly create the same devaluation losses for every yuan of money, the harm they cause to various individuals is absolutely different. In an inflationary state, commerce is better than industry, with hoarding and profiteering in turn being better than commerce. The group most negatively affected is the wage-earning and salaried strata, while profiteers on the other hand can fish in the troubled waters to get very rich by foul means. These not only are facts that we all know, but even more so are history that we of this generation have experienced personally. 2) Using monetary expansion to alleviate the difficulties of state enterprises is like drinking poison to quench one's thirst. While the current difficult plight of state enterprises has many causes, the main one is system factors. The only way to ensure that they essentially overcome these difficulties to recover their glory is by determining to reform our enterprise system and overall economic climate. While enterprises of course need help out of their immediate difficulties, if they need subsidized relief, then it should come through "open subsidies," not the "large-scale irrigation" method of universally providing low-interest loans (actually negative-interest loans). This is because that can only lower fund-use efficiency, forming a vicious cycle of inflation--lower efficiency--worse inflation, even evolving into a difficult and complicated case of macroeconomic inflation coexisting with microeconomic enterprise recession. 3) The theoretical grounds of the abovementioned policy proposal, the theory that low unemployment can be maintained only at the cost of high inflation, have long since been debunked by Western economics as a misapplication of the "Phillips curve." All modern economics textbooks say that even based on the Phillips theory of a negative correlation between unemployment and inflation, a society's unemployment depends not only on inflation, but even more importantly on its place in the Phillips curve. In some economies, the maintenance of zero inflation comes only at the cost of very high unemployment, while in others, zero inflation is not accompanied by too high unemployment, which is absolutely possible to keep within socially sustainable limits. So Western economists seem to have learned a lesson from the disastrous effect of "stagnant expansion" caused by the use of a macroeconomic policy of displacing unemployment with inflation. Noone any more regards an inflationary policy as a panacea for curing recession and unemployment, seeking rather for remedies in areas such as promoting technical advances, optimizing economic structures, enhancing competitive capability, and paying attention to human resources development. As to China, in addition to striving to upgrade our own modern economics knowledge, we had best assimilate certain lessons from the ultimate consequences of the 1987 plan to ease difficulties by the "flooding-of-the-pump method." In light of this, our current strategy should be to reassert the consensus reached in mid-1992, that to overcome immediate difficulties and avoid greater risks, the basic way is through reform. In this respect, a currently very popular viewpoint seems to be wrong. This viewpoint sums up the cause of the severe inflation danger as the many reform measures taking effect in 1994, correspondingly holding that a valid means to prevent severe inflation is to slow reform. This viewpoint is wrong primarily because it does not conform to the facts. We know that there is a 10-month process of inflationary pressures from excess monetary accumulation to release through price rises. Once inflationary pressures begin to be released, they accelerate steadily. China's current round of inflationary pressures has accumulated in the course of our early-1990 reform delay and growth acceleration. These pressures began to be released in the last half of 1992, being somewhat eased through the tighter macroeconomic control of July and August 1993, but then reaccelerating due to the loosened monetary policy of September through November 1993. Market economoy operating principles tell us that the direct cause of inflation, or steadily rising overall prices, is invariably an excess money supply causing an imbalance between overall supply and demand. Without this condition, rising prices for any particular commodity cannot cause a steady rise in overall prices. But with it, certain reasons (such as tax rate adjustments and interest rate changes) can always be found to raise prices. Moreover, as prices have been essentially deregulated, even without excuses, sellers' higher prices can always be accepted by some buyers. So the attempt to slow reform to curb inflation and ease enterprise difficulties basically cannot achieve its objectives. On the contrary, as China's economic inflationary pressures and enterprise difficulties are created essentially by lagging reform in crucial sectors and the coexistence of dual systems, adopting such a roundabout method to overcome difficulties could result only in just the opposite of what we wished. The basic thinking of the "Resolution" by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on proceeding with overall reform in all areas was right. While the application plans for reforms in all areas drawn up in the spirit of this programmatic document still contain certain flaws and loopholes, they are still generally right. The current issue is whether these reform measures can be genuinely implemented. Organizing the implementation of such major reform actions in 1994 will be a very difficult task. On one hand, as our economic system is an overall system, with mutual ties and restraints among its various systems and system links, all reform actions need to be closely coordinated. Particularly in launching such a large-scale reform-offensive campaign as in 1994, coordination among all front armies will be decisive. For whatever reason, if the actions of a front army or even a small platoon are obstructed, so that it cannot reach its scheduled position at the designated time, this will check the actions of other units, even causing the whole campaign to fail. As to the reforms that are taking effect in 1994 in areas, such as tax revenue, banking, foreign exchange, enterprises, and social security system, in whatever aspect or link that does not keep pace, the economic system cannot work effectively in that area. If reform does not occur in one area, the whole market economy system cannot operate effectively. Taking banking reform for instance, its basic substance is to upgrade our investment system on planned economy terms to a financing system in a market economy, including items, such as making sound central bank functions, commercializing specialized banks, establishing financing markets, marketizing deposit and loan interest rates, and setting up a policy financing agency. If only one of these reforms does not occur, none of the others can achieve the expected results. For instance, while various new financial institutions have been established in line with banking-reform application plans, as long as deposit and loan interest rates remain under hard regulation by administrative organs, retaining the low and even negative interest rates on planned economy terms, the newly established financial institutions may be called "commercial banks," but can only be old wine in new bottles, meaning that the effort was in vain. This is because artificially prescribed low-rate terms can mean only an open or covert rationing system, not commodity circulation through free market exchange. This is an unchangeable rule. With man-made maintenance of real negative-interest rates for bank loans, funds can be distributed only with certain administrative authority. At which time, if the planned investment system has been abolished, things can turn even worse. This is because on planned-economy terms, administrative fund distribution has to occur in principle through certain plans formulated to achieve balance while, with neither money markets or investment planning, all is dependent merely on "patting the heads" of the administrative officials who make the examination and approval decisions. When the public financing system cannot work effectively, this makes it hard for all reforms in other areas to succeed, as well as having a severe impact on economic operations, including normal enterprise operations. On the other hand, as there are so many uncertain factors in economic activities, we need to pay close attention to the development of events, responding promptly to changing circumstances. Especially when carrying out such a reform offensive as in 1994, as there are not precedents to follow, we can neither require all measures to to be designed flawlessly in advance, or expect their execution to be exactly right or perfectly done. Moreover, in the course of implementing predetermined measures, misunderstandings or conflicts of interests may produce deformities and distortions. And when there are new situations, issues, and flaws that had not been considered in advance, there is even more need for prompt adoption of forceful emergency steps to resolve them. All of this shows that the key to seizing opportunities and avoiding risks is earnestly implementing all reform measures that have been put into effect. In this respect, firm command, oversight, and coordination are the most decisive factors. If this is done well, our overall reforms will have won their first victory, laying real ground for the smooth growth of the Chinese economy.
