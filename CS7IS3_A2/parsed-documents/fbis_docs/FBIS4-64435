Japanese sources explained their premier's wish by recalling the importance he places on the July Naples G-7 summit -- the reason why he chose Italy to start a European tour which will take him to Paris (tomorrow), Bonn and Brussels. Separately, the premier-designate had talks with Italy's Ambassador to the United States Boris Banchieri on U.S. President Bill Clinton's June 2-3 visit to Italy.
