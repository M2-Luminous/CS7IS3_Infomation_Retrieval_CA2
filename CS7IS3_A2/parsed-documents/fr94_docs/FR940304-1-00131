FR940304-1-00131 FR940304-1-00014 The Net Present Value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, indicates that for all classes of room air conditioners, standard level 1 would produce an NPV of $0.44 billion to consumers. The corresponding net present values for standard levels 2&hyph;6 are $0.82 billion, $1.59 billion, $1.68 billion, $1.85 billion and $1.32 billion, respectively. The net present value for standard level 7 is minus $4.70 billion. See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6. C. Energy savings. As indicated above, standards will result in significant savings of electricity consumption by room air conditioners. D. Lessening of utility or performance of products. As indicated above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the standards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performance of room air conditioners. E. Impact of lessening of competition. The determination of this factor must be made by the Attorney General. F. Need of the nation to save energy. Room air conditioners use electricity directly. In 1987, 4.3 percent of residential sector source electricity (or 0.45 quads) was accounted for on a national basis by room air conditioners. In addition, decreasing future electricity demand as a result of standards will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of Volume A. 37 Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO 2 ). For all classes of room air conditioners at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated SO 2 reduction would be 52,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of SO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by powerplants in the United States is 0.03 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;7, the reductions are 116,000 tons; 229,000 tons; 261,000 tons; 394,000 tons; 520,000 tons; and 777,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.35 percent. 37 The expected environmental impacts of the candidate standard levels were calculated prior to passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA, Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, November 15, 1990). As explained below, the CAAA will lower emissions of SO 2 and NO 2 . Since appliance standards reduce the need for generation of electricity, they will cause lower emissions by powerplants of SO 2 and NO 2 , thereby helping those utilities meet their required pollution reductions. For SO 2 , any emission reductions caused by appliance standards prior to the year 2000 will be part of much greater SO 2 reductions that are required by the CAAA. After the year 2000, SO 2 reductions achieved through appliance standards or any other means by those emitting SO 2 can be earned as credits. These are credits to emit an amount of SO 2 equivalent to the amount of the SO 2 reduction that created the credits. The new amendments allow those earning the credits either to sell them to others or to ``bank'' them for future use. Therefore, after the year 2000, to the extent that appliance standards result in SO 2 credits being earned, and to the extent that such standards_induced credits are sold and used by others, the national SO 2 reductions from standards will not occur. The new law also requires that utility boilers emit lower levels of NO x and requires that additional actions to reduce emissions be taken in regions not now in compliance with Federal ambient air quality standards for NO x or derivative pollutants, such as ground-level ozone. Because of these new requirements, the actual reductions in NO x emissions likely to result from the appliance standards are very likely to be substantially less than the estimates made prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990 and contained in this document. With respect to CO 2 , there are as yet no such regulatory constraints on national or regional emissions. However, efforts to comply with international commitments to stabilize CO 2 emissions, such as voluntary commitments by utilities and industries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000, may result in constraints that are similar in nature to those for SO 2 and NO 2 . If so, the reductions in CO 2 emissions estimated to result from the standards also may not be fully realized.
