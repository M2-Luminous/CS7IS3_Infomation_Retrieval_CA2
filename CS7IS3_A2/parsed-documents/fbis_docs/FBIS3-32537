Alexandre Garcia now reports live from the Congress plenary session. [Begin Garcia recording] Despite a protest by the minority, the majority of lawmakers approved a request for an overall vote on all the individual topics on which separate voting had been requested. This means that a majority vote will defeat the requests for separate voting on individual topics, in order to let the original text of the bill -- which has already been approved -- remain unchanged. Today's congressional agenda also includes a vote on the reduction of the presidential term from five to four years. [end recording] We remind you that a second voting is due on the emergency social fund before it is published by the official gazette.
