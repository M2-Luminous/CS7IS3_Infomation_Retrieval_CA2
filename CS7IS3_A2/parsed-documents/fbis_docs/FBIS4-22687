Of course, I do not mean direct military aggression. The most important task today is to preserve the country's unity, so that the Russian state will not become a "patchwork quilt." It is also necessary to provide for Russia's sovereign right to dispose of its own wealth: minerals, strategic raw material, gold reserves, precious metals, and so forth. We must not allow our country to become some kind of colonial appendage. If foreign investors and foreign firms are able to penetrate deeply into our economy and financial system, Russia will lose its sovereignty and national independence, and without military aggression. Many people today think that Russia is surrounded only by well-wishers. This is a profoundly erroneous position. Unfortunately, we have opened wide not only our doors but also Russia's borders for penetration of everyone and anyone and we have removed all restrictions on access to what was previously closed. We have foreigners as advisers to the president and government, advisers in the economic structures and financial system. Foreigners already have their hands on our property and have made their way to our property and have made their way to our natural resources. In think this is an uncontrolled process--a far from normal phenomenon. But if we begin to rectify the situation, I do not rule out the possibility of strong pressure on Russia from the states of the West. In other words, we have many friends as long as we allow them to operate without restriction in the country. But as soon as we raise the question of restricting their freedom of activity, their attitude toward us changes. I am in favor of national accord, and on this plane I am prepared for any interaction with the government and presidential structures. But under the condition that they will take into account at least the interests of the majority of the population, the main social strata. Because when the hungry, the unclothed, and the unshod continue to be poor and on an ever larger scale and the well-off and the rich increasingly rob the poor and down and out with ever greater frenzy, no national reconciliation can be achieved. For the sake of universal peace and harmony, the course of the so-called economic reforms must be changed. No less crucial is the problem of fighting crime and corruption. I think that with the present course of the reforms, if it is possible to stop their growth at all it is only for the time being. Because the social basis of this phenomenon will not be eliminated. In the section of Yeltsin's message devoted to crime I was struck by the frequent use of expressions like "needed," "necessary," and "must," meaning the government, the Duma, and the Federal Assembly as a whole. But who has been keeping the president from fighting crime up to this point? After all, he is the one responsible for the government; according to the Constitution he is the one who guarantees observance of the rights and freedoms of the citizens and is responsible for protecting their interests. And he, the president, is the end point of the power structures. So what has Yeltsin done to fight crime during his reign besides issue empty declarations which we hear in every one of his speeches? Our problem is that the laws are not being obeyed, and not least of all--by the president himself. Moreover, the current authorities are corrupt from bottom to top and they are never going to fight against themselves. Now the post of procurator general has been filled by Ilyushenko--a member of the infamous "interdepartmental commission." It is difficult to imagine a greater tragedy for the procuracy or greater harm to law and order in Russia. During the past three years the procuracy has lived through three procurator generals and, unfortunately, each has been worse than his predecessor in terms of professional qualities and persistence in defending the law. Knowing the procuracy system and many of its workers well, I can state that Ilyushenko will not be taken seriously either by the apparatus or by the workers in the localities. And this will have a negative effect on the state of procuratorial oversight and the organization of the fight against crime. As before, the current authorities will limit themselves to exposing only individual cases of corruption and wage the battle against it in insignificant forms. The foundation, the essence of this phenomenon that is tearing society apart will remain untouched. As before, corruption in the higher echelons of power will be beyond the reach of anyone who would expose it, and that is the saddest part. Honest procuracy investigators and judges will perform their professional and civil duties in fear of losing their positions, their jobs. There are plenty of examples of punishment of principled, "obstinate" workers of law enforcement organs. But still, even under the current unfavorable conditions, a fight against crime can and should be waged. The first contacts between deputies who are members of the committee on security and law enforcement organs inspire a certain amount of hope. We have already concluded an agreement with the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation concerning joint development of legislative acts aimed at stepping up this battle. The Ministry of Internal Affairs has assigned a group of its own specialists--scholars and experts. We are also arranging similar contacts with the Ministry of Justice and the Procuracy. We have held work meetings with representatives of the Security Council. We have a certain understanding and we can work together. Still, in my view, serious progress in this area will be possible only with certain changes in the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the discharge from the law enforcement system workers in all of its areas who compromise themselves. It would not be a bad idea for such a "purge" to simultaneously affect government structures, administration chiefs, and presidential representatives in the localities. People must be recruited not according to the principle of personal loyalty to the leaders but according to the principle of professionalism in combination with steadfastness, honesty, and devotion to the people. It would be desirable to take all these urgent measures in concert with effective law making, improvement of the moral situation in society, and, undoubtedly, improvement of the well-being of the people. The first work sessions of our committee revealed a certain uniformity of views among its members and a similarity in the assessments of the situation and the security of Russia. We have declared a need to adopt a law on corruption. We are preparing for hearings in the State Duma of a draft law on protection of judges, procurators, and workers of other law enforcement organs. We have announced a law on protection of victims and witnesses. We are working on a draft law that would regulate the extraction, production, transportation, and sale of strategic materials, precious metals, and gold. In my view, the political amnesty declared by the State Duma was an important state toward national accord. The question of restoration of justice with respect to the people arrested and taken to court for the events of 19-21 August 1991, and 1 May, 21 September-4 October 1994 was raised by the opposition long ago, and above all by the Communist Party. This was a point in their election platform and a kind of mandate from the voters. An awareness of the fact that the investigation of these cases that has been started and their examination in court will not reveal the objective truth and hence will not be fair has gradually come to many of the deputies. They have also understood that Russian society cannot be constantly in a state of civil war, we must get out of this situation somehow, because confrontation threatens us with graver consequences. Therefore an attempt has been made to find at least certain areas of mutual understanding among various factions in the Duma, and we have adopted a memorandum on accord. Amnesty is the first step toward building bridges among various groups in parliament and thus in our society.
