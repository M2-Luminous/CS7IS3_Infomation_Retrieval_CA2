Four U.S. congressmen, including Robert Torricelli -- the author of the law that intensifies the blockade against Cuba -- spoke during the demonstration, which was planned by the Cuban Unity Movement [Movimiento Unidad Cubana]. Florida's Republican Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz Balart, as well as New Jersey's Democratic Representative Robert Menendez, spoke at the demonstration. They all expressed their support for maintaining the restrictions, which have cost Cuba over $40 billion in the past three decades. Some 1,000 people, who arrived in three planes and 12 buses from Miami, took part in this demonstration in front of the Capitol. A spokesperson for the organization called International Peace for Cuba [Internacional Paz Para Cuba] told PRENSA LATINA by telephone that the demonstration was staged to protest a draft bill proposed by New York's Democratic Representative Charles Rangel, who will submit said bill for discussion before four congressional committees on 17 February [date as received]. Rangel's draft bill, which is called the Free Trade With Cuba Act, has the support of 30 U.S. congress members, religious leaders, businessmen, academicians, and the moderate sector of the Cuban- American community. Paul Asure, an International Peace for Cuba spokesman, said that the demonstration's organizers sought to get the attention of U.S. Government leaders in a context in which they are increasingly becoming a minority, as they are listened to less and less. Asure added that they see themselves as losing strength in their efforts to smother Cuba and are trying to make noise. However, they are faced with the current situation where people in the United States and most members of the Cuban-American community are pressing Washington to change its policy toward Cuba. On 12 February the so-called International Peace for Cuba organized a demonstration in favor of Rangel's proposal and the U.S.-Cuban Friendship Caravan, which will take humanitarian aid to Cuba on 12 March. Today's demonstration in Washington is the most advertised activity by ultrarightist groups since Havana announced a call for a dialogue between the government and representatives of the Cuban community abroad to be held on 22, 23, and 24 April. According to Andres Romero, president of the Organization of Cuban-Americans for Dignity [Organizacion Cubanos-Americanos por la Dignidad], this demonstration is "more or less the same thing" and it shows that they "feel as cornered as those who see their game is about to end." Romero told PRENSA LATINA that representatives of various groups that oppose the blockade also participated in the demonstration because if "this is a democratic country, we are also entitled to exert our rights." When people of this type use their time to threaten the lives of 11 million people solely to defend their personal interests.... their words, predictions, and threats lose their strength. The demonstration by blockade advocates is viewed as an act of protest against those who favor an end to economic sanctions, including prominent U.S. publications such as THE NEW YORK TIMES, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, THE JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, THE WASHINGTON POST, and WORLD TRADE magazine. Even former supporters of the blockade have changed their minds, as is the case with New Mexico's Democratic Representative Bill Richardson, who is a cosponsor of Rangel's bill. Former Justice Secretary Ramsey Clark has also challenged this policy and has raised the question that if Washington ended the commercial embargo against Vietnam, why can it not do the same with Cuba, where, as opposed to the former, no U.S. citizens have died. However, Warren Christopher, U.S. Secretary of State, recently rejected the possibility of a policy change as in the case of Vietnam, because, Christopher argued, "Cuba and Vietnam constitute two different situations."
