The visits of British statesmen to our republic have become more frequent. How do you evaluate Britain's position in the solution of questions of vital importance to Azerbaijan? [Akhundov] I would note Britain's objectivity both in respect to the events in our region and during discussion of all the first three resolutions in the UN Security Council. The draft of the latest, fourth, resolution, which Britain is at this moment correcting, was submitted for Security Council discussion recently. It differs from Resolution No. 874, with whose content Azerbaijan has in principle remained dissatisfied and which it has regarded as a retreat from the provisions of the preceding Resolutions 822 and 853. [Correspondent] You mean that Britain is preparing a draft new resolution? [Akhundov] Britain is a member of the UN Security Council. Usually each country on the Security Council makes its corrections and submits its observations and revisions during the elaboration of official documents. At the present time the draft new resolution is being studied at the British Foreign Ministry. [Correspondent] May it be maintained that all these visits, meetings, and talks will somehow influence the opinion of the world community, help Azerbaijan find new supporters, and produce specific results? [Akhundov] The first British parliamentary delegation came to Azerbaijan this April. It consisted of representatives of the Conservative and Labor parties. It was followed on a visit to our republic by Dr. Clark, representative of the Labor Party and shadow defense secretary. And, finally, this month--the latest visit of representatives of the British parliament. The result of all these contacts was the joint decision to form a special group in the British parliament for liaison with the parliament of Azerbaijan and our republic as a whole. This group will register with the Interparliamentary Union, which may be seen as a positive factor in Azerbaijan's favor. [Correspondent] How are relations with the parliaments of other countries shaping up? [Akhundov] There are no further such examples of cooperation as yet, unfortunately. Relations have been established with neighboring Turkey, but they have not been seen through to the end. It is very important today that at this difficult, dramatic time for Azerbaijan foreign countries and the public obtain objective information and learn the truth. I believe it to be of considerable importance that Britain itself and the British parliament are commenting objectively on the events taking place here. Interparliamentary contacts--a guarantee of the development of further cooperation between our states--are taking shape. I have to mention Mr. James Spicer--a sponsor of the creation of the interparliamentary group. He is the head in Britain of the Westminster Democracy Foundation, which, obviously, will perform an important role in relations between our states. We outlined in the negotiations the first specific steps, and Mr. Spicer proposed the formation of a group of 10-15 young politicians which would in the future visit Britain. It is contemplated that the Azerbaijani politicians will meet with politicians of Britain, visit the British parliament, and acquire visual lessons in parliamentarianism and democracy. In addition, we believe that the foundation will associate itself actively with the implementation of cultural activities. [Correspondent] In other words, the foundations of further mutual relations between Azerbaijan and Britain, between the parliaments of the two countries, are being laid today, now? [Akhundov] Yes, and this is in itself a very good beginning. It implants hope of the possibility of cooperation and the establishment of stable relations with the parliaments of other states of Europe and Asia and neighboring Iran and Turkey. I believe that Azerbaijan could find political partners in the Far East also. [Correspondent] I would like to hope that this cooperation will not be of an episodic nature but will become a system and a direction of the parliament of Azerbaijan's overseas activity. [Akhundov] We will aspire to constant interaction with all parliaments of the world. Relations based on cooperation, mutual trust, and friendship have stood the test of time and given a good account of themselves and serve only the interests of peace and stability. [Correspondent] Than you for the interview.
