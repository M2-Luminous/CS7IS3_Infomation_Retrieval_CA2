In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Tunis, 'Abd-al-Rahim said that Fatah's Revolutionary Council approved the autonomy agreement signed by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on Wednesday 4 May in Cairo. He added that the Council unanimously decided to return to Gaza and Jericho and to form committees to pass instructions and duties to the cadres to enter the homeland as soon as possible in accordance with a preconceived plan. 'Abd-al-Rahim denied divisions and differences of opinion between members of the Revolutionary Council which, he said, is a framework within which views and ideas interact, issues are discussed, and decisions are made on the basis of agreement and reconciliation. He pointed out that there were two trends in the Council: One led by Faruq Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf), head of the Political Department, who wants the return to be gradual at all levels from the command to the lowest organization level. The other trend, led by President Yasir 'Arafat, believes that the entry of Fatah and PLO cadres into Gaza and Jericho should be done in full strength and weight because the situation is ripe for that and because the process of building the autonomy authority in Gaza and Jericho requires the pooling of all efforts and resources to ensure success of that experiment and, therefore, pave the way for PLO success in future steps aimed at setting up an independent Palestinian state with holy Jerusalem as its capital. Al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, who is also a member of Fatah's Revolutionary Council, confirmed that all the Council's members have expressed support for the decision to return to Gaza and Jericho in accordance with a specific plan and instructions for all cadres, and that 10 special committees have started their task of placing the cadres in their appropriate place within the national authority. These committees represent all the political, economic, security, educational, and other sectors under national authority powers. The Fatah Central Committee member said that all Palestinian qualified patriots would participate in the process of building the Palestinian entity, and that the process would not be confined to qualified people from the factions because "the Palestinian authority belongs to all the Palestinian people and not just one group." 'Abd-al-Rahim said that he might be assigned the duties of the presidency's general secretariat.
