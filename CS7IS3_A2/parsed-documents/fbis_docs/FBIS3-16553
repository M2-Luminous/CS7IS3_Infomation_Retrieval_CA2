He said the supplies are provided for by an agreement between the State Committee and the Russian TVEL corporation signed at the end of last year. Ukraine paid 6.79 Bn rubles for the fuel immediately. According to Stovbun, at the end of last year the capacity of the Chernobyl nuclear power station had to be cut down due to fuel shortages, but at the end of February the State Committee purchased Russian fuel for a quarter of a year. At the beginning of 1994 Ukraine received the first batch of nuclear fuel. At the same time Kiev has drawn attention to the fact that Russia has not signed an agreement on fuel supplies to Ukraine in exchange for the withdrawal of nuclear warheads from its territory which is provided for by the treaty between Russia, Ukraine and the USA. The Ukrainian vice-premier Valeriy Shmarov has told INTERFAX that they only received a letter from Viktor Chernomyrdin in which the Russian side pledged to begin shipments this month. The State Committee believes that as Ukraine has a sufficient number of nuclear installations, it would be more profitable to develop the production of nuclear fuel in the country itself than import it. In this connection the State Committee is preparing for an international tender of technology for the production of nuclear fuel.
