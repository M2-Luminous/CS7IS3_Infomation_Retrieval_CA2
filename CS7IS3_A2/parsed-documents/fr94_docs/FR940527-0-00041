FR940527-0-00041 FR940527-0-00014 Par. 2. Section 1.170A&hyph;13T is added to read as follows: §1.170A&hyph;13T Substantiation requirement for certain contributions. (a) Certain goods or services that have insubstantial value not taken into account. Goods or services that have insubstantial value under the guidelines provided in Revenue Procedures 90&hyph;12, 1990&hyph;1 C.B. 471, and 92&hyph;49, 1992&hyph;1 C.B. 987, (and any successor documents) need not be taken into account for purposes of section 170(f)(8). (See §601.601(d)(2)(ii) of the Statement of Procedural Rules, 26 CFR part 601.) (b) Contributions made by payroll deduction _(1) Form of substantiation. A contribution made by means of withholding from a taxpayer's wages and payment by the taxpayer's employer to a donee organization may be substantiated, for purposes of section 170(f)(8), by_ (i) A pay stub, Form W&hyph;2, or other document furnished by the employer that evidences the amount withheld by the employer for the purpose of payment to a donee organization, and (ii) A pledge card or other document prepared by the donee organization that includes a statement that the organization does not provide goods or services in whole or partial consideration for any contributions made to the organization by payroll deduction. (2) Application of $250 threshold. For the purpose of applying the $250 threshold provided in section 170(f)(8)(A) to contributions made by the means described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the amount withheld from each payment of wages to a taxpayer is treated as a separate contribution. (c) Distributing organizations as donees. An organization described in section 170(c), or an organization described in 5 CFR 950.105 (a Principal Combined Fund Organization for purposes of the Combined Federal Campaign) and acting in that capacity, that receives a payment made as a contribution is treated as a donee organization solely for purposes of section 170(f)(8), even if the organization (pursuant to the donor's instructions or otherwise) distributes the amount received to one or more organizations described in section 170(c). This paragraph (c) does not apply, however, to a case in which the distributee organization provides goods or services as part of a transaction structured with a view to avoid taking the goods or services into account in determining the amount of the deduction to which the donor is entitled under section 170. (d) Effective date. The rules of this section apply to contributions made on or after January 1, 1994. PART 602_OMB CONTROL NUMBERS UNDER THE PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT Par. 3.
