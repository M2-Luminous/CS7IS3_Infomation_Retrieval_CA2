It warns: "If the Japanese authorities continue their acts of deliberately aggravating the situation, taking advantage of the vicious pressure campaign of the United States and the South Korean authorities against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in disregard of the demand of our nation, they will be held responsible for the consequences arising therefrom." "The raid on the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) was a fascist outrage against Koreans overseas and an unpardonable political suppression," the statement says, and goes on: "We cannot but call in question the fact that all the hostile acts persistently committed by the Japanese authorities against Chongnyon are timed to coincide with the anti-DPRK campaign of the United States and the South Korean authorities. "The Koreans residing in Japan are mostly victims who were taken there as `labor draftees' for the Japanese imperialists' war of aggression on the continent and forced to toils, undergoing all manner of national humiliation and harsh maltreatment in the past, and their descendants. "Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities, far from repenting of this and making compensations, are repeating the past crimes today. This naturally arouses the resentment of the whole nation. "The North side headquarters of Pomminnyon can hardly repress indignation at the surprise raid on and search of Chongnyon organisations by the Japanese police and strongly urge the Japanese authorities to immediately stop such criminal suppression and apologize for it and punish those responsible for it."
