In a speech he delivered at the Royal War College, his highness added that peace in the Middle East figures high on the international agenda. He said Jordan has always been a peace advocate, and that Jordan's peace theory is not just theoretical propaganda, but an essential practical reality. In his the lecture, his highness reviewed the challenges facing the Arab nation under changing world circumstances. His highness said the world's interests have become intertwined. Therefore, small states have lost a great degree of their freedom, and their decisions are affected by the international axis more than by regional and domestic axes. He indicated that the continued Arab-Israeli conflict threatens cruel international disputes. [Begin Hasan recording] We want a peace that preserves our historical and religious rights in the holy land and holy Jerusalem. Peace should not be a bargain of material profits at the expense of moral and spiritual sublimeness. Any peace that does not secure our rights cannot be a durable peace. For peace not to be fragile, we want peace for all Arab parties. Peace is indivisible. A just peace is a comprehensive peace on all fronts. We are not raising this as a slogan, but as a message that this is the only possible peace whose hopes and pains we can cope with. For us in Jordan, the requirements of peace are unchangeable. They will require us to face the burdens of peace with internal cohesion, comprehensive security, building a production base, and resolving the shortage in basic supplies, such as water, energy, and food. [end recording] Present to listen to the lecture were Acting Prime Minister Dhuqan al-Hindawi, advisers to his majesty the king, the information minister, his highness the prince's special adviser, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, the chief of staff of the Royal Ground Forces, aides to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and senior Armed Forces officers.
