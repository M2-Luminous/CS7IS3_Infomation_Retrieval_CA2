It was the first time in the territory's history that the council had condemned the chief executive. Legislators voted 21 to 11 in support of the motion sponsored by United Democrat heavyweight Szeto Wah to "reprove" the Governor for "acting against the will of the public." Citing the Royal Instructions, Mr Patten last month rejected a proposal from three major political parties to freeze the rates payment. The Liberal Pany did not vote, even though it supported a freeze in the rates. Legislators from the three parties -- the United Democrats, Meeting Point and the Liberal Party lashed out at the behaviour of the Governor, describing his move as "high-handed", "colonial" and "Draconian." Mr Szeto said Mr Patten's use of a colonial privilege to veto a request with general public support should be denounced. He was to blame for the humiliation the government had suffered with an unprecedentedly low support of the legislature in the budget debate -- only 15 legislators support the government's proposed rates increase. The Liberal Party accused the Government of brushing aside public aspirations and paying no respect to Legco, but said the wording of the motion was too strong. Party chief Allen Lee Peng-fei said it was tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the government. The party chose not to support, oppose, or abstain from voting. It did not want to abstain because that might give the impression the party had given up on the rates issue. Meeting Point's Fred Li Wah-ming lamented the impotence of the Legislative Council [Legco], saying that even if the motion was passed, it would not in any way damage the governor's position because he was appointed by Britain. Opposing the motion, appointed member Martin Barrow, who also spoke on behalf of six independent legislators, said it was dangerous to develop an "unrealistic vision" about the role of Legco and its relations with the executive. He said the rates issue was not significant and said the introduction of measures to spend public money or impose taxes was the "sole privilege" of the administration. "What Hong Kong people look for in a governor is leadership, not just acquiescence to political demands and what they look for in their council is responsible leadership in the best interests of Hong Kong, not a weathervane." Appointed independent legislators Christine Loh Kung-wai and Anna Wu Hung-yuk, who were absent from voting, said the problem was the lack of accountability. "It is wrong to equate balance of power with the weakening of power with the executive. Executive-led government does not mean to control the legislature," said Ms Loh. Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said in reply: "The motion is like 'crying wolf' when no wolf exists. "It should be reserved for serious policy or constitutional issues, or its impact is greatly devalued. Nor will it change the fact that the system simply would not work if it involved the executive rubber-stamping the views of the legislature," he said. The proposed rates increase represented a minute increase in household income, which was hardly a sufficient cause for a "constitutional drama." He called on legislators to respect the power of the Government.
