"Our two countries decided to exert all available efforts to settle the nuclear question through dialogue until the regular Board of Governors' meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) opens (on Feb. 21)," Han said. He made the remarks to reporters at the Watergate Hotel following talks with U.S. Vice President Al Gore and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake at the White House. "It is true there are some hard-line voices in the United States with respect to the nuclear question," said Han. "But, the United States' official policy direction now is to carry on with dialogue." The two countries, Han said, also shared views on the importance of maintaining peace on the Korean peninsula, even though the peninsula is not in a state of crisis now. Discussing recent efforts by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to adopt a statement on North Korea, Minister Han said dialogue was discussed as part of its policy on the North Korean nuclear question. "The five countries can pool their opinions for conveyance to North Korea," he said. Han said that if the nuclear question were referred to the U.N. Security Council, it would choose one of two available options. The first is to begin with a resolution on North Korea, followed by weak sanctions initially and stronger steps later: The second is to impose sanctions from the start after a certain period of time passes. Regarding China's future role, Han said its behavior at the Security Council depends on how far "we have striven to resolve the question peacefully." "Substantial achievements have been made between Seoul and Beijing through direct discussions and cooperation. I believe China will continue to try to settle the question peacefully in what they think is the best manner," the minister said. On the possibility of the United States and North Korea resuming contacts in New York, Han said there are no plans to do so at the moment. He was quick to add, however, that "we think it is better to have an exchange of opinions in whatever form." Minister Han is scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry on Friday afternoon to discuss the nuclear question. The talks will be preceded by an earlier meeting between Han and Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Tom Hubbard and several other senior State Department officials.
