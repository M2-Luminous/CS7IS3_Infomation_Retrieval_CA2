He spent the whole day today in Tashkent, where he held talks with the president of Uzbekistan. [Correspondent Shakhnoza Ganiyeva] Andrey Kozyrev's working visit to Uzbekistan today began with talks at the republican Foreign Ministry. Subsequently he was received by Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov in the second half of the day. The most acute problems of economic, military, political, and humanitarian cooperation between Russia and Uzbekistan and also aspects of Islam Karimov's official visit to Russia, due toward the end of February, were discussed at the meeting. [Begin Kozyrev recording] I think that we will arrive at a correct solution, so that we can help people as much as possible and irrespective of their nationality -- and this also includes the Russian and Russophone population and also other citizens of both republics, both states -- so that they can cross the border with ease and exchange money and dispose of their property as they see fit. These, in actual fact, are the issues people are interested in. Also, so that we can, of course, remove whatever tensions, as it were, that might arise in connection with the language and so on. These issues must be dealt with professionally, dispassionately, without superfluous emotions, even though the problems themselves are extraordinarily emotive. However, they must be tackled in a level-headed manner. I think that at any rate, we have made yet another step toward ensuring that these issues are examined in a correct manner and that they can be generally resolved when the two presidents have their meeting.
