FR941205-1-00037 FR941205-1-00014 The 1984 Act sets forth an extensive list of prohibited acts, barring many anticompetitive practices that previously had been outlawed under the broad ``public interest'' standard of section 15 of the 1916 Act. For example, section 10(b)(6) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1709(b)(6), carries forward section 15's prohibition of agreements that are unfair or unjustly discriminatory between shippers or ports. Sections 10(c)(1)&hyph;(3) and (5) of the 1984 Act, id. app. 1709(c)(1)&hyph;(3) and (5), prohibit boycotts, restrictions on technological innovations, predatory practices and the denial of reasonable freight forwarder compensation, all of which the Commission previously had found violated section 15. 3 3 See S. Rep. No. 3, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 35&hyph;37 (1984). If the Commission has indications that an agreement may be operating in violation of the 1984 Act, it may institute an investigation of the agreement and its member lines. In addition, the Commission may ask any U.S. district court to temporarily enjoin the agreement while the investigation proceeds. 4 If the court should find that continued operation of the agreement would be inequitable, it can issue an order barring further effectiveness of the agreement until ten days after issuance of the Commission's final decision. If the Commission should find in its final decision that violations of the 1984 Act in fact occurred, it may ``disapprove, cancel or modify'' the agreement, 5 which would in effect supersede the existing court injunction. In addition, the Commission may assess fines against the agreement member lines. 6 4 Section 11(h)(1) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1710(h)(1). 5 Section 11(c) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. 1710(c). 6 Section 13(a) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. 1712(a). The other procedure provided by the 1984 Act by which the Commission can prevent an agreement from going into effect, or prevent further operation of an existing agreement, is set forth in section 6(g). This provision authorizes the Commission to seek an injunction in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against an agreement that is ``likely, by a reduction in competition, to produce an unreasonable reduction in transportation service or an unreasonable increase in transportation cost.'' 46 U.S.C. app. 1705(g). A proceeding under section 6(g) does not involve questions of discrimination or unfairness, which are covered by the section 10 prohibited acts, nor does it involve questions of statutory violations or fines against the carriers. Section 6(g) was meant to provide a way of dealing with ``unusual or severe cases not addressed by other prohibitions in the Act,'' 7 and the only remedy available under the provision is an injunction against the agreement itself. 7 H.R. Rep. No. 600, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 37 (1984). B. The Commission's Agreement Program The Commission's procedures for evaluating and monitoring carrier agreements reflect the new responsibilities and limitations imposed by the 1984 Act. When an agreement is first filed, its provisions are immediately reviewed to ensure that they contain the 1984 Act's mandatory provisions and do not run afoul of the prohibited acts sections. In the ordinary case, that is a one-time process and does not entail ongoing periodic review.
