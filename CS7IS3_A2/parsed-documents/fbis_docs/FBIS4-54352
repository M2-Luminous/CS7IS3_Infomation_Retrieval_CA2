The sale of the 1994-crop rice is intended to increase Japan's rice supplies and reduce market prices in order to facilitate auctions of Japanese-produced rice for free marketing outside government channels, agency officials said. The auctions are to be resumed in July. For the same purpose, the agency will also sell a total of 100,000 tons of Japanese-produced rice from its emergency rice stockpile in July and August, the officials said. The agency earlier announced a plan to supply 150,000 tons of Japanese-produced rice in each of the two months, and the total supply of such rice in the period is now expected to amount to 400,000 tons. The domestic rice market is heating up following the 1993 rice crop failure that forced Japan to resort to emergency imports. The government controls production and marketing of most Japanese-produced rice, but 40 percent is marketed freely outside government channels. Medium-grain Australian rice is similar to Japanese rice and is likely to be popular among Japanese consumers, the officials said.
