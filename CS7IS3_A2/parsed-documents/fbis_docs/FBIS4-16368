Four days ago he arrived there as a member of a Russian parliamentary delegation for a Council of Europe session. His statement that Russia should retaliate for NATO air strikes on Serb positions in Bosnia by attacking NATO bases in Italy provoked a negative reaction from the French Foreign Ministry. Apart from that, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy caused outrage by getting involved in an incident with demonstrators protesting against his visit to France. As a result, the furious leader of Russia's Liberal Democrats vowed never to set foot on French soil again.
