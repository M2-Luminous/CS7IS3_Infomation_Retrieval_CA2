Lippold; place and date not given: "The Gap Between the Mandate and the Funds Is Widening More and More"] [Text] [Lippold] You have taken over your new function as army inspector at a time when the Bundeswehr is in a critical political and financial situation. How do you assess the situation? [Bagger] Regarding the changed and increased spectrum of tasks, I, as the inspector, want a broad political and social consensus. In the past, it was also founded on basic military questions in our country. It is a great psychical strain for the affected soldiers and their families to identify themselves -- for example, in Somalia -- with a mission and to take personal risks, while uncompromising debates on the constitutionality of this mission are held in public. The Bundeswehr took over these new tasks and, at the same time, the available financial means were repeatedly cut. The gap between the mandate and the funds is widening more and more. [Lippold] What can this lead to? [Bagger] Effects can already be felt today in the training. However, the long-term consequences will be more serious because investment funds to modernize the army to the necessary extent are lacking. I am concerned about that. [Lippold] What are the most important tasks and objectives of the new army structure? [Bagger] The army must be able to fulfill tasks in the complete sphere of future operations, which range from the defense of Germany and its alliance partners to participation in humanitarian measures and peace missions. These objectives were implemented on the basis of resources in army Reform 5. The capability to defend our country continues to be our supreme objective. However, the security policy situation permits main defense forces, which need not be completely operational, to be used for this purpose in times of peace. [Lippold] Who remains in a state of combat readiness? [Bagger] About one-third of our forces are to be operational and in a permanent state of combat readiness. After the establishment of the constitutional prerequisites, they can be employed for crisis management within the framework of NATO and the Western European Union. Main defense forces and crisis-reaction forces continue to be part of an "overall system." When called to action, the army divisions should be mainly assigned to the multinational corps, since security can only be achieved through an alliance, as shown by our past. Thus, integration within multinational structures is also a characteristic of army Reform 5. [Lippold] How can we prevent the development of a two-class army, that is to say the existence of privileged crisis-reaction forces and inferior troops for the defense of the country? [Bagger] The term "two-class army" does not live up to my idea of the future democratic structure of the army. It implies a qualitative graduation. It is a fact that, in the future, we will have crisis-reaction forces and main defense forces that have to fulfill different tasks. Crisis-reaction forces must be made available, put in a state of combat readiness at short notice, and be highly mobile and flexible. Depending on mobilization, part of the main defense forces can be employed after an appropriate preparation period. The security policy situation permits this. [Lippold] The defense budget, too? [Bagger] In view of tight budgetary constraints, we will have to set priorities. These are now the crisis-reaction forces because there is a greater demand for a follow-up on their equipment and, according to the present assessment, the probability of their employment is comparably high. We are forced to make cuts in the main defense forces. [Lippold] That is to say, there will be bipartition after all? [Bagger] The unity of the army must not be lost. A qualitative differential between individual units that impairs their functioning would jeopardize the functioning of the army. As the person who is militarily responsible for the operational readiness of the army, I insist on maintaining the compatibility of crisis-reaction forces and main defense forces regarding the regular exchange of personnel and appropriate equipment. It is nothing new in the German army that we use weapons systems that vary in their modernness. [Lippold] What tasks from the "German Unity" program does the army have to perform in the new laender? [Bagger] The takeover of soldiers of the former National People's Army into long-term service as military servicemen or professional soldiers has been concluded. We are now trying to provide the soldiers who have been taken over with the necessary training that corresponds to their employment. The exchange between west and east will further advance the process of growing together. This growing together of people has to be promoted further and followed up in case of need where required. [Lippold] What about the environment? [Bagger] A uniform standard is also to be provided for the external framework, the barracks, and soldiers' apartments. Priority was given to this intention in the plan on the infrastructure. However, as a result of the repeated budget cuts, the financial means to carry out the necessary construction measures in time are lacking. [Lippold] Your church grammar-school teachers reportedly criticized your decision to become a soldier as "some kind of recalcitrance on the part of a teenage lout." Do you think that the soldier's profession and military service as a whole has to be explained anew and socially upgraded? [Bagger] The preservation of external security continues to be a basic function of the state, independent of analyses of any threats. For this task, every draftee continues to be indispensable and will remain so in the future as well. We certainly have to make people increasingly aware of the fact that the defense of the country and the alliance has to be carried out in the alliance area and not exclusively on German soil. In this way, following the security policy change in Europe, we are arriving at a situation in which the soldiers and also draftees of our allies have been for a period of 30 years. Again and again, military service has to be explained and justified to those who are to assume this civic duty. The young citizen should also do his duty in the increased spectrum of tasks because he understands that this is necessary. [Lippold] Who can bring this home to him? [Bagger] This is a political and social task. There is a pent-up demand in Germany. The Bundeswehr and the army are prepared to do their share. However, we also ask for the support of the parties and the public. Such an information and learning process is necessary. All of us must understand what it means to be a sovereign state and to be challenged -- in the positive sense -- as a sovereign state in Europe and the world.
