Why? [Manolic] We can no longer work in a party that approves of the policy conducted by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. We have been following this president's deficiencies with great concern for a year now. What was crucial to our decision is the disagreement over policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is once again making sad headlines, but we have also been concerned about the development of democracy in our country. [Rathfelder] What mistakes has Tudjman made in Bosnia? [Manolic] We were both in favor of a single Bosnia-Herzegovina within its acknowledged borders. The three nations were to have equal rights there. But even before the war started, Tudjman agreed with Serb President Milosevic to split up Bosnia-Herzegovina between Serbia and Croatia. Neither Milosevic nor Tudjman had, however, expected the Muslims to resist this plan so vigorously. When the plans for division failed, the Croatian president, in agreement with the lobby of Croatian Western Herzegovina, decided more than a year ago to start a war against the Muslims. This was a destructive act for Croatian politics. [Mesic] The war in Bosnia is a truly absurd situation that is unprecedented in history. Croatia fought its only ally, the Bosnian Muslims, although we are still inferior to our main adversary. Thank goodness the Washington Agreement, which we warmly welcome, has changed the parameters of policy. What particularly pleases me is that reconciliation is going comparatively smoothly. This shows that the hatred between the two nations was artificially created. There should never have been a war between the two. [Rathfelder] How can you explain Tudjman's sudden change of opinion? [Mesic] We do not know whether Tudjman has changed his personal view. The fact is that after the Washington Agreement all those who were in power before in Herceg-Bosna are still there; this means all those who wanted to divide Bosnia, who promoted the war, and who are only interested in establishing the state of Herceg-Bosna in spite of the agreed federation. [Manolic] This touches on the second reason we want to disassociate ourselves from Tudjman. We want Croatia to become a constitutional state where human rights and democratic freedom are observed. Undemocratic practices have also been noticeable in the government party HDZ. We wanted to democratize it. [Rathfelder] Does forming a new party mean that you have given up hope that the HDZ can be reformed? [Manolic] Not only that. A new party will strengthen the democratic opposition in Croatia. A strong opposition could make various institutions more democratic. This is the first step. The second step would be to prevent the president from conducting his dishonest policy. [Rathfelder] Will you manage to pull enough HDZ parliamentarians over to your side to make their absolute majority in parliament totter? [Manolic] There have, of course, been intense discussions. This is why Tudjman is getting nervous; they are trying to pressure us. All government party deputies have been urged to declare their loyalty to Tudjman. Our telephones are being monitored, and police measures are reminiscent of those taken against dissidents during the communist era. When we formed the HDZ, we wanted to break the one-party rule of the old regime. In this respect, there were no differences between myself and Tudjman. Like Tudjman, I was a communist; we wanted to continue the tradition of the Croatian Spring of 1971 and create a democratic Croatia. But Tudjman has kept the old leadership principles, he makes all decisions autocratically. [Rathfelder] Tudjman still has plenty of support. And he is backed by the powerful clan of the Herzegovinians. [Mesic] These politicians from western Herzegovina are not powerful. The majority of Croatians and the entire church have spoken out against the policy of dividing Bosnia. Certain people are responsible for establishing concentration camps. There was hope of finding a reason to accuse the Bosnian Army of driving Croats out by withdrawing Croat forces from several areas in central Bosnia. They have destroyed a large part of Mostar. And this dishonest policy was supported by Zagreb. [Rathfelder] This is a harsh attack on Tudjman! Does this mean he has to resign? [Mesic] He must, indeed, draw the conclusions. [Rathfelder] Why did you not act a year ago? You might have been able to prevent the catastrophe then. [Manolic] If we had been more firm at that time, we would have been eliminated. Croatian paramilitary forces were established in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Their crimes were supported by Defense Minister Gojko Susak. And these people would not even have survived for a month, if Tudjman had not supported this course. [Rathfelder] Is the public in Croatia aware of the Croatian crimes? [Mesic] I do not think so. There is a media blockade; Croatian television has played the worst role in this war. But the war criminals will be persecuted. They must be convicted by the courts. We know who killed Muslims in Stupni Do, Ahmici, and Prozor. Some murderers have changed their names, others are living here in Zagreb, in the Intercontinental Hotel, protected by Minister Susak (Bosnian-Croat leader Mate Boban, E.R.). [Rathfelder] Is all this digging Tudjman's political grave? [Mesic] This policy was exclusively his choice. But you cannot ignore international responsibility in this context. The international community has had its share in the war in Bosnia. Feeding the victims before they are killed is simply not enough. Lord Owen promoted a division of Bosnia rather than safeguarding the unity of the state. Serbia was encouraged to continue its aggression, and Croatia was tempted with the prospect of gaining 27 percent of the Bosnian territory. But the resistance of the Bosnian Muslims has confused the international scene.
