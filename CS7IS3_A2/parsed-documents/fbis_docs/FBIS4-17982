In particular, the law "On Export and Import Tax" was abolished; from 1 May 1994 to 1 January 1996 (until the expiration of Russia's customs tariff on exports), a temporary customs tariff is being introduced. Changes were also introduced to legislative acts concerning taxation. In the first place, they concern tax policy toward facilities used by Russian strategic troops deployed on Belarusian soil.
