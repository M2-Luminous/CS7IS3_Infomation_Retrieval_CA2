This is what we tell the gang of apostasy and secession. This is because the announcement of secession made by the traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid is evidence that his hour and that of his gang has come and that God's command will be implemented at the hands of his honest slaves of the sons of Yemen in the battles of honor and sacrifice and on the axes of combat. When the time comes for the implementation of God's command, this cannot be delayed or prevented. This is especially true since God does not reward the actions of the corrupt and He is always watchful of the traitors. 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his traitorous collaborators have asked for it. They have dug their own graves. They have preferred blindness to guidance and violated their commitment and pledge to God, so He led them astray, blinded them, and promised them severe punishment. They have thought their weapons would save them from God and the people. But God surprised them and threw panic into their hearts and made the unionists stand firm. Thus, all the people are now fighting the battle against al-Bid and his gang. The gang is now closer to falling in the abyss and very near its end. Have they not heard the marching of the forces of legitimacy and unity when these forces continued to capture locations, hardware, and various weapons? Have they not learned that the forces which they had controlled are daily joining the forces of legitimacy in all positions? Have they not heard that the nationalist parties and popular bodies and organizations have all condemned their grave traitorous act? Have they not heard the unionists within the Yemeni Socialist Party condemn this malicious secessionist crime and disown this malevolent traitorous action? Have they not seen the world ridicule their traitorous action? Indeed, they have heard and seen all of this. We shall leave them in their trespasses, to wander in distraction. [Koranic verse] They are embarking on an adventure and are shooting their arrows right and left. Therefore, what they have done so far, and what they will do, are no more than random acts committed in the dark. [passage omitted]
