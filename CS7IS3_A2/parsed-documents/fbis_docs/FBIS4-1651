These crimes -- especially the forgery of invoices for value- added tax -- are greatly disturbing the country's new tax reform that began this year, State Council Secretary-General Luo Gan said on Wednesday. Co-organized the campaign are also the Public Security Ministry, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate. [sentence as published] The reform centers on a consumer tax system with the value-added tax at its core. Invoices are critical documents for the calculation of the tax, and any forgery is detrimental to the tax reform package. Speaking at a national telephone conference announcing the start of the drive, Luo called on the country's police, taxation and judicial workers to take severe measures to stop criminal activities concerning invoices. Currently, businesses in many large- and medium-sized cities take advantage of the forged and stolen invoices to evade or cheat on taxes. Luo called on the Public Security Ministry, the State Taxation Administration, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate to form a special coordination office to guide the campaign, which will continue through June. The move will focus on big cities and areas where the crimes are most prevalent. Other areas and regional governments should also put the fight on their agenda for their daily work, Luo said. Targeting forgery and theft gangs, the drive aims to net underground printshops that produce large batches of bogus invoices, as well as those who sell the fraudulent documents. People who use the fake invoices to evade taxes or cheat on their tax returns should also be sought out and dealt with harshly. Luo added. By the end of June, the campaign must meet its goals to ensure the smooth implementation of China's new tax measures. Local protectionism and professional corruption must be cleared away to carry out this battle. In addition, it is imperative to educate and encourage people to check for and reject fake invoices, he added.
