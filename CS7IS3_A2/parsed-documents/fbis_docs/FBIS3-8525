Since last week, Muslims and Croats have been together in Vienna to unite their two so-far hostile ethnic groups in one state. For this purpose, many issues must be clarified--the constitution, the division of the territory into cantons, and, not least, the problem of the overall territory. And here, the circle closes with the so-far unsuccessful negotiations of all three ethnic groups--Muslims, Croats, and Serbs. The Serbs are currently occupying about 70 percent of the Bosnian territory. A state of Muslims and Croats with only 30 percent of the territory seems to be impossible. Thus, the Serbs would have to give up territory that they have conquered. However, they are not part of the negotiations in Vienna. This defect is also seen by Bosnian Prime Minister Silajdzic. Since the Serbs are not willing to participate in the negotiations in Vienna, one now has to discuss the possibility of a Muslim-Croat state. [Silajdzic] They will be invited to join this common effort of the Bosniaks and the Croats. For the time being, their statements show that they are not willing to do that. In that case, we can talk about a possibility of creating a political entity with a status, of course, within the international body of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Schwarz] However, even if a Muslim-Croat state in Bosnia-Herzegovina is established without the Serbs, this will be a weak state. Therefore, a loose union with Croatia is envisaged. There are even voices from Zagreb that want to make this one of the basic preconditions for the negotiations in Vienna. Prime Minister Silajdzic does not think anything of that. The new state will be a strong state, he says, and both Croatia and the new Muslim-Croat federation will be separate, sovereign, and independent states. [Silajdzic] Well, of course, it will be even a stronger country. The two countries will retain their identity, their independence, their sovereignty. [Schwarz] With consideration for the negotiations that are still underway, the Bosnian head of government was not able to say anything more specific about the planned Muslim-Croat state. However, there are continued efforts to include the Serbs in the planned solution in some way. Therefore, Silajdzic visited Serbia's protector, Russia, in Moscow yesterday. And he believes that Moscow will still play a positive role in the negotiations. [Silajdzic] Yesterday, I came from Moscow, and Mr. Kozyrev assured me that Russia will do its best to play a constructive role in seeking the final negotiating settlement. [Schwarz] One thing is clear in any case. The negotiations are now entering their decisive stage. This is also indicated by the fact that, this afternoon, Croatian Foreign Minister Granic will also come to the negotiations in Vienna. Nevertheless, Muslim Prime Minister Silajdzic does not expect a speedy conclusion. One is not in such a hurry, it will still take some time until peace will reign in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said.
