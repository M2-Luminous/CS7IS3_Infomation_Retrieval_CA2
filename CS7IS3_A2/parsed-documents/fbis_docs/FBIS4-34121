The entry took place early in the morning after a truck crashed through the gate of the embassy's garage. This is the second violation of embassy territory in the past 15 days. Only two weeks ago, another aggressive group broke into the residence of the Belgian ambassador, and although seven of the occupants have left the installation on their own, the rest have so far refused to heed requests by the Brussels and Havana Governments. Shortly after today's incident, the German ambassador asked the instigators of this unexpected action to leave the embassy, but the occupants ignored the will of the diplomat. The German position in demanding that the occupants leave the embassy immediately agrees with Cuba's official position of rejecting this type of action as a means to travel outside the country in open disregard for normal procedures now in effect. One important element to be highlighted in this case, according to the Cuban Foreign Ministry, is that it has taken place precisely on the day that Mexican President Carlos Salinas arrived in the country and on the eve of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of heads of state and government. Some diplomatic sources believe that the main objective behind these actions is to divert attention from the increasingly stronger ties now developing between the Caribbean nation and many countries and international organizations. The same sources believe that another objective is to neutralize the international movement -- a movement flourishing even within the United States -- that opposes Washington's economic and trade blockade and supports the normalization of relations with the island. Cuba has reiterated that there will be no reprisals against those who voluntarily leave the occupied embassy, just as in the case of those who have left the Belgian ambassador's residence.
