At a news conference in Johannesburg on Wednesday, ANC officials admitted some SDUs had been infiltrated by undisciplined elements, out to kill unit commanders and harass communities. ANC PWV [Pretoria - Witwatersrand - Vereeniging] General Secretary Oped Bapela said because the SDUs had been set up by communities, they had not previously been accountable to the ANC. But the time had come for the ANC to protect the community by becoming directly involved in the units. The ANC PWV regional office had stepped in as soon as it had been alerted to continuous gunfire between SDU members of Mavimbela and Ncala sections in Katlehong on the East Rand at the weekend. There had been no similar occurences since Sunday, Mr Bapela said. He said the four deaths of SDU members and Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing -- MK] commanders last week had been caused by malicious rumour-mongering and character assassination of local leaders. Some SDU members had acted emotionally without establishing facts. Guidelines for SDU restructuring had been drawn up at an urgent 10-hour meeting of the ANC, SA [South African] National Civics Organisation, SA Communist Party, SDU commanders and other involved parties on Tuesday. It had been agreed people joining SDUs would be screened carefully and those not living in the township should not be allowed to become involved. For the first time, SDUs would have to be accountable to the ANC, which would control their activities through a newly-established monitoring committee. All fighting parties agreed to a formal ceasefire and that the highly-charged Mavimbela SDU would be disbanded temporarily during investigations and restructuring, Mr Bapela said. He assured the media the investigation into the deaths would be honest and no incriminating facts would be swept under the carpet. He did not rule out the possibility of handing suspects over to the [words indistinct] Internal Stability Unit was withdrawn from townships.
