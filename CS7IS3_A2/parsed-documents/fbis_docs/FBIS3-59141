For, in America things are really better at the moment, as Goethe once wrote. The recession that will make itself really at home in Germany this year, has already bidden farewell to the United States. The country is at an enviable (and very rare) point in the economic cycle, where everything is right. The economy is growing, inflation is going down, interest rates are at a 20-year low, the dollar is on its way up, the deficit is declining, and jobs are mushrooming. In Germany, once called "model Germany," almost all the indicators are pointing in the opposite direction. Here, unemployment is growing, together with debts and the budget deficit; inflation is only beginning to fall below the 4-percent mark; interest rates seem to be too high to boost the economy -- and too low to maintain the external value of the German mark: Since April 1993, the mark has gone down 20 pfenning against the dollar. And this is why Helmut Kohl might remember Walter Rathenau's words when he meets Bill Clinton: "Not the world, but the economy is our fate." With these words, the foreign minister, who was murdered by the Nazis, anticipated several cubic meters of political literature: A purse that is doing all right is a nice pillow to rest on for those in power. But if the man in the street gets the feeling that his material existence is suffering in line with the economy, the ballot paper turns into a letter of dismissal. Whether chancellor or president, with the economy going down, they may have to go. George Bush had to experience this. In March 1991 he was still the glorious winner of the Gulf War (with an approval rate of 91 percent), and in November 1992 he was the loser in a domestic war called "presidential elections." "Not the world, but the economy," was, therefore, the unwritten motto of this year's State of the Union Address, which the president gives on Congress' return from winter recess. Of the total 11 pages, only one and one-half were on foreign and security policy; the rest concerned domestic and economic policy. The speaking notes were full of success figures: 1.6 million new jobs in the private sector alone during Clinton's first year in office; the tackling of the seemingly eternal budget deficit, that -- according to Clinton -- will be only 180, instead of 300 billion next year; the cutback on bureaucracy; the removal of trade barriers in North America; the plans for a general health insurance. Today, the "state of the nation" looks as if Clinton might come out with flying colors in the 1996 election year -- at the height of an economic upswing, the most secure basis for reelection that the Democrats know. But there is another reason why things are better in America, and this has something to do with the electoral system. In practice, this system creates more frequently clear-cut majorities than the German one. In a majority voting system you tend to have two parties, one in power, the other in opposition. Proportional representation, on the other hand, creates many parties, and thus the need to form coalitions. This obviously does not bring about any clear mandates for change, but compromise cabinets maintaining the status quo. In good times, the Germans, the Europeans, were quite well advised with this system. But when there are fires burning everywhere, coalition governments are not an effective fire brigade. Clinton is fortunate enough to have his Democratic Party controlling both houses of Congress. He managed to get many things underway during his first year: "Weariness of politics," is a term unknown to the Americans -- even if it did seem at one point that they might fall into the trap of a demagogic outsider like Ross Perot. Beside, Clinton has managed to embody the state of his union as perfectly as Kohl did in the eighties. Leaning toward the "left," he offers voters a national health insurance and laws to control firearms -- both long overdue. Speaking to the "right," in his State of the Union Address he promised an additional 100,000 police officers, stricter laws against relapse offenders, more liberal choice of schools, and a welfare reform that would speed up people's return to the labor market. More state here, less there; more welfare here, more freedom there -- Clinton seems to have come up with a mixture that smells strongly of achieving a majority. And that is why the chancellor might very well have an attack of nostalgia during his visit to Washington -- all the more so, as almost two-thirds of Americans think that Clinton will be a "better president" during his second year in office. But one enemy stays with him, Clinton himself -- with his affairs and lapses. More than half of the voters say: "Every time I am beginning to feel good about the President, something happens that speaks against him."
