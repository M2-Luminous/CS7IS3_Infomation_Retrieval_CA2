The total amount of the middle and primary school teachers' wages in arrears across the country dropped to 309 million yuan at the end of 1993 from 1.43 billion yuan in September 1993. The State Education Commission has called on all localities to pay more attention to solving the problem and pay all the arrears before the Spring Festival. According to reports from various localities, teachers' wages have never been in arrears in Beijing Municipality and Tibet Region; 17 provinces municipalities, and autonomous regions -- Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong, Gansu, Yunnan, Jilin, Sichuan, Qinghai, Hainan, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Guizhou, Shandong, and Ningxia -- have paid or basically paid the teachers' wages in arrears; and arrears of teachers' wages still exist to a varying degree in 10 provinces. The arrears exceed 10 million yuan in Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Hunan, Shaanxi, and Fujian. Henan Province owes the most -- 120 million yuan. The spokesman said: The party Central Committee and the State Council are deeply concerned about the middle and primary school teachers' wages in arrears and attach great importance to the problem. At the national rural work conference held in October last year, Premier Li Peng pointed out that it is impermissible to owe arrears of teachers' wages, and he called on all localities to take effective measures to solve the problem. Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, has successively written the governors or party committee secretaries of Hebei, Heilongjiang, Guangxi, Hubei, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu, and Sichuan to speed up the solution to the problem. The party committees and people's governments of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have made great efforts to pay the arrears of teachers' wages, despite financial difficulties. The principal party and government leaders of many provinces are personally taking a hand in the matter. They have instructed that wherever the teachers' wages are in arrears, the wages of government office cadres should also be withheld; and that if the arrears of teachers' wages are caused by diversion of budget fund to building unauthorized projects or buying automobiles, such diversion must be resolutely stopped. Henan Province owes more than 100 million yuan in arrears of teachers' wages. In addition to adopting other measures, the provincial government appropriated a special funding of 43 million yuan in late December last year. Moreover, the eighth session of the fifth provincial party committee has made some arrangements and demanded that all necessary measures be taken to open up sources of funds so as to pay all the teachers' wages in arrears.
