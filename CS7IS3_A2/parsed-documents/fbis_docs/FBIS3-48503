The Chinese administration on auto imports says that 1,346 Korean automobiles were sold through official channels for 14.1 million U.S. dollars in January-September last year, according to industry sources Monday. In the nine months, the Chinese bought 58,660 Japanese vehicles, the highest figure, followed by Russian vehicles at 39,651, German at 33,774, French at 20,589 and American at 6,184. Italy placed low with 1,224 vehicles. The Korean share of the Chinese import market was 2.3 percent of the Japanese share and 21.8 percent of the U.S. share. The real number of Korean vehicles sold in China last year is assumed to be nearly 50,000 (new and used), the sources said. The Chinese Government bans imports of completely assembled automobiles in principle but legally purchases nearly 200,000 a year with a 180 percent to 220 percent tax by barter or for official use. It is estimated that 500,000 to 600,000 foreign automobiles are imported by China through legal and illegal channels each year. The Chinese Government partly allowed private dealers to import vehicles in January, lowered the tax to 80 percent minimum and gave a quotas by country. Since it has decided to exclude from the quotas nations continuing to export to the Chinese market through illegal channels, Korean automakers must find new ways to sell in China, a source said.
