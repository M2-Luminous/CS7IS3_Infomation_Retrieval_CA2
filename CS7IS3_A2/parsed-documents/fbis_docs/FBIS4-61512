He said that an expedition would go to the Ussuri District this month to prove Russia's sovereignty over ten square kilometres of hunting grounds, now claimed by China. The ambassador said that an early demarcation of the border would meet the interests of both sides, while the ratification of agreements on the revised borderline would "rule out the possibility of mutual territorial claims in the future". The members of the demarcation commission especially stressed that the interests of the local population should by no means be jeopardised during the demarcation. According to Kireyev, the possibility of jointly using of some of the disputed areas was now being discussed. Moreover, both China and Russia are ready to make mutual concessions concerning small border strips. For instance, China is ready to transfer to Russian jurisdiction a part of the territory in Khasan district. Soviet borderguards, killed during the conflict near Lake Khasan, are buried there. On the whole, it is planned to end the demarcation work on the Russo-Chinese border in 1997.
