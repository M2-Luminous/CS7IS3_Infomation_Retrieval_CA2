[passage omitted] Touching on problems of the Black Sea Fleet, Leonid Kravchuk noted that there are two tasks which must be tackled first: To resolve the problem of the deployment of both fleets at various bases and to clearly define the status of the Russian fleet which is based on Ukrainian territory. The problem of the Black Sea Fleet should, in the president's view, meet Ukraine's national interests and should guarantee Russia's security on its foreign borders. However, the president considers that in the future the Russian fleet should be based exclusively at bases on Russian territory. At the end, Leonid Kravchuk stressed that the regulation of the "Crimean problem" is of vital importance for Ukraine, Crimea, Europe and the world. Leonid Kravchuk answered questions from journalists.
