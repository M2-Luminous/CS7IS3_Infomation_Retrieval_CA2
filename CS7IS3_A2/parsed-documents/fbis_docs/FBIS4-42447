He first received the National Unity Party delegation headed by leader Dervis Eroglu and then the Communal Liberation Party delegation headed by its leader Mustafa Akinci. Denktas later received the Free Democratic Party delegation headed by Ismet Kotak, the Nationalist Justice Party delegation headed by Zorlu Tore and the Unity and Sovereignty Party delegation headed by Arif Salih Kirda. In a statement after the meeting, Eroglu said that the president briefed them on the recent developments. Pointing out that it is a mistake to accept the confidence-building measures [CBM's] package, Eroglu noted that his party has opposed the CBM's from the very beginning, adding that the Cyprus problem should be solved in its entirety. Claiming that the CBM package has been eliminated, Eroglu said that solutions directed toward the essence of the problem should be sought. Noting that the UN secretary general should try and bring the two sides together instead of putting forward proposals, Eroglu said that if a solution is sought to the Cyprus problem based on where it was in 1992 then the NUP will oppose it. Pointing out that the talks should be based on the existence of two states, Eroglu referred to the UN secretary general's report saying that it should seek a solution taking into consideration the views of the people living in Cyprus and not those of the secretary general himself. Noting that the Turkish Cypriot political parties should clearly express their wishes, Eroglu added that everything should be discussed from the very beginning. Akinci drew attention to the fact that the meeting with the president was held soon after the UN secretary general's report was announced adding that such contacts should be held before everything is concluded. Akinci said that they got the impression that the report accused the Turkish Cypriot side and added that currently the rights of the Turkish Cypriot side are being abused. He added that this report shows that the Turkish Cypriot side has not been successful in explaining its just cause in the international field. Pointing out that the thing to be done now is to achieve a communal conciliation, Akinci added that only then can one meet on an international platform to plan the future. Akinci concluded by saying that one cannot defend a just cause through an intransigent attitude and that everything is not over yet.
