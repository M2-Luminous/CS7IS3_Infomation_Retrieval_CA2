Instead, Guangdong viewers who normally receive Hong Kong TV, saw a concert by the pop star Sally Yeh. ATV Home viewers said an episode of the Justice Pao series was shown and then the graphics for the ATV documentary series News Magazine came up. The screen then went black and the concert started. The documentary, mainly re-edited from old film taken by ATV in Beijing five years ago, provoked a row in Hong Kong last week when six of the station's senior staff quit after learning that management was refusing to show it. The programme's host, assistant news controller Selina Li Yuk-lin, was one of those who resigned. She closed the show by saying: "Thanks for watching and thanks for your support."
