Last Sunday [29 May], local citizens snapped up 6.5 billion yuan ($747 million) in two-year notes, according to the municipal office orchestrating the bond issue. The office said local securities firms playing a major role in underwriting the treasury notes, have taken up 2.8 billion yuan ($322 million) in bonds, more than 10 per cent of all the two-year notes being sold by the central government this year. The figure is 65 per cent more than the total bought by local investors last year. Shanghai Finance Securities Co took the lead by underwriting 700 million yuan ($80 million) worth. Sales figures for the three-year bonds, underwritten by banks, were still being calculated, but the Shanghai branch of the central bank said things were going smoothly. The warm response to the issue, which is scheduled to end at the end of this month, put officials in the municipal office at ease. They said it is possible that, for the first time in recent years, demand may outstrip supply. In the last two or three years, local authorities have had to resort to administrative measures to issue treasury bonds, which lost public favour because of inflationary pressure and the appeal of the city's fast-growing stock market. However, with the stock market losing ground for more than a year, officials said, investors are redirecting their attention to the safer investment of bonds. The favourable interest rates and flexible terms are the major attractions of this year's treasury bonds. The annual interest rate of the two-year bonds is 13 per cent, 1.3 points higher than bank deposits of the same duration. The interest rate for the three-year bonds, offered as certificates of ownership, will be 13.9 per cent, surpassing banks' three-year fixed deposits by 1.7 points. Though the three-year bonds will not enter the market like the two-year bonds, purchasers will be able to cash their certificates in advance and still obtain higher interest than a bank deposit if they hold onto the bonds for more than six months. To lure more buyers, the Finance Ministry has encouraged people to cash in their 1991 three-year treasury bonds, due on July 1, and their five-year 1989 special treasury bonds early to buy the new bonds. These buyers will be offered an additional percentage point for their old bonds.
