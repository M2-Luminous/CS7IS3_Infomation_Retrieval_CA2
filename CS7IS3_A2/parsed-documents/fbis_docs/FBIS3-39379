The PDS has convened jurists and magistrates precisely on the day when the issue of "opportune justice" is disrupting the electoral campaign. Last Saturday [12 February] [League Secretary] Bossi stated very clearly that "it looks as if the magistrature is following politics like a shadow. Action is immediately followed by reaction." For his part [Center Union leader] Alfredo Biondi said: "This is clockwork justice: As soon as [Forza Italia leader] Silvio [Berlusconi] stands as a candidate, Paolo [Berlusconi] is arrested." [Italian Socialist Party, PSI, rebel member] Ugo Intini's remark: "This will be the first election to be decided by handcuffs," while on a Fininvest TV program, Enrico Mentana said: "The judges should keep silent during the 15 days leading to the elections." Berlusconi's arrest, the attack on D'Alema -- is there really someone issuing notices and warrants of arrest with stopwatch precision? Milan chief public prosecutor Borrelli denies this categorically: "We are only responding to events, we cannot change our pace at will." Justice Minister Giovanni Conso, however, putting in an appearance at the PDS convention, uttered carefully worded sentences, thus giving rise to doubt: "We must assume, unless otherwise demonstrated, that the timing depends on the development of the investigations." Unless otherwise demonstrated? Why, is Conso in any doubt? No, he said he was in no doubt, but he emphasized that it would make no sense for the magistrature to keep quiet for a few days, "it would be a serious mistake to regard the electoral campaign as a time when the state's fundamental activities are interrupted." Nevertheless, the minister added, "at sensitive moments the risk of interference between political and judicial activities increases, and we must therefore appeal for compliance with the rules, and appeal to the honesty of the people."
