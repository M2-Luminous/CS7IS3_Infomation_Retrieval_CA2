Reacting to a riot police raid on the engineers' sit-in protests earlier in the morning, Chonkihyop, a private "unregistered" union of locomotive engineers, declared a general strike immediately after the raid, four days earlier than originally scheduled. During the raid, the police, mobilizing over 6,000 riot troopers, took away 613 engineers staging sit-in demonstrations at 14 sites in nine cities for later detention. The strike reduced railroad transportation, both passengers and cargo, to 11.2 percent of the normal level, the Korean National Railroad said. On the Seoul-Pusan line, the usual 147 train runs a day fell to only 28. The police sought arrest warrants for seven leaders of Chonkihyop, including Vice Chairman Pak Sang-su. The Seoul Subway Workers Union threatened to join locomotive engineers in the strike at 4:00 AM Friday if collective bargaining on Thursday fails, while Chonnodae (the National Council of Trade Union Representatives), another dissident unregistered labor organization, is moving toward striking along with Chonkihyop. Transportation Minister O Myong, saying the police raid was unavoidable to prevent the threatened railroad and subway strikes next Monday, appealed to the striking engineers to return to their duties. Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok called an emergency economic ministers' meeting to discuss handling the railroad strike and the imminent Seoul subway strike. Economic losses from the railroad and subway strikes are estimated at 2,950 million won (some 3.6 million U.S. dollars) a day.
