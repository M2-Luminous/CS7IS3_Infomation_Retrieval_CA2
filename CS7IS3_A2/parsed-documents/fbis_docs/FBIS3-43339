Patel says the ANC will resist any attempt to convert the South African Police's Internal Stability Division [ISD] into the national peace force. The ANC has been calling for the ISD's removal from townships, but law and order spokesman Captain Craig Kotze says the proposal to convert the ISD is likely to be tabled after a defense subcouncil meeting for the TEC [Transitional Executive Council]. That meeting will discuss the composition of the force and its command council.
