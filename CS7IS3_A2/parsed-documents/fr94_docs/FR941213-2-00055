FR941213-2-00055 FR941213-2-00039 Review Criteria A panel of OSHA staff will review the applications. It will consider each of the factors listed below. 1. Occupational Safety and Health Training Experience a. Evidence that occupational safety and health training or education has been an ongoing program of the applicant organization. Reviewers will examine the number of different occupational safety and health courses offered by the applicant organization over the past two years, the length of the courses, the number of students completing each course, and the number of times each course was offered. Successful applicants will also include samples of course announcements. b. Qualifications of personnel teaching occupational safety and health courses. These include academic training in occupational safety and health subjects, experience with the application of Federal OSHA standards to hazards and hazard abatement, professional certification, practical experience in the field of occupational safety and health, and training experience. Training experience is defined as experience in training workers or managers in nonacademic situations. 2. Adequacy of Training Facilities. Potential for accommodating classes of 25 to 40 students on a year-round basis in settings comparable to those of the OSHA Training Institute. Items considered will include classroom layout, e.g., desks or tables for students, availability of audiovisual equipment, reproduction facilities for handouts, and availability of appropriate laboratory and/or hands-on facilities. Accessibility for persons with disabilities will also be considered. 3. Recruitment and Registration Procedures. Reasonableness of the applicant's procedures for recruiting and registering students. Methods of reaching potential students, ease of registration, provisions for cancellations, and system for informing students of available accommodations and materials necessary for the course, if any, are among the items that will be reviewed. 4. Accommodations and Location. Availability of lodging and restaurant facilities, access to nationwide transportation and proximity to an OSHA Area or Regional Office. Accommodations, preferably national hotel/motel chains, and restaurants should be reasonably prices and should be within a few miles of the training facility. A major airport with regular service to all parts of the Region should be within a reasonable driving time from the hotel and training locations. Interstate highways should also be within reasonable distance. The nearest OSHA Office should be within one hour's travel time of the principal training site to facilitate OSHA participation in training sessions. 5. Tuition. Conformance of proposed tuition and/or fees with the established policies of the applicant and reasonableness of the charges. 6. Nondiscrimination. Adherence of the applicant's policies with Federal requirements. 7. Off-site Courses. Experience and/or ability of the applicant to conduct courses at sites other than its own facility.

These are intended to provide potential applicants with information about the OSHA Training Institute, OSHA Training Institute courses and methods of instruction, and administrative requirements for OSHA Training Institute Education Centers. The conference in Des Plaines, Illinois, will also include a tour of the OSHA Training Institute. The conferences will also feature question and answer sessions about the documentation expected in applications. The proposal conferences will be held from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon.
