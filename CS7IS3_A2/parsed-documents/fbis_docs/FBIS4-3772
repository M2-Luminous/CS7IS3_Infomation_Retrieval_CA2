Those being invited to visit the barracks said that this would enable Hong Kong people to increase their understanding of the PLA. Some members of the Preparatory Working Committee last year expressed their hope to inspecting the training of the PLA troops. Yesterday, the Hong Kong NPC deputies, CPPCC National Committee members, Hong Kong affairs advisers, and Preparatory Working Committee members were notified by the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch that a visit would be arranged to the PLA troops' military training in Guangzhou on 30 April. According to the arrangement, the visiting delegation will travel to Guangzhou by train on the morning of 30 April. They will inspect the training of the PLA troops that afternoon and will see dancing and singing performances put on by the PLA units. Next day, they will see the military performances and will then return to Hong Kong in the afternoon. The delegation will be received by the Guangzhou Military Region. This is aimed at enabling the visitors to better understand the training, living, and study conditions of the PLA troops. Some people being invited on this visit said that it would be a good opportunity to come into direct contact with the PLA personnel and this will be a good beginning for Hong Kong people to have a better understanding of the PLA so that they can dispel their misgivings. Cheng Yiu-tong, a deputy to the NPC, said that Hong Kong people did not know much about the PLA troops. This time, the visit arranged by the Chinese Government will increase the transparency of things and the authorities are also showing an open-minded attitude. This will help Hong Kong people to better understand about the lives of the troops, remove their misgivings about the troops to be stationed in Hong Kong after 1997, and gradually establish their trust in the troops. Liu Yiu-chu, another deputy to the NPC, said that between now and 1997, it is necessary to cause Hong Kong people and the PLA personnel to have closer contacts and exchange opinions so that the military personnel will better understand the mentality and values of Hong Kong people as well as the legal system and procedures in Hong Kong. This will ensure that the troops will properly abide by the local laws after they are sent to Hong Kong. Some members of the Preparatory Working Committee believe that Xu Huizi, deputy general chief of staff of the PLA, may also participate in this activity. Xu once indicated that, after 1997, the troops stationed in Hong Kong will be dispatched from the Guangzhou Military Region. At present, the PLA troops are receiving training in Guangzhou. They also study English, Hong Kong laws, and the lifestyle in Hong Kong.
