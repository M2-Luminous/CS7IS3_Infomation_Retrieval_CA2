He described these statements as a sign of bankruptcy, noting that they come in reaction to the constant security campaigns and the tightening of the noose around the terrorists. In remarks he made today after attending a ceremony on training day for the Central Security Forces in al-Jizah, al-Alfi noted that terrorist group members are criminals who do not enjoy recognition. He stressed that the initiative is now in the hands of the security agencies, which receive high-level training, maintain planning and coordination, and achieve constant success. The interior minister noted that the statements released by the terrorist groups are the result of the strong and successful blows by the security agencies against their dens and that their statements are mere noise designed to show that they exist. Al-Alfi pointed out that there were security shortcomings in the attack on the showroom owned by al-Sayyid Yahya, the main witness in the case of the attempted assassination of Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. He noted that an investigation is now being conducted by inspection teams from the Ministry of Interior to determine who was responsible for the security shortcomings. Asked if some of those who carried out the attack were arrested, al-Alfi asked to delay the announcement of arrests of any suspects, adding that the Interior Ministry will issue a statement when the time comes to maintain the confidentiality of information for the sake of the public good. In response to a question on tightening security around citizens who give out information to security agencies, al-Alfi emphasized that those who give information are under protection, although this is done secretly. He added: If a mistake has been made in one area, this does not mean that mistakes will continue. Asked about the bomb that exploded yesterday in front of the Central Bank branch in Ramsis Square, the interior minister said that it was a trivial thing done to prove that the terrorists are still present. Asked about the security situation in Asyut, the interior minister stressed that the situation is completely calm there and that there is a security presence and that security agencies are constantly being modernized. The interior minister referred to the regrettable incident that claimed the life of Brigadier General 'Umar Hasan Mustafa the day before yesterday, adding that it happened because of a personal error by martyr Brig. Gen. 'Umar, who used his private car on his day off without any guards accompanying him. This morning the interior minister attended a ceremony marking the training day of the Central Security Forces in al-Jizah, where he inspected the living quarters of conscripts and inaugurated a water project. He attended some exercises demonstrating how to confront terrorists and break into their dens using modern equipment. The ceremony was attended by Major General Samir Fu'ad, first assistant to the interior minister and commander of the Central Security Forces; Major General 'Abd-al-Wahid 'Atallah, director general of the al-Jizah zone; and a number of senior officials from the Central Security Forces and the Interior Ministry.
