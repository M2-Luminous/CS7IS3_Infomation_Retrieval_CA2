FBIS4-842 "drafr074_c_94021" FBIS-AFR-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA General Denies Approving Arms Deal General Denies Approving Arms Deal MB1604201894 Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English 16-17 Apr 94 p 1-2 MB1604201894 Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR English BFN [Report by John Perlman, Janine Lazarus, and Guy Jepson] [Text] Amid allegations that Police Commissioner General Johan van der Merwe authorised the sale of 1,000 semi-automatic rifles from Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] to the Kwazulu Police [KZP], the SAP [South African Police] yesterday failed to arrive at a Goldstone Commission hearing called to probe the attempted weapons deals Eskom's corporate investigations consultant, Gaf van Niekerk, said yesterday that the export permit for the weapons (required by law for weapons sales to "self- governing" territories) had been approved by the police. He said it had been discussed with the commissioner and signed by a Major R le Roux on Van der Merwe's behalf. And Ivan Garb, MD of the firearms dealer involved in the weapons transaction, yesterday told the inquiry he was also given to understand that it had been authorised by the commissioner. Van der Merwe yesterday denied he had personally authorised the deal or was aware of it. Speaking from his home yesterday afternoon, he told WEEKEND STAR. "That is not correct, not at all." Van der Merwe said the SAP section responsible for the issuing of firearm permits had inquired at his office whether there was any special provision regarding "the issuing of permits for the exporting of certain arms to KwaZulu". "My office went through the minutes of the Cabinet and informed the Firearms Register that there is no such provision and that they can continue in terms of the normal requirements of the Arms and Ammunition Act, and they did so." Yesterday's hearing lasted barely two hours, but the information that has begun to emerge may well prove to be explosive when the hearing is reconvened on Wednesday. The commission heard evidence that Phillip Powell, commander of KwaZulu's controversial self-protection units, had initiated the deal from the KwaZulu government side. Evidence was also presented that while the KwaZulu government paid out R2.1 million [rand] for the weapons -- the money was returned when the deal fell through -- the purchase price for the guns was just R675,000. Seyeh International, a private company whose director John Sleep helped to initiate the deal, made a profit of R1.03 million, with the rest of the balance going to Garbs, the firearm dealers. But the biggest surprise came at the start when Mr Justice Richard Goldstone called the roll of legal counsel and found that the SAP was not represented. He told the hearing that he had written to Van der Merwe on Wednesday requesting SAP representation at yesterday's inquiry. In this letter Mr Justice Goldstone also asked Van der Merwe to provide the commission with certain information, including "all documents and correspondence relating to the issue of the permit for the delivery of 1,000 LM-4 rifles on Friday, 25 March 1994." This was the day the Eskom deal was supposed to go through. The judge asked for the names of the police officials who had authorised the permit and the reasons for such authorisation. He also required information about Eskom's earlier sale of 1,043 G-3 rifles to the KwaZulu Police. Subsequent correspondence clearly signals a looming stand-off between the commission and SA's top policeman. Van der Merwe replied the following day, saying that "the time allowed was not sufficient". The commissioner said that the "short notice received of the inquiry" had made it impossible for the SAP to "consult with and instruct its legal representatives". He asked Mr Justice Goldstone to "consider postponing the inquiry to a mutually arranged date". The judge replied that the matter had been made public by Eskom on April 1, "more than two weeks ago". He said the arms sale on March 25 and "the permit issued on that day by the SAP are hardly complex matters". At the hearing, Eskom representative Dr George Lindeque described how he was on his way to his car when he stumbled across men loading rifles into trucks parked in the company's garage. He said a check revealed that Henk Pienaar, Eskom's head of protective services, knew nothing about the deal. Van Niekerk told the commission that the vehicles had not been signed in on Eskom's security register and did not have number plates. Stephen Mullins, appearing on behalf of the KwaZulu government and the KZP, said it had become "increasingly difficult" to source weapons for the homeland's forces. Responding to WEEKEND STAR's story last week that a vehicle belonging to the National Intelligence Service [NIS] had been seen at Eskom during a weapons transaction NIS head of information security Andre Roux said inspection of the vehicles log showed that it had not been used on the day in question. He said an examination of fuel consumption and questioning of personnel who controlled the vehicle's use had confirmed this. Eskom representatives said they "could not find any trace of (the NIS vehicle) being there". Roux said a vehicle, belonging to a security company, with a similar registration was at Eskom on the day in question. Eskom representatives confirmed this.
