The Armenian government's press-service told SNARK the explosion took place in the Marneuli region of Georgia, mainly inhabited by Azerbaijanis. The Armenian specialists have already left for the accident's place. Meanwhile, it is reported that a day before the explosion the Georgian government had blocked the gas entrance to Armenia, motivating it by a scanty amount of gas entering Georgia. During the last two years about 15 sabotage acts were committed on this pipeline. Despite numerous appeals of Armenian officials, the Georgian government doesn't provide with the safe guarding of the pipeline.
