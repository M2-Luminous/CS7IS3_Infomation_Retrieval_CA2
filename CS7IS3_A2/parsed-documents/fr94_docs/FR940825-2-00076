FR940825-2-00076 FR940825-2-00050 [Announcement Number 470] Cooperative Agreement for the National Coalition for Adult Immunization Introduction The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Immunization Program (NIP), announces the availability of cooperative agreement funds to assist the National Coalition for Adult Immunization (NCAI) in giving guidance to and coordinating activities of the NCAI Action Groups. The NCAI consists of private, professional, and volunteer organizations and public health agencies. The goal of the NCAI is to reduce vaccine-preventable diseases and deaths among adults in the United States by increasing the awareness of physicians, other health care providers, and the general public about the need for and the benefits of immunization. The NCAI supports the use of influenza, pneumococcal, hepatitis B, measles, mumps and rubella vaccines and tetanus and diphtheria toxoids in adults. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Immunization and Infectious Diseases. (For ordering a copy of Healthy People 2000, see the section WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION .) Authority This program is authorized under the Public Service Act, Section 317k [42 U.S.C. 247b(k)], as amended. Smoke-Free Workplace The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people. Eligible Applicants Assistance will only be provided to one of the member groups or professional organizations of the National Coalition for Adult Immunization. No other applications will be solicited. The NCAI is a membership of 72 private, public, and voluntary organizations, whose goal is to improve the immunization levels in the adult population by the year 2000. Member organizations develop highly visible programs to educate the public about adult vaccine preventable diseases. The NCAI is unique, in that there is collaboration among the Public Health Service, private, professional, and voluntary organizations with a history of combining resources and sharing information to improve immunization rates in adults. NCAI member organizations have established and continue to maintain a network of contacts, who contribute to the development and distribution of information and educational materials and support of activities to improve adult immunization. Coalition members are more likely to receive support and cooperation from private, public and professional organizations to achieve its mission than non-coalition members. The applicant organization should have an emphasis on research or education on adult health issues, including immunization. In addition, applicants must have demonstrated relevant leadership experience in building relationships with national organizations, private and public sector non-profit health care organizations, professional health associations, volunteer groups, advocacy groups, minority organizations, and government entities. The applicant organization must have an established national network of State or local chapters and/or affiliates which devote a substantial proportion of their activities to adult health issues.
