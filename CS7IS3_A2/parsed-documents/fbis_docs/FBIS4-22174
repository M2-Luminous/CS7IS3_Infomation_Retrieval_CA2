Nizhalovskiy, candidate of historical sciences and docent, under the rubric "From the Directorate of the Chief of Engineering Troops of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense" : "An Assembly of Administrative Personnel of the Engineering Troops"] [Text] In accordance with the plan for training the Russian Federation's armed forces a special operational assembly was conducted at the end of August 1993 under the supervision of Colonel-General V. Kuznetsov. This was the first such assembly on this level in the Russian Army. More than two years had gone by since the last assembly, that one was in the Soviet Armed Forces. During that time a considerable portion of the engineering troops transferred to the armies of the independent states, former republics of the USSR, to industrial enterprises and design offices. Russia's engineering troops have now taken shape, and the administrative personnel have been 40-percent renewed. There have been large changes also in the nature, the scope and the organization of engineer support missions. There are new weapon models and ammunition, and the conditions surrounding their safekeeping and operation have become more complicated. That is, there have been fundamental changes in the conditions for the functioning of the engineering troops and in views on their combat employment and path of development. The first day of activity was devoted to theoretical issues. In his report Col-Gen Kuznetsov summed up the results of the first stage of the development of Russia's engineering troops and told about prospects for their development and the main missions which must be accomplished in the immediate future. He also touched upon problems arising as a result of the altered geopolitical circumstances, the collapse of the USSR and the transition to market conditions. These were further developed in reports and speeches by deputy chiefs of engineering troops of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense, the chiefs of leading departments at the Military Engineering Academy imeni V.V. Kuybyshev and a representative of the General Staff Military Academy. The assembly participants were particularly concerned about the fact that the scope of engineer support missions is tending to grow. The periods allowed for their execution is being reduced or remains the same, but the size of these forces is dropping considerably in the situation of reform of the Russian Army. This is reflected primarily in the fortification equipment of lines and positions, the establishment of engineer obstacles and the performance of operational and tactical camouflage measures. It is obvious in this situation that it would be expedient to revise the deadlines involved and the extent of the fortifications, making protection of the personnel against weapons the keystone. In setting up the system of engineer obstacles we need to switch decisively from the mining of areas to the mining of specific facilities, the laying of most mixed minefields in the course of combat operations, on revealed sectors of enemy operations. Success in the execution of engineer measures will depend to a large extent upon the use of the latest facilities and the improvement of camouflage measures, and the enlistment not just of engineering subunits but also, and primarily, subunits of the troop army and branches of the armed forces for the performance of these missions. Considerable problems are arising in the course of establishing new groupings of engineer troops. The withdrawal of a large number of formations and units of troops and their settlement within Russia, with a simultaneous reduction in numerical strength and the lack of vacant military posts, particularly housing, are making it impossible to set up groupings of engineer troops in the classical sense. This requires a great deal of effort not just of the command element of the engineer troops but also the commanders of the military districts. Assembly participants considered such urgent problems as moral and psychological support for the operations of the engineer troops and indoctrination of the personnel at the modern level of their functioning. Recently, given the withdrawal of troops and the large-scale removal of ammunition from the groups of forces, we are faced with a drastic exacerbation of the crime situation in the nation, with the problem of safeguarding the weapons and ammunition moving to the fore. The latter was the subject of discussion on the second day of the assembly. Classes were held at one of the arsenals of the engineer troops. Specific recommendations were worked out for safeguarding special ammunition in the districts and armies, and ways to solve the problems were outlined. The third day was equally repleted and useful. For six hours the participants were acquainted with new models of engineering equipment and ammunition, prospective directions for the development of engineer weapons were discussed, and experience in their employment in various areas of the nation and at hot spots was exchanged. The assembly participants learned with great interest about the extent and the organization of engineering missions and the specific features of engineer installations on the Tajik-Afghan border. After all, matters of fortifying the border sectors, coverning the sectors with the greatest mine danger and provisioning the troops with water following the tragic July events at the 12th Border Post have moved to the forefront. A class on means and methods of operational and tactical camouflage was equally interesting and instructive. It was set up at the training center of the Military Engineering Academy imeni V.V. Kuybyshev. The entire complex of means of camouflage and simulation--from the simplest of fire arms to a missile complex--was graphically represented there. The assembly participants were further convinced of the multilevel nature and complexity of camouflage measures. Unquestionably the new models of engineer equipment, the new engineering ammunition and the prospective means of camouflage are all making it possible to raise the techniques and the organization of engineer support missions to a higher qualitative level. Due to difficulties with financing, however, the production of many new models not inferior to their Western counterparts in efficiency and originality of technical solutions is becoming a big problem. At the conclusion of the assembly the chief of engineering troops of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense summed up the results and set missions for all areas of activity of the engineer troops, taking into account existing economic, social and financial circumstances. The objectives set for the assembly were met in their entirety. Its participants were not only enriched with new knowledge but also took with them into the forces numerous reference books and aids, and recommendations for carrying out the missions in the new circumstances.
