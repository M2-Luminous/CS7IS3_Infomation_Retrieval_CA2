Data disclosed on 1 June by the National Statistics Institute (INE) shows that the annual inflation rate remains at 12.7 percent, following a rise of 1.4 percent in May, while unemployment rose to 5.3 percent; a 0.9 percent increase over the past 12 months. All this, in addition to a growth of only 3.4 percent of the GDP during the first quarter and a persistent drop in the exchange rate, makes businessmen fear that the economic adjustment the government has been implementing for the past year may became negative and that the Chilean economy may slow down. Chilean Economy Under Secretary Carlos Mladinic asserted that these figures reveal that the struggle to curb inflation--one of the government's main objectives and the main reason for the adjustment--is not easy and demands great discipline and austerity in public and private expenditures. Mladinic denied that the Chilean economy has been drastically over-adjusted, adding that it is only "logical" that the measures to reduce expenditures would increase the unemployment rate. Mladinic added that the government is maintaining its goal of an inflation rate not higher than 11 percent for this year. [passage omitted]
