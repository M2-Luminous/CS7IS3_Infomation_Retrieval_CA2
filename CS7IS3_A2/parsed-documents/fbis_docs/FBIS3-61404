Two voluminous documents, which analyze in detail the situation in Russian science: the ``Base Report'' (more than 200 pages of text), which was prepared by an expert group of the Ministry of Science and Technology Policy of Russia, and the conclusion based on it--what is called the ``Evaluation Report'' (67 pages of text), which was written by experts of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)--were discussed. The OECD traces its history back to 1948--the organization was established for the purpose of restoring the war-ravaged European economy on the basis of the Marshall Plan. Today the 24 most industrially developed countries of the world are the members of the OECD. More than 20 committees belong to the structure of the organization. An expert group of one of them--the Committee for Scientific and Technical Policy--performed to the order of Russia much evaluation work. In the summer of last year the Ministry of Science and Technology Policy addressed to the OECD the request to conduct a survey. The examination was necessary for the objective distribution of western financial aid and adjustments of the scientific and technical policy of Russia. According to the assessment, which Minister of Science Boris Saltykov gave at a press conference, the conclusions of the examination of the OECD for the most part confirmed the correctness of the policy being pursued by his department, the ``Evaluation Report'' does not contain any particular surprises for him, while many of the recommendations of the OECD have already begun to be used in practice. ``The process is even more important than the result'' is how the minister expressed himself. Thus, what are the basic recommendations of the examination of the OECD and how did the participants in the representative world scientific forum (in addition to Russian specialists delegations of 19 OECD member countries and eight international organizations participated in the conference) appraise them? For precisely these recommendations will be of fundamental importance for western foundations, banks, financial groups, and firms when implementing various projects for the support of Russian science. The first thesis that is heard persistently in the ``Evaluation Report'' is that the scientific potential of Russia is its second national wealth after raw material resources. But the structure of science is extremely distorted and ``excessively overweighted'' by the defense, space, nuclear, and machine building complex. This structure is absolutely unsuitable for a market economy, and for this reason the OECD's examination concludes that the decrease of the number of people employed in science and scientific service by two-thirds is inevitable. Calculating the real possibilities of Russia in the maintenance of scientific personnel, the report names 300,000 people. OECD experts recommend reductions first of all at the expense of technical and administrative personnel, as well as inefficient sectorial science. The Russian Federation Ministry of Science and Technology Policy did not agree that there are still too many scientific personnel in Russia, and specified its policy in the following thesis: ``To halt the further destruction of the scientific potential, to cultivate new structures alongside old ones.'' However, here it was admitted that sectorial science needs significant institutional reorganization and market reorientation. This evaluation was confirmed by data of Russian specialists. Thus, the following facts from the ``Base Report'' were cited in the statement of Nadezhda Gaponenko, chief of the department of scientific policy and forecasting of the Center of Research and Statistics of Science: No more than 10 percent of sectorial science is capable of working at the world level, no more than 5 percent of the assets being invested in it lead to the development of innovative technologies. At the same time sectorial scientific research institutes in the number of personnel and expenditures make up more than 70 percent of the entire research infrastructure. The second most important thesis of the ``Evaluation Report'' is that the mechanism of the management of science, which exists in Russia, is inefficient due to the lack of unified monitoring of the distribution of budget allocations. The OECD experts gave a negative assessment to the removal from the Ministry of Science and Technology Policy of the functions of the supervision of the higher school, which took place at the beginning of 1993, and to the removal of Boris Saltykov from the post of vice premier. Representatives of the Ministry of Science and Technology Policy also acknowledged this, having spoken about the return in 1993 to the old system of the formation of the budget of science, in case of which the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Atomic Energy, the Russian Space Agency, the State Committee for Industrial Policy, the RAS [Russian Academy of Sciences], and so on determine a large portion of it. Under the conditions, when the Ministry of Science and Technology Policy actually controls only a small portion of the budget of civilian science, the monitoring of the effectiveness of the use of assets is impossible. Consequently, as compared with 1992, when the Ministry of Science and Technology Policy controlled the science budget entirely, the chances of Russia to attract western investments to this sphere have worsened significantly. Estimating the amounts of foreign investments in Russian science, the report names a figure of $500 million (of it approximately half is along the lines of state programs, the other half is investments of private firms). The OECD experts rate very pessimistically the prospects of subsequent private investments in this sphere: ``Russian scientific organizations understand cooperation as an exercise in the obtaining of aid that is intended for the maintenance of the existing structure of science, while private business of the OECD countries is seeking projects that are of mutual interest.'' So that the report recommends that the directors of scientific research institutes (and first of all sectorial scientific research institutes) seek financing from their colleagues in domestic industry. For the present the OECD experts have estimated the contribution of industry to the financing of research and development in the total amount of expenditures at less than 5 percent. Such a situation, in their opinion, is irrational and inefficient. In no country of the world will the state budget be able to provide all scientific and technical financing. At the same time there are areas that were rated at top-priority ones for western financing. First of all these are the acquisition of foreign scientific literature and the subscription to journals. The report states indignantly that instead of the allocation of $12 million for subscription in currency, which were envisaged by the 1992 budget, the libraries of the RAS received from the USSR Academy of Sciences an ``heir's debt'' of $175 million. Other priority spheres are aid to Russian scientific centers with instruments and equipment, materials and agents for experiments and the establishment of telecommunications systems. The state of the scientific museums and libraries of Russia with unique collections aroused particular concern of the OECD experts--their affairs are so deplorable that the report demands the quickest financial aid for urgent rescue measures. In evaluating the programs of aid to Russian basic science, the report dwells first of all on the successes of the Soros Foundation, which is distributing $100 million among 25,000 selected scientists. According to the estimates of the OECD experts, western investments already come to about 30 percent of all Russian funds for science, including its military sector, which is an exceptionally important lever of influence on research themes. The OECD experts do not dramatize the problem of the ``brain drain,'' estimating its scale by the figure of on the order of 30,000 specialists--this is 10-15 percent of the total losses that have been incurred by the sphere of science in the last three years. For the solution of the problem the ``Evaluation Report'' recommends summer seminars of young scientists and programs of the practical training of thoae with undergraduate degrees and graduate students at western scientific centers. The experts believe that given guarantees of regular trips abroad, talented Russian scientists will remain in the country and will acquire enormous psychological support, while constantly working together with western colleagues. The report rates very critically the situation in the area of the social sciences, not seeing prospects of a demand for social scientists either in Russia or in the West. The OECD experts believe that the social scientists, who received training in the USSR, were simply deprived completely of humanities knowledge in its worldwide understanding, and only a few are capable of adaptation. The innovation part of both the ``Base Report'' and the ``Evaluation Report'' is most poorly developed, which was repeatedly noted by the speakers: Mikhail Tsimbalov, chief of an administration of the Committee for Patents and Trademarks, Dmitriy Piskunov, director of the analytical center of the Ministry of Science and Technology Policy, and others. This lack of development is connected in many respects with the lack of the necessary statistical data on the sphere of innovative activity, about which Prof. Yuriy Yakovets, head of a chair of the Academy of the National Economy, spoke bitterly. As a whole the report notes that, in spite of the introduction of a package of laws on the protection of intellectual and industrial property, in Russia the questions of the reliable protection of the rights of patentees have not been settled, thus far the Patent Court has not been set up. The OECD experts note that the resources and finances, which are being allotted from the budget of the Committee for Patents and Trademarks, are obviously inadequate for the accomplishment of urgent tasks and the bringing of the new Russian patent system ``out of its infancy.'' Among the other obviously undeveloped items of the technical policy of Russia the OECD experts noted the uncontrolled destruction of such most important units of the scientific and technical infrastructure as the system of certification, standardization, and scientific and technical information. The process of the privatization of institutions of the scientific sphere, according to the data of the ``Base Report,'' is at the initial stage--37 scientific organizations have been privatized. In the opinion of the experts of both Russia and the OECD, people are continuing, alas, to carry over mechanically the forms and methods of privatization from the sphere of physical production to privatization in science. The procedural questions of the evaluation of intellectual property in the process of privatization have also not been settled. The ``Evaluation Report'' demands that Russia establish precise norms--what can be privatized in the scientific sphere and what is ``inalienable public wealth'' that is not liable to privatization. In evaluating as a whole the recommendations and conclusions of the OECD experts, it is merely possible to state that Russian science (with the exception of individual most advanced areas of basic research) can hardly count on major western investments, particularly from the private sector. I am certain that the main benefit of the performed expert work for the team of first-class professionals, which the leadership of the Ministry of Science and Technology Policy is forming around itself today, also consists precisely in this. At any rate, Minister Boris Saltykov stated firmly and unequivocally: ``The recommendations of the OECD are very useful, but we are obliged to form our own scientific and technical policy.''
