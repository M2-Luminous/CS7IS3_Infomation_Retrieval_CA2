FR941025-0-00030 FR941025-0-00006 Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding a new airworthiness directive to read as follows: 94&hyph;22&hyph;02 Consolidated Aeronautics: Amendment 39&hyph;9051; Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;21&hyph;AD. Applicability: Lake Model 250 airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any category, that are equipped with a Bendix/King KFC 150 automatic flight control system. Compliance: Required within the next 10 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, unless already accomplished. To prevent automatic flight control system malfunctions caused by failure of the elevator autotrim to disengage, which could result in flight path deviations, accomplish the following: (a) Pull the two circuit breakers, one marked ``A/P'' and the other marked ``TRIM'', and attach a collar or tie-wrap to them to prevent resetting. (b) Fabricate a placard with the words: ``Use manual trim only.'', and install this placard on the instrument panel within the pilot's clear view. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the initial or repetitive compliance times that provides an equivalent level of safety may be approved by the Manager, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), 1801 Airport Road, Room 100, Mid-Continent Airport, Wichita, Kansas 67209. The request shall be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Wichita ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Wichita ACO. (e) Information related to this AD may be examined at the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.
