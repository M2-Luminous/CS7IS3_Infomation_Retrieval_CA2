TELEGRAF writes that Frantisek Miklosko, chairman of the deputies group of Slovakia's Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), said that "Zeman submitted such an initiative during his talks with the Slovak Social Democrats and part of (Slovakia's) Democratic Left Party (SDL)...and according to his (Miklosko's) information, the CSSD planned to include such an initiative into its election program." Novak said he spoke to Zeman every day but they had never discussed such an initiative. He stressed that representatives of social democracy had never discussed "a similar project" either with Miklosko or SDL leaders, or leaders of the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia (SDSS). CSSD has not dealt with these questions since the split of the Czechoslovak Federation on January 1, 1993, Novak said. He stressed that the activity of Zeman as deputy to the now defunct federal parliament in late 1992, by which he pushed for the unity of the country, had not represented CSSD policy. Zeman then had "only certain support" within the party, but not of its central boards.
