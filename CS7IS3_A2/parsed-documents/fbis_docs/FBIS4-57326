FBIS4-57326 "drlat096_h_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-096 Daily Report 15 May 1994 Honduras President Says No to Taxes on Water, Public Services President Says No to Taxes on Water, Public Services PA1705031494 San Pedro Sula TIEMPO in Spanish 15 May 94 p 2 PA1705031494 San Pedro Sula TIEMPO Spanish BFN [Text] Trinidad, Santa Barbara -- President Roberto Reina yesterday said that the potable water and electric energy services will not receive a 7 percent tax, as international financial organizations have recommended. Reina, who presided over the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of this city's founding, thus refuted Deputy Finance Minister Ramiro Lozano Landa, who had reported that those services would be taxed. "Every report should be released positively rather than negatively. The country's problem is its economic situation, which was not created by this government but handed down from the previous one. We are trying to solve it," he said. He pointed out that by the human face he so much referred to in his political campaign he meant to avoid, as much as humanly possible, imposing too much of a burden on the country's popular and lowly classes. "This is the battle I am waging. If you journalists do not help me, you will be opposing the Honduran history," he said. Nevertheless, he said that, if new taxes have to be established, they should be applied on those who are economically stronger. "I would regard this as the right direction." Regarding a report by Byron Suazo, Liberal Party deputy for La Paz Department, saying that the confidential fund had not been suspended as Reina had promised in his campaign, but had its name changed to humanitarian fund, the president said the report is aimed at tarnishing his moral revolution. Reina admitted that the presidency incurs in "normal expenditures" but that every single cent disbursed is audited. As for the third fuel price increase decreed in three months, the president said the prices of oil by-products do not depend on his administration but on international market prices. "The country experiences a difficult situation. If we do not control the current inflation, we would enter into an even more difficult situation. It is not the government, but inflation, which harasses the people. We are trying to solve the problem," he said. He said if fuel prices are lowered on the international market those prices will automatically be lowered in the country by the same percentage. He added that the people should be defended by preventing taxes from pressuring them. "This is the tragedy that we have been experiencing." Reina said his government is in the process of outlining a regulation to protect the country's forests. He remarked that, as the result of demand by the majority of the people, he has ordered the cutting of trees stopped. He said he took the measure because of the way forests are being destroyed. He described forests as vital to prevent river basins from drying up. If this happens, the country would be left without water. He affirmed that he will maintain his position and that he will not accept pressure from government officials who own lumber mills. Reina also said he never promised to make public the names of the former officials involved in corruption. He said that he had pledged to give the names of the institutions where these officials worked and that this is what he did. Regarding the money that the government plans to lend peasants for agricultural activities, Reina said that Natural Resources Minister Ramon Villeda Bermudez has already reported on how the farmers will be aided. [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 2051 GMT on 14 May reports that Deputy Finance Minister Ramiro Lozano had announced that the government would tax potable water, telephone, and electric energy services. Lozano reportedly had also announced taxes on school materials, cable television, and videos, and that these taxes were necessary because of World Bank and IMF demands.]
