"Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov has launched a campaign of large-scale violations of privatization legislation and even fully prohibited the transfer of state property into private in the city," Chubays told correspondents. In his words, the Moscow City Committee for Property gradually stopped corporatization and sales of Moscow enterprises at privatization voucher auctions. The share of joint stock enterprises in Moscow amounted to 15 per cent from the overall number of enterprises liable for corporatization in April 1994, as compared to 62 per cent throughout Russia. Moscow is lagging behind in privatization of large enterprises as well. The privatization situation in Moscow can be estimated as catastrophic, said Chubays.
