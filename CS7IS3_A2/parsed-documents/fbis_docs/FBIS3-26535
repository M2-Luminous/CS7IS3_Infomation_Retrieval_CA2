This was the seventh consecutive year Comrade Deng Xiaoping joined people in Shanghai to mark the Spring Festival since 1988. The hall of meeting was decorated with flowers and imbued with a spring atmosphere. With a smile, Comrade Deng Xiaoping walked to the front of the comrades in Shanghai in high spirits and with firm strides. Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal party committee, and Huang Ju, Shanghai mayor, stepped forward to express their sincere blessings to Comrade Xiaoping. Wu Bangguo said: "On behalf of the 13 million people in Shanghai, I wish you a happy Spring Festival, health, and long life; I wish your whole family happiness." Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "I wish the leading comrades of the central authorities with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core a happy Spring Festival and good health. I wish people throughout the country a happy Spring Festival, happy family lives, unity, and greater victories in the new year." Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "I come to Shanghai once a year to wish the people in Shanghai a happy Spring Festival." Wu Bangguo said: "This is your encouragement for people in Shanghai. It shows your concern and support for the work in Shanghai." Comrade Deng Xiaoping said happily: "You people in Shanghai have done a really good job in your work." During his stay in Shanghai, Comrade Deng Xiaoping showed great concern for Shanghai's material and spiritual construction. He fully affirmed the successes achieved by people in Shanghai in the past year. He said: "Shanghai has accomplished its work very well. Shanghai has special qualities and character. Shanghai is fully capable of proceeding faster." On 13 December 1993, Shanghai was engulfed by force 6 chilly wind and drizzle. The temperature abruptly dropped to about zero degrees Celsius. On the morning of that day, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, accompanied by Wu Bangguo, Huang Ju, and others, inspected Pudong and ascended the Yangpu Bridge to view the teeming construction in Pudong. Having inspected the Pudong section of the inner ring and the two overpasses over Luoshan Road and Longyang Road, which were completed last year, Comrade Xiaoping said with a smile: "Watching these roads with joy today is better than reading books for 100 years." He told Comrades Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju: "These words are from the bottom of my heart." Standing on the magnificent Yangpu Bridge, Comrade Xiaoping held the hands of Zhu Zhihao, chief commander of the construction of the bridge, and praised him: "This is a victory of the Shanghai working class. I salute the Shanghai working class!" On the eve of the New Year, in the company of Wu Bangguo, Huang Ju, and others, Comrade Deng Xiaoping ascended to the top floor of the Jinjiang Tower, looking down the brightly illuminated Shanghai streets. He said: "Shanghai has changed." Seeing Comrade Deng Xiaoping unexpectedly, Chinese and foreign tourists marking the holiday at the hotel could not but give him a long applause and express their respect and best wishes to him. With a smile, Comrade Xiaoping waved to them in acknowledgement. This evening, he also went to the congested Nanjing Road and the bund to enjoy the jubilation of the holiday with people in Shanghai. Comrade Deng Xiaoping was very pleased to hear that the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant No. 1 generator unit had been successfully put into operation. This morning, he asked Comrade Li Peng to convey his congratulations and gratitude to the builders, scientists, and technicians of Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant.
