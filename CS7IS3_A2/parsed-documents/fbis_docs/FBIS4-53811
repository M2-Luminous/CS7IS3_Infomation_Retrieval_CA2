FBIS4-53811 "dreas100bb_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-100 Daily Report 24 May 1994 INTER-ASIAN AFFAIRS Officials Begin ARF `Special Preparatory Meeting' Officials Begin ARF `Special Preparatory Meeting' BK2405040194 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 24 May 94 p 6 BK2405040194 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] The approach and pace in dealing with regional security issues topped the agenda yesterday as senior officials began a special preparatory meeting for the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) being launched in Thailand in July. Much time was spent sorting out two schools of thought put forward by Western countries which advocate development of the ARF as a results-oriented forum, and Asian countries which advocate a slower and more general approach to dealing with security. Specific security concerns in the region, proliferation of nuclear and biological/chemical weapons in the Korean peninsula, the dispute over the Spratly Islands, Cambodia and Burma were mentioned but not discussed at length yesterday. Deputy permanent secretary for foreign affairs Sarot Chawanawirat told reporters the four hot topics were raised with the aim to work out a regional strategy to resolve them without blaming any party involved. The senior officials were in Bangkok to prepare for the ARF in July and not to try to resolve the four issues, sources stressed. Foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) announced the advent of the ARF at their annual meeting last year. ARF participants will include the six ASEAN member states -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, their seven dialogue partners, plus observers and consultative partners. The United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the European Community, Japan and South Korea are ASEAN's dialogue partners. China and Russia are consultative partners, while Laos, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea are observers. ASEAN sources stressed that the ARF is meant to be an informal, consultative forum for discussing regional political and security cooperation in Asia and the Pacific. It is not meant to replace existing international or regional mechanisms dealing with security issues. ASEAN's position is that the ARF's development as a forum should be "slow but sure," Thai permanent secretary for foreign affairs Pracha Khunakasem told reporters. All participating countries should feel comfortable with it. Security was complex and had to be dealt with step by step as a certain issue developed, Mr Pracha said. "ARF is a new constructive experiment; it's like a newborn baby, we have to nurture it," he said. "Foreign affairs is difficult to quantify. We have no control because the events happen outside our country and the only thing we can do is to have an open dialogue (with the countries concerned)," he said. A U.S. official said ARF could develop step by step but there must be movement and results. A senior Russian official expressed optimism that all 18 countries will be able to reach a consensus on the issue by the time three days of preparatory talks end tomorrow. "I believe a melange (a mix) will be reached between East and West on the approach and speed at the end of the meeting, because without consensus, we cannot deal with security issues," he said. A Canadian delegate said Canada would like to see the forum play an important role in strengthening peace and security in the region. The forum should be institutionalized to allow participants "to meet each year to be able to discuss issues in order to prevent situations from further deteriorating," the official said. South Korea supported a forum to meet once a year and it should be a supplement for existing dialogues between Seoul and its partners, a senior South Korean official said. "We are going to have some more supplements which might be conducive to further stabilizing peace and security in the future," the official said. Mr Pracha said the participating countries had already agreed that ARF at foreign minister level would meet annually with the six ASEAN members taking turns in hosting the meeting. He said the meeting in Bangkok would last three hours on July 25 with a working dinner. A so-called chairman's statement by Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri will be released at the end of the meeting. Sqd Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong will set the parameters of the three-hour talks around Asia-Pacific security issues, preventive diplomacy and confidence building.
