Presidential Elections: More Problems Than Certainty"] [Text] A typical, and in many ways determining feature of the parliamentary elections campaign in Ukraine is the fact that its completion coincided in time with the start of the presidential elections campaign, which started, in accordance with the law, 90 days prior to 26 June 1994. It is precisely this coincidence that has immediately revealed, first, several real threats to the presidential elections and, therefore, also to the sociopolitical stability in the country. Second, it has finally become clear to everybody that the contradictions emerging in this connection cannot, in fact, be resolved without violating the current laws. That is to say, one of the most typical characteristics of the "old" Supreme Council's legislative activity has clearly manifested itself: It first adopted laws and then thought them over and figured out how to implement them in such a way that they would be fulfilled. However, let us analyze everything in order. Threat One It has already become obvious that, in accordance with the provisions of the law on presidential elections, there may simply be not enough time, since, on 27 April, the nomination and registering of candidates for Ukrainian president must be completed. Today, it is known that only the Socialist and Social Democratic parties have officially agreed to take part in the presidential elections. The Socialists have even been issued their first registration certificate. However, nobody has heard of personal nominations from those parties; there are no names. There did appear some information to the effect that 515 Chernihiv citizens had nominated ex-prime minister L. Kuchma as a candidate for president, but nobody knows for sure what is next. It is, therefore, necessary either to speed up the process of nomination or to change the norms of the law. The latter may only be effected by the Supreme Council, whose last meeting has been appointed for 22 April. Then there will be days off [Saturday and Sunday] and the "difficult day," Monday.... In short, there remain only 10 days, but who cares about the political consequences of this situation? However, this is not the main point. Threat Two This is the main threat, as everything else emanates from it. It is clear today that candidates must be nominated to the post of president, who is, in accordance with the current constitution, the head of both the state and the executive power. However, it is known that the old parliament agreed to reconsider the division of functions in the upper echelons of power. There is still no law on this. Instead, the law on the 26 June elections to local power structures was adopted. In accordance with it, in the case of electing these bodies, the institution of presidential representatives in provinces will be abolished. In other words, a constitutional crisis of contradiction automatically arises. The president remains head of the executive power, but the executive vertically subordinated to him and to the government becomes abolished. Well, it is not known today what kind of president we are going to elect, and this considerably complicates the task of compiling preelection programs for possible presidential candidates. It is simply not known what to promise to the people and on what platform to enlist supporters, without risking to become, excuse me for the word, a charlatan, if the law on the redistribution of powers is not adopted in favor of the presidential power. Incidentally, [President] L. Kravchuk had in mind precisely this when he refused to be registered as a presidential candidate. Threat Three Today, the fate of the president in Ukraine is totally unknown. The new parliament may object to the existence of such an institution and simply abolish it. It may then transpire that, on the one hand, there are people wishing to become candidates and there even are presidential candidates who started their election campaign, but there is no institution of the presidency. It is futile to expect that the new law on the new powers for the Ukrainian president will be adopted by the present Supreme Council on 22 April and, as a result, it will be necessary to wait for the first plenary session of the new parliament. It is not yet known when it will be held. Nor is it known whether the new parliament will be able to elaborate and adopt the new law in a constructive and efficient manner. Suppose that there are no presidential candidates until the new parliament ultimately makes a ruling on the issue of the presidency, and that the new parliament will convene in the middle of May and will adopt the necessary law. Then, there still remains one question: How about the 90 days assigned for holding the presidential election campaign? There only are three possible variants: Either to change the current law on presidential elections, to violate it openly and hold elections within shorter time limits, or to postpone the presidential elections by several months. In any case, there will suddenly emerge other problems: What kind of president will it be if he is elected in a hurry? What will be the attitude of those political forces, which demanded the presidential elections, to their postponement? What will be done about the law on holding the elections on 26 June? What will be done about the elections of local power bodies, and so on? Head of the Ukrainian Presidential Legal Service Ivan Tymchenko said that there may also be the following variant with regard to the Ukrainian presidency other than its abolishment without elections: First, the president will be elected in accordance with the current constitution and then a new entry will be made in the new one to the effect that there is no presidency in Ukraine, and then the president will resign ahead of time. Second, the elections will proceed in accordance with the current constitution, but in the new Main Law it will be specified that the president is only the head of state and therefore, some of the powers for which people voted will be taken away from the president. I. Tymchenko clearly referred to the above situations as a "legislative deception of the voters," something that may only lead to one thing -- a constitutional crisis, when nobody will know what to govern and how to govern. In addition to that, for example, the institution of the presidency is provided for in our current constitution, and in order to abolish it, it is either necessary to make corresponding changes in the Main Law or, again, adopt corresponding constitutional laws, something which is practically impossible to accomplish with an incomplete composition of the deputies corps. Threat Four Let us imagine that the elections did take place and resulted in electing a president as the head of state, and local bodies of representative power whose heads will also preside over the local administrations. This situation will not simply be one of stalemate. It will be disastrous for the integrity of the state, because there are no levers for the center to influence the local power bodies and no mechanisms for determining the responsibility for the failure to fulfill the laws or general state programs. Nationwide elections of local leaders may turn them into de facto princes, Ukraine's federalization will be brought about spontaneously and, instead of an integral and balanced state organism, there will emerge a disintegrated state structure composed of centrifugally oriented territories. Besides, the new parliament may also turn completely into a place for competition among regional deputations, as, in our single-chamber Supreme Council, there is no special body (like, for example, a chamber for the issues of territories), which might take care of balancing relations between the center and regions. Consequently, in the situation which has taken shape today, it is difficult to draw any constructive conclusions. It is difficult to dispel an impression that the prevailing mood among the ruling elite is "well, things will somehow settle down," and this mood has absolutely nothing to do with laws. Are we going to look for our separate Ukrainian road. In other words, will we proceed from the principle: It's your property and your fire, so burn it if you desire! Despite the laws?...
