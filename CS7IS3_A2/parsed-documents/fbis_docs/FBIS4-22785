The masters of financial intrigues have to turn themselves inside out, inventing intricate operations to pass dirty dollars, lire or yen through innumerable banking filters and get a 100-percent clean product. In our country, however, there is no need to make any great effort to achieve this -- the circulation of criminal money has been almost legalized and, were it not for several nuances, it would be absolutely pointless to discuss the techniques of laundering dirty capital in Russia. Fearless billions The sources from which dirty money originate are the same throughout the world -- narcobusiness, illegal trade in arms and antiques, and prostitution. In the opinion of experts, in present-day Russia, in contrast to the West, there is no need to clean the money gained from these operations -- without any treatment it can be safely used in legal turnover. There are hundreds of variants: transferring money from one bank account to another, lending or loaning, purchasing realty, investing in a business. In none of these cases is the mafia, as are individual law-unabiding citizens, threatened with an unpleasant question from a financial inspector -- "where's the money from?" During the past year not a single person in Moscow has been condemned for concealing incomes or for evading the submission of a declaration on money receipts, although it is perfectly well known to everyone that fantastic sums are not taxed in Russia today. Last year Moscow's taxation police checked a mere 236 of the tens of thousands of commercial and state organizations. It also checked 423 individuals. This kind of "activity" means just one thing -- no serious control over the movement of money has been established in Russia. This means, at least, that no one is interested in the origin of capital in our country. But does it also mean that there are no problems with laundering money? "Russian criminals still have to `rub' their money," says Mikhail Zotov, section head at the Investigation Department of Moscow's Main Directorate of Internal Affairs. "This is true only in cases when money is earned through large-scale crimes which, incidentally, seldom occur in the West. The real issue is `air money' -- the billions and trillions that are removed from bank accounts on forged documents." Indeed, criminals have to invent new miraculous ways to convert this money into cash and to cover their tracks. Playing hide-and-seek Domestic mafiosi got their first serious experience in laundering money when they used false letters of advice in 1992-1993. To this day this episode has remained the biggest "emergency" in the entire history of the existence of Russia's financial and credit system. Upwards of 1.5 trillion (!) rubles were stolen from the state with forged documents. Public money was involved and therefore definite efforts were required to take the stolen money away from under the nose of law-enforcement bodies and then to clean it. The criminals succeeded with flying colors. "The scheme of laundering stolen money is always typical," says Mikhail Zotov. "Some commercial structure sets up a peculiar buffer zone for itself -- a group of fictitious firms allegedly having no relation to it, although in fact they are its subsidiaries. Moreover, they may be scattered all over the country. Then, of course, the commercial structure opens accounts for all of them at different banks. Now it is already possible to manage serious illegal operations. "For instance, the mother firm concludes a fake contract with its own dummy structure in a different city, say, for the delivery of farm produce. Immediately it puts through the banking network a false letter of advice -- the non-existent payment for the specific commodity. By way of multistage machinations the real money is entered on the head organization's account. That is all -- dirty money has been received. Now comes the laundering: the mother firm instantaneously transfers the money stolen from the state to the bank account of yet another one of its fictitious subsidiary organizations, again with a fake contract -- allegedly for the purchase of specific products. On the face of it everything is in accordance with the law. Over there, the received rubles are turned into cash and laundered, whereupon the false firm is liquidated and the stolen money disappears without a trace. In fact, now the fraudulently earned capital is fully controlled by the organizers of the multistage swindle. This is all -- the circle has been closed. Where the stolen billions will surface is another matter. In any case, nobody will ask where the money came from -- it is quite suitable for legal financial-economic operations. "It is practically impossible for law-enforcement bodies to find the culprits. But though the financial and credit system is a common area where criminals launder money, it is not the only way, of course. Medellin cartel respects Russia The casino is perhaps one of the most traditional "laundries" for washing dirty capital in the West. Without any doubt, domestic gambling institutions are also used for these purposes. All the more so since according to the militia's summaries, more than half of them (and there are about a hundred of them in Moscow) are controlled by criminal structures. The system of laundering is simple: dirty money is passed through the casino as winnings. And since our New Russians are hot-tempered, reckless and, moreover, rich people -- it is possible to declare daily very large sums on financial reports. And there is one more interesting peculiarity: gambling houses have a lot of foreign capital. This makes it possible for criminals to clean their pounds, dollars and marks, which then safely return home as the large sum snatched in an "honest" game with the Russians. In general, laundering money through transnational mafia syndicates is prevalent on the Russian market. One need not have a rich imagination to presume that not one billion of "narco dollars" are hidden in Russia's troubled waters. But, strange as it may be, neither the Federal Counterintelligence Service nor the Interior Ministry has specific data on these operations. The international mafia can launder money in different ways in our country. For instance, through its Russian colleagues or its own legalized structure it may invest its unclean money in the purchase of timber, oil and metals. Then the commodity is shipped to the West (generally through our near abroad) where it is sold and clean dollars appear on someone's account in a Swiss bank. It is very difficult to find faults with these savings -- the money seems to have been earned as a result of an honest commercial deal. One more variant of laundering is the investment of money through dummy firms in Russia in lucrative financial and industrial projects. And, of course, the acquisition of real estate, land, enterprises and banks. The range of maneuver is great and, moreover, I repeat, nobody in Russia takes any interest in the origin of capital. So it will hardly be a surprise when with time the shadows of Camorra, Yakuza or the Medellin cartel become apparent behind many of our industrial and financial giants. Offices for exchange of criminal experience And lastly, active use is being made in today's Russia of the numerous currency exchange offices for laundering operations with cash in rubles and foreign exchange. Already the fact that not a single exchange office, not even the Central Bank, knows even their approximate number makes one wonder. Although, according to strict instructions, every authorized bank must present exhaustive information on all its exchange offices to the territorial departments of the Central Bank. "Of course, almost nobody does that -- it is not profitable: there will be check-ups, inspections and reports," says Alexei Belov, deputy head of the 4th section of the Moscow Criminal Investigation Department. "Therefore we decided to take a look ourselves: how many exchange offices are there in Moscow? In the course of our operation we checked about 1,000 such centers. In fact, I believe, there are many more in the capital -- at least 2,000-2,500. The Social Development Bank alone had about 400 exchange offices until recently." The results of our investigation were stunning. No more than a dozen exchange offices in Moscow worked without violating instructions and legislation. In 61 banks there were no orders in opening exchange offices, practically none of the offices filled out Form No. 377 which requires that they record all exchange operations. A record number of violations was registered at the centers of the All-Russia Exchange Bank, Kristall Bank and First Investment Bank. "It is evidently not worth explaining in detail why this happens," Belov goes on. "Going around in those banks is a vast quantity of uncounted cash, quite often of absolutely unknown origin. Rarely is it possible to understand where the office got the dollars which it sells for rubles or the rubles with which it buys dollars -- there are no accounts whatsoever. That is, any money you like -- whether stolen from the state, amassed through rackets or received on a fictitious payment -- may be and is put into circulation. Fifth column Needless to say, it is not thanks to phenomenal intellect that our local mafiosi and their foreign colleagues have scored such impressive results in laundering money. At every stage of implementing their criminal plants they have been actively assisted by the multimillion army of Russian officials, perhaps the most resourceful in the world. Take the false letters of advice. According to most of the Interior Ministry's experts, the banks through which fictitious papers passed have, to one extent or another, taken part in this swindle. Of course, this statement seems too categorical but, on the other hand, it is not so groundless. For example, the investigation has shown that the Soyuzprombank made its own letters of advice. A criminal case has been brought up on this fact. Or one more case: in 1992 four false letters of advice to the sum of 2.2 billion rubles were received at the address of a client of the Moscow subsidiary of the Severny Bank run by the Zhilremontstroi firm from the small enterprise Svim in Grozny. The bank did not demand a contract with Svim, but remitted this money in small batches to the accounts of over 20 commercial enterprises indicated by the client. Whereupon the director of Zhilremontstroi vanished without a trace, whereas no Svim could be found in Chechnya, of course. However, in the course of a subsequent investigation eight million rubles of the stolen sum were found on the account of the Sirius firm, on whose payroll was Alan Gabisov, the chief accountant of the Moscow subsidiary of the Severny Bank. Another 1.5 million was found on the account of the Alan enterprise, one of whose founders was Gabisov's father, and another 31 million -- in the firm of the chief accountant's childhood friend. There have been at least dozens of such scandals. There is one more problem conducive to the success of swindlers -- the absence of a normal data bank on likely business partners: commercial banks, firms and natural persons. Moreover, no track is kept in Russia of stolen and lost passports, and registration chambers, even in Moscow, have not yet been computerized. Hence the thousands of fictitious firms which exist solely on paper and through which the underworld launders its money. It is more than easy to start such a fake enterprise. You find, steal or buy a passport from some hobo, glue your photo on it and off you go to the registration chamber. You get registered there and immediately go to the bank to open an account. That's all: yet another fake office is born. In short, conditions are very good for thieves in our country, one might even say extremely favorable, to such an extent that seditious thoughts occur form time to time -- for example, legislators are preoccupied solely with checking their projects with swindlers: so as not to harm them or not to cross their path. And until journalists get rid of these strange perceptions, they will for a long time continue lacking materials on financial-economic swindles and on the mafia's laundering operations. MN [MOSCOW NEWS] file Last year 110,000 economic crimes, 4,300 of them in the financial and credit system, were committed in Russia. According to the Central Bank's data, false payments are brought to light every quarter to the tune of 120 billion rubles. Exposed during this round were 429 criminal groups specializing in business and banking operations. The law-enforcement bodies averted the theft of sums which totalled two trillion rubles. According to reports by French special services, in the first seven months of 1993 alone the commercial structures of the CIS countries and the Baltics earned 1,045 billion francs on the re-export of Russian raw materials to France -- 96 percent of these deliveries passed through Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Georgia. Of course, some of the illegally exported raw materials were intercepted -- 97.8 tons of oil products, 17.8 tons of different grades of metal -- but that is nothing in comparison to the whole volume of materials. According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, as many as 1,500 officials violated the Russian president's decree on the fight against corruption in 1993. Of this number, 25.8 percent were staff members of law-enforcement bodies, 42.7 percent -- of ministries, different committees and their structures at grassroots level, 11.3 percent -- workers of the financial and credit system, 2.5 percent -- employees of the Customs Committee. Over the same period of time 4,500 persons were found to be taking bribes.
