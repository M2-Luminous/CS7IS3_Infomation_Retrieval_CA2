Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (d)(3)(i) of this section, a vessel holding a valid Federal multispecies permit under this part and fishing in the Southern New England or Mid-Atlantic regulated mesh areas, may not have available for immediate use any net, or any piece of a net, not meeting the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(2) and (d)(2) of this section; and a vessel, holding a valid multispecies permit while in the areas and for the times specified under §651.32(a), and any vessel while in the EEZ portion of the areas and for the times specified under §651.32(a), may not have available for immediate use any sink gillnet gear. * * * * * * * * (e) Midwater trawl gear exemption. (1) For the GOM/GB, JL/SB, and Nantucket Lightship regulated mesh areas south of 42 ○20' N. lat., fishing for Atlantic herring or blueback herring, mackerel, and squid may take place throughout the fishing year with midwater trawl gear of mesh size less than the regulated size, provided that: * * * * * (2) For the GOM/GB and JL/SB regulated mesh areas north of 42 ○20' N. lat., fishing for Atlantic herring or blueback herring, and for mackerel may take place throughout the fishing year with midwater trawl gear of mesh size less than the regulated size, provided that the requirement of paragraphs (e)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section are met. (f) Purse seine gear exception.

Mesh sizes are measured by a wedged-shaped gauge having a taper of 2 cm in 8 cm and a thickness of 2.3 mm, inserted into the meshes under a pressure or pull of 5 kg. (2) Square-mesh measurement. Square mesh in the regulated portion of the net shall be measured by placing the net gauge along the diagonal line that connects the largest opening between opposite corners of the square. The square mesh size will be the average of the measurements of 20 consecutive adjacent meshes from the terminus forward along the long axis of the net. The square mesh shall be measured at least five meshes away from the lacings of the net. (3) Diamond-mesh measurement. Diamond mesh in the regulated portion of the net will be measured running parallel to the long axis of the net. The mesh size will be average of the measurements of any series of 20 consecutive meshes. The mesh shall be measured at least five meshes away from the lacings of the net. * * * * *
