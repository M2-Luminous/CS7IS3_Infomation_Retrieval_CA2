FBIS4-37256 "drnes118_j_94027" FBIS-NES-94-118 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Raid Reportedly Kills 17, Wounds 33 Raid Reportedly Kills 17, Wounds 33 JN2006060894 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0430 GMT 20 Jun 94 JN2006060894 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] A responsible source has stated the following: In a desperate and treacherous criminal act, aircraft belonging to the traitorous rebels carried out an aggressive raid on the power generating station in the city of Mocha at 1415 yesterday. Preliminary reports indicate that this criminal action damaged the station, martyred 17 citizens, including children, women, and elderly people, and wounded 33 others. This raid is part of a series of criminal actions carried out by this traitorous gang against economic and civilian installations and targets in our country that began with the firing of Scud missiles at defenseless civilians in Sanaa, Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, Zinjibar, and al-Rahidah, and includes the shelling of vital installations in Aden, led by the Aden refinery and the power generating station in al-Hiswah. These attacks express this gang's profound enmity toward the people and their achievements, as well as its hostile desire to destroy the homeland and implement the scheme designed to fragment its unity. The source added that these hideous criminal acts carried out by the rebellious gang against economic targets and installations and residential areas in the cities take place at a time when many vital installations and targets in Aden, where this criminal gang is entrenched, lie within range of our valiant Armed Forces' artillery. Our Armed Forces, however, are greatly concerned to preserve and protect these installations from this traitorous clique because they are the property of the homeland and the people, and also because the Armed Forces are complying with the leadership's strict instructions not to inflict any harm on these developmental achievements, which are the people's wealth and the fruit of their efforts and hard work.
