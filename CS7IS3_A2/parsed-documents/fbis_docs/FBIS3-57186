Bryczowski, who heads the National Self-Defense front, a small extremist party, said that instead of arriving Thursday, Zhirinovskiy would be in Poland on Sunday. He said Zhirinovskiy told him by telephone Monday evening that he was concerned for his security while in Poland. Polish interior ministry spokesman Piotr Szczypinski said Polish authorities could not guarantee the safety of private citizens visiting the country and that there had not been any contact with Moscow officials concerning security arrangements for the trip. "Poland is a country where foreign nationals are safe," he said. Walesa told reporters Monday that he had no intention of meeting with Zhirinovskiy. None of the political leaders here have expressed any interest in seeing him either. The center-left opposition Democratic Union meanwhile announced that it would hold a demonstration in Krakow, along the road leading to Auschwitz, to protest the visit. According to Bryczowski, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, is planning meetings with important politicians and press conferences during his stay. He will also make trips to Krakow, in the south, and the Auschwitz death camp and spend some time relaxing in the ski resort of Zakopane in the Tatra mountains.
