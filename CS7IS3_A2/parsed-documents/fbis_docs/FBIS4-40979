Replying to a question about the possible emergence of a new armed conflict on the Korean peninsula just over four decades since the end of the Korean war, the Russian special service experts said: For the time being, according to our estimates, neither side wants a conflict. The specialists said that so far they cannot see that either side has a clear and firm policy toward casting the world into global conflict. The experts of the Foreign Intelligence Service categorically denied speculation that the former Soviet Union virtually assisted North Korea [DPRK] to create a nuclear bomb, stressing that cooperation between the USSR and DPRK in the nuclear field had been carried out for exclusively peaceful ends and under international control. In particular some work to train specialists was carried out. Apart from this, the USSR supplied fuel assemblies for a civilian research reactor under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Commenting on the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, informed Russian circles note that in addition to the problem on the surface, each side has its own political objectives and this is reflected in the political campaign now under way in the world.
