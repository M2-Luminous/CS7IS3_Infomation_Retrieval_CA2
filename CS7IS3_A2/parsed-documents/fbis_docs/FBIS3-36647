Yeltsin proceeds from a specific situation in Russia. Kohl said this in interview to SAT-1 television network transmitted on Monday evening. The reforms will apparently not be so rapid. Kohl said his conversation with Yeltsin and the Russian president's supporters make him realise that they represent a proud nation and proud country with great history and traditions. Kohl spoke highly of the recent visit to Moscow by U.S. President Bill Clinton who showed respect for the people of Russia that remains a great power and also showed the striving for cooperation and aid. But this aid should not be self-aid, the German chancellor said. Regarding the situation in former Yugoslavia, Kohl stated Germany's position of principle. It refrains from sending troops into the region. First of all, this is not allowed by the German Constitution, the chancellor said, pointing to the need to amend the Constitution. But even if the Constitution permitted sending troops into former Yugoslavia, Germans, for historic reasons, would not be suitable partners. Kohl declared again for a quest of political solution to the problem and stressed that the forcible change of the existing frontiers is impermissible.
