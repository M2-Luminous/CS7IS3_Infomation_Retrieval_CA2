One of these, isolated from a dog's stomach, is particularly effective for activating pancreatic secretions--which, when absent or insufficient, causes many human maladies, among them cystic fibrosis, a very frequent and severe hereditary affliction affecting in Europe one child in 2,500. In order to produce this lipase industrially, in other words to "graft" this animal gene into the chromosomes of an organism capable to synthesize cheaply large amounts of the corresponding protein, the researchers could choose among a number of solutions. Among them, there is one using microorganisms and farmed "transgenic" animals (in whose genotype the alien gene is to be introduced), a solution applied by many industrial research laboratories for producing pharmaceutical substances) (LE MONDE 18 September 1991). For technical and financial reasons equally, Jouveinal has finally opted for the vegetal. According to the company's director, Pierre Le Sourd, "When compared to animal biotechnologies, the production of therapeutic enzymes through plants offers better safety guaranties against viral contamination, while providing a very cost-effective, large scale production." Advantages even more valuable can be derived from transforming genetically tobacco or, even better, rapeseed plants into true "molecule factories," by a method developed recently at Limagrain, the world's third largest seed production facility, in a fashion common to many other international associations. By deciding to join their know-how, the two enterprises have concluded a four-year agreement and set aside about 20 million French francs for the project. They hope to obtain a productivity of one kg purified lipase per hectare of rapeseed. Limagrain will be responsible for the plants' genetic manipulation, the cultivation of the fields, and for the first stages of extracting the lipase. Jouveinal will be charged with enzyme purification, studying its biological activity, and with monitoring the medicine's--hoped for--safety and performance against the digestive attacks (symptoms) of cystic fibrosis. Relatively easy to manipulate genetically, the rapeseed is a storage organism with a natural metabolism totally geared for protein production. Its use, therefore, appears particularly well adapted for producing molecules of industrial or therapeutic interests. Well versed in vegetal transformation technology, Limagrain has also concluded a cooperation agreement with the Regional Blood Transformation Center (CRTS), on 9 May in Lille, with the objective of producing, via plants, certain human proteins existing in the blood (albumin, alpha-1-antitrypsine, hemostatic factor).
