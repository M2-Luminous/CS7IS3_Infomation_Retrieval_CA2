Velasquez; place not given; broadcast in progress -- live] [Text] ...due to the recent Banco Latino intervention and the rumors circulating throughout the country, I believe it is my duty to deliver a message to the country on the position of the national government. To confront the Banco Latino crisis and its pernicious consequences to Venezuela, the government is adopting a series of measures, joined in an overall plan, to serve Banco Latino depositors and reestablish confidence in the Venezuelan financial system, hit hard at this moment not only by this bank's crisis but also by rumor campaigns that are seriously hurting the country. The complexity of the problem demands everyone's commitment and participation. The program I am announcing today has the support of the country's financial authorities and banking system. President-elect Rafael Caldera has been consulted about the program, and we trust he will give it the necessary continuity during his administration. Likewise, we have informed the political parties so the initiatives that need to be taken will find the necessary receptivity in Congress, which will be convened soon. To address the situation that arose following the Banco Latino intervention, I am close to appointing a board of intervention comprising Julio Santodomingo, who will preside over the board, Hernan Oyarzabal; Cesario Cadenas; and (Jose Grazovechio). All of these people have broad banking, financial, and legal experience, and they enjoy the respect and trust of the financial community. This board of intervention will assume the duties the banking law establishes. 2. [number as heard] Advisory Council. In order to support the board of intervention and channel the support Venezuelan banks are giving the state during this difficult situation, I am appointing an advisory council comprising the following bank presidents: (Edgard Dao), Banco del Caribe; Jose Maria Nogueroles, Banco Provincial; Gustavo Marturet, Banco Mercantil; Jose Bouza, Banco Venezuela; Herbie Benacerrat, Banco Union; (Jose Alvarez Stelin), Banco Consolidado; Juan Santaella, Bancor; and Jose Francisco Otero, Banco Italo. I have received clear signals from members of the Venezuelan banking community on the confidence all of them have in this effort and they have delegated their representation and support to this group of colleagues. The Banco Latino action program will give priority to the following: Expediting depositors' accounts. To this end, we intend to begin with accounts of up to 100,000 bolivares, as announced, and continue progressively with larger accounts. Larger accounts in individuals' names and public and private institutions will be handled as Fogade's [Deposit Guarantee Fund] financial support system begins to operate and with the cooperation of banks. Negotiations for the recovery of Banco Latino's loans will start immediately with effective collection actions and the execution of all applicable collaterals. External auditors will be hired as soon as possible to determine the true situation of the institution and subsidiaries, both locally and abroad. No later than 90 days from now, such reports should serve to make the most appropriate decisions. There are several possibilities for selling Banco Latino and subsidiary assets or business units, both within and without the country, which foreign and domestic investors have already shown an interest in. The intervention board will take the greatest care in preserving the value of the Banco Latino and subsidiary assests and extracting the largest possible profit from the sale of assets to minimize the cost of this crisis. The auditors' examination will include, not only the institution's accounts, but Banco Latino's methods in granting investment loans. Pertinent responsibilities will be determined very carefully. 4. [number as heard] To alleviate the pressure this crisis and the pressure the wave of rumors are applying on the financial system, the Central Bank of Venezuela board of directors has agreed to the following measures: a) Given this situation, loan support for the Bernay monetary market has been activated to give banks the necessary short-term loans. b) The Central Bank mandatory reserve has been reduced from 15 to 12 percent. This measure releases 26 billion [currency not specified], which will make it possible for banks to meet the liquidity needs derived from the Banco Latino crisis and the depositors' requirements. c) The existing system for the Central Bank mandatory reserve system is hereby modified. The foreign currency deposit will be made in the same currency in which the obligation was incurred. d) To give Fogade financial assistance according to the law to enable this institution to meet the needs derived from the Banco Latino intervention and contribute to the recycling of funds in the national banking system. e) To grant financial assistance to banks facing liquidity problems as a result of this irregular situation. 5. I have instructed the banking superintendant to go to the proper authorities and request all of the pertinent civil and penal actions against the individuals responsible for the Banco Latino crisis. 6. I have instructed the attorney general to go to the Supreme Court of Justice and apprise it of all the lawsuits that are being processed to establish responsibility for the Banco Latino case. 7. I have ordered the police to take specific actions against individuals and commercial establishments that spread rumors concerning the banking situation. This is a crime that jeopardizes state security, and the full weight of the law will be brought to bear against these people. I am willing to admit the country's stability has been threatened in an irresponsible manner. I urge the public not to spread these rumors. The government and financial authorities are taking all the necessary steps to ensure the proper functioning of all Venezuelan banks and to protect the depositors' interests. The best cooperation you can give is to remain calm. Banco Latino depositors will be taken care of, and customers of other Venezuelan banks have nothing to fear. Your banks are capable of maintaining operations with absolute normalcy, and for that they have the full support of the Central Bank of Venezuela. Good night.
