FBIS3-28696 "dreas027_a_94037" FBIS-EAS-94-027 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Ozawa Interview on Tax, Political Reform, DPRK OW0802013794 Tokyo FNN Television Network in Japanese 2238 GMT 5 Feb 94 OW0802013794 Tokyo FNN Television Network Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in Japanese at 2238 GMT on 5 February carries, during its weekly "News 2001" program, a 74-minute interview with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. The program, which is moderated by Yuji Kuroiwa and Kaori Matsuyama, includes regular guests freelance commentator Kenichi Takemura and Keio University Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi. At 2239 GMT, regarding the process of proposing the national welfare tax announced by Prime Minister Hosokawa, Ozawa says the tax reform system has been discussed among the ruling coalition parties for a long time, and the proposed tax did not crop up suddenly. He notes the need for substantial discussion on the tax system. Takemura, noting Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) opposition to the Hosokawa-proposed national welfare tax, says the media have reported that two or three people, including Ozawa, decided on the tax without consulting with the SDPJ. In reply, Ozawa says the proposed tax was announced after discussion among the coalition parties. Asked about the timing for deciding on ways to raise funds for the tax cuts, Ozawa says: "I have no objection to spending several years in making the decision. However, implementing tax cuts repeatedly until then by issuing deficit-covering national bonds incontinently is very bad for the future of Japan. This is like a drug. Issuing deficit-covering national bonds is the easy way out." At 2249 GMT, Kazuhide Uekusa, a laboratory man at the Stanford University, in a satellite relay from Los Angeles, gives his views on the U.S. stance with the 11 February Japan-U.S. summit approaching. Asked how the current situation concerning the tax debate will affect relations between Japan and the United States in future, Ozawa says: "It is true that this is of no benefit to Japan-U.S. relations. However, I believe the United States is coolly considering whether it is appropriate for it to attack Japan out of spite at the present. Meanwhile, in Japan, serious discussion should be held among the people on the tax system or funds for tax cuts." On the policy-deciding system of the ruling coalition, he says: "There is no problem with the system." At 2255 GMT -- following a two-minute commercial break -- Ozawa discusses the national welfare tax, social welfare, the tax system, and other general topics. He says the Hosokawa-proposed national welfare tax is necessary to prepare for the upcoming aging society. Explaining the current tax system, Ozawa states the balance between direct and indirect taxes has to be rectified, and stresses the need to improve the pension and medical security systems. He casts doubt on the effect of income tax reduction as an economic pump-priming measure, saying: "Tax reduction for policy purposes, such as tax cuts concerning housing and land, is more effective" in revitalizing the economy. He then explains how the current preferential taxation system has to be remedied. Matsuyama asks about the possibility that Shinseito and Komeito will merge as a prelude to reorganization of the political world. Ozawa replies: "It is impossible. The mass media are trying to emphasize the Shinseito-Komeito line. There is no possibility that our party will ally with Komeito to take the lead in doing something." Ozawa also denies the possibility that the ruling coalition and the Liberal Democratic Party will merge to form a large coalition. On what Japanese society ought to be like, he states that a society in which personal ability is displayed and personal imagination is developed should be established. At 2336 GMT, Ozawa comments on the threat of the DPRK's nuclear programs and Japan's crisis control. He says: "I think (North Korea) definitely has nuclear arms. Therefore, it has delayed talks with the United States on one pretext or another. There is no progress in the talks. It has been said that the country is just playing for time. I do not think the country will accept the IAEA's full-scale inspection of its nuclear facilities. I think its nuclear arms have already been completed." He predicts a power struggle after Kim Il-song steps down, and notes the possibility that there might be upheaval on the Korean peninsula. In this connection, Ozawa says: "There is no crisis control system in Japanese society." Reviewing Japan's diplomacy at the time of the Persian Gulf war, Ozawa says Japan lacks the ability to make a quick decision on diplomatic affairs. He questions what Japan would do if the DPRK took military action and the United Nations, led by the United States, tried to deal with it. Ozawa stresses that it is important for politicians to make a quick decision and to act responsibly. At 2350 GMT -- following a two-minute commercial break -- In reply to a question sent via fax by MAINICHI SHIMBUN special editor Takao Iwami, Ozawa says the priority political task from the medium- to-long term viewpoint is to change the current political structure and to establish a political system that prevents Japan from being isolated in the international community. The interview winds up at 2352 GMT after Ozawa stresses the need for all people to cooperate in carrying out political reform.
