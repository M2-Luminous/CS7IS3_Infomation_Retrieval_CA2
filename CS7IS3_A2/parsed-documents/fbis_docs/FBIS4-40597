The working trip to the United States by Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin 21-23 June could be the next step along this road. On this occasion the government head is acting in the role of co-chairman of the Russian-American Intergovernmental Commission for Economic and Technological Cooperation. He will participate in its third session, to be held at Washington's Jackson Place Conference Center. According to advance information from reliable sources, in contrast with the two previous sessions this meeting will not only embrace a wider range of questions but will also proceed without previously prepared draft decisions on the issues under discussion: These will be hammered out in the course of debate and reached through consensus. So the experts will have to sweat it out a little and put in some solid work. The sides' efforts will be concentrated in six committees: space, energy, defense sector conversion, the development of business cooperation, ecology, and science and technology. The forthcoming business meeting, as we can see, promises to be highly interesting and productive. Its results will be expressed not so much in the specific value of prospective deals as in the content of the talks: the thrust lies in developing an all-round Russian-American partnership and establishing a balance of interests in various spheres. In this sense the Committee for Business Cooperation headed by Ministers Oleg Davydov and Ronald Brown is of vital significance. Its field of vision embraces reciprocal access to the two countries' markets and customs, taxation, and export-import policy. We, of course, are interested in securing recognition -- which we already have from the EU -- of Russia's status as a country with a transitional economy. The American side wants to break into the Russian market. At the same time it is noted that our products are more competitive than America's, as they cost less owing to cheap labor. It is planned to sign a number of agreements. But it is still too early to talk about them. Nevertheless, experts preparing the working documents believe that it could prove possible, for example, to sign a treaty on the construction of an international space station (the United States is prepared to allocate $400 million for the first two stages of the project). The upcoming three days of talks will be complex because eventual agreement will depend not only on the degree of mutual understanding between the Russian and American administrations. Here, indeed, in the experts' view, very few difficulties arise. However, finance for the programs lies in the hands of Congress: Its viewpoint on Russian-American cooperation differs somewhat from that of Bill Clinton's team. Our premier, as is obvious from the preliminary program for the trip, does have a chance to meet with the U.S. congressmen, to talk to America's business community about the projects under preparation, and to harness their support in favor of plans to deepen the bilateral partnership. It looks as though Viktor Chernomyrdin's U.S. visit will be packed with meetings with business people and invitations from top companies and corporations. The program's details are still being finalized but even now, on the eve of the trip, it is quite clear that some tricky work and a packed and hectic schedule await the Russian premier. ...And a Congress in Italy On his way to the United States Viktor Chernomyrdin will stop off in Italy to address participants in the 19th International Gas Congress, to be held 20-23 June in Milan. The largest delegation at this forum will probably be from Russia. Apart from Viktor Chernomyrdin himself, Rem Vyakhirev, president of the "Gazprom" Russian Joint Stock Company, is also expected to deliver a speech. The conference participants have a special interest in Russia because Russia supplies the bulk of Europe's gas. It is characteristic that the conference participants include representatives not only from countries producing gas but from those consuming it too. It is not ruled out that while in Milan the Russian premier could meet with his Italian counterpart, Silvio Berlusconi.
