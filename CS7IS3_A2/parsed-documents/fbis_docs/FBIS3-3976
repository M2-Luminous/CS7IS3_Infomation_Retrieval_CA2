The achievements reached by the two sides during a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Mr. Warren Christopher showed such effort being made by the Chinese side. The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, stressed that China did only what it was allowed to do by law. He added that the key to good or bad relations between two countries did not lie in the same ideology or social system but rather in how many mutual interests they shared. He noted that following the visit by Mr. Christopher both China and the United States knew that the interests of the two powers were vast and they shared mutual interests in many fields even though they had deep differences in some matters. Because of this the future relationship between China and the United States in no way merited pessimism. In other developments, Portuguese Prime Minister Mr. Anibal Cavaco Silva will pay an official visit to China between April 10 to 16 at the invitation of Chinese Premier Mr. Li Peng. The 50th annual convention of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific will be held in New Delhi, India, between April 5 and 13. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr. Liu Huaqiu will head the Chinese delegation to attend the meeting.
