Vladimir Meciar briefed newsmen about this development at a news conference at the end of the government meeting today. He went on to say that none of the members of his cabinet will accept the request of President of the Republic Michal Kovac to head their ministries until a new government is appointed. In this connection, Vladimir Meciar emphasized that what is at issue is not a political position, but the situation that results from the constitution which does not prescribe the sequence of ministerial moves in the event that a vote of no confidence in the prime minister is passed. Based on the government's resolution passed at its meeting today, from 18 March the prime minister is recalling all state secretaries and heads of departments of individual ministries from their posts. According to Vladimir Meciar, those members of his cabinet who are not members of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], agreed with the government's resolution concerning the refusal to temporarily carry out ministerial functions until the new government is appointed. These are: Economy Minister Jan Ducky, Interior Minister Jozef Tuchyna, and Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak. While the first two are returning to their initial posts--Jan Ducky will be the president of the Association of Industry of the Slovak Republic, and General Tuchyna is returning to active military service--General Andrejcak said that he is joining the HZDS as a protest against political practices. Of the three members of the coalition government from the Slovak National Party, the former deputy prime ministers Jozef Prokes and Marian Andel are returning to the parliament as deputies and Jaroslav Paska, who was minister of education and science, is said to be going back to his initial job as higher education lecturer. Vladimir Meciar acquainted journalists with the contents of the two letters he received from the president of the republic today. In the first letter, Michal Kovac asks him, as the chairman of movement with the largest number of seats in parliament, to nominate a representative whom the president can delegate to begin negotiating about the composition of the new government. If Meciar fails to do it by 1700, the president will consider his request to have been refused. Vladimir Meciar is determined to answer the letter in writing, adding that he has already expressed his rejection in public. He also remarked that it is unusual for the president to negotiate with chairmen of other political parties while inviting chairman of the parliamentary group to represent the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. Vladimir Meciar said it is offensive to the whole movement. Addressing the president, he also said that Michal Kovac was publicly dishonest toward the HZDS in his speech in the National Council and on several other occasions. He will therefore negotiate with him only if the president apologizes. Vladimir Meciar continued: The president who does not speak truth before the National Council should leave his post. It is his duty. Meciar added that the moment a new government is formed, he will consider it the president's moral duty to resign. In the second letter, the president of the republic recalled Vladimir Meciar from the post of prime minister and abolished his duty to temporarily run the Ministry for the Administration and Privatization of National Property. At the same time, he recalled him from the post of chairman of the State Defense Council. At the same time, he thanked him for the work he had done in these posts. Vladimir Meciar announced that as from today he is returning to parliament as a deputy. Together with him, former ministers Olga Keltosova [minister of labor, social affairs, and the family] and Katarina Tothova [minister of justice] will join the National Council's plenum. Vladimir Meciar said that the government is not disbanded. From today, it has begun to work as a shadow cabinet.
