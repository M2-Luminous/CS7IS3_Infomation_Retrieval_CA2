The party rejected all conditions presented by Senator Danilo Astori to accept becoming a candidate from the municipal capital. During the meeting held by the leftist coalition party, which lasted more than six hours, Vazquez finally accepted becoming a presidential candidate. His candidacy now will have to be confirmed in a Broad Front national meeting. Vazquez explained that his remarks, made 48 hours before, about preferring to be reelected Montevideo mayor had been misunderstood. After Vazquez accepted becoming a pre-candidate, the Broad Front offered Sen. Danilo Astori the possibility of becoming a candidate to be Montevideo mayor, with Vazquez' support. Astori answered that he accepted with the condition that he be permitted to continue heading a new political group made up of legislators and leaders who today are considered independent Broad Front followers. Astori's proposal prompted a wave of comments, and even though nothing was decided, most representatives of the 12 factions attending the meeting rejected the proposal with similar arguments. One of the most repeated reasons to oppose Astori's proposal was the Broad Front tradition forbidding double candidacies. In other words, a candidate representing the entire coalition cannot, at the same time, appear on the ticket of one of the groups participating in the coalition. It was agreed to recess until 16 March in order to give time for all groups to independently analyze the issue and define who will represent the Front in the race for Montevideo's mayoralty. Sen. Danilo Astori declined to comment when EL PAIS asked him about the matter at the end of the meeting, adding that he will talk with reporters later in the day. He said, however, that he does not intend to resign from his plan to work for the creation of a new group of independent Broad Front followers. No other names of possible candidates to head Montevideo's city hall were mentioned on 9 March in case Astori confirms he will not become the candidate. A few days ago, the name of Senator Mariano Arana, the Front's 1984 candidate, was mentioned in congressional corridors as a possible candidate. At that time, however, Arana was an "independent" and did not belong to the Artigas Sector, the group that elected him to the Senate. There is a formula circulating among Broad Front leaders that will be analyzed by the different coalition groups. This formula has Tabare Vazquez and Sen. Danilo Astori heading all possible tickets. [passage omitted] After announcing the candidacy of Montevideo Mayor Tavare Vazquez for the presidency of the Republic, Broad Front leader Liber Seregni said the coalition now must "program the appropriate electoral campaign." Seregni made this remark in Shangrila (Canelones) after the Broad Front provisional executive board meeting that gathered to define the issue of candidacies. Regarding the candidate for Montevideo's city hall, Seregni said: "We are talking about it. It was proposed..., I proposed Sen. Danilo Astori." "We have been talking about the issue and we have been listening -- as we appropriately should. Sen. Astori gave us his personal opinion on the matter, and we are comparing it with the interest of the coalition as a group. We are seeking to harmonize Astori's rightful personal wishes with the Broad Front's best interests," Seregni said. The Broad Front leader added: "We have been exchanging ideas. We have talked about a series of issues and concluded that executive board members need to discuss the matter with their respective grassroots. We then decided to postpone a decision until the 16 March meeting." Before joining the meeting of the so-called "provisional" executive board Vazquez said: "It is just one more stage in a process that will develop progressively into a satisfactory political message, a very positive message for the people." The capital's mayor said the Broad Front already has approved its reorganization and programmatic platform and is progressing in its efforts to achieve a larger electoral coalition with other political forces. "The process is proceeding very well; I am optimistic," Vazquez said. Meanwhile, Socialist Senator Reinaldo Gargano said the recommendation to the highest Broad Front bodies (the plenum and the congress) to promote Vazquez's candidacy for the presidency of the Republic was approved unanimously and "with cheers." "I think we have taken a very important step because the force and attraction of this candidacy goes beyond Broad Front borders. It is a proposal that clearly attracts citizens with backgrounds not typical of Broad Front followers," the Socialist senator said.
