Chen Guanglin made a progress report on Anhui's anticorruption drive. The provincial advisory committee submitted a written work report to the meeting. The third plenary session adopted the "Resolution on Implementing the `14th CPC Central Committee's Decision on Several Issues Regarding the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economy' [the "Decision"]"; and adopted the "Resolution on the `Anhui Provincial Party Committee Advisory Committee's Work Report'," agreeing to abolish the provincial advisory committee. The meeting held: The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee was an important meeting held at a time when reform in China's economic system was entering a new phase. The "Decision" -- adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee -- has sketched the basic framework of a socialist market economy; is a splendid blueprint for transforming the traditional planned economy into a socialist market economy; and is an action program that guides us to promptly accelerate the pace of reform and progress. In accordance with the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the national economic meeting has made specific arrangements for various reform and economic tasks in 1994. Party committees and governments at various levels must earnestly study the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; must adhere to the national economic meeting's arrangements; and must pay close attention to and meticulously organize related tasks so as to realistically and properly perform them. The meeting proposed: The general guiding ideologies and requirements for the work in 1994 follow: We should earnestly implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics; should persistently intensify anticorruption drive while carrying out reform, opening up, and economic progress; should further liberate the mind; should seize opportunities; should accelerate the pace of reform in an effort to expeditiously establish a socialist market economy; should open wider to the outside world; should maintain the favorable momentum of rapid economic progress while ensuring that quality and efficiency in 1994 will be improved over that of 1993; should considerably raise the provincial comprehensive strength; and should improve our work performance in various fields. The meeting pointed out: To properly perform the work in 1994, we have to accomplish very arduous tasks. While regarding reform as the main theme, we should make efforts to do a good job in the following aspects: 1) We should expeditiously smoothen the relations between producers and enterprise owners and strive to invigorate state enterprises in an effort to establish a modern enterprise system. 2) We should accelerate rural economic restructuring and strive to raise peasants' income in an effort to realize the goal of becoming well-off. 3) We should expeditiously develop factor-of-production markets and strive to enable market mechanisms to play their full roles in an effort to optimize resource allocation. 4) We should accelerate the pace of opening up to the outside world and strive to enhance the export-oriented economic sector in an effort to reach a situation whereby the economy is open in an all-round manner. 5) We should expeditiously develop scientific and technological progress, make use of related achievements, and strive to increase high-technology levels in an effort to transform scientific and technological achievements into economic benefits. The meeting pointed out: Reform is progress. We cannot achieve economic progress unless we have breakthroughs in reform. We should make greater efforts to accelerate reform; should earnestly study various central reform policies; should fully understand their guidelines; should make use of favorable conditions from a macroeconomic viewpoint; should be fully prepared; and should strictly implement the guidelines. Meanwhile, we should actively create conditions through our own efforts and effective work; should strive to seek opportunities for progress under a new relationship among various interest groups arising as a result of reform; and should use new reform breakthroughs to enhance rapid economic progress. We should realistically change our concept of economic progress, and should earnestly shift to performing the central tasks of restructuring and raising efficiency. The meeting stressed: Strengthening party organizations at various levels and raising the leadership's ability to regulate the overall situation in accordance with the party's basic theories and basic line are important guarantees for us to establish a socialist market economy. All Anhui residents should thoroughly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In particular at present, we should earnestly and properly study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. Leading cadres should lead the study so that we can conscientiously reach common understandings on Comrade Xiaoping's theories and the guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress. We should further uphold the ideology and line on liberating the mind and on seeking truth from facts; should continually eradicate backward ideas that are incompatible with development in the new situation; should respect the masses' creative spirit; and should summarize and promote fresh experiences initiated by the masses. Furthermore, we should unwaveringly and persistently uphold the policy of simultaneously and strictly launching the anticorruption drive while carrying out reform, opening up, and economic progress. We should intensify ideological and political work; should strictly crack down on various crimes; should continually launch the anticorruption drive; and should ensure that we accomplish related achievements at various stages. Additionally, we should continually strengthen the party's own development, especially development in leading bodies and grass-roots organizations; and should raise the rallying force and fighting capacity of party organizations at various levels so as to more appropriately fulfill the requirements for reform, opening up, and modernization in the leadership. The meeting earnestly deliberated the provincial advisory committee's work report. The meeting fully affirmed and highly commended the provincial advisory committee for its enormously effective work, since its establishment, on enhancing Anhui's reform, opening up, and modernization drive; on fostering party building and spiritual civilization drive; and on consolidating a stable and united political situation. The meeting also expressed lofty respects to veteran comrades of the provincial advisory committee for their important personal contributions to abolishing the previously existing permanent leading posts, to replacing old cadres with new ones, and to facilitating cooperation between the two groups. The meeting urged party organizations at various levels to be more concerned for old comrades politically and in their daily lives; to pay attention and listen to their suggestions and proposals; and to continually attach importance to the roles they will play in the future. Meanwhile, the meeting expressed the hope that old comrades will be concerned with and support, as they have previously, the work in various sectors, and will make fresh contributions to enhancing Anhui's reform, opening up, and modernization drive.
