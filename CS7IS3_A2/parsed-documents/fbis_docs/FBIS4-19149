The PS rose 4.1 percent since the previous month and now stands at 37.9 percent, while the Social Democratic Party (PSD) lost 1.7 percentage points, to drop to 34.1 percent. Drops were also registered by the Communist Party (PCP), which now stands at 5.3 percent, and the Center Social Democratic Party (CDS), whose popularity is 4.6 percent. PS leader Antonio Guterres also recovered lost ground, going from 31 percent last month to the present 34 percent, with Prime Minister Cavaco Silva standing at 33 percent. Only 9 percent of the Portuguese consider themselves "somewhat" or "not nationalistic," the results of an EXPRESSO/Euroexpansao poll (no further details) published in the 26 March EXPRESSO revealed. On a scale of 1 to 5, 23 percent said they are "highly nationalistic," 20 percent consider themselves "quite nationalistic," and 36 percent are "moderately nationalistic." At a time when the nationalism-versus-federalism question is in heated debate, the Portuguese failed to perceive the essential contradiction of the fact that 51 percent of the respondents agreed with future Portuguese integration in a "United States of Europe," compared to 27 percent who objected to it and 22 percent who had no opinion.
