Attacking "ill-conceived," "disappointing," and "risible" policies in Brussels and among EU member governments, Mr Davies told the annual dinner of the Yorkshire and Humberside regional CBI that EU legislation on social policy was being brought into disrepute. It was time for the European business community to act in its common interest and force politicians to take notice. The CBI's business agenda would be published next month. Mr Davies said recent "disappointing developments" in Europe include: 1. EU member governments' discussions of a white paper on growth, competitiveness and employment by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, were focusing on new social policy initiatives and running counter to the document's original themes. 2. A green paper on social policy which had focused on ways of increasing the cost of employing labour instead of how to get Europe's 20 million jobless back to work. 3. Failure by the EU and the Council of Ministers to prevent a proliferation of state aid for steel, telecommunications energy and air travel, putting British companies at a disadvantage. 4. The failure of the EU to get to grips with its spending. Auditors had produced "dismal catalogues of fraud and waste", yet the commission took little interest. All large European employers opposed the European Works Council Directive -- discussed yesterday by the Council of Ministers -- said Mr Davies, because it would cut across existing satisfactory consultation arrangements, impose new administrative burdens, push up costs and slow down decision-making. Britain was not obliged to follow it because of its opt-out from the Maastricht social chapter, but 90 UK companies would be affected in mainland Europe and the EU was funding a union campaign to persuade companies which were not affected by the directive to follow it voluntarily. He dismissed the commission's claim that the directive would increase identification of employees with their companies and increase productivity.
