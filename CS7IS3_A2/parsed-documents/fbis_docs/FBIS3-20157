President Clinton reiterated his support for Ciller in a surprise message to her yesterday. He said he will support Turkey's effort to effect economic reform. Clinton's five-page message reached Ankara through diplomatic channels yesterday. It replied to the expectations and requests that Ciller conveyed to President Clinton during their telephone conversations and in recent messages they exchanged. Clinton reportedly replied to Ciller's request for U.S. support to the Turkish economy by saying that $5 billion of Eximbank credit has been released for Turkey's imports. The U.S. Eximbank credit can only be used for imports from that country. Clinton's message also expressed support for Turkey's request for World Bank credit. It said the United States would adopt a constructive approach toward concluding the negotiations on a World Bank credit package for Turkey of $2.7 billion. The Gulf Fund was another issue in which President Clinton promised to support Ciller. Her request regarding that fund was one of the most important appeals to the United States. The Gulf Fund, earmarked for the second phase of the F-16 project in Turkey, is being held in the United States. It was established with a contribution by the Gulf States for the production of 160 F-16 aircraft. Ciller has asked that the fund be placed under the Turkish Treasury Department's control. Although the United States has not opposed the transfer of the fund to Turkey, it has objected to the use of the fund for other purposes. But the message said Clinton has agreed to a formula that will enable Turkey to benefit from the interest on the fund. President Clinton's message failed to satisfy Ciller's expectation of an agreement to have the oil embargo on Iraq relaxed. On the possibility of the withdrawal of a limited amount of oil from the pipeline between Turkey and Iraq, the message is reported to have said that the talks should be maintained. That was a sign that the United States opposed that idea. President Clinton thanked Ciller for the support she has given to resuming the talks on Cyprus and informed her that he discussed the problem of the Workers Party of Kurdistan with President Hafiz al-Asad when he met him some time ago.
