Recently, however, it was reported that a bilateral secret accord exists. This report resulted in great shock and further anxieties among Okinawan residents, who eagerly hope for the removal of U.S. military bases. The Okinawa Prefectural Government considers this a serious matter. It will ask the central government to take steps acceptable to the Okinawan people to disclose the facts, and state its views on the three anti- nuclear principles. From the standpoint of protecting local residents' lives, livelihood, and properties, we will further seek a peaceful Okinawa with no "nuclear arms" and "military bases" by patiently appealing to both the Japanese and U.S. Governments to make efforts.
