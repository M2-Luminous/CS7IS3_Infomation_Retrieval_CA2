DANAS notes that the murder of Croats in Algeria is closely linked to the war in Bosnia, adding that the Croats were murdered "because the Islamic integrationists have been expanding all over the world, and, it seems, have linked the Croats, just as the Serbs, to the suffering and slaughter of brother Muslims in Bosnia." DANAS claims that Bosnian Presidency Vice President Ejup Ganic, "the greatest integrationist and Croat-hater among the Bosnian Muslim leaders," had recently visited Algeria and, earlier, Libya, adding that it is known that a large number of Algerian mojahedin have been fighting on the side of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. "The West will perhaps now understand the danger of creating an Islamic state in Bosnia, in which radical and extremists leaders would prevail," DANAS concludes.
