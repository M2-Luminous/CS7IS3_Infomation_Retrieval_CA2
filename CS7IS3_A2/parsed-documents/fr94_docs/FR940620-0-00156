FR940620-0-00156 FR940620-0-00029 Response. The interim final rule includes a requirement that meter controls be located within 10 inches horizontally of the clear ground space and be centered on that space at accessible parking spaces. 14.2.6(3)␣Passenger Loading Zones Paragraph (3) adapts ADAAG requirements for passenger loading zones to the public right-of-way. Comment. The NPRM referenced ADAAG 4.1 through 4.35, which included 4.6.6 (Passenger Loading Zones). One commenter sought a clarification of the number of public sidewalk curb ramps required in a passenger loading zone that serves several vehicles. The commenter noted that block-long curbside drop-off and pick-up areas at transportation facilities may have only a single public sidewalk curb ramp, which may be difficult to identify, be obstructed by a car, or require a lengthy route of travel to separate entrances. Response. The interim final rule adds a provision that requires additional public sidewalk curb ramps at reasonable intervals where passenger loading zones serving multiple vehicle spaces are provided along public rights-of-way. 14.2.6(4)␣Motorist Aid Communications Systems Paragraph (4) requires that callboxes installed along public roadways be accessible. It requires controls and operating mechanisms to be operable by one hand without tight grasping, pinching or twisting of the wrist. The force required to activate the controls cannot exceed five pounds. The highest operable part of the callbox shall be no more than 48 inches above the finished grade at the callbox. It also requires the callbox to provide both visible and audible indicators and precludes voice-only use. It further requires that a stable, firm, and slip-resistant surface a minimum of 30 inches by 48 inches be provided immediately adjacent to the callbox and that it be level and connect to the roadway shoulder, or to a public sidewalk or pedestrian path, if provided, by means of a continuous passage. Comment. Several commenters suggested that the use of the word ``emergency'' in defining the coverage of this section might have legal implications or restrict coverage to systems that offer police communications only. Response. This provision covers systems provided for motorist communication along highways, whether they access a central control station, a 911 service, or a law enforcement or other switchboard. Although the term ``callbox'' is used throughout the provision, the device in place may operate by cellular telephone, radio, or other technology using a handset or push buttons. The section has been retitled to clarify that it applies to all such systems. Comment. The NPRM proposed that physical access be provided to callboxes. A large number of comments were received from State and local government agencies responsible for the design, installation, and operation of motorist aid systems in California. The California Highway Patrol submitted data on accidents involving patrol officers, disabled vehicles, and pedestrians along high-speed roadways indicating that persons travelling along a roadway shoulder or break-down lane are at risk and present a hazard to motorists. Commenters from transportation agencies were strongly opposed to accessible callboxes, citing safety concerns and the difficulty of providing a continuous passage to callboxes located along highways. Persons with disabilities and organizations representing them supported physical access to callboxes, noting that persons with disabilities should have the same choices as other motorists needing assistance on the highway. However, several persons with disabilities and two State organizations representing them submitted comments favoring alternative methods of access, specifically the provision of cellular telephones. A number of commenters favored physical accessibility to new installations in combination with alternative forms of access to existing systems. Response. Callboxes that are physically accessible are available to every motorist if the need arises, allowing each motorist to make a judgment about the advisability of using it. In new installations, it is possible, by the careful selection of location and the application of standard engineering practices, to achieve an accessible approach without compromising drainage, guardrail, abutment, and other criteria of highway design. Although a continuous passage from the shoulder to the callbox is required, there is no requirement that a passage along the highway be provided. Access to existing facilities, including callboxes, is subject to the Department of Justice regulation implementing title II of the ADA (28 CFR 35.150(b)). No substantive changes have been made in this requirement. Comment. The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) raised the issue of access to callboxes installed in tunnels and on bridges where structural and cost considerations encourage structural design that occupies the least possible right-of-way width. MTA suggested that an exception be given from the requirement for accessible callboxes for such facilities.
