"The matter was not discussed in the government," he said. "We are unable to ensure the normal functioning of the available launch pads, not to mention building a new one." Yuriy Semenov, general designer of the "Energiya" scientific-industrial association, supported the position of the first deputy prime minister. He deeply believes that Russia, if it aspires to the status of a space power, will not be able to do without the Baykonur cosmodrome. In this connection, he described the current situation at Baykonur as catastrophic. The social sphere has not been provided, heating is not working, and people have not been paid wages for the previous month. Practically, he said, the whole thing runs entirely on people's enthusiasm. At the same time, one should be reminded of the fact that the cosmodrome that took 30 years to build is worth an estimated 13 trillion rubles, including worn out assets [at 1991 prices]. If we do not start restoration work before April, we will soon lose Baykonur, he said. Oleg Soskovets expressed confidence that at the upcoming meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev in Moscow they will adopt a political decision on the status and functioning of the Baykonur cosmodrome.
