Civil rights are rights protected by the coercive power of the state. In accordance with laws and regulations, citizens and legal persons are entitled to many kinds of civil rights. According to different standards, civil rights can be classified into various categories: 1. Personal rights and property rights (classified according to whether or not civil rights are directly composed of property). Personal rights are civil rights which are inalienable from the subject of the rights and do not consist of property. Personal rights are also called non-property personal rights. Personal rights can also be classified into personality rights and right of status. The former is a civil right that is inalienable from the civil subject and is in force throughout the period of his existence. The latter is a civil right whose existence is based on a definite relationship of status. Property rights are civil rights that have material content and directly embody economic benefit. Property rights mainly include ownership, creditor's rights, and inheritance rights. Under some circumstances, personal rights and property rights are combined. For example, intellectual property rights include both property rights and personal rights. 2. Absolute right and relative right (classified according to the scope of obligatory subjects involved in civil rights). Absolute right, also called right in rem, refers to obligations which all persons other than the subject of the right shall not interfere with or violate. Therefore, as a general rule, the exercise of absolute right does not depend on the action of an obligatory subject. Personal rights and property rights are both absolute rights. Their exercise does not depend on actions initiated by other persons. Relative right, also called right in personam, refers to the right enjoyed by the subject of a particular right to the subject of a particular obligation. As a general rule, the exercise of relative right depends on actions intitiated by the subject of a particular obligation. Creditor's right is a relative right, which finds its expression in the fact that only the creditor has a right to claim payment from the debtor, and his right as a creditor can only be realized by the debtor's fulfillment of his obligation. It should be noted that all civil rights, being not above the law, are limited and restricted. Absolute and relative rights do not mean such rights are absolute or relative. They are classified in accordance with the scope of obligatory subjects who are under the restriction of the rights, that is, whether they refer to a particular person or not. 3. Right of petition and right of initiative (classified according to function). Right of petition refers to a right by which the subject of the right makes other persons undertake or not undertake a certain action. Creditor's right is a right of petition. Right of initiative refers to the right by which the subject of the right brings about changes in the effect of a civil law through his own actions. The right of referendum and right of recall are rights of initiative. 4. Primary right and secondary right (classified according to the degree of interrelatedness and interdependence of civil rights). Among two or more interrelated and interdependent civil rights, the one whose independent existence does not depend on any other civil rights is called a primary right; the one whose existence is based on the premise of other civil rights or depends on other civil rights is called a secondary right. For example, mortgage right is a secondary right, while creditor's right, which is guaranteed by mortgage right, is a primary right. Mortgage right has been established to guarantee the primary claim. The existence of mortgage right depends on the primary creditor's right; when the latter ceases to exist, mortgage right also ceases to exist. China's "General Code of Civil Law" stipulates that a legal person's legitimate civil rights and interests are protected by law from violation by any organization or individual. While confirming and protecting the legitimate rights of civil subjects, the "General Code of Civil Law" demands that the civil subject exercise his civil rights in accordance with law. Civil rights consist of certain interests. When the owner of such rights realizes these interests, he exercises his rights. When the owner of such rights realizes the content of the rights, through certain action performed by himself or someone else, he exercises civil rights. Civil rights can only be enjoyed by their owner; but civil rights can be exercised by someone else. This is the main difference between exercising civil rights and enjoying civil rights. The legitimate civil rights and interests of citizens and legal persons are protected by law. No one is allowed to violate such rights and interests. Persons who violate the legitimate civil rights and interests of citizens and legal persons shall bear legal responsibility according to law. When his civil rights are violated, the owner of such rights is entitled to ask his violators to stop such violation and compensate for the losses. He can also request, through administrative procedure, relevant government departments to protect his rights or directly initiate legal action with the people's court and ask for protection. Lawsuit protection is the most effective legal protection for civil rights.
