A senior Chinese official yesterday confirmed for the first time that Chan, the former secretary for education and manpower, and Yeung, the former secretary for the treasury, had been approached by the New China News Agency (XINHUA) and invited to be among the third batch of advisers. Neither was available for comment yesterday. They are believed to be considering the offers. The Chinese source also confirmed that Peggy Lam one of the most senior legislative councillors and chairwoman of Wan Chai District Board, had accepted the offer to become an adviser along with four other district board chairmen. They are Shum Choi-sang of Eastern, the former owner of WAH KIU YAT PO; Choy Wai-shek of Sham Shui Po, also a member of the Airport Consultative Committee; Pang Hang-yin of North; and Chau How-chen of Tsuen Wan. The appointments will be announced in Beijing at the end of this month. The new advisers will be invited, like their predecessors, to go to Beijing to attend a certificate awards ceremony. XINHUA is understood to be involved in final consultations with several other candidates who are still to decide whether to serve on the influential advisory body. Chan, now managing director of Kowloon Motor Bus, was once a key strategist for the government in handling talks with China over the future of Hong Kong leading up to the signing of the Joint Declaration in 1984. He is also tipped as one of the strongest candidates for the future chief executive of the special administrative region (SAR) government after the handover in 1997. When Chan left the administration last summer, he said that he would be prepared to offer advice to the Chinese government if it was sought. Chan's resignation was a surprise to the administration and he has refused to reveal why he quit. It has been speculated that he left to distance himself from the controversial political reform plans of the Governor, Chris Patten, and to further his political future after 1997. Yeung was a more distant runner in the chief executive stakes. It was believed that he resigned from the government last year over differences of opinion with Patten over the administration's style of management. Yeung is regarded as a top administrator and is now an executive director of Sino Land, a land development and investment company. It is Beijing's intention to invite former government officials to be advisers because of their knowledge, understanding, and experience. It is understood that there will be about 40 new Hong Kong affairs advisers, bringing the total to more than 100. China has already invited two democrats, Antony Cheung, chairman of Meeting Point, and Frederick Fung, chairman of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, to become advisers. They have accepted the invitations. China has appointed three levels of advisers: The Prepapartory Working Committee, the Hong Kong advisers and the more junior district affairs advisers, who were appointed last week to advise on nonpolitical matters. Two district board chairmen, Ambrose Lau of Central and Western and Lau Wong-fat of Tuen Mun, were appointed in the first and second batches.
