FR941006-1-00005 FR941006-1-00002 In 1979, APHIS published a notice of proposed action (44 FR 54737&hyph;54738, September 21, 1979) to restrict animal rabies vaccines to distribution and use by or under the direction of a licensed veterinarian. APHIS received 150 comments in response to that notice of proposed action. Sixty-six commenters supported the proposed action without change. Seventy-two commenters were opposed to the proposed action. At that time, there was a lack of agreement concerning the need and justification for a Federal restriction. The prevailing opinion of those opposed to a Federal restriction was that there was a need for flexibility to meet local needs, especially in rural areas. Based on the comments received in 1979, the restriction that animal rabies vaccine be distributed and used by or under the direction of a veterinarian was not imposed on a nationwide basis. Rather, APHIS determined that the decision concerning control of distribution and use of animal rabies vaccines should be made by each State based on what would work best for a particular State. Thus the current restriction reads in relevant part that animal rabies vaccines are restricted ``to authorized recipients designated by proper State officials under such additional conditions as those authorities may require'' ( see 44 FR 18411, March 21, 1980). At least 34 States currently restrict or have pending legislation to restrict the distribution and use of animal rabies vaccines. Some sixteen States do not restrict the distribution and use of animal rabies vaccines. The National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV), the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), and other organizations including State public health agencies have expressed concern regarding rabies control programs in various States. They requested in 1989 that APHIS consider the promulgation of a Federal restriction on the distribution and use of animal rabies vaccines on a nationwide basis to protect the health and safety of animals and the public. The groups that took an active role in studying the various problems associated with the control of rabies were the NASPHV Compendium Committee, the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the AVMA, State and local veterinary medical associations, veterinary medical schools, veterinary practitioners, and numerous State public health agencies. The NASPHV evaluated the progress of rabies control programs in the United States. As a result of its study, NASPHV requested that the Federal Government consider strengthening current restrictions aimed toward controlling rabies nationwide. In response to the request from the NASPHV to amend the Federal restriction on animal rabies vaccines to require that they be distributed and used only by or under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarians, APHIS requested that the NASPHV address four issues raised by the comments to the 1979 notice of proposed action concerning restrictions on animal rabies vaccines. Four main points were cited by commenters opposing the 1979 proposed restriction that rabies vaccines be distributed and used only by or under the direction of a veterinarian: (1) There were inadequate veterinary services in remote rural areas of the United States; (2) a veterinary monopoly on rabies vaccine would raise the cost of vaccination to unaffordable amounts (especially for individuals with many animals), resulting in fewer animals being vaccinated; (3) traveling to and from a veterinary clinic during business hours (especially for individuals with many animals) could be very inconvenient and impractical; and (4) APHIS has no information whether misuse of rabies vaccines by nonveterinarians is a problem.
