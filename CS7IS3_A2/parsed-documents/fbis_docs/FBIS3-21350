The most important such developments are lower oil prices, the difficulties that the world economy in general is encountering that have impacted international economic conditions, and the increase in petroleum supply and its imports, which accounted this past year for 75 percent of the Kingdom's total revenues. That decline in revenues has negatively influenced the GNP rate of growth in all sectors of the domestic economy whose growth this past year is put at 1 percent (preliminary estimate). Meanwhile, the private sector grew by a comfortable 5.1 percent. This rate emphasizes clearly indicates that the private sector continues to expand as a basic and strong bulwark of the development process. It is also an indication of the continued growth of the absorptive capacity of the national economy thanks to private investments undertaken in the past few years. It is common knowledge that the Kingdom is undergoing a comprehensive developmental and cultural renaissance in all sectors, with an equilibrium that reflects the genius of planning and the thoroughness of performance at all levels continues day after day. The factors of goodness and development never cease diligent action, and the forces of habilitation are tireless. The general budget, with its facts and figures, embodies the sincere efforts of the government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques to boost the advancement and improve the quality of life of the citizenry; [so much so that] the Kingdom leads the countries of the world in citizens' standard of living. It goes without saying that the budget will be implemented in the form of tangible developmental and cultural accomplishments such as those monuments and fortresses of industry and the high standards of health, educational, social, cultural, and other services. All of this crystallizes in the form of economic stability, which is the reality of life in the Kingdom, that creates a proper and fitting environment and is one of the factors in attracting foreign investment. This study, therefore, focuses on the following points: - the development of the state budget - a careful review of previous budgets - developmental accomplishments - the role of financing institutions - economic stability as a factor in attracting foreign investments. Budgetary Development in the Kingdom The Kingdom's interest in fiscal matters began early. The Directorate of Finance was created in 1346H [1927], was renamed a year later to be the Finance Agency, then became the Ministry of Finance by virtue of a Royal Decree issued on 3/4/1351H [1932]. The first budget ever was issued that year, during the reign of the late King 'Abd-al-'Aziz. The budget's term ran from 1 Sha'ban to 30 Rajab. The first budget had a value of 106,442,544 Amiri piasters or the then equivalent of 10 million silver riyals. The Kingdom's revenues were then derived from pilgrimage, customs, alms, and Amiri land holdings. Revenues and expenditures, as dual budgetary components, were first used in 1367H [1948] and [when the budget] covered the period from Muharram to the end of Zul-Hijjah. The budget has been issued regularly since then, even though its timing varied every now and again. Later, Royal Decree No. 8 of 15 Jamadi-al-Awwal 1378H [1959], based on Council of Minister's Decree No.48 dated 10/5/1378H [1959], mandated that the budget be issued on the first of Rajab, spanning the period to the end of Jamadi-al-A'khirah. The state's budget was tied to the development plan from the year 1390/1391H [1970/71] when the first five-year plan began. Budget instructions [then] mandated that it be drafted in tandem with the development plan already approved by the Council of Ministers by virtue of Decree No.812 of 1390H [1970]. The Kingdom, in accordance with a decree of the Council of Ministers in 1407/1408H [1987/88], adopted a fiscal year that begins on 10 al-Jaddi (31 December) and ends on 9 al-Jaddi (30 December). In 1405/1406H [1985/86], the fiscal year used to begin in the middle of one Hijra year and end in the middle of the following Hijra year. A Review of Budgetary Figures in Past Years It is common knowledge that revenues and expenditures are major indicators that reflect the economy's condition and strength. It is no secret that the Kingdom's budget has undergone remarkable and tangible changes reflected in increasing revenues and escalating expenditures amounting to R3,485 billion for the period from 1390H to 1413H [1970-92]. It is be noted that public expenditures have grown noticeably from R6 billion in [fiscal] year 1389/90H [1969/70] to R298 billion in the year 1401/1402H [1980/81] and to R196.95 billion in 1413/1414H [1992/93]. They stand at R160 billion in the budget of the new 1414/1415H [1993/94] year. Revenues, on the other hand, climbed from R6 billion to R340 billion by 1401/1402H [1980/81] and amounted to R169.150 billion in 1413/1414H [1992/93]. It may be said that outlays for various services and sectors have continued to rise over the past ywo years despite the circumstances experienced by the region, as indicated by the [following] cursory review of major budgetary allocations. Defense and security appropriations rose from R54.300 billion in 1412/1413H [1991/92] to R61.636 billion in 1413/1414H [1992/93]. Education received R31.100 billion in 1412/1413H [1991/92]; rising to R34.093 billion in last year's budget. Allocations for health and social development climbed from R12.200 billion in the 1412/1413H [1991/92] budget to R14.087 billion in last year's budget. Allocations for transportation and telecommunications grew from R8.300 billion in 1412/1413H [1991/92] to R9.078 billion last year. Allocations for economic resource development expanded from R8.000 billion to R8.930 billion; local subsidies from R7.100 billion to R9.176 billion; municipal services and water utilities from R6.300 billion to R6.980 billion; and infrastructure allocations from R2.100 billion to R2.095 billion. Other allocations [dropped] from R51.600 billion to R50.884 billion. Expenditures for secretariats, municipalities, and water utilities are estimated at R5,52698 billion in the fiscal year 1414/1415H [1993/94]. Allocations for maintenance and management contracts and approved construction projects are estimated at R43.000 billion. The 22 general organizations authorities are to receive R28.000 billion and R387.413 million [as published]. Figures, as they say, are not cut and dry. Rather, they reflect the economic state, including the various and numerous accomplishments in all fields, sectors, and agencies as the following facts would indicate: - The government extended some $70 billion in long-term soft loans to citizens and to companies in order to support domestic investments in agriculture, industry, housing, and the construction of private hospitals and hotels. Development funds will likewise make available some R7.870 billion in interest-free soft loans. [as published] - The hard currency balances of commercial banks in the Kingdom exceed $15 billion. - The Saudi riyal is stable in value and is covered by special hard currency reserves of more than $30 billion. - The Kingdom's foreign assets are valued at $72 billion by the end of 1417H [1996], according to IMF sources. Accomplishments in Development Industry. The number of operating licensed factories increased from 199 in 1390H [1970] to 2,036 in 1413H [1992], in which R138.5 billion has been invested. The number of food industries multiplied during the 1401-1413H [1980-92] period from 150 to 320. These industries produce milk and milk products, cereal and olive products, fodder and carbonated water products, drinking water, meats, fish, sweets, and dates. Food processing plants account for 16 percent of all factories in the Kingdom. Investments in that sector are estimated at about R7.5 billion. The volume [value] of Saudi exports amounted to R3.700 billion [as published] by the end of 1413H [1992]. The Kingdom has eight industrial cities, covering a total area of 54.387 million square meters. Construction of those cities began in 1390H [1970]. Three of them were initially constructed at Riyadh, Dammam, and Jeddah followed by others at al-Qasim, Ahsa', Mekkah, and Baridah. The cost of those cities exceeded R1 billion. Agriculture. The state encourages citizens to plant the reclaimed land it has disbributed to farmers over the years--an amount of 1.8 million hectares of farm land. This helped increase the size of cultivated land from five million hectares to 1.4 million hectares by the year 1412/1413H [1991/92]. That strategy has produced outstanding results. The production of wheat set a record of 4 million tons. The number of wheat farms has increased by 37 percent since 1407H [1986]. The standard of crops delivered to the Granary Grinding Authority--which is responsible for purchasing the crops--has improved at the rate of more than one-half [as published]. Self-sufficiency has been reached in fish and most vegetables, fruits, eggs, birds, poultry, and dates. The Kingdom is one of the major date producers, with an annual production of 600,000 tons, most of which is exported to Muslim countries and the remainder consumed domestically. The Desalination Station The daily capacity of water desalination stations expanded from 5.1 million gallons to 502 million gallons by 1413H [1992] in order to supply the water needs of the citizenry. The volume of water used for irrigation is estimated at 12,322 cubic meters annually. The Kingdom's output of desalinated water accounts for 30 percent of world production and ranks first world-wide. Telephones The number of operating telephone lines increased from 39,000 in 1390H [1970] to about 1.45 million in 1413H [1992]. The cost of local calls, amounting to R500 million annually, is absorbed by the state now that such fees have been abolished by a resolution of the Council of Ministers at its meeting on 20/9/1412H, coinciding with 23/3/1992 AD. Electricity Power generating capacity expanded from 418 megawatts, serving 316,000 subscribers, to about 21,000 megawatts, serving some 15 million beneficiaries throughout the Kingdom. Education The number of schools and colleges increased from 3,107 in 1390H [1970] to 19,631 in 1413H [1992]. The total number of male and female students at all levels of education in the Kingdom grew at the annual rate of 8.7 [percent], from 547,000 in 1390H [1970] to about 2.5 million in 1413H [1992]. The number of non-university students increased from 528,000 males and females in 1390H [1970] to 3.397 million in 1413H [1992]. The number of male and female university students rose from 8,000 in 1390H [1970] to 140,000 in 1413H [1992]. The number of universities increased from three in 1390H [1970] to seven universities and 14 girls' colleges in 1413H [1992]. Health The number of hospitals increased from 74 hospitals and 591 primary health care centers in 1390H [1970] to 272 hospitals and 3,154 primary health care centers in 1413H [1992]. The number of hospital beds in the Kingdom increased from 9,000 to more than 41,000 in 1413H [1992]. This figure includes Ministry of Health hospitals, whose beds increased from 7,165 to about 26,900. The number of physicians rose from 1,172 to 26,153 and the number of nursing staff members likewise increased from 3,261 to 53,871 male nurses. The number of technical assistants rose during the same period from 1,741 to 29,758. Athletics They say that a sound body begets a sound mind, prompting the Kingdom's government to provide all kinds of incentives and encouragement for athletes and athletics. As a result, the number of gymnasiums increased from 53 in 1390H [1970] to 164 in 1413H [1992]. Athletic federations increased from five to 20. Nineteen youth houses, five neighborhood playgrounds, 17 athletic and cultural centers, nine literary clubs, nine stadiums, two permanent youth camps, and 24 club athletic facilities have been constructed and were operational by the end of 1413H. Road and Telecommunications Networks The network of paved roads grew from 8,021 km in 1390H [1970] to more than 41,000 km in 1412H [1991], thereby connecting all cities and most villages in the Kingdom with a network of two- or multi-lane paved roads. The network of dirt roads likewise grew 25-fold from 2,500 to about 93,000 square km. The number of quays at Saudi ports increased from 27 in 1395H [1975] to 179 by 1413H [1992]--of these, industrial ports account for 45 quays. The Role of Financing Institutions Numerous financing institutions play a developmental role in order to fulfill the desires of residents and raise the standard of services by supporting and energizing construction, installation, and housing habilitation. Those institutions are the Agricultural Bank, the Lending Bank, the Real Estate Development Fund, and the Industrial Development Fund. As an example: The Saudi Arabian Agricultural Bank has distributed as grants a total of R5 million since it was founded in 1384H [1964] through the year 1410/1411H [1989/90]. The cumulative aggregate of bank grants to farmers amounts to about R9.1 billion for the period from 1393/1394H [1973/74] to 1410/1411H [1990/91]. From its foundation until the year 1412H [1991], the Lending Bank has extended more than 155,500 loans for marriage purposes as well as R3.964 billion in general loans to 278,186 beneficiaries. The cumulative aggregate value of loans extended by the Real Estate Development Bank since it was established in 1395H [1975] until the year 1412H [1991] amounted to R103.277 billion to finance the construction of 483,475 housing units. The Industrial Development Fund, since its creation in 1394H [1974] and until the end of the fiscal year 1411/1412H [1991/92], made available more than R13.9 billion. The Fund is primarily concerned with industrial development in the private sector. Economic Stability As A Factor in Attracting Foreign Investment The Kingdom enjoys the advantages of a vibrant domestic market and notable economic prosperity, making it an attractive destination for foreign investments. That, in itself, indicates that the Saudi economy enjoys world confidence. International reports show that $20 billion in investments has flowed into the Kingdom in recent years. It is common knowledge that the Kingdom's economic climate is what encouraged investors to boost their investments. Inducement incentives include the potential for obtaining Industrial Development Fund loans amounting to as much as 50 percent of project costs, not to mention the availability of economic, technical, and managerial assistance from the Fund. Imports required for industrial projects are totally free from customs duties. Such imports include machinery, tools, equipment, apparatuses, spare parts, and semi-manufactured primary raw materials. Foreign capital enjoys all the privileges of domestic capital in order to protect and support domestic industries. Furthermore, industrial and agricultural projects financed [in part] by foreign capital are forgiven certain income taxes for a period of 10 years provided that domestic capital accounts for no less than 25 percent of the [joint] venture. There are numerous advantages, incentives, and facilities aimed at promoting investment in the Kingdom. The new budget therefore underscores the absorptive capacity of the Saudi national economy and proves to all that the faithful sons of this land are capable of overcoming obstacles with profound faith and deep determination to achieve desired goals. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Development of State Budget Allocations | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Year |Revenues (million riyals)|Expenditures (million ri-| | | |yals) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1389/1390H[1969-70] |5,966 |5,966 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1390/91 |6,380 |6,380 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1391/92 |10,782 |10,782 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1392/93 |13,200 |13,200 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1393/94 |22,810 |22,810 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1394/95 |98,246 |45,743 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1395/96 |95,847 |100,935 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1396/97 |100,935 |131,296 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1397/98 |146,493 |134,254 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1398/99 |130,000 |144,558 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1399/1400 |160,000 |180,259 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1400/01 |261,516 |245,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1401/02 |340,000 |298,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1402/03 |313,400 |313,400 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1403/04 |260,000 |260,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1404/05 |260,000 |260,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1405/06 |200,000 |200,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1406/07 |200,000 |200,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1407/08 |117,280 |170,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1408/09 |10,300[sic] |141,200 need text | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1409/10 |116,000 |141,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1410/11 |118,000 |143,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1411/12 |118,000 |143,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1412/13 |151,000 |181,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1413/14 |169,050 |196,950 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1414/15 |160,000 |160,000 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
