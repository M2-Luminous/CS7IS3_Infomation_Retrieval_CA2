No one can dare confront the United States politically or militarily after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Economic relations issues are not simple because the forces that retain enough power to resist the United States economically still remain and because the stronghold in economy is economic power, just as the last stronghold in international politics is military power. These forces are none other than the European Union and Asian countries. The United States' economic offensive is now focused on the Asian region, including Japan. The weight of U.S. trade with Asia is greater than with Europe. In particular, there is a great trade U.S.-Japanese trade imbalance. This is precisely the very important reason for the United States to justify its offensive. It was revealed that the United States pressured Japan to drastically relax its restrictions after it invoked the Super 301 trade law -- defying public opinion of the world. In addition, a "rumor" that the United States will apply its domestic Anti-Monopoly Act to overseas countries spread. We have suspicions about the true intention of the U.S. indiscriminate offensive. We cannot but make precautions against consequences arising from such an offensive. The U.S. demand for Japan's relaxation of restrictions for 45 items includes some items that infringe upon Japanese sovereignty. In other words, this demand includes such requests as establishment of a third-party inspection organization independent from the government and participation of foreigners in examining relaxation of restrictions. Even the order for expanding facilities of airport storage facilities and for lowering the airport utility rate is included in the request. One can hardly judge whether this is a demand to ease trade barriers or an act to interfere in the administration of other countries. The U.S. policy to apply the Anti-Monopoly Act overseas, which was put forward with "a new bayonet," is a retaliatory act that has lost reason. It was noted that the United States is going to apply this law so it affects not only the U.S. markets, but also U.S. exports. Based on a literal interpretation, it can be noted that all organizations that produce commodities that are not competitive belong in this category. For example, large business groups in the ROK must be immediately dissolved if they want to continue trading with the United States. We do not mean that we want to protect monopolizing acts of large business groups, but we wonder if such a reorganization of world trade is possible. Are U.S. business groups fully prepared for this? The U.S. act means that the United States will lecture on antimonopoly and will punish monopolies, while actually building barriers for its own monopolies in domains of various services and intellectual properties and collecting royalties on its monopolized sale. The effort to establish world trade through transactions based on fair competition is a different issue from the U.S. act of enforcing its domestic order onto the world. Frankly speaking, we feel a great sense of danger and threat regarding the U.S. intention to reorganize the world into a "U.S.-style." When the Super 301 trade law was invoked, THE NEW YORK TIMES published prudent advice to Clinton that efforts to reduce domestic consumption should be made first, instead of adhering to an indiscriminate offensive overseas, to eliminate deficits in U.S. trade with Japan. It should be deservedly coped with if Japan and other countries repeatedly carry out unfair acts, including monopoly. Means and method, however, should not be decided on the basis of a U.S. yardstick. Some unreasonable steps that the United States has recently taken are regarded merely as acts to cause trade disputes rather than cause an increase in trade.
