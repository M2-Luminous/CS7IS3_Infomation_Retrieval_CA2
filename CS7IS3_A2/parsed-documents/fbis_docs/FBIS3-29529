This is the first official visit to Cambodia since the setting up of the constitutional monarchy government in that country in September last year. Vietnam always attaches great importance to friendship and good neighborliness with Cambodia. Immediately upon setting up the new government, Cambodia affirmed its continued strengthening of relations with Vietnam. In such a situation, this visit by Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam is an important contribution to consolidating and strengthening mutual relations. The results of the talks between Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and his Cambodian counterpart signal good news in bilateral relations. They both discussed preparations for the coming official visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. Cambodian Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Prince Sirivut remarked: These events will open up a new stage in relations between Vietnam and Cambodia. Cambodia remains faced with many difficulties due to the lack of goodwill of the Khmer Rouge, but developments in Cambodia tend to be positive. This is due to the important and great role played by King Norodom Sihanouk in the process of peace and national reconciliation in Cambodia. In the implementation of its open-door and diversified foreign policy, Vietnam is determined to establish and broaden multifaceted relations with Cambodia. This Cambodia visit by the Vietnamese foreign minister and the coming visit by the Vietnamese head of government will be a vivid expression of Vietnam's stance.
