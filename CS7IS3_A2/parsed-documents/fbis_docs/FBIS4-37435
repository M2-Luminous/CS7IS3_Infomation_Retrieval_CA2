His body was found at Dayalgam in Anantnag District this morning. Qazi Nissar Ahmad was kidnapped from his residence last evening. One of the killers has been identified as Fayaz Ahmad Mir, alias Abu Bakr, who according to official sources belongs to the militant outfit Hizbul Mojahedin. Over 50,000 people took out a procession in Anantnag town in protest against the killing and demanded immediate arrest of the killers. The funeral procession raised anti-Hizbul Mojahedin and anti-Pakistan slogans. The prime minister has expressed shock and grief at the tragic death of Qazi Nissar. Condemning the killing, the state governor, General K.V. Krishna Rao, said it clearly indicates that the militants have no respect for religion or human rights. The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and the CPI-M [Communist Party of India-Marxist] have also condemned the killing. The BJP general secretary, Mr. K.L. Sharma, asked the government to take firm measures against the militants, while the CPI-M said it showed that the struggle in the Kashmir valley is not on communal lines, but between the patriotic and antinational forces. Four left parties and the Janata Dal have called for revival of the political process in Jammu and Kashmir. In a joint statement in New Delhi, the CPI-M, CPI [Communist Party of India], Forward Bloc, RSP [Revolutionary Socialist Party], and the Janata Dal urged the center to deal firmly with militancy in the valley and districts like Doda. They alleged that the BJP has chosen to utilize the current events in the state to deepen the communal polarization. The union civil aviation minister, Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, has said the migrants in the Doda District in Jammu and Kashmir are likely to return home very soon. He was speaking to newsmen after a two-day tour of the bordering villages in Himachal Pradesh.
