North Korean Ambassador to Russia Son Song-pil, while explaining his country's position on the continuing nuclear row to members of the Russian State Duma (House of Representatives) Foreign Affairs Committee, said that international nuclear inspections would never be allowed until an across-the-board agreement on the issue was reached with the United States. Pyongyang would not return to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) should international organizations fail to withdraw their move toward sanctions against it, Son added. Son said, "economic sanctions, if taken against North Korea, will be regarded as a declaration of war...we will counter war with war."
