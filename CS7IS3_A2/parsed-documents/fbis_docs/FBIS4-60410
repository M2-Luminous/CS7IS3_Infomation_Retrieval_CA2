FBIS4-60410 "drnes101_l_94006" FBIS-NES-94-101 Daily Report 24 May 1994 ISRAEL Rabin Holds News Conference in Gaza Strip Rabin Holds News Conference in Gaza Strip TA2405124094 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1100 GMT 24 May 94 TA2405124094 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [News conference by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the Nahal 'Oz checkpoint in the Gaza Strip -- live; broadcast in progress] [Text] ...is linked to this place in the Gaza Strip. Approximately 750,000 or almost 800,000 Palestinians live here with 5,000 Israelis as opposed to the less than 20,000 Palestinians living in the Jericho area that will be under the control of the Palestinian Authority. I would like to start by extending my deepest appreciation to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], the chief of staff, the General Staff; especially to the Southern Command and its commander, staff, division commander; the operation coordinators and their commanders, for the extraordinarily efficient and excellent manner in which the difficult and unique mission of the orderly transfer of control on the ground from the IDF and the other security forces to the Palestinian police and forces -- including those issues pertaining to civilian authorities -- was completed. I was seriously concerned about the way, form, and order in which these steps had to be carried out because although we are familiar with the IDF and have confidence in it, we had no experience with the other side. As I have learned, a fabric of relations has emerged with regard to the important issues in order to facilitate the evacuation of those parts of the Gaza Strip the IDF withdrew from. This relationship permitted an orderly and adequate transfer process. I think that this constitutes a beginning that gives rise to hope, and gives the Palestinian authorities the chance to translate the just-completed transfer into orderly control, if they indeed make full use of all their abilities as they did during the transfer stage. As far as we are concerned, an important chapter in the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement has been concluded. I believe it offers the Palestinians a comfortable start. A start that will permit them to fortify their rule and bolster their control over the population. We are especially sensitive to security aspects, both with regard to the security of the Israeli settlers in the settlements inside the Gaza Strip and with regard to all issues relating to the roads used by the settlers either inside the Gaza Strip or leading into Israel; and certainly anything pertaining to the IDF activities in the area or to the borders between the Gaza Strip and Israel's sovereign territory. In my view, the activities, preparations, and implementation as carried out by the IDF are simply worthy of the admiration of the Israeli public and definitely that of the government and of myself as prime minister and defense minister. The Southern Command is indeed worthy of all praise. Thank you. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, it appears that relations in the field between the IDF and the Palestinian Police do not seem particularly rosy. What briefings did you receive at the Southern Command? Can the gaps between the parties be bridged? Can the confusion and uncertainty which is so prevalent here in the Gaza Strip be resolved? [Rabin] I am sorry to disappoint you. In all that pertains to the transfer of authority, I think that things were coordinated well. Nevertheless, let us not forget that the mechanism stipulated by the agreements is a very complex one of coordinating centers which are already operating. There are joint patrols and information sharing. Any such newly-established mechanism between two parties [two-minute break in transmission] ...serious fears. I would like to say that things have been carried out much better than I expected. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el's Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe] Are you satisfied with the IDF's new deployment and the security of the settlers? [Rabin] I think that our plans were drafted as best we could. The forces deployed accordingly, and I believe we will be able to provide maximum security. There is no foolproof [previous word in English] security. The IDF is currently in full control in Judaea and Samaria. A base murder occurred 10 days ago near Bet Hagay. The fact that this area is under our control did not and cannot absolutely prevent terror attacks. Those who think that in the current conditions, before the whole system has stabilized, we can make sure that terror incidents will not occur does not know and does not tell the truth. I am convinced that our deployment and measures, some of which are still under construction...[pauses] We arrived here after driving along part of a fence under construction which will divide between the Gaza Strip and Israeli territory; the construction of other measures is still under way. When all these are operational, they will provide the best security possible. I would like to reiterate that there is no absolute security against a terrorist willing to commit suicide or against individuals willing to perpetrate terrorist attacks. I would like to add a personal note: I am more than pleased that IDF soldiers are no longer hanging out on the outskirts of Gaza, the alleyways of Jabalyah and al-Shati'. I consider it a great privilege to be part of the government that made the decision to get them out of Gaza. [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television's Roni Daniyel] Yesterday, the police minister told the Knesset that if the Palestinians do not abide by all their commitments the whole process would come to a halt. Could you elaborate on this point? [Rabin] I will clarify our position, as presented by the police minister to the Knesset yesterday on behalf of the government. We expect all sides to the agreement to fully abide by their commitments. A bilateral agreement is based on the premise that it serves the basic interests of both sides. Therefore, our efforts will be aimed at having all sides abide by their commitments. In spite of Palestinian statements which could be interpreted as a possible violation of the agreement, there will be no unilateral violation. I hope no significant violations will occur. Agreements obviously involve two sides and are based on the premise that each side must abide by its commitments. Otherwise, and I hope this is not the case, Israel definitely has all the means to insist that violations be rectified. [Indistinct question by unidentified correspondent about incidents in recent days with the Palestinian police, including today's incident in Jericho] [Rabin] I will first comment on yesterday's incident. In the wake of the killing of two IDF soldiers in the southern part of the Erez checkpoint on Friday, we imposed a full closure on the Gaza Strip and demanded from the Palestinian police to station roadblocks 200 to 300 meters ahead of the IDF roadblock so that they can be responsible for checking every vehicle arriving at an IDF roadblock from the direction of Gaza to confirm that the passengers are not carrying weapons. Unfortunately, in contravention of instructions and the law, an Israeli vehicle apparently drove into the Gaza Strip yesterday, and then drove back toward the Erez checkpoint. At our demand, the Palestinian police tried to stop the vehicle. When it failed to do so, they aimed their fire at its wheels. Nobody was hurt. In this case, the violation was unequivocally committed by the Israeli vehicle. As for today's incident in Jericho, I have no accurate information. I will not comment on it until I get a report from the IDF. [Indistinct question by unidentified correspondent about Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi's announcement yesterday that the PNC, the Palestine National Council, will be holding its session in Gaza to amend the Palestinian Covenant] [Rabin] Referring to the first part of your question, I do not know what Ahmad al-Tibi's status is -- to the best of my knowledge, he is an Israeli citizen -- and I am not prepared to vouch for the extent to which he reflects 'Arafat's positions. I only know that the agreement signed in Cairo about the implementation of Gaza-Jericho First includes a passage in which 'Arafat undertakes to abolish those clauses in the Palestinian Covenant contradicting the content of the letters we exchanged, which led to the mutual recognition between the PLO and us, in the first meeting of the PNC and to fulfill all the elements of the Declaration of Principles [DOP]. Whether the PNC will meet in Gaza and when, I have not received any authoritative information about it. Secondly, in order to go ahead with the implementation of the process beyond Gaza-Jericho First, we will insist that the Palestinians demonstrate their ability to fulfill their commitments in Gaza and Jericho and reaffirm their commitment to the DOP, the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and the letters which led to the mutual recognition.
