This is the most sacred issue in the realities of Indonesian politics. It not only triggers controversy, but produces long discourses and polemics, as well. It is also a question that always intrudes into the territory of other issues and often generates a separate controversy. One of the controversies involves the "difference in opinion" between two young leaders who come from the same "home": Muhammadiyah. The recommendations of Amien Rais regarding criteria for national leadership in 1998--which reportedly point to B.J. Habibie--were directly countered by Din Syamsuddin's "political prayer" for Try Sutrisno. What is actually happening? There are a number of analyses, such as the one by Marzuki Darusman. This political observer, who is also a lecturer at the University of Indonesia, frankly calls the phenomenon a "reflection of the internal struggle in the Muhammadiyah organization." That is not all. From a broader perspective, Marzuki in fact sees this phenomenon as a "symbiosis" involving Muhammadiyah leaders who are members of the ICMI [Indonesian Muslim Intellectuals Association]. "What Amien Rais asserted is clearly an expression of ICMI voices in Muhammadiyah," he said, summing up. It is an attractive political step. Therefore, there is another matter, apart from the "difference of opinion," that should be examined in connection with the spread of this succession issue. "This is proof that Muhammadiyah has been able to produce new players for the political arena," Marzuki declared. By "nominating" Habibie, according to Marzuki, Amien Rais's position in Muhammadiyah is certain to be more dominant. Moreover, "It is hard to believe that Muhammadiyah does not understand the political implications of the step it has taken." What does this mean? Within Muhammadiyah itself, he said, a struggle is going on. By nominating Habibie, Amien's position in Muhammadiyah is certain to be more dominant, especially with respect to relations between Muhammadiyah and the ICMI. Regardless, Muhammadiyah, one of the largest Islamic organizations, is increasingly presenting itself as a political force that needs to be reckoned with in the Islamic political constellation in Indonesia. Indications of this began to appear when the ICMI was founded in December 1990. Prominent Muhammadiyah figures--besides people from HMI [Islamic College Students Association] and other Islamic mass organizations--became ICMI's "backbone" among nonbureaucrats. The occurrence of the Muhammadiyah Congress in the same month and year further emphasized this phenomenon. Through its congress, Muhammadiyah was successful in regenerating leadership, from older people to younger ones. From the younger circles--especially intellectuals--emerged the names of Amien Rais, Watiek Pratiknya, Ahmad Syafii Ma'arif, and several other prominent young people. In fact, Din Syamsuddin, a young Muhammadiyah personage, also in the end became a member of the GOLKAR [Functional Group] DPP [Central Executive Council] as a result of the creation of the Harmoko-Habibie "duet" at the recent national conference. Meanwhile, NU [Muslim Scholars League] figures are truly acting outside the fence. Young NU personage Slamet Efendi Yusuf, DPR [Parliament] member from the F-KP [GOLKAR Faction], who previously was a member of the GOLKAR DPP under Wahono's leadership, has been active outside the fence. Also, NU people in the ICMI did not demonstrate any significant role. "They merely went with the flow of the existing ICMI mainstream." Therefore, when succession does occur, for example, many people predict that NU masses as a political potential will turn to ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] as the strategic group. Reflections of that appear in the closeness between NU Muslim scholars and Vice President Try Sutrisno. According to Taufik Abdullah, one of Indonesia's foremost historians, the NU has been going through a very disturbing process of transition since 1984, when it returned to the 1926 Policy. After leaving the political world, the NU began to look inward: It turned out that the NU has only Muslim scholars and Islamic boarding schools. "What are NU's assets compared to those of Muhammadiyah? There are none. Therefore, this process of transition within the NU can be very painful," said Taufik Abdullah. Previously, while the NU was still political, Muslim scholars could say, "Let us choose politics...." Now, there is no alternative to improving whatever there is on the inside, while confronting extraordinary political temptations from the outside. According to Prof. Mitsuo Nakamura, author of the book The Crescent Rises Over the Banyan Tree: A Study of the Muhammadiyah Movement in a Central Javanese Town (Cornell University, Ithaca, 1976), as of 1992 there were no signs that Muhammadiyah was experiencing any change in the orientation of its religious struggle. Moreover, despite the existence of desires to participate more actively in the political process, it is unlikely that Muhammadiyah will take part as a political organization, he said. Nevertheless, he said, it attracted considerable attention when at its conference in Surabaya it touched on the issue of criteria for national succession. "Perhaps this is one form of contribution to Indonesia, which is now seeking a formula for openness and democratization. Naturally, this needs to be observed further," he said. Changes in Indonesian political life, including the fact that a Muhammadiyah personage mentions the matter of succession--while Pak Harto [President Suharto] has not been president for even a year--shows the reality that Indonesia has entered a new phase, one that has never occurred before. From the international point of view, Nakamura said, this change will improve Indonesia's image. Indonesia is a Southern nation on which many hopes are pinned. It also is a market that should be reckoned with. Thus, he said, Indonesia's legitimacy and prestige as a democratic country are on the increase. As for differences within Muhammadiyah regarding succession, he stressed that they are merely natural. In fact, open debate, for example, should be appreciated. It is true that, as Taufik Abdullah said, Muhammadiyah is accustomed to differences of opinion before decisions are made. Besides, its involvement in politics has not been by the organization, but by people in it. Differences of opinion may exist also because Muhammadiyah has never had a central figure like the general chairman of the NU. This apparently is what makes the difference between Muhammadiyah and the NU. Whatever the case, said Arbi Sanit, the Islamic community will never be united as a political force. Because the Islamic community is a large but diffuse force, the force will be dispersed everywhere when succession occurs.
