[Poivre d'Arvor] In Brussels this evening General Morillon said that he is now in favor of defensive strikes being launched should there be cases of aggression. Does this rule out any offensive, or preventative strikes? [Leotard] In this matter of air strikes, you have to know what you are saying. Most of the time the people are caught up in the military incidents that occur between the sides. An air strike is meaningless. In another scenario, around Sarajevo, for example, there would be immediate fallout on our troops -- that is what the Army itself says -- and not on potential enemies, but on our troops. So we have to be very careful. We are in a sort of situation which is more or less the opposite of the Iraqi scenario: Valleys, gorges, fog, no front, so there is no air power in the proper sense of the word, so you have to be very careful when raising the possibility. We raised it, and hoped for it, ourselves, but in very special cases, very close to the actual incident, and as a response to an attack on our forces, or to protect the people. [Poivre d'Arvor] Are the Western nations credible when they keep repeating that one day they will strike? This happened with Bill Clinton last July. Isn't this the story of Peter and the Wolf: They'll end up not believing us. Not on the ground either. [Leotard] It is not so much us, you know. The real loss of credibility in this tragedy is for the United Nations. You will have seen that the generals who speak out -- sometimes much too much -- who speak out, but never speak out against their governments. They speak out against the United Nations, for whom the word thing [machin], as used by General de Gaulle, is probably less than reality. [sentence as heard] So there is a real crisis with the United Nations, and everyone should pay attention to it. It isn't a crisis for France, or for Italy, or for Turkey -- I am only quoting generals who have recently spoken out, who have had problems with the United Nations. It is a UN crisis. We have told Mr. Butrus-Ghali that it is struck with a type of incapacity today, military incapacity. And yet it is in situations, for example in Bosnia, where military types of action are likely to prevail. [Poivre d'Arvor] You have said that the United Nations is consuming too many generals, that it is consuming them in excessive numbers in the theater of operations. [Leotard] I told Mr. Butrus-Ghali, himself, so. [Poivre d'Arvor] Who will be the next one to succeed General Cot? [Leotard] We have proposed to the United Nations, who will pass it on to the Security Council, the name of General (de la Presle), who is the current head of the Rapid Action Force, in other words one of the most important soldiers in the Army, and who will succeed General Cot at the proper time, in other words at the end of the current mandate of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], at around the end of March. This is in no way a disavowal of General Cot, who has done his work very well. It is a replacement that has to be made given the differences that have appeared between the local commander, General Cot, and the UN structures, which are quite insufficient to follow a crisis of this kind. [Poivre d'Arvor] And you insist that it should be a French general to replace General Cot? [Leotard] We insist on it being a French general, simply because we have the biggest contingent on the ground, out of the 30 nations currently present in the Yugoslav theater of operations. [Poivre d'Arvor] Just now you spoke to the RPR [Rally for the Republic] deputies, and some of them said that they favor a withdrawal of French forces, and of the UN forces as a whole, from Bosnia. What is your reply to them? Will we one day abandon these people, whom we are seeing being battered? [Leotard] Of course they have the right to say that; we listen to them, and I can tell you that when I visit this or that parliamentary group I listen to what the members of parliament are saying, and it is always extremely interesting. I think that if we withdrew today it would mean looking the other way. Staying doesn't mean a guarantee of success, but withdrawing means looking the other way. The pictures you just showed of those children who were so tragically murdered in Sarajevo -- are we going to forget them? Are we going to turn our backs on them? Are we going to leave, so as to let people kill each other? I think that there are policies that contain risks, but there are also policies that lack honor. And I don't think it is for France to put forward a policy without honor. It is a very difficult task at the moment. We are in very complicated situations on the ground. Are we then to say: Well, it's not our business any more? I know that when I say this a lot of people will not listen to me, or will not believe me. I think that there is something in French courage, in the heritage of the French people, that makes them sensitive to the distress of others. And I think of those children, I think of those women, I think of the people who are under seige today. In the Europe we are trying to build, we can not accept this. So French soldiers are doing their job, their mission, their duty today, with extraordinary morale. Let us be careful, when we speak, not to discourage these young people, who think they are being of some use. Just now I heard the adjective: Useless. It is not true. It is not true. Thousands of people are currently being protected -- even if it is not enough -- by soldiers, and in particular by French soldiers. So I think we must not say it is useless. There is a form of UN impotence, and we are in this situation. We now have to find political initiatives. You have the humanitarian path: We have to continue with it; you have the diplomatic path: We have to continue with it; and you have the path of war: And that one is a dead end. That is what we are telling the parties involved. [Poivre d'Arvor] Do you think the Geneva conference can start again in spite of the very many... [Leotard, interrupting] We must at all costs, tirelessly, with a great deal of tenacity, get the people to sit down at a table again, to get the two great powers, Russia and the United States, to sit down at the table too -- and we said this to Mr. Christopher -- so that after this meeting we Europeans, Russians and Americans can say to the three sides: Look, that's enough. You don't have the right to continue in that direction, which is the direction of war. Not just war in this small part of Europe, but a war which bit by bit will spread -- we have to be aware of this -- towards the south, in other words, Kosovo and Macedonia; towards the north, in other words, Croatia. In both cases this is a terrible kind of failure for Europe. Everyone must be aware of this. We are only doing our duty. Let all the Europeans, and the others, try to do theirs too. We have faced up to our responsibilities. We will not abandon these responsibilities, or at least not in the near future.
