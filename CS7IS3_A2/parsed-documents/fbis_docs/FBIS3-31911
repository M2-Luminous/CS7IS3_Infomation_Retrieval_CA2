Velasquez' last Council of Ministers meeting was being held at Miraflores Palace, Vice Admiral Radames Munoz [outgoing defense minister] said that after the statement he made yesterday he had nothing to add. Nevertheless, he rejected the statements made about him by reporter Jose Vicente Rangel during a television program. Here is what Vice Admiral Radames Munoz said: [Begin Munoz recording] If I had ever thought about staging a coup d'etat, I had 271 days to do so. Gentlemen, simply by taking advantage of the incident that occurred at the presidential palace and by arresting one parliament member I could have staged a coup. I never perpetrated this and I never wanted to, even though in the media there were suggestions that I had ordered something like that. I did not do this precisely because of my respect for the Venezuelan people and the democratic system in which I have a firm belief. Therefore, those accusations are groundless. [end recording]
