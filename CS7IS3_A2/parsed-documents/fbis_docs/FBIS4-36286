He welcomed the mission of special UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi. He said that he will not set any preconditions or make any prerequisites so that Ibrahimi's mission is not fraught with obstacles. We asked al-Bid at the beginning of our meeting with him about the latest developments in the military situation. [Begin recording] [Al-Bid] The military situation: I believe it is well-known now that there are many battles raging around Aden. There are also battles raging on the Hadhramaut and Shabwah fronts. But there is also mythical heroism from our people. [Tannuri] What are the factors for the success of the mission of UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi, in your opinion? [Al-Bid] We welcome Lakhdar Ibrahimi in his capacity as the envoy of the UN secretary general and as an Arab brother with a respectable position and experience in the Arab homeland. I also believe that he will find us cooperating with him. We are confident that he is the man for such a mission. [Tannuri] Is it possible to return to the subject of unity once again? [Al-Bid] All issues are open for discussion. We declared the Democratic Republic of Yemen. The bases on which this republic is established are known. The important thing now is to talk about stopping the fighting. We can then discuss any other topic. [Tannuri] How did you receive the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] statement regarding Yemen? [Al-Bid] We believe that this is the result of the status quo. Our relations with the GCC and with all the Arab countries and the rest of the world are old relations going back a quarter of a century. The transitional period during which we earnestly tried to move toward unity is a period of a break in relations that was not successful as a result of obstacles imposed by the kind of thinking that interprets unity as control and hegemony. It was a period of our estrangement from the rest of the world. However, we believe that the statement is a good statement. We expect more serious steps to be taken after this. [end recording]
