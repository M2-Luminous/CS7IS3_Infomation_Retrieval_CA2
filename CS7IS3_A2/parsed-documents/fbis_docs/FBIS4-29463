FBIS4-29463 "dreas118__a94012" FBIS-EAS-94-118-A Daily Report 19 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan U.S. Taps Government on TMD System Development U.S. Taps Government on TMD System Development OW2006101094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 19 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2006101094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] On 18 June it was revealed that, Washington unofficially sounded Tokyo out about the possibility of jointly developing a Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system, by specifically presenting areas of cooperation including downsizing of a mobile launching device. The United States has shown strong interest in developing the system using Japan's civilian-product technology. The recent revelation makes it clear that Washington gives importance to "realizing technical cooperation" in the Japan-U.S. TMD system talks. Defending the nation from ballistic missile attacks has been argued about in the current Diet session in connection with the tense situation in North Korea. Thus, how the TMD talks develop from now on will draw the attention of various sectors. The TMD system was devised to counter ballistic missile attacks. It is composed of Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missiles, a control system, a space-based censor, and other devices. Talks on the TMD system have been promoted by a working-level task force established by Japan and the United States. As "an example of Japan-U.S. cooperation," Washington unofficially proposed joint development of a compact, mobile launching device by using Japan's civilian-product technology and parts. Washington also referred to the possibility of using Japanese- made composite materials to reduce the weight of missiles so their range will be improved. Moreover, it sounded Tokyo out about the possibility of exchanging techniques in such areas as optical electronics technology, which is needed for developing a guidance system, and technology for the production of electronic equipment and radar circuits. At the ministerial-level talks on Japan-U.S. security (called the 2+2 meeting) held in March, then Defense Director General Kazuo Aichi commented on Japan's cooperation in developing the TMD system, saying: "I am thinking about clearly stating that the government will study this when it reviews the national defense program guidelines." There are growing voices within the government that while keeping an eye on North Korea, Japan should actively work to establish an air defense system against missile attacks, which is a "blind spot" in Japan's defense buildup.
