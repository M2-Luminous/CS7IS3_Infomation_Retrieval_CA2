Interestingly enough, several congressmen changed their minds following an intense diplomatic effort by de Greiff. Despite his temper and nature, lately de Greiff has been tapping his diplomatic skills. First, he used his new talent on U.S. Senator John Kerry, who had criticized him harshly. De Greiff's telephone conversations with Kerry 15 days ago had such an effect that Kerry is considering coming to Colombia at de Greiff's invitation for a closer examination of the fight against the drug cartels. However, de Greiff went even further. De Greiff began contacts with U.S. judicial authorities, including U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, whose reaction to de Greiff's endeavor is not yet known. The "Seven O'Clock Newscast" learned de Greiff has claimed that his views regarding drug legalization are purely academic and do not jeopardize the Colombian Government's policies. However, the Prosecutor General's Office and the government expect, as proof of its good relations with the U.S. Government, the prompt dispatch of evidence linking confessed drug-trafficker Ivan Urdinola with a case being currently reviewed in a Florida court implicating him with the trafficking of heroin in the United States. Twelve persons have been detained in Colombia and the United States in connection with this case.
