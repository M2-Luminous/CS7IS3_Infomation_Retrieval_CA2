ATTN USVIENNA FOR IAEA FBIS TRENDS-DPRK-ROK-U.S. North Accepts South's Call for Talks on Inter-Korean Summit North Accepts South's Call for Talks on Inter-Korean Summit SUMMARY In a move clearly designed to defuse the current crisis over the nuclear issue, Pyongyang has accepted Seoul's proposal to hold a vice premier level meeting next week to prepare for an inter- Korean summit. Although Pyongyang media portrayed in a positive light former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's recent visit--at which North Korean President Kim Il-song broached the proposal for a North-South summit--North Korean media have not acknowledged foreign reporting that it was Kim who initiated the current move toward an inter-Korean summit during Mr. Carter's visit. END SUMMARY Pyongyang's acceptance, which came in a 22 June "telephone message" from Premier Kang Song-san to ROK Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok (Pyongyang radio, 22 June), seemed calculated to project an image of sincerity. In a departure from the longstanding inter-Korean practice of counterproposing sundry amendments to the other side's proposal, Kang said that the North Korean delegation will be headed by "an official of a vice-premier level" and that it will be at Panmunjom on 28 June, as suggested by the South. Eschewing snide remarks that often marked Pyongyang's past communication to Seoul (SEE NOTE), Kang "welcomed" the South's "readiness" to hold a summit. (NOTE: For instance, in a 6 September 1993 telephone message on the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys, Kang told his Southern counterpart that it was fortunate that the South, "although belatedly," came to an "understanding of the true meaning" of envoy exchange (Pyongyang radio).) Justification for Shift Kang sought to justify the abrupt turnabout in North Korean policy--from the months-long vilification of ROK President Kim.Yong-nam as a "traitor" to Kim's acceptance by Pyongyang as a dialogue partner of "the Great Leader"--by essentially denying that there has been any change. Ignoring the fact that Seoul's call for the preparatory talks was in response to Kim Il-song's reported initiative, Kang depicted the South Korean proposal as in conformity with the North's long- standing and "consistent" policy of seeking to "remove distrust and confrontation" between the two halves of Korea through summit talks. Appealing to the nationalistic aspirations of South Koreans, Kang reiterated Pyongyang's call to achieve "independent" national reunification "without relying on outside forces." He did not acknowledge the go-between role reportedly played by former U.S. President Carter. Carter Visit Pyongyang's treatment of the former President's 15-18 June visit seemed designed to show that, despite its confrontational behavior in recent weeks, North Korea still hopes to salvage its relations with the United States. While President Kim Il-song's talks with Mr. Carter were routinely reported to have held in a "sincere" and "warm" atmosphere (Pyongyang radio, 16 June, KCNA, 17 June), Kim, in a gesture reserved only for the most distinguished of foreign visitors, personally accompanied the former President on a visit to one of the country's "gigantic" construction projects (KCNA, 17 June). Pyongyang radio also portrayed North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam as being upbeat about the prospects for improved relations, quoting him as describing Mr. Carter's "extraordinary visit" as a possible beginning of a "gradual" process of turning the current "distrust and hostility" between the two countries into "good-neighborliness, friendship, and mutual respect." The radio also quoted Foreign Minister Kim as stating that all U.S.- North Korean problems, including the nuclear issue, can be solved if the United States respects North Korea's "sovereignty" (16 June). In a further indication of North Korean interest in using the visit to play up the prospects for improved relations with Washington, Pyongyang radio also reported approvingly, and in considerable detail, Mr. Carter's comments--made at a post-visit press conference in Panmunjom--calling for the establishment of "full relations" between the United States and North Korea. It cited the former President as saying that despite "differences of opinion" between the two countries, outstanding issues can be resolved through "direct talks." In addition, the radio cited him as predicting that the nuclear issue will be resolved "smoothly" (18 June). Implications Pyongyang's willingness to forego polemics with the South over the summit issue--at least initially--points up the alarm with which it apparently views the current crisis. Similarly, North Korean media's upbeat portrayal of Mr. Carter's visit appears to reflect the North Korean leadership's eagerness to avoid a showdown with the United States and the international community.
