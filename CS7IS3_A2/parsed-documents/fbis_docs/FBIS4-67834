How To Cover It?'' --first paragraph published in boldface] [Text] On 7 and 8 April, the conference ``The Road Toward a Nonnuclear Future; Ecological Problems of Ukraine's Nonnuclear Status and Human Psychology'' was held in Kiev in the Ukrainian Building for Economic and Scientific and Technological Knowledge. The conference was largely sponsored by the Global and Regional Security Institute. The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Machine Building, Military-Industrial Complex, and Conversion organized it. Vice prime minister Valeriy Shmarov, who opened the conference, made the following comment upon the fact: ``The Ministry of Defense is interested in new scientific developments as a consumer. The Ministry of Machine Building -- as a contractor....'' Regarding scientists, they also tried to specify their role in the future nuclear conversion and asked how long the information (partially published in the foreign press) that is essential for their elaborations, will be withheld from them. To this Shmarov replied: Foreign journalists know how to work and the always obtain the necessary information. However, this strictly practical question sounded very routine against the background of the issues that were discussed at the esteemed academic gathering. Namely: political and legal aspects of nuclear disarmament; the development of programs for destroying nuclear missile weapons and ecological and economic problems of their implementation; how to prevent the spread of radiation through subsurface water; the safety of the population residing near potentially hazardous facilities; the psychological syndrome that may afflict the liquidators of the accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant in the future; social guarantees for servicemen from those military formations that will be disbanded. With regard to the latter, vice premier Shmarov said this: Seventy-five percent of all the capital allocated for the disarmament program (according to some tentative estimates, it is $2.5 billion -- N. F.), will, in all probability, be spent on the social protection of servicemen dismissed from military service, on finding new working places for unique specialists, and on reprofiling. Incidentally, on this particular issue, no common language was found with the U.S. side. A considerable sum is also allocated for ensuring ecological aspects of nuclear disarmament. In the opinion of the majority of speakers, Ukraine must abandon the idea of accumulating nuclear waste on its territory and utilizing (which is extremely expensive) the radioactive fuel in the hope to later emerge onto the international market with newly produced uranium, something upon which some specialists insist. All the more so since this will be difficult to accomplish in the near future. In the next 15 years, Russia will supply uranium to the United States (500 tonnes, in accordance with an agreement). The conference, which was prepared at the highest level and at which interesting and, the main thing, realistic reports were delivered, proved that Ukraine has a chance to cover that road toward a nonnuclear future, but there will be many problems and shocks on that road.
