FBIS3-30131 "dreas038__a94005" FBIS-EAS-94-038-A Document Type:Daily Report 25 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo Rebuffs U.S. Request on Plutonium Video OW2502002494 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 22 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 27 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2502002494 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] It has been learned that U.S. Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary has sent a letter to the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Corporation [PRNFC] regarding a video which the organization produced to promote the use of plutonium as nuclear fuel, according to information received by the Citizen's Nuclear Information Center from a U.S. civic group on 21 February. In the promotional video entitled "The Plutonium Story: Pluto-Boy, Our Reliable Friend," there is a scene where an animated character representing a little boy drinks water containing plutonium. In her letter, O'Leary has urged the PRNFC to withdraw its videotapes. The PRNFC has admitted receiving the letter. The PRNFC produced 200 videotapes last spring to publicize the current situation regarding its use of plutonium as nuclear fuel. In the video, an animated character called "Pluto-Boy" appears and explains the harmlessness of plutonium. There is a scene where Pluto-Boy drinks water containing plutonium, saying that "even if plutonium is ingested along with water, the body discharges it, hardly absorbing any of it." O'Leary sent a letter dated 7 February to Takao Ishiwatari, president of the PRNFC, urging him to consider withdrawing the videotapes. In the letter, O'Leary said: "There have been reports (about the videotapes) in many U.S. newspapers. To say that it is safe to drink water containing plutonium is a gross underestimation of the dangers of plutonium. It is potentially dangerous, even in very small amounts, whether it is ingested or inhaled. It is urged that an advertisement be produced to publicize that strong measures are being taken to prevent the release of plutonium into the environment, instead of an advertisement that may mislead the public about the dangers of plutonium." In response, a spokesman for the PRNFC said: "It is known that plutonium is discharged from the body even when ingested, and there are hardly any effects of its radiation on the body. Details of the videotapes are accurate, and we have no intention of withdrawing them." Experiments with animals have shown that when inhaled in powder form, plutonium adheres to the surface tissue of lungs and bones, leading to cancerous growths. The element is said to have strong radioactive toxicity, with one gram equivalent to the maximum tolerable intake for tens of millions of people in one year.
