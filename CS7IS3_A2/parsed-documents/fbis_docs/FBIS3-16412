On the same day, Gromov put to sea on board anti-submarine ship Admiral Kharlamov to test the crew's combat skills, a navy spokesman told Interfax. In the meantime, his deputy Admiral Igor Kasatonov in an interview with Interfax described the fleet as being Russia's most powerful naval group both operationally and strategically. In his words, it is the Northern Fleet which has most of the country's nuclear-powered submarines carrying nuclear missiles. The admiral said the Fleet was securing Russia's strategic interests in that direction. On the might of the four Russian fleets, Kasatonov said that by far the strongest of them all were the Northern and Pacific Fleets, both of them ocean-going. By contrast, the Baltic and Black Sea Fleets are responsible for carrying out regional tasks, he said.
