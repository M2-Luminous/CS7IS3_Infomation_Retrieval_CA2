For 30 years [French President] Francois Mitterrand and [Socialist Party First Secretary] Michel Rocard have been performing "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" on the Left. For 30 years, misunderstandings have been added to rebuffs, disdain has followed underhand blows. The case of the embargo on arms for Bosnia is merely another episode in a long series. After Michel Rocard backed the stance adopted by Bernard-Henri Levy, Francois Mitterrand forcefully reaffirmed in Wednesday's [25 May] cabinet meeting that he would not accept "sermonizers" on this issue. He added that there was no question of going back on the embargo which reduces the two camps' sources of armaments. Yesterday morning, in an interview granted to five European newspapers, he stressed once again, that this demand had "not been acted on.... I think this is wise." This shows the Elysee's irritation at the Socialist Party [PSF] first secretary, who also expressed his anger: "Have you ever known an embargo to be imposed on the victim? If we cannot protect the Bosnians, they should at least be allowed to defend themselves." In private, Mitterrand asserts that the "Europe Begins at Sarajevo" list is an operation directed by the PSF first secretary or rather by Jean-Paul Huchon, his right-hand man. In reply to those who express surprise at this certainty, the head of state says that this list -- the ultimate sacrilege -- openly attacks the major issue of his seven-year term: France's European policy. Moreover, this initiative "obligingly" displays the split between the original pro-Mitterrand intellectuals and their former champion. At PSF headquarters they are not displeased to see Michel Rocard "finally dissociating himself from the Elysee, which has so far only distinguished itself by its aptitude to cause nuisance." And a jumbled list of examples is given: cohabitation which was "too soft" at the beginning, legislation on citizenship, and the encouragement given to the formation of the Tapie list for the European elections.
