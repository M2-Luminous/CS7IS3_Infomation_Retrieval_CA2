In a speech to the NDP's political club last night, Dr. Wali said that the points of agreement with the opposition leaders were far greater than those of disagreement. He said the dialogue is a good initiative because it has enabled the opposition parties to comprehend the NDP's views. It has also enabled the party's bureau staff to understand the concepts of the opposition party leaders concerning the national dialogue issue. Dr. Wali said that he will meet with the leaders of the Greens Party and the Democratic Unionist Party by the end of this week. Meanwhile, the NDP's bureau staff will meet with the officials in charge of AL-AHRAM's Strategic and Political Studies Center, which is exploring the various opinions about the national dialogue issue.
