"The planes are there, the pilots are there, it is perfectly possible, technically," he told a small group of journalists, saying that UN Security Council Resolution 824 could be invoked, if the "political will" existed. The resolution, agreed on May 6 last year, allows for use of force in case of attacks on UN-designated safe areas in Bosnia, of which Gorazde is one of six. "I have made it known that we should enforce Resolution 824," he said. Leotard said air strikes "are technically feasible, weather permitting," and stressed the importance of "enforcing all resolutions of the UN." Fighting around the eastern Bosnian enclave has killed 64 and left 301 wounded in the last nine days, according to Radio Sarajevo. It said Thursday that Serb forces were regrouping and that fighting was less intense. Earlier Thursday a team of 11 UN observers and liaison officers reached the besieged enclave, after being held up en route by Serb forces at Rogatica, around 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the enclave. U.S. authorities, who have been reluctant to threaten the use of airpower over the situation in Gorazde, said Wednesday that they did not rule out the possibility of air strikes there.
