Mr. Rabin said this during today's cabinet session. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 4 April, in a report by Udi Segal on the cabinet session, adds the following: "Prime Minister Rabin said it will take a miracle to complete the negotiations by the middle of this month. Rabin said there are only six or seven negotiating days until 12 or 13 April -- the no-longer sacred date -- due to Holocaust Day [7 April]. Rabin also denied press reports on 14 April as an alternative option."] Also in the session, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said that Yasir 'Arafat played a constructive role in the contacts involved in resuming the Gaza-Jericho negotiations. Security elements told the minister that 'Arafat's status in the territories is shaky. The government was also told that several mayors in the territories who had been deposed now want to resume office, like newly reappointed Hebron mayor Mustafa al-Natshah. Police Commissioner Rafi Peled said that 90 percent of nationalistic motivated murders of Israelis over the last year were perpetrated by Gaza Strip youths.
