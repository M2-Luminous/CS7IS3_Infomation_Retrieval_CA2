FR940920-2-00064 FR940920-2-00027 E. Domestic Wastes (Discharge 004) Domestic wastes refers to materials discharged from sinks, showers, laundries, safety showers, eyewash stations, and galleys. Because domestic wastes do not contain fecal coliform, chlorination is not required. Floating Solids: Under BCT, EPA is prohibiting the discharge of floating solids. The limitation is included in the offshore oil and gas guidelines (58 FR 12487, March 4, 1993) and is equivalent to the current level of control for sanitary wastes in the previous permits. Visible Foam: Discharges of visible foam are prohibited under BAT in the offshore oil and gas guidelines (58 FR 12487, March 4, 1993). This limitation is equivalent to the current level of control for domestic wastes in existing permits and past practices have not resulted in violations of this limitation. All other domestic waste: This permit includes requirements limiting the discharge of all other domestic waste (garbage) as included in U.S. Coast Guard regulations at 33 CFR part 151. These limitations are a new feature in EPA offshore oil and gas permits for Beaufort and Chukchi Seas operators and reflect the offshore oil and gas effluent guidelines (58 FR 12487, March 4, 1993). The requirements on garbage are currently included in the most recent reissuance of the Western Gulf of Mexico general permit (57 FR 54654, November 19, 1992). As proposed, the reissued permit will prohibit the discharge of garbage including food wastes within 12 nautical miles from nearest land. Comminuted food waste which is able to pass through a screen with a mesh size no larger than 25 mm (approximately 1 inch) may be discharged 12 or more nautical miles from nearest land. Incineration ash and non-plastic clinkers that can pass through a 25 mm mesh screen may be discharged beyond 3 miles from nearest land, otherwise ash and non-plastic clinkers can only be discharged beyond 12 nautical miles from nearest land. Since this BCT limitation already exists in Coast Guard regulations and other NPDES permits, it will not result in any additional compliance cost, or additional non-water quality environmental impacts. There are no incremental costs associated with the limitation. F. Miscellaneous Discharges: Desalination unit wastes (005), blowout preventer fluid (006), boiler blowdown (007), fire control system test water (008), non-contact cooling water (009), uncontaminated ballast water (010), uncontaminated bilge water (011), excess cement slurry (012), and mud, cuttings, and cement at the seafloor (013). No free oil: Region 10 has determined that no free oil shall be discharged. The no free oil limitation is Region 10's best professional judgement determination of BPT controls for these discharges. Compliance with the free oil limitation for miscellaneous discharges will be by visual observation for a sheen on the receiving water, except for bilge water under the conditions described below. All of these discharges have been subject to this limitation in the previous permits issued by Region 10 and past practices have not resulted in violations of this limit. G. Discharge 014 (Test Fluids) Limited volumes of formation waters which are encountered during testing of the well are authorized for discharge as test fluids. Formation waters are encountered during well testing and are similar in composition to produced waters. Free oil: As previously discussed, no discharge of free oil is permitted from discharges authorized by this permit. In previous general permits, Region 10 has determined that the BCT effluent limitations guideline of no discharge of free oil from the discharge of deck drainage, drilling muds, drill cuttings, and well treatment fluids should apply to other discharges, including test fluids. The no free oil limitation is Region 10's best professional judgement determination of BCT controls for the test fluids discharge. Operators have been subject to a no free oil limitation in previous permits issued by Region 10, and past practices have not resulted in violations of this limitation. In accordance with Section 308, the Static Sheen Test will be required for the monitoring of test fluids. Oil and grease: Although oil and grease is a conventional pollutant subject to BCT, it also serves as BAT (i.e., as an indicator of toxic pollutants) for produced water. Specifically, the toxic pollutants which are controlled by limiting oil and grease include phenol, naphthalene, ethylbenzene, and toluene (U.S. EPA 1993a). EPA has determined that it is not technically feasible to control these toxic pollutants individually so that the limitation on oil and grease controls discharge these pollutants in produced water at the BAT level (U.S. EPA 1993a). The promulgated BAT for oil and grease in produced water as 29 mg/l monthly average and 42 mg/l daily maximum based upon the improved operating performance of gas flotation technology (58 FR 12506, March 4, 1993). Based upon the chemical similarity of test fluids and produced water, Region 10 Agency has determined that it is reasonable to apply the produced water provisions to test fluids. Accordingly, the proposed permit limits on oil and grease in test fluids are 29 mg/l monthly average and 42 mg/l daily maximum. pH: The pH of discharged test fluids (which may have a substantially different pH from that of the ambient receiving water) has been limited to a range of 6.5&hyph;8.5 at the point of discharge. In Region 10's best professional judgement, this limitation appropriately equals a BPT level of control. No more stringent standard has been identified by the Region at this time. Therefore, Region 10 is setting a BCT effluent limitation for the pH of test fluids equal to that of BPT. This limitation will ensure that pH changes greater than 0.2 pH unit will not occur beyond the edge of the 100-meter mixing zone [40 CFR ยง125.121(c)]. This requirement has been and is routinely complied with by operations under previous BPT permits and thus, reflects no cost incremental to BPT.
