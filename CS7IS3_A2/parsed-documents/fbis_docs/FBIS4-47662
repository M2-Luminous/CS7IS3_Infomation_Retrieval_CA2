That the massacres currently going on in Rwanda are designed to exterminate a certain section of the population of this country. The massacres are carried out by a clique of murderers constituted of extreme groups like the Presidential Guard, the CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic], MRND [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development] militias and some elements in the government army. In less than three weeks, since the accident of the 6th April 1994, the murderous clique has killed more than 200,000 people of different ethnic groups. 2. That the massacres have been long planned by the high-ranking government officials of the then Habyarimana government, the training and arming of CDR and MRND militias were clear signs of the plan. This plan was known by people inside and outside the country even before the signing of the Arusha peace agreement. 3. That during the Arusha peace negotiations the extremist clique was busy [words indistinct] confusing innocent citizens as the murderous group was busy planning activities, including the restoration of radio [word indistinct] for propaganda purposes. At the same time, the group was making it impossible for the setting up of the broad-based transitional institutions (?agreed on under) the Arusha agreement. 4. The RPF appeals to all countries that have been following and are assisting to carry out the Arusha peace negotiations to condemn openly and without reservations the massacres in Rwanda and to refrain from giving any attention or assistance to the self-imposed [break in transmission] instead, such countries should give assistance to the (?threatened) innocent people. 5. The RPF has noted that some countries and nongovernmental organizations have already given assistance to the victims of war. Some others have not. It is sad to note that the French Government has (?responded) and given audience to the self-imposed government in Rwanda. Does this mean that the French Government is supporting the killing done in Rwanda, and by the people who make up this government? 6. The RPF wishes to remind the international community of the following: a. That the international community has obligations and responsibilities toward human beings and life should not be destroyed to this extent while the international community keeps quiet about it; b. the RPF condemns any country or organization that [words indistinct] or recognition to the self-imposed government in Rwanda and condemns anything done by any country to promote the interests of this government as regards international relations; c. The RPF appeals to the international community to dissassociate themselves from this government and even to extend asylum to those who took part in the killings [as heard]; d. The RPF requests the international community not to lose hope because of the open threat that the killers will continue to murder and kidnap people; e. the RPF wishes to extend its sincere thanks and appreciation to all countries, international organizations and individuals who have shown concern for the plight of the Rwandese people during these difficult times. Done at Mulindi this 30th day of April 1994. Signed by Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, chairman of the RPF.
