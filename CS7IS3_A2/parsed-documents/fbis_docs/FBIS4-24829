I feel very uneasy. The party and the people have entrusted me with a very heavy task. They have not only shown great confidence in me but also entrusted me with heavy responsibility and set higher demands on me. I deeply feel the heavy responsibility and big pressure on me. In my case, although I have been trained and educated by the party for many years and successively assumed leadership work in townships, counties, prefectures, cities, and the province with the help and support of the veteran comrades, and have gained understandings in the work of the grass roots and some aspects, however, measuring the requirements of this post, my practical experience, organizational ability, and leadership level still fall short of the requirements. I am afraid that I may create great losses to the party's cause and disappoint the expectations of the party and the people. If my nomination to the posts is approved, all I can do is to pluck up my courage, undertake the heavy tasks, and try my utmost to do the work well. Under the leadership of the provincial party committee and through the efforts of the past leading bodies and the masses of cadres, our province has achieved fairly big progress in reform, opening up, economic construction, and social undertakings, laying a foundation for future work. In spite of the fact that Heilongjiang is now facing some practical problems and difficulties in economic development, however, it has its own distinctive advantages and tremendous potentials. If I am approved to be the acting governor by this people's congress standing committee meeting, I have the determination to work together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and cadres at all levels across the province to conscientiously implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee under the leadership of the provincial party committee, the supervision of the people's congress and its standing committee, act in line with the 20-character policy of the Party Central committee and the overall objective on reform, development and stability defined by the second plenary session of the seventh provincial party committee and the second session of the eighth provincial people's congress early this year, carry out all sorts of major measures in a down-to-earth manner, and comprehensively fulfill this year's various work tasks. At present, we should look squarely at the problems and difficulties in front of us and recognize the good opportunity we may meet. Thanks to the endeavors of the party committee, the provincial government and all sectors, Heilongjiang's problems and difficulties have been comprehended and taken seriously by the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Entrusted by Comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji has led responsible comrades of the relevant departments of the State Council to our province to conduct investigation and study and help us solve problems. This is a major opportunity for our province's reform, opening up, and economic development. We should treasure this opportunity, firmly grasp it, expand the dynamic of our work, and push our future work to a new height. The key to solving our province's problems on the way of advance is to push economic development forward. Therefore, as far as we are concerned, under the situation in which the state has helped us solve some problems, it is very important for us to change concepts, keep our eyes inward and rely on our own efforts to become strong. It is necessary to give full play to our province's natural resources, trained personnel, and industrial advantages, base on ourselves and rely on our own efforts to overcome difficulties, and through solid and effective work, translate the factors that currently restrict the province's development into advantages for invigorating Heilongjiang. In line with the ideas of "five extensions and two accelerations," we should grasp well the development and construction of major projects, cultivate and develop new economic growing points, and strengthen the staying force for the national economy. Through reform, transformation, opening up, and development, we should promote state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises to change mechanisms and enhance their vitality and strength. We should consolidate agriculture, the foundation of the national economy, and vigorously increase the comprehensive economic results of agriculture. While making contributions to the state, we should further achieve development; earnestly enforce the strategy of having science and education make the province prosperous; promote the scientific and technological progress; do a good job in the work of personnel affairs; and upgrade the economic quality of the province as a whole. Only by firmly fostering the unswerving and persistent belief and determination of waging arduous struggle can we fully discern that the current difficulties are just the temporary ones cropping up along the advancing road and are possible to overcome. Thus, the province's prosperity and development will certainly be very hopeful as long as we heighten our spirit, make concerted efforts, unite as one, go all out to make the province strong, refrain from engaging in myopic behavior for a single day, and engage in our work in a down-to-earth manner for several years by displaying the indomitable spirit and will. In order to fulfill these duties and to do a good job in the government work, the acting governor expressed in his report that he is ready to make efforts in the following five aspects after the repeated meditation: First, the government work should be strictly placed under the leadership of the provincial party committee and under the supervision of the provincial people's congress and its standing committee. The linking of work and contacts with the provincial Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] committee and various democratic parties should be positively enhanced. The provincial people's government should closely rely on the leadership of the provincial party committee. The leading body of the provincial people's government should set an example in earnestly implementing the arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the provincial party committee, and vigorously enable the work of the government and various departments to embody the demands set in the party's basic line. As for important and major policy decisions and measures that have a bearing on reform, opening up, economic development, and social stability, it is necessary to report them to the provincial party committee in a timely manner and to ask for instruction. The provincial people's government should unswervingly implement the guidelines, policies, and work arrangements defined by the provincial party committee. By effectively conducting our work, we should ensure the down-to-earth implementation of these guidelines, policies, and arrangements and score results in the implementation. All personnel from acting governor himself to the leading cadres and staff members of units under the provincial people's government should strengthen their sense of responsibility to the party and their sense of organization and discipline and act in unison with the CPC Central Committee in ideology and action. In line with the provisions set in the Constitution and the local organizational law, we should actively report our work to the people's congress and its standing committee and fully respect the power and duties imposed by the law on the people's congress and its standing committee. We should also earnestly implement the decisions, resolutions, and local regulations and rules adopted by the people's congress and consciously accept the congress' supervision. These decisions, resolutions, and local regulations and rules are legally authentic and are important basis for standardizing the government conduct. The provincial people's government and its subordinate departments should earnestly implement these decisions, resolutions, and local regulations and rules and actively put forward legal motions in the course of establishing the law systems of socialist market economy so as to gradually orient the government work onto the track of legal systems. Efforts should be made to enhance the sense of democracy and legal systems; to do things strictly according to the law; to perform the administrative duties in line with the law; and to persistently take the lead in studying, enforcing, and abiding by the law. We should consciously accept the inspection conducted by the deputies of the people's congress over the government work. As for the criticism, opinions, and suggestions raised by the deputies of the people's congress and by the special committees under the people's congress, we should earnestly discuss and handle them and embody them into our practical work so as to use them to promote and improve the government work. Governments should even more actively enhance their linking work with the provincial CPPCC committee and various democratic parties and fully attach importance on the role played by them in participating in and discussing government and political affairs and in conducting political consultation and democratic supervision. We should report in a timely manner the situation prevailing in the important and major issues to them and earnestly listen to their opinions and suggestions relating to the government work, economic construction, and social undertakings. Second, we should make concerted efforts, advance in a united way, and bring into full play the overall functions of the ordinary personnel of the provincial government. We should further unify our thinking to lay a good ideological foundation for bringing into play the overall functions of the ordinary personnel of the provincial government. We should conscientiously study the basic line of the party and a series of principles and policies, conscientiously implement the important arrangements made by the party Central Committee and the State Council and the guidelines of the important instructions on the work of Heilongjiang made by the leading comrades of the central authorities, and reach common understanding on a series of major issues. My own ability and energy are limited. We should rely on the wisdom and forces of the collectives, conscientiously listen to the people's opinions when making policy decisions on major issues, carry forward democracy, pool the wisdom and efforts of the people, mobilize the enthusiasm of ordinary personnel, bring into full play the advantages of the whole, and strive to make policy decisions more democratic and scientific. According to the principles of democratic centralism and of linking responsibilities with rights, each and every government leading member and each and every functional department should bring its functions into play in dealing with the routine work of the government; and assume responsibility for its work, its own rights, and fulfill its duty according to the principle of division of work. It is necessary to strictly perfect a system of responsibility for fulfillment of assigned work, intensify a mechanism for grasping the fulfillment of work, and bring into play the main functions of leading bodies and all departments under the governments. It is necessary to further perfect and intensify the system of chiefs assuming responsibility for major work and the leadership responsibility system among each level. We should adopt effective measures to ensure that the government work is under normal and orderly operation so as to make the ordinary personnel of the governments work with one heart and soul and do solid work and to promote the progress of the economic and social undertakings. Third, we should persist in the mass viewpoint and rely on and serve the people wholeheartedly. The mass viewpoint is not only a requirement for the work line of the party but also a decision made according to the purpose of the party. So, we should firmly foster the mass viewpoint and regard wholeheartedly relying on and serving the people as a point to start with and conclude the government work. We should strive to mobilize the masses' enthusiasm for reform and development and fully believe and rely on the masses to rise over various difficulties cropping up in the course of advance. The government should regularly accept the supervision by the broad masses of the people so as to make the government work more visible to the public and to enjoy the understanding and support of the masses. The major policy decisions on reform and development should be passed to the masses for discussions. We should fully listen to the voices of the masses, respect the experiences gained by the masses through practice and their pioneering spirit, and embody their aspirations. We should go all out to do solid work for the masses and always be concerned with the weal and woe of the people. At present, we should pay particular attention to the issues relating to price hikes, help the enterprises in danger and those with difficulties solve their problems, and solve the production and living problems of the poverty-stricken rural areas. We should positively and conscientiously handle the affairs that are in keeping with the interests of the people and resolutely refuse to do the things that go against the personal interests of the people so as to make the government work and all policy decisions reflect and fall in with the will of the people. Fourth, we should study hard to ceaselessly upgrade the leadership level and the ability in controlling the overall situation. I profoundly know that Job himself does not entrust abilities of man. Even now as I take on the post of acting governor, this does not mean my work abilities suit the work requirements. There must be a process of improvement. An important task ahead of me at present is to study again. I have to learn from books and mainly study the basic principles of Marxism, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the theory on socialist market economy. Simultaneously, I should also learn modern scientific and technological knowledge and modern economic, social, and administrative management methods; ceaselessly widen my own knowledge fields and upgrade my leadership abilities. We should learn from practice, regularly go down to the grass-roots units, pay attention to investigation and study, discover the new situation and study new problems in a timely manner, and sum up the experiences created by the grass-roots units and the broad masses of people so as to enrich ourselves and to guide our work. It is necessary to learn from veteran leaders and comrades. These veteran comrades have engaged in leadership work for many years and accumulated many practical experiences. They gave us lots of help in the past. I am willing to and earnestly hope that these veteran leaders and comrades will continue to offer views and suggestions for me and for the government work and enable us to avoid detours and mistakes. Fifth, we should perform the government work honestly and diligently, do practical work, and enhance the cohesion of the government. "One who is just will do things uprightly and one who is clean and honest will enjoy high prestige." I deeply feel that only a clean and honest government can enjoy prestige and have cohesion. I will start with this way of doing things myself, set strict norms to keep my own conduct within proper bounds in line with the central demands, and never abuse my own power to seek personal gain or do things to harm the image of the party. Meanwhile, I will pay attention to educating my family members, children, and the functionaries around me. And on this basis, I will work together with all of you to grasp administrative honesty and diligence in the government and its subordinate units. I will uphold the principle of taking a two-handed approach in work and be tough with both, and while concentrating efforts on grasping material civilization, exert efforts to grasp the spiritual civilization. In economic activities and our routine work, I will always attach importance to the people's ideological and political work and actively promote the spirit of building our country by means of thrift and hard work, giving consideration to the overall situation, maintaining unity and cooperation, performing official work diligently, cherishing the people, and being eager to make dedications among the broad masses of cadres and the people. I will resolutely struggle against all sorts of corrupt phenomena, never avoid contradictions, never tolerate or yield to the evil, and realistically check the unhealthy trends existing in major trades and important departments that seriously affect the relationship between the government and the masses. Meanwhile, I will strengthen comprehensive management of public security, deal strict blows to all sorts of criminal activities, and maintain social stability. As the saying goes, diligence can make up for one's unskillfulness. Although my ability and level are limited, I will strive to handle the government work diligently, exert my utmost efforts, and devote more time and energy to managing each and every work well in order to make up for the deficiencies in my ability level. I will exercise strict self-discipline by using the tenet of being realistic in ideology and practical in work style and doing solid work and concentrate the major energy and attention on solving practical problems that affect the overall situation. As long as the work style of working hard and being steadfast in work and plain in living is formed and maintained in the government and its functionaries, the government will surely become one enjoying trust from the people and support from the masses. Chairman, fellow vice chairmen, secretary general, and all committee members, I heartily thank the chairmanship meeting of the provincial people's congress standing committee for nominating me as the candidate for acting governor. If my appointment has been approved, I will act according to my report, match my words with my deeds, perform my duties well, speak less and work more, and undertake this historical heavy task with untiring efforts. If my appointment has been declined, I will continue to work hard as before, and will not disappoint your great expectations on me. Thank your very much.
