Bacongo, an opposition stronghold, has been the scene of repeated fighting since November, when Lissouba ordered a crackdown on "brigands" among the opposition. Lissouba's opponents were excluded from parliamentary bodies created last June, and fresh elections in October failed to resolve the situation. Government troops in armoured vehicles used heavy weaponry against opposition supporters in the same districts on Thursday and Friday when they came under machine gun fire, witnesses said. The shelling had died down Sunday morning, but there were still bursts of fire from machine pistols in the Makele-Kele district.
