Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman told A.A. [ANATOLIA] that reports that a group of Westerners was detained was untrue. Earlier in the day, Reuters news agency said security forces in southeast Turkey detained seven [words indistinct] activists on Tuesday [words indistinct]. But Ataman said the group had not been detained, but willingly stayed overnight at a state guest house to await an escort deemed necessary for their onward journey to Siirt, a town in southeastern Turkey. An official from the British Embassy in Ankara also denied allegations of detainment. The seven Westerners were three Britons, one New Zealander and three Irish nationals. Turkish officials have accused a number of Western press organizations of deliberately distorting news stories, particularly those about the situation in the southeast, so as to disrupt Turkey's human rights image. The Government Press Office has told foreign journalists in the southeast they should not engage in activities likely to be construed as provocative or unprofessional. Earlier on Wednesday, Ataman told reporters: "Certain groups with self-conferred observer duty are making use of the freedom and democracy in our country to indulge in subversive activity. ``Unfortunately they include certain press groups which disseminate false news by provocation, prejudice and distortion.''
