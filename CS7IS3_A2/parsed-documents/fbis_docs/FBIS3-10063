The minister clarified the main doubts about the new index, emphasizing that financial investment and savings will remain unchanged: [Begin Cardoso recording] We were careful to guarantee that savings account owners and those who have invested their money will have nothing to fear. Nothing at all has changed. This is an old promise. We will not confiscate savings accounts, freeze salaries, or freeze the funds of workers, housewives, or anybody else. We will not do anything to disturb the Brazilian people's routine lives. [end recording] Interest rates: [Begin Cardoso recording] The trend of the program is to make interest rates drop, as the program has been designed to deflate the economy and produce a currency with real value. Interest rates will then stand at a normal level. From the beginning of this process nominal interest rates will drop. [end recording] New contracts: [Begin Cardoso recording] New contracts will be based entirely in URV's [real value units]. Yet this will not be enforced immediately, in order to let people become accustomed to it over a period of 15 days, so as to learn how it operates. After this period the standard will be the URV -- that is, a fixed, stable standard. This will remain valid for one year. Contracts may not have adjustment clauses. As for old contracts, it will depend on what the contracting sides want. There will be time to agree to new terms. [end recording] Installments paid by home buyers: [Begin Cardoso recording] They will remain unchanged until further notice. There is no reason for any concern about it. Installments will be paid in real cruzeiros, based on the old rules. [end recording] Health plans: [Begin Cardoso recording] We expect that terms will be renegotiated. It will be more advantageous, because contracts can be for one year, as I said here, in URV's. It will be more practical, and if there is any problem we will solve it. [end recording] Credit cards: [Begin Cardoso recording] There will be no modifications. Everything will remain unchanged. [end recording] Purchases on credit: [Begin Cardoso recording] There will be no devaluation scale whatsoever. New contracts on credit will be specified in URV's. We will respect the terms of old contracts. [end recording] Postdated checks: [Begin Cardoso recording] They will be honored. Now, as we reach the time for implementation of the URV, we will give the rules. In any event, postdated checks will be honored. [end recording] Minimum salary: [Begin Cardoso recording] The previous law set the minimum salary at 55,500 cruzeiros, as I have just said. Well, if a person collects a minimum salary on the fifth working day of the following month, the URV conversion will make him collect 62,800 cruzeiros. If a retired worker were to collect 55,537 cruzeiros, which is the minimum salary under the old law, under the terms of the new law he will collect 70,600 cruzeiros. The important thing is this comparison in cruzeiros, right? The URV, as we said, is approximately equivalent to one dollar. One dollar, one URV, right? Therefore, in dollars, if the URV is compared to the dollar, the result will be of approximately $64. But this amount, the day it is collected, in cruzeiros, will be much more valuable than on the first day of the month. This is the difference, and this is the real gain for workers. [end recording] Past losses: [Begin Cardoso recording] I don't know what past losses are all about. Things will depend on the calculation method. From now on, negotiations will be free. The government did not order any constraint; it is not forbidding negotiations with unions, with employers. Therefore, if there is any loss that was not caused by this law, negotiations will continue the way they were being implemented, and compensations will be agreed upon on the collective agreement renewal date. Yet this will the last time, because from then on there will be no losses, because of what I said -- that if prices go up, salaries will also immediately go up, because of the three indexes that I mentioned here. Consequently, I do not know whether there will be actually any losses. For example, in the case of public workers, in order to avoid additional complications we granted a bond for February, which was included in the basis for calculation of their salaries. Therefore, if the inflation rate were 40 percent in March, public servants will not lose anything, not even in March. In April, when public servant salaries would not be adjusted, they will be adjusted for inflation, by whatever rate, 40, 35, or 30 percent, whatever the rate.... This law is actually much better.
