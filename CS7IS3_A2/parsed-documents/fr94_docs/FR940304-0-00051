FR940304-0-00051 FR940304-0-00016 Administration for Children and Families 45 CFR Part 233 Aid to Families With Dependent Children Increase in Stepparent Income Disregard AGENCY: Administration for Children and Families (ACF), HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule implements the change in the stepparent earned income disregards for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program as provided under section 13742 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993. This provision increases the stepparent earned income disregard from $75 to $90. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Mack A. Storrs, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Family Assistance, Fifth Floor, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., Washington, DC 20447, telephone (202) 401&hyph;9289. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Discussion of Rule Provision Pursuant to section 402(a)(31) of the Social Security Act (the Act) the income of an AFDC dependent child's stepparent who lives in the same home as the child is counted in the monthly determination of eligibility and the amount of assistance. This provision is applied in States that do not have laws of general applicability holding a stepparent legally responsible to the same extent as a natural or adoptive parent. Section 402(a)(31) also provides for the disregard of certain portions of the stepparent's income in determining the amount to be counted, including the first $75 of the stepparent's monthly earned income. Effective October 1, 1989, Public Law 100&hyph;485 amended section 402(a)(8)(ii) of the Act by increasing the standard work expense disregard for AFDC applicants and recipients from $75 to $90. However, it did not increase the comparable $75 earned income disregard for stepparents. Thus, to be consistent, section 13742 of Public Law 103&hyph;66, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993, amended section 402(a)(31)(A) of the Act by increasing the earned income disregard for stepparents from $75 to $90 per month. We have amended ยง233.20(a)(3)(xiv)(A) to reflect this statutory change. Regulatory Procedures Justification for Dispensing With Notice of Proposed Rulemaking The amendment to this regulation is being published as a final rule. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), provides that, if the Department for good cause finds the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is unnecessary, impractical or contrary to the public interest, it may dispense with such notice if it incorporates a brief statement of the reasons for doing so in the rules issued. The Department finds that there is good cause to dispense with a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with respect to this change. Publication of this rule in proposed form would be unnecessary as the change simply implements the statutory provision and does not involve administrative discretion. Executive Order 12866 Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that this rule is consistent with these priorities and principles. This rule has no costs and merely conforms the codified regulation to the statute.
