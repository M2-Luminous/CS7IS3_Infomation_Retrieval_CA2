This was emphasized by Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the great al-Fatih revolution, as soon as Yemeni unity was announced. He was aware of the importance of the achievement and of the dangers which threatened it from imperialist and reactionary forces, lying in wait for the Arab nation. The Great Jamahiriyah's General People's Committee for Unity, proceeding from the sacrosanct unionist ideals of the great al-Fatih revolution and in consecration of the unionist longing of the Libyan Arab people, announced in the document proclaiming the people's authority, to continue the struggle until comprehensive Arab unity is achieved and, in response to the leading role of the leader of the great al-Fatih revolution and his continuous drive to achieve Yemeni unity, reaffirms the need for efforts to be exerted to stop the bloodletting and for recourse to be had to wisdom and dialogue. Based upon unionist legality and the pledge and concord document, efforts should be made to save Yemeni unity, which should be valued as a pan-Arab achievement that must not be abandoned. The General People's Committee for Unity, proceeding from its pan-Arab commitments and in implementation of the basic people's congresses' resolutions, reaffirms the following: 1. Efforts should be exerted to preserve the unity of Yemen, which was the product of the will of the Arab people in Yemen, as a historic achievement of the Arab nation's modern era. 2. The unity of Yemen and its historical borders should be preserved as an inalienable geographical and historical unit, which is an integral part of the pan-Arab entity. 3. An appeal should be made for an end to the fighting and the resumption by brothers, in both Aden and Sanaa, of dialogue, leading to an understanding based upon the terms of the constitution of the unified state and the pledge and concord document. All unionist people in fraternal Yemen shoud be urged to work for such an aim in order to prevent imperialist and reactionary forces -- the enemies of the Arab nation -- from making capital out of this situation. The General People's Committee for Unity, while urging the above, calls upon all the sons of the Arab nation to exert efforts in order to allow united Yemen to remain in its true position in the movement of comprehensive confrontation, which is being waged by the masses of the Arab nation against imperialist schemes aimed at destroying the Arab nation, plundering its resources, and undermining its sovereignty.
