In the past, this guerrilla army mounted numerous offensives to mark the day of its birth and demonstrate its capacity for war. Today, this is a tired army, plagued by confusion and confronting an "enemy" that has firmly established an ascendant moral position. Few, if any, offensives will probably be mounted today. Logistical exhaustion dictates that. More, the guerrillas confront a nearly insurmountable moral wall: Government forces have declared a long unilateral cease fire to mark the Holy Week. The soldiers would rather pray than fight. Last Friday, President Ramos signed the two amnesty proclamations that were being closely studied for two years now. The amnesty program, that shall come into effect as soon as the proclamations are confirmed by Congress, will open the door for six months to all rebels desiring to return to the mainstream. Congressional confirmation is expected to be ministerial. The amnesty program is expected to have most significant effects on the ranks of the NPA. The ideological crisis plaguing the communist movement has diminished the will to fight of many guerrillas. Sen. Blas Ople surmised that the amnesty program, when put into effect, would quickly decimate what remains of the guerrilla "army." A few days earlier, Sen. Rodolfo Biazon went on record calling on the government to break off talks with the exiled Sison-Jalandoni faction of the CPP. That faction has not only become a minority in the movement they purport to lead. It has also proven most reluctant in engaging government peace initiatives. It is not for government to initiate the break-off of talks, contrary to what Biazon suggests. The government enjoys the moral higher ground in the peace process. It does not have to squander that advantage. It is for the other side to carry out their earlier threats and disengage from talks that have not even begun. The exiled Maoist fundamentalist group that claims formal leadership over the fragmented CPP [Communist Party of the Philippines]-NPA has been dodging and feigning for many months now. After government conceded on their demand to meet at Ho Chi Minh City, the Sison-Jalandoni faction demanded that "preliminary" talks be held in Europe before "exploratory" talks are conducted in Vietnam. That particularly crude trick, coming after many prior bluffs, convinced the government that the Sison-Jalandoni group has no intention at all of participating in the peace effort. Some time ago, the exiled fundamentalist group threatened to disengage from the peace process if amnesty is proclaimed. The amnesty proclamation has, apparently, been indicated as the signal to formally disengage. The mere mention of the word "amnesty" drives their most avid local cadres into a frenzy. The choice of disengagement point is rather curious. Amnesty is always a unilateral act on the part of government -- never a negotiated outcome. It is, too, generally considered an act of magnanimity, compassion and humanity. How the CPP is going to turn the amnesty proclamation into a demonic incident, and indication of government's "insincerity" in its pursuit of peace, should be interesting to watch. Lately, Jose Maria Sison has been warning the government not to allow bail for captured CPP leader and Sison rival, Arturo Tabara. The right to bail, if Sison must be reminded, is a basic democratic right. By putting petty party rivalries ahead of basic principles, Sison ends up arguing against the government assuring one of his own comrades due process. It is likely that he will fall into another of his logical contortions arguing that amnesty is a hostile act. The rest of humanity considers amnesty a benevolent gesture. It matters very little at this point if Sison and his loyalists withdraw from the peace process. The prospects for fruitful engagement have been nil from the start. The government, by waiting for so long, has won the higher moral ground. Sison has not only lost much of what is left of the Left, he has also lost credibility long ago. If he takes this benevolent gesture as his excuse for disengagement, he scores no political points. If the prospects for talks with the CPP are completely closed down by that withdrawal, government loses no political points. That is the nature of the dilemma Sison and his loyalists must now deal with in the face of the amnesty proclamation. For the men in the field, the simple men rebelling against real grievances, the amnesty proclamation occasions a fateful decision. They will have six months to decide if the course of "revolutionary" violence that earlier seemed just is worth continuing. There is no debate here about the validity of the grievances that forced many Filipinos to take to the gun. But there is much debate about the wisdom of continuing the carnage. The amnesty program requires, not an organizational decision, but an individual decision on the part of those who found themselves enmeshed in abnormal politics during times of great turbulence. They are offered a backdoor to normal life, freed from legal obligations that they frenzied politics might have caused. As much as the amnesty program is a unilateral decision on the part of government, premised on the higher value of achieving peace at the soonest possible time, the decision to avail of the amnesty package will be an entirely personal one. What matters is that a point of exit is available. If none avails of it, then the act of magnanimity on the part of the government comes to naught. If the dwindling insurgencies evaporate as a consequence of this proclamation, then it will be the sum of personal decisions taken. Very clearly, an amnesty program cannot be the outcome of negotiations between movements and the government. It requires fateful decisions at the personal, existential level.
