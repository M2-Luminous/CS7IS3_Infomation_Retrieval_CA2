Some politicians fear rapprochement with the great Eastern neighbour. Does this correspond to reality? Is it right to use the term "balance of interests" in this case? As is known, politics involves many different aspects: foreign affairs, diplomatic, economic, cultural, humanistic, global, ecological, etc. All these aspects as well as territorial and geographic ones should be balanced. And that is, in my opinion, the major goal of the present Lithuanian government. This is not an easy task for a young diplomacy: even more experienced diplomacies sometimes fail to do it. Although the opposition tries to deny it, I think we have already made some progress in this sphere and, primarily, in reducing political friction with our Eastern neighbours. I mean first of all Russia: we signed about ten agreements during Mr. Chernomyrdin's visit to Lithuania. I also have in mind our relations with Belarus, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan. We hope, the list will be lengthened in future. We have serious interests in the West as well. We have discovered there many new things we didn't know before. But I should say we are also finding the East anew. Previously, we had quite different relations with the Eastern countries since all of us were a part of the Soviet system. At present, we are partners. During the first year after the restoration of Lithuania's independence, political motives predominated in our sphere of interests. At the moment, economic ones seem to have come to the fore. Is this so? That's right. At the beginning of my term in office I was criticized sharply for my emphasis on economic aspects of foreign policy. I still adhere to my previous opinion. We cannot neglect economy in politics. Economy is not a dominating factor in politics but still it plays an important role. I believe Lithuania's trade and other relations with all political partners will further strengthen if nothing happens in future. What do you mean by your last remark? Unfortunately, the situation on the continent is unstable. There are several hotbeds of conflict on it. Didn't you have in mind the economic catastrophe the rightist opposition sometimes forecasts for Lithuania? In my opinion, an economic catastrophe could be caused by a political one in case we decided to resume confrontational policy in the region. I think we have already finished this kind of politics, or, to be more precise, we are out of the era of confrontation. And God forbid to have it back. We should continue the development of civilized relations among countries. Lithuania has large emigre communities scattered all over the world. Could they be the third force in helping us to overcome a political and economic instability? How better could we use their assistance in our foreign affairs and diplomacy? Yes, there are many Lithuanians abroad. We can meet several thousand of them even in Siberia. They found themselves there brought by different causes: deportation, the wish to elude the past, the search for happiness or the whims of fortune. Generally speaking, during the three years of our independence, all the former governments were ineffective in dealing with the issue of Lithuanian expatriates. To tell the truth, personally I was surprised to see unskilled, even adventurously-minded people sometimes with Lithuanian names coming to our country. We were blind enough to treat them as experts. Now we are more careful. On the other hand, Lithuanians abroad and their organizations should be more helpful in nominating people who could be most useful to our state. There are many spheres in which Lithuania lacks experience,for instance, international business relations. There are educated and experienced people among emigrants who could assist us in working more effectively with the World Bank, GATT, the European Community and other worldwide organizations. To find such people is one of our most important tasks. We will use our embassies in solving this problem. We expect Lithuanian communities abroad to be critical and strict in nominating such specialists. The new year of 1994 is approaching. May we hope, that it will be more successful to Lithuanian's diplomacy? If we succeed in maintaining stability in Lithuania and if the international situation is peaceful, Lithuanian diplomacy will be able to advance in firmer steps. We will be more secure... In relations with our neighbours as well? Of course. In the near future, we shall resume negotiations with Poland which were broken off because of elections and formation of the new government there. We are ready to be active. On the whole, I dare evaluate the current international situation positively. The Russian Army has left Lithuania and a psychological atmosphere with our neighbours is friendly. This creates favourable preconditions for economic and other relations. Thank you for your time.
