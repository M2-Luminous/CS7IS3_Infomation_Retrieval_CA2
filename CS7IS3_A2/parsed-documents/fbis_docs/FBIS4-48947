Driven largely by an instinct for survival, Chen Zisheng, now the factory director, recalls that he and his colleagues decided to gamble on making trucks and sewing machines for the civilian market. "It was a last-ditch struggle," he explains. What Chen had no way of knowing then was that he was paving the way for most of the nation's war industry to make the switch from armaments to consumer goods in the changed environment of global detente and the Chinese adoption of a market economy. Jianshe, eventually, was lucky to establish a link with the Japanese motorcycle manufacturer Yamaha, which has been a lucrative partnership for both sides. Yamaha continues to pour big investment into the venture to build new assembly lines turning Jianshe into the country's second biggest motorcycle producer, lagging only behind another Chongqing-based company, Jialing, which was hived off from the Norinco (China North Industries) arms manufacturing group and was able to form a technical cooperation agreement with Honda. Together they produce 1.3 million machines a year, more than a third of China's current output. Jialing alone will be producing one million machines a year by 1997. It is an amazing turnaround for China, given its long obsession with national security and perceived threats from all directions. In order to prepare for national defense in the 1960s, when China seemed to face a threat from the Soviet Union and the United States (plus the U.S.-backed nationalist forces on Taiwan), the best talent, the most advanced technology and equipment, with unlimited funds was concentrating on establishing a complete defense industry in the remote mountainous areas of inland provinces, notably Sichuan, Hunan, Yunnan and Guizhou. Meticulous government planning used to guard military manufacturers from worries such as supply of materials, funds and market conditions. But as the threat of war eased, the central government decided to put an end to the wartime footing of the military in the 1970s, and in the early 1980s to trim one million soldiers from the bloated People's Liberation Army (PLA). Orders for weapons and ammunition fell sharply, and, to survive, much of the defense industry was told to forget the guns and start thinking about producing something more mundane -- like refrigerators and color television sets. The government strategy for the conversion was to set up so- called "window enterprises" in the special economic zones and other experimental coastal economic development zones during the 1980s to introduce foreign technology and capital for the development of a limited range of 100 products. These window enterprises then became information centers and bridgeheads for the inland ordnance enterprises to develop an export-oriented economy. The changeover seems to have worked. Over the past decade, the defense industry in southwest China has manufactured four million motorcycles, nearly 500,000 refrigerators, about 700,000 cameras, over 100,000 minibuses and 1,000 heavy trucks. It is reported that 70 percent of China's defense plants are now turning out products for civilian use. The industry as a whole has a target of manufacturing civilian goods valued at 10 billion yuan in 1995. Honda's partner, Norinco, one of the country's biggest military suppliers, has diversified so much that 70 percent of the output of its 300 units and subsidiaries is civilian goods. It has even brought the amusement arcade concept to war through the operation of a unique weapons range north of Beijing where paying customers can shoot everything from hand guns to antitank rockets. Now it is looking for foreign joint venture parts for at least 200 projects in advanced machinery, motor vehicle assembly, optical, electrical and chemical products. An official of its development planning department acknowledged that Norinco was hindered by having many of its manufacturing plants located in remote interior regions, but this could be overcome by moving them to central or coastal areas. The former mayor of Chongqing -- wartime capital of nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek -- used to refer to defense industry as "a tiger sleeping in the remote mountains." City officials have now turned that round to describe the current transformation as involving a "tiger leaping down the mountains." There have been no shortage of foreign takers given the loving care lavished in the past on companies in the military sector. At least 20 joint ventures have been created, primarily in vehicle manufacturing. And the Japanese connection in this military-to- civilian transformation is extremely strong. Apart from those already mentioned, another success has been the Jiangling machinery plant, which switched from military hardware to the production of car engines with technological help from Suzuki Motors. It is now the city's number two engine maker, its main customer being the Changan machinery factory, which produces minicars with Honda. The transition from swords to plowshares, however, has not always been smooth. Ni Runfeng, director of the Changhong machinery plant, a military radar producer, in Mianyang, a remote city in eastern Sichuan, recalled how he was caught in a vice between higher-ups demanding he convert to civilian production and military workers who refused assignments to new workshops set up to produce television sets. But that is now a distant memory. After more than a decade of technical cooperation with Japan's National Panasonic Corp. (Matsushita) has laid a solid foundation for Changhong's upgrading. Their self-designed color television production line introduced in 1989 as the first of its kind in the country is regarded as up to the quality of imported lines and now poses a serious challenge to Matsushita's own factories. Having won a firm footing in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe, Changhong set up a joint venture in Indonesia to produce 300,000 television sets annually. It has been turned into a stock company -- Changhong Electric Appliances Co. -- and with two new color television assembly lines added to the existing six, the company ranked first in production and profits in the nation's electronics industry for four successive years (1989-92).
