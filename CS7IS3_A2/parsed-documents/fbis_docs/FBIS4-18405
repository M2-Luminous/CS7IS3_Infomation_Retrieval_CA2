Despite the escalating crisis between North and South Korea, the Federal Government is sticking to the deal it decided this year. Bonn has guaranteed 696.36 million marks for three submarines, which will probably be built at Nordseewrke in Emden and Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG in Kiel. The Federal Government has accepted a basic promise of coverage for another 52.3 million marks, Economics State Secretary Johann Eekhoff announced. Two years ago South Korea was taken off the "H country list," which lists all risk countries to which armament goods are not to be exported. The Social Democratic Party [SPD] has announced that it will put South Korea back on this list of risk countries if it wins the Bundestag elections. South Korea was taken off the list following pressure from industrial circles. The latest developments in the Far East show, however, how wrong this decision was, said Elke Leonhard-Schmid, foreign trade spokeswoman of the SPD Bundestag group.
