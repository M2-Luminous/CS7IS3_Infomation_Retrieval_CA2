This was another important international conference on global environmental protection after the UN-sponsored conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to discuss environment and development. The theme of the conference was "caring for the earth and its residents." The 1,300 or so representatives from 118 countries and regions presented and adopted over 100 motions about protecting the environment and promoting sustained development. Unlike previous international conferences on the environment, experts attending the just-concluded meeting showed greater concern for conditions which people depend on for development as well as for the rational use of the earth's natural resources. They pointed out that the industrial powers' destruction and waste of large amounts of resources during their development processes must not be repeated. The three-year strategy the conference has drawn up for the union consists primarily of urging and assisting countries to protect the integrity and diversification of the environment so as to ensure the rational use of natural resources, and encouraging government and nongovernment organizations to continue their cooperation in protecting natural resources. On 25 January the conference, by a majority of votes, vetoed a motion sponsored by some members that vilifies the Chinese Government for destroying Tibet's natural environment and resources. Taking the floor at the conference, the Chinese representative condemned the motion, saying that it was a political motion intended to incite "Tibet independence." He pointed out that the motion's accusation that the Chinese Government has ravaged Tibet's environment is "totally groundless." [passage omitted]
