The results show that the macro-critical resolved shear stress can be obtained by the finite-element method which takes thermal misfit into consideration, and the method can be used to analyze further the superalloys with high _g_' volume. The effect of thermal misfit on change of _g_' on tempering condition, and the primary quantitative result shows that the thermal misfit stress is one of the main driving forces on _g_' coarsening.
