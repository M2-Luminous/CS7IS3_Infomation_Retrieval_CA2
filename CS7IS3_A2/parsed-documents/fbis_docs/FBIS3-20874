While in 1989 the European countries of the former CEMA accounted for 54 percent of the total volume of foreign trade for the CSFR and the countries with developed market economies accounted for 31 percent, last year the share of countries with developed market economies rose to 72 percent, whereas the European countries of the former CEMA accounted for a share that had declined to 18 percent. This is evident from data provided by the Czech Statistical Office. The strongest export territory for the Czech Republic was the Federal Republic of Germany last year, with 26.9 percent, followed by Slovakia, with 20 percent. Following an extraordinarily large gap, exports to the former USSR amounted to 6 percent, to Austria 6.2 percent, to Italy 5 percent, and to Great Britain 3.1 percent. Only 2 to 3 percent of our exports went to China, France, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Poland; less than 2 percent were directed to the other countries. We import the largest volume of goods from the Federal Republic of Germany--25.1 percent; from Slovakia, we import 17.7 percent, from the countries of the former USSR 11.5 percent (crude oil and gas), from Austria 7.7 percent, from Italy 4.7 percent, from France 3.1 percent, and from the United States 3 percent. Two to 3 percent of our imports come from the Netherlands, Poland, Great Britain, and Switzerland. The other countries account for less than 2 percent. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Share of Country Groups in Czech RepublicExports and Imports (excluding Slov-| |akia)(in percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Exports |Imports | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |European Union |55 |51 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |EFTA [European Free Trad-|11 |15 | |e Association] | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |European Union, EFTA, an-|4 |7 | |d other countries with d-| | | |eveloped market economies| | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |European countries of fo-|16 |20 | |rmer CEMA area | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Developing countries |11 |6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other |3 |1 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
