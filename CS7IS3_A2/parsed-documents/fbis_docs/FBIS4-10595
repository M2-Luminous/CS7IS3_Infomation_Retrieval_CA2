Venezuelan Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez said here in this western Mexican city that nevertheless, his country is fully confident the pact will be finalized in the next months. Interviewed within the framework of the 35th annual meeting of the Assembly of Governors of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Venezuelan official said that his country wants a total commercial opening. He explained that the diversification of markets should be done in a just, equitable fashion so the three economies can reap equal benefits from the trade pact without any one country taking undue advantages. "The southern part of the continent already has a common market. This accord with Mexico and Colombia is meant to establish a mechanism for opening with commercial exchanges that reflect guarantees as if we were a single country," he indicated. Sosa says Mexico must recognize that Venezuelan products are at a disadvantage in the areas of basic industry and capital goods. Sosa Rodriguez declined to comment on the obstacles that exist regarding the rules of origin and government purchases, although he said that no progress has been made on those topics because the negotiations have been delayed. Sosa said that his country's oil will not be a subject for negotiation in the free trade pact since Mexico is not willing to do the same.
