ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard proposes to expand the boundaries of the safety zone for the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP). A deepwater port safety zone constitutes an area within which the erection of structures or mobile drilling operations for the exploration for or extraction of oil or gas is prohibited. An expanded safety zone would enlarge the approach to the terminal portion of the safety zone and provide more unobstructed maneuvering room for vessels arriving and departing from LOOP. This would reduce the risk of a marine casualty and subsequent pollution. DATES: Comments must be received on or before March 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA/3406) (CGD 93&hyph;080), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001, or may be delivered to room 3406, at the same address, between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
