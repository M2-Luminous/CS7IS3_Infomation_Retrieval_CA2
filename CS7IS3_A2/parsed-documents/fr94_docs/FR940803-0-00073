Discussion of Regulations The Wilmington Family YMCA submitted an application to hold the swim portion of the 16th Annual Wilmington Family YMCA_Physicians Health Plan Triathlon at Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. The swim portion of the triathlon will consist of approximately 700 swimmers racing in a section of the Wrightsville Channel.

Because the swim portion of the triathlon is an event of the type contemplated by these regulations, the safety of the participants will be enhanced by the implementation of the special local regulations. The waterway will be closed during the event. Since the waterway will not be closed for an extended period, commercial traffic should not be severely disrupted. Dated: July 8, 1994. W.J.
