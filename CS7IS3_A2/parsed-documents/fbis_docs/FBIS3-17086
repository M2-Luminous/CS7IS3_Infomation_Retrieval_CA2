According to the document, the Russian cabinet accepts the obligation to take into consideration the IMF recommendations on the budget. Camdessus pledges to submit for consideration a draft resolution on allocation of the second part of the systemic credit to the board of directors of this international organization. In his interview with journalists, Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, who participated in the talks, explained that the Russian Government obligated itself to prepare and forward a package of legislative initiatives to the State Duma before mid-April. The documents are aimed at revising and partially suspending several presidential decrees and laws and government resolutions, which lead to a growth on the expenditure part of the budget, and at proposing concrete measures to fulfill the revenues part. According to Shokhin, the decision to allocate the second part of the IMF systemic credit opens the way for Russia to receive the so-called second rehabilitation credit of the World Bank amounting to $600 million and grants opportunities to restructure the foreign debt to be paid off in 1994. Shokhin added that the draft budget prepared by the government and forwarded to the State Duma already contains foreign credits for 1994 totaling $2.1 billion. Having signed this joint statement, the International Monetary Fund in fact showed its approval of the government's activity in the economic sphere, said Shokhin. Chernomyrdin reported to journalists that he had discussed the issue on the IMF credit during his meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Sochi because, he said, it is "a very serious issue." For his part, Camdessus said that in the course of the negotiations in Moscow he was convinced of the Russian president's and government's resolution to pursue the course of reforms.
