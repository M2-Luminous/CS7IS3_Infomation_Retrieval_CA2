[passage omitted] The shells crashed in mid-afternoon not far from the town's hotel, which had been hit Sunday night by a large-calibre shell, and left two craters in a children's play area. Residents of the town immediately fled the streets, bathed in early summer sunshine, to take shelter, dragging their children away from play. No injuries were reported. It was the third day in succession the northeastern Bosnian town had been shelled, apparently from Serb positions some four kilometres (2.5 miles) to the north east. Last Wednesday two people were killed and four injured in two waves of shelling, prompting local authorities to close schools. A decision was to be made later Monday on when to reopen them.
