Kozlova: "Passports of the Former USSR Become Invalid by the end of 1996"] [Text] The principle task of the new laws passed by the Milli Majlis [as published] at the last session is to return to the passport its original significance as a document used for going abroad and to introduce a new document--the identity card of a citizen of the Azerbaijani Republic--for use within the boundaries of Azerbaijan. Eldar Mamedov, supervisor of the department of administrative and military legislation of the Supreme Soviet, which prepared the draft laws "On Exiting the Country, Entering the Country, and Passports," and also "On the Identity Card of a Citizen of the Azerbaijani Republic," noted that these laws are on the territory of the former USSR for the first time. They brought into conformity with international standards the procedures for entry into and exit from the country, they simplified the issuance of the indicated documents to a maximum, they clearly consolidated the legal position of citizens going abroad, and also the procedure for entry into Azerbaijan and exit from it by foreigners. For the first time, these and many other questions associated with them will be decided in our country not on the basis of departmental instructions of the MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs], the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], and the KGB, which are not available to citizens, but on the basis of laws of the state that are binding on both officials and citizens. "We made the laws flexible enough and as clear as possible, and leaving as few opportunities as possible for bureaucratic procrastination in their fulfillment," Mamedov noted. "The law itself proclaims the primacy of the norms of international law in the event of any kinds of contradictions. With the adoption of these laws by parliament, Azerbaijan took a big step on the path to the construction of a democratic society. Azerbaijan actually showed what attention is paid in the republic to the fulfillment of obligations that it assumed after joining the general declaration on human rights and other international pacts on human rights." The law clearly stipulates that no one can deprive a citizen of the right to free movement through customs and border points in a publicly safe method at any time. He can leave and return to the country at any time. Practically all of the previously valid obstacles are being removed, and natural temporary restrictions are associated only with those exceptional cases when a citizen's obligations are in effect concerning not divulging state or military secrets, or in the event that criminal proceedings are brought against him and he is convicted, or if he is called up for active compulsory military service in the established legal procedure. A citizen's going abroad will be conducted on the basis of a general citizen's passport, but for some officials, a list of whom is clearly designated in law, official or diplomatic passports will be used that are specially issued for this. Representatives of the third branch--the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, and the Higher Court of Arbitration--are included for the first time among persons who have a right to a diplomatic passport. All citizens who go outside the boundaries of Azerbaijan will be able to enjoy not only all of their constitutional rights, including the right to pension support, but also to carry out their duties as citizens of Azerbaijan. It is stipulated that they have the right to take out property that belongs to them and their family, except for objects that have been taken out of civilian circulation (for example, cultural valuables). The types and procedures for issuing visas to foreigners and the periods of their stay in Azerbaijan have been consolidated for the first time. The second law provides for the issuance by Internal Affairs organs, according to place of residence, of two types of plastic identity cards for persons up to 16 years of age and older than 16 years of age, which will be exchanged when citizens reach 25, 35, and 50 years of age, or in the event of a change in last name, first name, patronymic, place of residence, family situation, military service obligations, and also if they were lost or are worn out. The new laws will go into effect starting on 1 January 1995, but passports of the former Soviet Union will continue to be valid on the territory of the republic until 31 December 1996.
