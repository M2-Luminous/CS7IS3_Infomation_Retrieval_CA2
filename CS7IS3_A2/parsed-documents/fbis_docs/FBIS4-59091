The league called for the severing of political and economic relations with the Yemeni leaders if they do not respond to the appeals to stop the fighting. It said that they are "pursuing only their personal interests." A statement issued from Aden yesterday by the league's leader, 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Ja'fari; its secretary general, Muhsin Bin-Farid; and the Unionist Grouping's secretary general, 'Umar al-Jawi, said that what is happening in Yemen now is "the result of the way in which the country is being run. Here are the country's leaders destroying it, its Army, and its people." They described what is happening as a "catastrophe." It said that the Yemeni leaders are acting "as though they are the enemies of the country and its people." The statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has received, added: "We know that our position could expose us and our party to danger. But we do not care about what could afflict us. We are interested in our country and our people, because we know we are worth nothing without a secure homeland. We also know that what the gangs' leaders are doing will not spare a country or a people, because their only concern is their own interests.... They are firing their missiles and dropping their bombs everywhere, no matter who is killed or what is destroyed." The statement said that the Yemeni Army "is destroying itself, while the leaders continue to destroy their country's infrastructure. We doubt whether some of them feel they belong to this country or to our religion, Islam, or have any human feelings." The statement urged "that this dirty war be stopped and innocent citizens rescued. If the leaders refuse to stop this war, we urge you to sever your political and economic relations with them and help our people to surmount the catastrophe being inflicted by these leaders who are taking the country into the unknown." The statement issued by the league and the grouping went on: "In the name of God, brotherhood, and humanity, we appeal to you to move swiftly before it is too late. Because it is in no one's interests for our citizens to continue to be killed and our country destroyed.... If the country's leaders lose their mind, someone must stand by the people, who are suffering terror and starvation." The statement urged the Army to stop the fighting and not to respond to any orders to launch attacks.
