Asked why this code was necessary, Komov mentioned four principal reasons: Firstly, the number of parties to land relations has lately increased sharply, reaching 60 million families. This process is continuing due to the extensive development of entrepreneurship, private housing construction, increasing number of private farms, development of horticulture, vegetable-growing, and subsidiary farming. Secondly, new rights to own land have appeared, as well as new legal grounds on which citizens and legal persons can obtain land and effect transactions with it. Thirdly, one now has to pay for the right to acquire land and to use it. And, fourthly, the redistribution of land (land circulation) has become much faster. A land market has appeared. Komov said that the draft land code includes 21 chapters. They reflect the main directions of Russia's land policy, the right to own land and other rights, the competence of state bodies and local self-government organs in land matters, the legal and economic mechanism for dealing with them, the status of agricultural, forest, urban, specially protected and other lands. Important attention is given to the protection of the priceless land wealth, land management, state land evaluation and registration of the right to own land plots, and to transactions with them. Komov particularly noted that the document includes for the first time a chapter on "land transactions", laying down clearly the procedures for concluding deals with land plots and land shares, obtained during the reorganisation of collective and state farms. The proclaimed rights of citizens and legal persons are still not legislatively regulated even now that Russia is switching over to a market economy. There is no mechanism or procedure for obtaining land (for money or free of charge), or for renting it on a termless basis. An owner cannot mortgage his land, cannot use is as a contribution to some fixed capital, cannot present it as a gift or to exchange it. It is practically impossible to dispose of a land share at one's own discretion, because it is granted only for farming purposes. There is also no procedure for buying out land needed by the state or the municipal authorities. Today, it is even impossible to replenish the land redistribution fund for carrying out many state programmes or to confiscate land from lazy owners and to transfer or sell it to efficient farmers. In addition to legally guaranteeing the rights of citizens and juridical persons to freely own, use and dispose of their land in their own interests, the draft code also contains some restrictions on land deals, preventing latifundism in Russia. Komov also noted that legal norms for the land around large apartment houses have been fixed for the first time. These land plots, within the established limits, may be owned jointly by the dwellers (in the form of condominiums). The proposed draft land code, Komov believes, allows to eliminate the blank spots in the existing legislation and to place land relationships on a solid economic basis. It reflects the novelty and complexity of the land situation in Russia. At the same time, the document is understandable and convenient not only for specialists, but for all the citizens of the country. After discussing the draft, the Presidium of the Russian Government instructed corresponding bodies to make the necessary amendments in it and to submit the document to the State Duma for approval.
