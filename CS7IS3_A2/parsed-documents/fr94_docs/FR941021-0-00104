FR941021-0-00104 FR941021-0-00020 As the foregoing preamble discussion indicates, the vast majority of the provisions of the interim final rule issued today follow the provisions of revised OMB Circular A&hyph;110. For the reasons that follow, DOE has determined that none of the provisions of the interim final rule need to be proposed for public comment. The final version of revised OMB Circular A&hyph;110 resulted from a lengthy public comment process involving all of the Executive agencies including DOE. In 1987, an interagency task force recommended that OMB Circular A&hyph;110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations'' be combined with OMB Circular A&hyph;102, ``Uniform Requirements for Grants and Agreements with State and Local Governments,'' as a consolidated ``common rule.'' In November, 1988, a proposed consolidated ``common rule'' was published by OMB in the Federal Register , 53 FR 44716. That proposal elicited a substantial number of adverse comments. Subsequently, in August 1992, a revised proposal, developed by another interagency task force which also included DOE, was published for public comment. 57 FR 39018. The revised proposal drew over 200 comments from a wide variety of sources. All relevant comments were considered in the final revision of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 when it was issued for government-wide use on November 29, 1993, 58 FR 62992. The revised circular states that Federal agencies responsible for awarding and administering grants and other agreements to recipients described therein shall adopt the language in the circular unless other provisions are required by Federal statute or exceptions or deviations are approved by OMB. As noted above, OMB Circular A&hyph;110 identifies certain areas where agencies have options, but the available options are explicitly limited. These areas are discussed in section I.B. of this Preamble under Supplementary Information. For the most part, the provisions of the interim final rule discussed in that preamble section represent a continuation or a technical clarification of existing policy under 10 CFR part 600. To the extent that there are changes in existing policy, they are either the choice of the most permissive available option under OMB Circular A&hyph;110 (e.g., ยง600.123(b) permitting unrecovered indirect costs to be included in cost sharing) or a purely procedural change (e.g., ยง600.125 limiting prior approval requirements for revisions of budget and program plans.) Given the extensive public comment process on the OMB circular, DOE's participation in the resolution of comments, and the lack of discretion to change the policies in the circular, DOE concluded that a notice of proposed rulemaking for its implementing rules would be unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to public policy.
