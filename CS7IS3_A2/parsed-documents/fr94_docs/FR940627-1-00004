Issued in Washington, DC on June 21, 1994. Michael E. Chase, Acting Assistant Chief Counsel for Regulations. Petitions for Rulemaking Docket No.: 27371 Petitioner: Gerald A. Silver Regulations Affected: 14 CFR 91.119 Description of Rulechange Sought: To strike out the following language in subsection (d) of ยง91.119: ``(d) Helicopters. Helicopters may be operated at less than the minimum prescribed in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section if the operation is conducted without hazard to persons or property on the surface.'' Mr. Silver, on behalf of Homeowners of Encino, proposes to add the following language in place of that deleted above: ``(d) Helicopters. Helicopters operated by any municipal, county, state, or federal authority for emergency services, rescue operations, police or fire protection, may be operated at less than the minimum prescribed in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section if the operation is conducted without hazard to persons or property on the surface.'' Petitioners's Reasons for the Request: The petitioner(s) feels that the helicopter noise problem, created by low flying helicopters overflying his/their community conducting sightseeing tours (particularly at night), real estate caravan flybys to show homes to prospective customers, and other short distance business travel, is a flagrant abuse of the constituency represented by the petitioner(s). It is a recurring problem that has not been, heretofore, relieved by means of a pilot/industry cooperative endeavor; and the proposed rulemaking change would provide acceptable relief. Docket No.: 27736 Petitioner: City of Santa Monica Sections of the FAR Affected: 14 CFR 91.119(d) Description of Rulechange Sought: To require that, except when necessary for takeoff or landing, helicopters operated over a congested area maintain an altitude of 500 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft; helicopters operated over non-congested areas would be required to maintain an altitude of 500 feet above the surface; and helicopters operated over open water or sparsely populated areas would not be permitted closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure. Petitioner's Reason for the Request: The petitioner feels this change will increase the safety of helicopter operations by raising the altitude that they fly; provide the Federal Aviation Administration greater authority to enforce minimum safe altitude regulations similar to the provisions for all other aircraft; not unduly burden helicopter operators with increased costs or loss of efficiency; and minimize the intrusion of helicopters in the community.
