Thus they have also failed, dismally, to deter. The leaders of NATO's states, in a communique issued in Brussels yesterday, reaffirmed their "readiness to carry out air strikes if necessary." Virtually identical to the one issued last August, it is hardly the mother of all threats. Its timorous scale and unimaginative contours mark once more the shabbiness of NATO's policy on Bosnia. The problems of that ravaged state are many. Four command immediate attention: the Serb siege around Sarajevo, mounted from the hills that strangle it in their embrace; blockading in Srebrenica, a so-called safe haven, of Canadian United Nations troops; the closure of Tuzla airport to relief flights; and the continued, brazen breach of the "no-fly zone" by Serbs and Croats. Empty, unfocused threats are unlikely to force changes in Serb and Croat policy. They will only nourish the cosy sense of violent accomplishment that now prevails, especially in the Serb camp. Any action taken now, however effective and committed, will be several thousand lives too late. That, however, should not excuse further pusillanimity. NATO must identify specific objectives, lay down crisp ultimatums, and deal firmly with failures to meet them. The Serbs must be given a week to "unlock" Tuzla airport. Humanitarian aid to thousands depends on access to its runways. A similar deadline should be imposed for the release of the Canadian contingent, to be relieved by its designated Dutch successors. Failure to meet these demands should earn the Serbs punitive air strikes. As for breaches of airspace in the "no-fly zone," the response must be swift. Most pressing of all is the siege of Sarajevo, and the need to act there is the greatest. But the problems of that city did not begin yesterday, and NATO has squandered the many chances it had to intervene. Air strikes, while serving as effective responses to specific, and localised, examples of aggression, are not the answer. In fact, the mightiest minds now despair of ever finding a solution. This frustration was evident in President Clinton's language on the matter at the NATO summit. "If you lack the determination to deliver what you have promised," he said "do not make promises." In the context, with all its expectations of diplomatic cuddling and kissing, this was a stinging rebuke to Europe's leaders. It is criticism that they richly deserve. Their threats to use force have degenerated to the level of pure rhetoric, of empty sabre-rattling, devoid of deterrent effect and credibility. The Serbs know this, as they pound Sarajevo daily, and mercilessly. The Croats know this, too. And, most damningly, the Bosnian government has long since lost hope. This explains, in part, its determination to gamble everything on renewed military offensives against the increasingly vulnerable Croats. It is tired of promises and expressions of solidarity. Mr Clinton spoke his mind and he must be congratulated for that. If it means an end to vacuous rhetoric, then some good, and some truth, might be said to have emerged from the NATO summit.
