FR940922-1-00066 FR940922-1-00009 In contrast, drug and device manufacturers are required under statutory authority to submit clinical trial data in order to gain FDA approval to market a product. FDA's concerns are more narrowly focused on evaluating the reliability of clinical data submissions in support of marketing approval because FDA must rely on submitted clinical data in making decisions on the safety and effectiveness of regulated products. FDA's primary interest is in the potential of certain financial interests to bias the outcome of clinical studies. Because of the agency's special regulatory responsibilities, FDA's proposed rule differs from the NIH regulation and the NSF policy in terms of the research conducted by potentially affected investigators and in two other respects as well. FDA's proposed rule does not include a financial interest of a clinical investigator in a firm that owns a product that would compete with the tested product for market share, and FDA is not proposing to require disclosure of financial interests and arrangements in or with the sponsor by full-time employees of the sponsor. In addition, FDA's proposed rule does not identify a specific threshold dollar which would trigger disclosure of financial interests. Instead, FDA is requesting public comment on whether setting a threshold amount is appropriate, and if so, what the dollar amount should be. These additional differences, and FDA's interest in obtaining comment on them, are discussed further in section II.D. of this document. FDA is concerned about financial interests that are unknown or undisclosed to the agency and potentially unmanaged by product sponsors to guard against purposeful or inadvertent bias. In particular, FDA is concerned about those types of financial interests whose value is heavily influenced by the outcome of the research. Clinical research data provide the basis for FDA's assessment of the safety and effectiveness of new human drugs, devices, and biologics, the assessment of the bioequivalence of generic drugs and sometimes the substantial equivalence of devices. It is essential that these data be reliable and that steps be taken to minimize possible effects on the data resulting from potential bias on the part of an investigator. FDA acknowledges that there are many factors that could give investigators a preference for a particular outcome, but a significant financial interest in the outcome of the study is of particular concern. Bias, as used here, means a purposeful or inadvertent preference of the clinical investigator for a particular study outcome that interferes with the clinical investigator's impartiality in conducting a clinical study. Bias could, for example, interfere with a clinical investigator's impartiality in assessing the outcome of therapy; in assigning patients to treatment (so that patients who receive the test product are those with a better prognosis); in interpreting an adverse event: in assessing the outcome of the therapy; or in deciding upon use of concomitant therapy. In any discussion of potential sources of bias, it is important to distinguish between the actual conduct of studies and collection of data by clinical investigators, on the one hand, and the use of those studies, i.e., the analysis, interpretation, and presentation of the data from those studies by the sponsor, on the other. In the analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data, a commercial sponsor would be expected to have a clear preference for a particular result, and FDA's review of the sponsor's submissions proceeds with awareness of the sponsor's interests and potential biases. The agency regularly examines, and in some cases repeats, the statistical analysis carried out by sponsors for scientific adequacy and for accuracy, basing these examinations on the raw data collected by clinical investigators. When there is a choice of analysis or study endpoints, the agency can usually determine whether they were specified prospectively or chosen without knowledge of the study outcome, and whether the choice appears scientifically credible. Where more than one analysis is possible, FDA can independently weigh the arguments for and against a given approach. FDA can, thus, deal with potential sponsor biases in the analyses and interpretation of submitted data because the agency has complete access to the raw data and a complete description of the analyses the sponsor chose. In contrast, there is no way to assess completely the accuracy of the raw data themselves, although the agency can, and does, take steps to help assure their validity. FDA provides guidance to sponsors of drugs, biologics and devices on how to develop monitoring systems that their study monitors can use to ensure that data generated in clinical trials are accurate and complete. As further protection against isolated unreliable data, the agency generally requires findings to be replicated before they can serve as the basis for marketing decisions; and clinical data may also be subjected to field inspections through the agency's bioresearch monitoring program. In many cases, clinical trial results arise from the combined efforts of many investigators, so that a regulatory conclusion does not depend on a single investigator's efforts. There are, however, limits to the protection these steps provide against potential bias. Even if the primary responsibility of the study monitor to the sponsor is discounted, monitors cannot verify many of the observations made independently by investigators. Moreover, while the bioresearch monitoring program is immensely valuable in detecting certain kinds of data problems, including errors or bias leading to an inconsistency between what is reported to FDA and information in independently generated records (for example, nurses's notes, laboratory slips, office records, hospital records) and can often detect sloppiness or deliberate fraud, it has limited ability to detect faulty assessment of study endpoints, or failure to record adverse effects. Thus, although the agency tries to ensure that data are reliable, FDA relies considerably on independent clinical investigators to provide valid and reliable data.
