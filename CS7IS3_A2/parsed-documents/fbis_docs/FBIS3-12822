The Palestinian Islamic Hamas Movement has announced that it rejects the dispatch of UN forces to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in order to protect the Palestinians. Hamas Movement spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah said in a telephone interview that this plan is designed to circumvent the basic problem, which is the presence of the Zionist occupation and the Zionist settlers on Palestinian territory. He affirmed that the PLO's purpose in making this suggestion is to attempt to tone down the escalating opposition among the Palestinian people inside and outside Palestine to enable the organization to resume its negotiations with the Zionist occupation. Ghawshah noted that the dispatch of UN observers will not ensure protection for the Palestinian people. Even if the UN Security Council decides to send armed forces to protect the Palestinians, he said, these forces will not be able to provide such protection. Proof of this is that thousands of UN armed forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina could not prevent massacres there. [passage omitted]
