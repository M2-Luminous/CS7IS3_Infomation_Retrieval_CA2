"It will be a private consultation. No communiques, no decisions. An open discussion between the ministers about the problems of the former Yougoslavia, and how regional voice can be raised to influence the outcome, bring an end to the fighting in Bosnia," Owen told a news conference. "None of the parties from the former Yugoslavia will be invited at this stage," he said, adding that if the talks proved "useful," the mediators might hold discussions later on "with the presidents of possibly Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia." Foreign ministers of the following nations would attend Wednesday: Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Romania, and Turkey. Owen, the European Community's mediator, who with Stoltenberg, the UN mediator, came here on the last leg of a tour of ex-Yugoslavia's neighbors, said the mediators felt "the European Union initiative and the negotiations over Bosnia now need to be discussed within the region and also the wider issues that affect the conference: Serb-Croat relations, the minorities, the Albanians in Macedonia and Kosovo." Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta meanwhile said Bosnian Croats and Moslems might hold talks Wednesday in Rome. The talks could take place between the meeting, Monday and Tuesday, of European Community foreign ministers and Brussels, and the meeting of ex-Yugoslavia's neighbors, he said. Andreatta put the proposal to Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic on Thursday when they met here, he added. Earlier, in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, Owne said international sanctions against Belgrade over its role in the war in Bosnia could not continue indefinitely. "We can't go on indefinitely asking countries quite far away from fighting to make sacrifices, if there is no readiness of the parties to make peace," he said. Bulgaria is one of the central European countries whose trade and economy have been badly hit by the United Nations embargo against Serbia and Montenegro, the rump Yugoslavia. "I do not favour lifting sanctions," Owen added. "It would be premature. But I don't think the status quo can carry on indefinitely." Albania has expressed concern about the war spreading to Kosovo, the restive northern province of Serbia which has a 90 percent Albanian population, or Macedonia, another former member of the Yugoslav federation.
