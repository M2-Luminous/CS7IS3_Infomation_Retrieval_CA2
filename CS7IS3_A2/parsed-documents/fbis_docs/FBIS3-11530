Two weeks ago, the two countries signed an agreement worth $30 million covering the purchase of about 200 kinds of medicines for distribution in public health programs. Lage said the shipment of meningitis vaccine that Brazil bought, on which the "use by" dates had expired, will be exchanged free of charge. "That is all we can do," he said. On a four-day visit to Brazil, Lage also hopes to advance some technical-scientific cooperation projects in the petrochemicals and tourism areas. "We are open to foreign capital, and are specifically interested in Brazil because it is the largest country in Latin America," he said.
