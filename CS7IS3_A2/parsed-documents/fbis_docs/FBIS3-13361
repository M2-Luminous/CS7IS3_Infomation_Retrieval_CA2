What is clear from both crimes is: First, Israel is launching an unprecedented war of annihilation against the Lebanese and the Palestinians aimed at sabotaging Lebanese national unity and preventing the reconstruction of Lebanon on the one hand, and directing a crushing blow to the peace efforts by attacking Muslim and Christian worshippers and spreading an atmosphere of religious hostility in the service of the opportunist Jewish interests on the other. Second, the crimes in Hebron and Beirut followed Israeli threats, which were also directed by the Zionist murder organ headed by Yitzhaq Rabin. These threats were strongly directed at Lebanon, and the world had expected a large-scale Zionist aggression against southern Lebanon. But Zionist militarism has struck at an unexpected place -- the Sayyidat al-Najat Church -- with a very clear aim, which is to cover up its crime in the Ibrahimi Mosque and to create an atmosphere of chaos in Lebanon in order to undermine the stability and security which that country is enjoying in the era of legitimacy and the al-Ta'if Agreement. On the other hand, now that secret and open talks with the PLO have led to the Cairo agreement, which was rejected by Palestinian popular forces and organizations, and the intifadah has intensified in a serious, qualitative manner threatening to end the series of concessions which are being made to Israel, Israel has resorted as usual to a strike, which even the Nazis would have been ashamed of, at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in order to intimidate the Palestinians and stop their intifadah, just as it did in Dayr Yasin during the establishment of the Zionist entity, believing that it could achieve now what it achieved then. Israel tried to cover up its crime by placing the responsibility on other extremist forces. But, it seems to have forgotten that the whole world knows that arming and training settlers is done by the Israeli security organs and so the Israeli war ministry cannot be entirely absolved from encouraging the crime the murder plans.
