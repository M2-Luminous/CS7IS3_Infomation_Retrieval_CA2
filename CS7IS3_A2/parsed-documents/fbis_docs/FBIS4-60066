We believe that some Gulf states may indeed have been surprised by the military developments in Yemen, but certainly not the Saudi regime. Because we are certain it is behind those developments. The Saudi regime has played a major role in plotting against Yemeni unity and fostering the secondary and marginal differences and disputes which have led to these military developments! The Saudi regime, which has fought the Yemeni revolution since the first hours of its outbreak and cannot bear to see one unified, progressive, and developed Yemeni Republic, cannot but conspire against Yemeni unity and encourage war and rebellion against legitimacy. When one of the Yemeni unity sides turns to Riyadh and other Arab and western capitals, and goes to the Saudi capital in search of "guarantees" for unity, as he claimed at the time, when he was probably looking for assistance and support for what he planned and had in mind, it is only natural for the reactionary, hostile Saudi regime to exploit Arab unity in general, and Yemeni unity in particular, and to fully exploit its relationship with that side in order to make secession look attractive and to instigate that side to escalate the crisis and ignite the fire of war and sedition. Sa'ud al-Faysal has lied twice: First, when he claimed that they were surprised by the military developments in Yemen, because it was his regime which created the atmosphere and paved the way for these developments; and second, when he called on northerners and southerners to end the fighting, because his regime is interested in the continuation of the war more than anyone else in order to exhaust and weaken the Yemeni Republic and waste its military and economic resources.
