The heaviest battles between supporters of moderate western Bosnia leader Fikret Abdic and troops of radical Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic are being fought in the areas of Varoska Rijeka and Buzim. Both sides are firing from small arms, anti- aircraft guns, machine-guns, mortars and grenade launchers. Each side claims to have inflicted heavy casualties on the other side and to have taken prisoners, but the front line has remained intact. The two sides recently exchanged prisoners in the presence of U.N. and Red Cross officials. Abdic's supporters released 280 prisoners in exchange for 75 prisoners held by the other side. The prisoners released from Bihac by Izetbegovic's troops say they were starved and maltreated, while those held in Abdic's stronghold of Velika Kladusa did not have any complaints.
