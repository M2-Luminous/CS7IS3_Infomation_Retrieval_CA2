A few hundred people took part in each of them. Twelve miners in Andaluzja in Piekary Slaskie started an underground occupational strike; however, the strike has nothing to do with the nationwide "S" action. Today, among others, a few dozen plants of the Bydgoszcz Region will go on strike. In the morning, "S" Head Marian Krzaklewski will meet with Senate Speaker Adam Struzik of the Polish Peasant Party [SLD]. They will discuss, among other topics, the budget and possible changes that the Senate may introduce. Struzik told RZECZPOSPOLITA that he will try to "reconcile positions." He may play the role of a mediator in the talks between "S" and the government. The Prime Minister Invites Unclearly According to "S" National Committee [KK] Spokesman Piotr Zak, the prime minister's invitation to talks has been worded so unclearly that it is not known whether this is an invitation to the negotiations on the trade union's demands. They wanted to advance the date of the meeting between Waldemar Pawlak and Marian Krzaklewski by one day because, as Zak put it, "let us not waste time." After consultations at the Office of the Council of Ministers, it turned out, however, that the prime minister had reserved Thursday [17 March] for other activities. It seems that "S" did not like the fact that the prime minister had invited not only this trade union but also "Solidarity '80," All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement, and Trade Union of Miners in Poland [ZZGwP] (the heads of the two latter unions are deputies of the Democratic Left Alliance). Because only "S" is right now involved in the dispute and is conducting the protest action, it would indicate that the prime minister wants to discuss not only their demands or even that he does not want to negotiate. At 1100 today, a meeting will be held between Chairman Krzaklewski and Speaker Struzik (PSL senator, member of "S"), who himself invited him to talk. Some "S" activists say that the union would already like to stop or at least to soften the protest action and finally begin talks. This is also suggested by the fact that "S" very seriously treated Leszek Miller's invitation to talks as well as by the fast response of "S." Such a possibility may arise after the meeting with the Senate speaker. Struzik told RZECZPOSPOLITA that he and Krzaklewski intend, among other things, to evaluate the current situation and to discuss the socioeconomic situation in the country, and so "a talk about the budget will probably be unavoidable." Much earlier, before the budget discussion and the voting, Struzik forwarded a letter to the KK, in which he wrote about possible changes in the budget. They were supposed to take that into consideration when planning their activities--right now, because there is a majority in the Senate (after amendments are proposed, the budget must return to the Sejm anyway) and as a representative of this chamber of the parliament, he will want to "reconcile positions." Asked whether he will fulfill the role of a mediator in the talks with the government, Struzik replied that he certainly would like this problem to be resolved favorably, but he does not know whether a mediator is needed because it was the government that launched the talks initiative. "The fact that the prime minister forwarded such an invitation indicates that we are all looking for solutions." Marian Krzaklewski said on Gdansk television that he expects the meeting with the prime minister to be long and tough. He believes that a brief talk would mean rejection of "S" demands, and then the union's KK would immediately convene to make decisions concerning means of increasing pressure on the government. "The effect of our activities will depend on the force of the pressure," stated Krzaklewski. ZZGwP Head Jan Kisielinski told the Polish Press Agency PAP that he does not think that meeting with the prime minister will be the result, among other things, of the "S" action: "Pawlak, at a time when he was not the head of the government, used to say that he attaches great importance to meetings with trade unions." Weaker Impact Twelve miners in "Andaluzja" started an underground occupational strike on Monday; they demand immediate talks with the board of the Bytom Coal Partnership on a wage agreement. PAP reports that the mine's directors say that all of the strikers are miners from the partnership's 12 mines; they went underground "without the knowledge and consent of the directors, who are responsible for security." Piotr Zak told RZECZPOSPOLITA that the protest has nothing to do with the KK action. At the last session of the Protest Headquarters, "miners did not rule out the possibility that there may be individual protests because there are wage problems." Yesterday's demonstrators handed in petitions and "S" demands to voivodes. Today, from 1000 to 1200, there will be a strike through the Bydgoszcz Region; however, excluded from the action are the Municipal Transportation Establishments, State Motor Transport, health service, education, etc. The heat energy plant in Elblag has not yet resumed supplying heat to the municipal and voivodship office in Elblag. In addition, one plant in Pila voivodship and several in Konskie, in the Swietokrzyski Region, will go on strike.
