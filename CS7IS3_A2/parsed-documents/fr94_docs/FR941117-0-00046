FR941117-0-00046 FR941117-0-00009 (4) Discussions. Discussions may be used if it is necessary to request the offeror to submit additional clarifying or supplementing information to make an offer acceptable. The procurement buying team member shall lead discussions with each finalist. The discussions are intended to assist the buying team in fully understanding each finalist's offer and to assure that all finalists are competing equally on the basis intended. Care must be exercised to ensure these discussions adhere, to the extent applicable, to the guidelines set forth in 1815.613&hyph;71(b)(5) for the applicable contract type. Technical transfusion, technical leveling, and auction techniques are prohibited. It is expected that discussions will be conducted on an informal basis with each finalist. After completion of discussions, each finalist shall be afforded an opportunity to revise its offer to support and clarify its offer. A reasonable amount of time (normally less than 5 working days) will be afforded for the revision. The amount of time given shall be the same for each finalist. Such discussions are not required if there are sufficient acceptable offers to ensure adequate price competition, and if further time, effort and delay to make additional proposals acceptable and thereby increase competition, would not be in the Government's interest. (5) The buying team may choose to conduct parallel negotiations with all acceptable offerors without a determination of finalists. This could particularly apply when few offers were received. (6) Selection. The procurement team member shall be the source selection official. The source selection official may elect to make selection in lieu of determining finalists provided that it can be demonstrated that (i) selection of an initial offer(s) will result in the lowest price/cost to the Government and (ii) discussions with other acceptable offerors are not anticipated to change the outcome of the initial evaluation relative to evaluated price/cost. It is expected that the source selection statement will not ordinarily exceed one page and that the basis for the decision will be apparent upon review of the informal worksheets used in the evaluation process. These informal worksheets shall be included in the contract file. (7) The names of offerors determined to be finalists, selected for parallel negotiations, or selected for negotiations and/or final contract award will be electronically transmitted to the offerors. This will serve as notification to those offers that were not selected for further evaluation (see 1871.505). (8) Negotiation methods and procedures. The buying team may choose to conduct parallel negotiations of complete contracts with those offerors determined to be finalists or with all acceptable offerors, including offers susceptible to being made acceptable. The buying team may discuss any aspect of the offer during parallel negotiations. The objective of the negotiations should be to achieve revisions to the offer, consistent with the RFO, that are more favorable to the Government. Technical transfusion, technical levelling, and auction techniques are prohibited. Upon conclusion of negotiations with each offeror, the offeror shall be asked to submit a revised offer (in full or amended) reflecting the results of negotiations, and including the offeror's signature on the negotiated contract. A reasonable amount of time (normally less than 5 working days) will be afforded for the revision. Award will be made to the lowest priced (or most probable cost), technically acceptable offer. 1871.401&hyph;4 Competitive negotiations using qualitative criteria.
