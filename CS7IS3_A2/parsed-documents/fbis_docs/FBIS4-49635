"By `one country, two systems' we mean that the main body of the country practices socialism, which is the fundamental system of China, while as a supplement to the socialist state, Hong Kong continues to practice capitalism," said Lu Ping, director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, at a luncheon given in his honor here today. "When we say there will be no change in the principle of 'one country, two systems', there are actually two aspects: the capitalist system of Hong Kong will remain unchanged, and the fundamental socialist system of the country will also not change," he said. "Otherwise, it will be 'one country, one system', instead of 'one country, two systems'," he said. Lu said that some people believe that only when China turns capitalist, can Hong Kong's capitalism be guaranteed. "This is an entirely wrong concept," he said. "If in case (which is an impossible supposition) China turns capitalist as some people wishfully think, where will Hong Kong stand? Can Hong Kong continue to play its role as a bridge, which contributes as a major factor to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability?" Lu asked. He said that Chinese leaders are determined to build a strong socialist China and any movement or action to change this direction may cause chaos and disruption to the Chinese economy. Any foreign government or anyone in Hong Kong trying to exert pressure on the Chinese Government will not succeed. China would not want itself to be rampant with chaos, he said. "Furthermore, can Hong Kong continue to prosper with a turbulent mainland at its back? During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), which was purely an internal conflict, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai to some extent, could still exercise some control over the 'Red Guards'. Do you know that in 1967 it was Premier Zhou Enlai who at the very last minute stopped the 'gang of four' to send troops to Hong Kong? "Do you know that in order to maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, China has been imposing strict self-control on the exodus of immigrants to Hong Kong? "It has been and still is, the People's Liberation Army which, under the strict orders of the central government, has been guarding the Hong Kong borders and maintaining the stability in Hong Kong," he added.
