After the first meeting of the coalition working group examining broad outlines for the future of the Bundeswehr, Ruehe said in Bonn on Thursday [19 May] that they agreed to meet again in June. He did not give any details. The working group was set up by top coalition members after the differences of opinion between the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union and the Free Democratic Party [FDP] came to light regarding future overall policy for the Bundeswehr. Given the current financial situation, Ruehe is aiming for a reduction of the Bundeswehr from 370,000 to 340,000. Basic military service is to be shortened from 12 to 10 months. Military service for the crisis reaction forces will be 12 months. The FDP has voiced its criticism over this. [passage omitted]
