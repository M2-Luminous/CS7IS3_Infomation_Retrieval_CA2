Both bankers and law enforcement agencies are worried at this development. They want to know how the new banknotes, which were printed in Canada and, supposedly, kept securely under lock and key, turned up on Zaporozhye's black market. By all accounts, the black marketeers already know what the exchange rate for the new currency will be. One hryvna is being exchanged for 24,000 karbovantsi, only 50 percent less than the U.S. dollar.
