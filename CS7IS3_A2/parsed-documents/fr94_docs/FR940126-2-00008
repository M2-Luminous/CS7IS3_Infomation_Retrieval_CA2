FR940126-2-00008 FR940126-2-00005 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Endangered Species; Permits AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), NOAA, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of receipt two applications for scientific research permits (P497B, P503M). Notice is hereby given that the Idaho Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit (ICFWRU) (P497B) and the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) (P503M) have both applied in due form for a permit to take listed species of Snake River salmon as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543) and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217&hyph;227). ICFWRU (P497B) requests authorization to lethally take juvenile listed Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) from bypass-collection facilities at the Lower Granite Dam in order to determine the physiological effects of collection, bypass, and transport on wild fish. ICFWRU requests authorization to conduct this research from April 15, to June 1, 1994. IDFG (P503M) requests authorization to take adult and juvenile listed Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon. IDFG proposes to enumerate and collect length information on upstream migrant adult chinook salmon in Chamberlain Creek and West Fork Chamberlain Creek. They would also conduct parr density monitoring by snorkeling, conduct redd counts, and collect biological information from carcasses. The latter activities are ongoing, and were previously covered by Permit 823. However, IDFG proposes to combine activities specific to the Chamberlain Basin into a single permit. IDFG requests authorization to conduct this research from March 1 through November 30 annually through 1997. Written data or views, or requests for a public hearing on these applications should be submitted to the Director, Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1335 East-West Hwy., Silver Spring, MD 20910, within 30 days of the publication of this notice.
