The national patriotic organisation called the movement for Russia's National Revival was set by the nationalistic front Pamyat, the centrist bloc of political parties and movements and the Conservative Union. The presentation of the new party was held in Moscow on Wednesday in one of the rooms of the Federation of Peace and Accord decorated with a huge portrait of Russia's last Czar Nicholas the Second and a table with an icon and traditional Russian bread and salt in the middle. The ceremony was attended by several dozen Pamyat members clad in black uniform and a large number of foreign journalists. The party's concept is based on the "holy unity of god, the czar and the nation." The statement of its organising committee read out by Pamyat leader Dmitry Vasilyev was written in old Russian and contained many provisions eulogising autocracy, the Orthodox Church and its traditional virtues, and blasphemed bolsheviks and communists. A large portion of the statement was devoted to the economic programme of the party. "Our course is towards reviving the strong peasantry on the basis of state, collective and individual forms of land ownership by freeing fledgling land users from taxes and establishing a system of deductions and a tax-free and balanced economy," the statement read. Speaking at a news conference after the presentation, Vasilyev said that the movement will not "take part in all these elections" because there is something unpleasant "in the fight for power." On the other hand, he stressed that it "will not quit political life." Vladimir Voronin, leader of the centrist bloc who failed to pass registration in the 1991 presidential elections, said that he "remains a candidate for presidency." Vasilyev refused to comment on the movement's tactics. He added that he would not name his supporters in the upper echelons of power, fearing they may "come under attack." He denounced Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the ultra nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, saying his emergence "is not incidental." It was carefully prepared by someone standing behind him. He described Zhirinovskiy's statements as a "dangerous political provocation," adding that he (Zhirinovskiy) "provokes revenge-seeking sentiments and discredits the idea of the Russian issue." Vasilyev also spoke extremely critically about Aleksandr Sterligov, leader of the Russian national assembly. Vasilyev distanced himself from some of Sterligov's former associates, including Nazi Aleksey Barkashov and Communist Nikolay Lysenko. Asked about the movement's place in Russia's political spectrum, Vasilyev replied that "there is no place for us there. I do not see there any people with whom I could stand together."
