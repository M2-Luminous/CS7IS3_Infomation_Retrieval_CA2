Let us comprehend the matter correctly. The controversy is not whether the satellite or its dish antennae are good or bad, lawful or unlawful! The question is of a certain form of social behavior. [passage omitted] 2. Let us discuss the matter of social conduct. Can anyone deny the deleterious effects of satellite transmissions on the mental and moral growth of youth? [passage omitted] 3. Now we come to the most crucial question: What should be done in the face of serious moral threats resulting from the proliferation of the various foreign transmissions. First of all, we should be aware that all of us, not only the government, but all individuals have a responsibility. If we accept this, we can be assured that not only can we help to stem this scourge but also to achieve a high level of success. This is only possible if all of us consider ourselves responsible, rise up against it, and carry out our duties. The people should gain enough knowledge and information on the subject. This is a momentous obligation for the scholars, intelligentsia, and farsighted individuals in our society that should be conveyed by our mass media: radio, television, the press, the Majles and so on so that the message is conveyed to the masses. Orators and preachers should enlighten the people on the issue at every opportunity. The people should not consider this issue as simply sensitivity toward all modernism [preceding word in English]. [passage omitted] 4. Should the government interfere in this matter? There should not be the slightest doubt. This is because the government is not a mere gendarme in an Islamic system to prevent murder and theft. It also has the responsibility of combating base thinking to maintain the moral wellbeing of society. It is precisely for this purpose that a guardian has two kinds of jurisdiction: The first is that which bestows power on him and the second is to guide the people. For the second, it is imperative that a guardian should be a pious and devout theological scholar so that he has the necessary ability to guide. What can the government do in this matter? Initially, it can make the people more aware of the issue and at a secondary level it should formulate certain useful laws and then compile regulations for the implementation of those laws. Perhaps it may not be so difficult to draw up a guidance program with the help of the government. The doubt lies in whether the government is able or qualified for such conduct, that is, whether it can ban the use of programs carried by foreign satellites. Regarding its legal authority, there is no ambiguity on this matter in the Constitution. Even in the democratic systems based on liberalism [preceding word in English], which on principle should be indifferent to values, the issue of safeguarding public decency is an exception. It is for this reason that in many of the American states there are restrictions on the establishment of gambling dens, brothels, and how much bodily exposure is permissible. Similarly, a man cannot have more than one wife at a time and vice versa. However, the implications of public decency are unwritten in the West, but in our system they are very clear, sensible and in accordandance with the shari'ah. Some people do not consider it proper that the government should impose a ban, even though there is no legal hindrance. Their main reasoning has two axes: The first is that banning the public from acquiring these programs will only increase their curiosity, and the second is that the government cannot impose laws on this matter, whether at the level of our current technology or when the acquisition of such programs becomes easier. It cannot go from house to house to supervise the implementation of its laws. [passage omitted] 5. What is the prospect for the future? One of the characteristics of our great contemporary revolution is that of operational information. Perhaps information in itself may not have progressed greatly, but it has maintained its swift and evolutionary course and it is the operational information that brought about revolutionary upheavals. [passage omitted] 6. To sum up: A. The future of communications is not in the proliferation of the use of the satellites by individuals. Instead, an important development will be the establishment of informational highways with ease, which will place a massive capability on informational traffic within reach of the home or workplace of individuals with the help of fiber optics. This information will not consist solely of television programs, but will also open up other vast horizons. B. In the last few years of the 20th century, there is a suitable opportunity for the dear people of our country to be aware of these developments and to learn the correct and useful way of utilizing the current facilities. One should admit that the correct way of utilizing radio and television has not been spelled out to the people. One should not think that this consists merely of switching equipment on and off or knowing directions! If modern communications equipment is utilized with awareness (regarding information pollution), it can certainly be said that the usefulness of human life can be extended manifold. This means that if today individuals can abandon their negligence in this field, their apparent lifespan of 60-70 years can become more useful than a mere existence of a few thousand years or more! In fact, age is a treasure that needs to be explored! C. Just as it has been mentioned in the country's plan for economic and social development, the Communications Department should prepare itself to join the current modern trend of information. The social, cultural, and scientific departments of the country should prepare the people for optimum utilization and on how to remain safe from the harmful effects of satellite programs. A legal ban on the use of communications satellites, which is a temporary technology for individual use, will stress the cultural aspects of those programs that are permitted. Of course, the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran should transmit a selection of these programs some hours daily for the benefit of the public.
