The officials say their judgment is based on the North's current military power, the combined defense capability of South Korean and U.S. military forces, and the political stands of major powers around the peninsula including the United States, China and Russia. Pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) this week, inviting possible sanctions by the United Nations and heightening tension on the peninsula. The United Nations Security Council is discussing adoption of a draft sanctions resolution, while North Korea has warned that any sanctions would amount to a "declaration of war." As further grounds for their assessment, the defense officials are citing vulnerable points that undercut the North's quantitative military superiority over the South. The performance of North Korea's weapons systems, ministry officials explained, is not very good and the "military exercise period" of its Air Force and Navy is only one-third that of the South. Moreover, the ability of the North's quartermaster supply including war material and ammunition is low, the officials said. In particular, shortages of oil and food would hamper North Korea from continuing an all-out war over a certain perriod of time. The rates of self-supply for oil and food are just 40 percent and 60 percent, respectively, according to the ministry. On the combined defense capability of South Korean and U.S. Forces, the ministry said that even if North Korea provoked a war, the South Korea-U.S. combined military power could repel an attack in the early stages. Hundreds of thousands of ground forces, several carrier battle groups, hundreds of warships and thousands of fighter planes would be added to the current combined forces to produce an overwhelming victory against North Korea in a very short period. With its war capacity, the Defense Ministry expects that North Korea would not dare to provoke an armed conflict unless Kim Il-song gave in to despair and decided to commit virtual suicide, the officials said. Finally, although Russia and China have not expressed support for a UN sanctions resolution, they do not want North Korea to develop nuclear weapons, either. That point is an important factor mitigating against war on the Korean peninsula, they emphasized. These countries are not actively supporting UN sanctions against North Korea in a bid to increase their influence, but it is unlikely they would back the reclusive nation militarily if it provoked a war. "North Korea could never provoke a war under the circumstances," a senior official said. "The United States can easily concentrate its military power on the Korean peninsula since it is not intervening militarily anywhere in the world at the moment." But the officials are not ruling out the possibility that North Korea may provoke a local skirmish near the truce line.
