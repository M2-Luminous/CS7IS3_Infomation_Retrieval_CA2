"We have new military and diplomatic initiatives which the President will likely discuss later today," White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said. Clinton met twice with his national security advisers for some four hours Tuesday [19 April] on how to deal with the worsening situation in Bosnia, especially in the encircled Bosnian Muslim enclave of Gorazde. It was reported that the U.S. plan included the support of wider use of air power against the Bosnia Serbs, not only in the six U.N.-authorized "safe areas" for the Muslims but on other Serb strategic positions. The plan also called for tougher economic sanctions against the Serb republic, seen by the West as supporter of the Bosnian Serbs in perpetuating the two-year war. In Brussels, NATO officials discussed the wider use of air power on Bosnia but no final decision was reached. Analysts believe that little objection will be expected to stiffer sanctions on Serbia but the military moves might encounter differences because many European countries have troops on the ground in Bosnia and their governments fear Serb retaliations.
