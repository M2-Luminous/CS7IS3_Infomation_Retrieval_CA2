Pyongyang Mixes Harsh Rhetoric With Signs of Moderation SUMMARY With the specter of economic sanctions over the nuclear issue looming larger, Pyongyang media have sharpened their rhetoric against Washington. At the same time, Pyongyang radio aired a leadership view that indicated a strong preference for a negotiated settlement, a possible sign that pragmatists within the North Korean leadership may be counseling a less confrontational approach to the nuclear issue. END SUMMARY Following last week's harshly worded Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement that accused Washington of bad faith, Pyongyang raised its confrontational rhetoric another notch. A 3 February followup commentary in the party paper Nodong Sinmun seemed to go beyond the Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement by hinting at possible military confrontation and by warning that North Korean verbal threats should be taken seriously (Pyongyang radio, 3 February). Sounding a belligerent note, the commentary declared that continued U.S. "pressure" on the DPRK will result ultimately in North Korea taking "concrete action." The commentary went on to declare that North Koreans are "completely prepared politically, ideologically, militarily, and materially to cope with any unexpected situation," and warned that "those who act rashly and and recklessly will face only shameful defeat." It cautioned, "What we say is not empty words. We do not like to issue idle talk." Assessment of Talks In sharp contrast to the belligerence apparent in both the 31 January Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement and the 3 February commentary, Pyongyang radio on 4 February reported remarks by a high North Korean official that accentuated the positive aspect of bilateral talks with Washington on the nuclear issue. At a 1 February Moscow press conference held in support of the Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, according to the radio, DPRK Ambassador to Russia Son Song-pil reiterated the now standard accusation that Washington is not interested in a negotiated settlement, but stopped short of following the line set in the earlier spokesman's statement and depicted bilateral negotiations as a "delaying tactic" on the part of the United States. On the contrary, he cited the DPRK- U.S. joint statement, issued at the first round of high-level bilateral talks last June, and unspecified "certain progress" he claimed was achieved at the second round in July, as positive accomplishments. The tenor of Son's assessment was in sharp contrast to the 31 January spokesman's statement, which dismissed the DPRK-U.S. talks as having been used by Washington merely to "buy time" to prepare for "crushing" North Korea. Moreover, the comments by Son, who in the 1980's headed the North Korean Red Cross and was instrumental in bringing about inter-Korean exchanges of family visits and art troupes, suggested that a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue is still within reach. While chiding Washington for allegedly leading the talks to a potential "rupture," he stated that this had happened at a "decisive moment when a bright vista for a complete resolution of the nuclear issue . . . is being opened up," an upbeat assessment of the talks Pyongyang had not used in recent weeks. Implications Pyongyang's publicity for Ambassador Son's press conference appears part of its carefully calibrated media campaign to signal its preference for a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue, its heightened rhetoric notwithstanding. Son's upbeat portrayal of DPRK-U.S. nuclear negotiations seems likely to represent views of pragmatists within the North Korean leadership who are pressing for amelioration of Pyongyang's current international isolation as a means to preserve the regime.
