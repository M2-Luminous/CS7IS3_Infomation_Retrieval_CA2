Made on the heels of the 21 February banking deregulation decree, the move, which "significantly alters the balance of power between ABRA and ADEBA," according to CLARTN of 10 March, may be the beginning of "even greater bloodletting" from ABRA, as "part of a strategy to force a merger of the two banking organizations." While ABRA was unhappy about the Citibank decision, as well as fearful that other members might follow suit, private Argentine banks were pleased to have the country's most important foreign bank as a new member of their group. "It is an honor for us," asserted ADEBA head Eduardo Escasany. The two banking organizations came out on opposite sides of the debate over the new banking competitiveness rules, which opened up the Argentine market to foreign banks without requiring "reciprocity" from their home countries. ADEBA, demanding reciprocity, was the first to "scream bloody murder" over the new rules aimed at reducing interest rates and the cost of banking services in general, according to the 9 March LA NACION. On the other hand, ABRA said the measures would "stimulate competition" while increasing efficiency. When asked whether the "oversized" Argentine banking market, totaling 164 private and public banks according to Central Bank data, would discourage foreign banks from establishing themselves in Argentina, ABRA economic adviser Jorge Lopez replied that investment banks linked to the capital market would probably be interested as long as the market remained stable and profitable. He doubted, however, that commercial banks would enter the market due to high costs. Quilmes Bank official Carlos Perez cited "the possible reduction in interest rates and an increase in capital inflows" as advantages of market deregulation. However, he pointed to the possibility of greater capital outflows as a disadvantage. "Foreign banks will send their profits back to their countries of origin." According to the 13 March CLARIN, large banks in Brazil and Chile as well as Spain's Bilbao Vizcaya Bank (BBV) have already shown interest in taking advantage of the newly deregulated Argentine banking market. Brazil's largest private banking group, Bradesco (Brazilian Discount Bank), is "very interested" in adding to its current network of 3,000 branches. If successful in this endeavor, Bradesco will become the first Brazilian bank in Buenos Aires to have an aggressive Mercosur [Common Market of the South]-oriented policy. Although other Brazilian banks have yet to "pound the local pavement," businessmen say that deregulation is attractive enough to bring them to Argentina within the next few months. Among Chilean banks said to be interested in the Argentine market are O'Higgins, one of Chile's "heavyweights;" BICE, which belongs to the Eleodoro Mate Group; and the Edwards Group, owner of the daily EL MERCURIO. Among other Latin American countries, Uruguay is the most likely candidate to enter the market, according to CLARIN.
