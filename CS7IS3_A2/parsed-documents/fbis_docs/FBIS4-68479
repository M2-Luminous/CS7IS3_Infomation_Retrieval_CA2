On the whole this phenomenon is characteristic not only of Russia but the world, and it is being imposed by "mondialism," that is, the aspiration of certain powerful financial and political forces to control the world ("mondialism" comes from the French word "monde," that is, "world"). This project is otherwise known as the plan for "world government"). Specific organizations that are the most highly involved in the realization of mondialist plans are primarily the Bilderberg Club and the Trilateral Commission. It is these structures that formerly "proposed and realized" ("imposed") perestroyka in the USSR; it is they that via the United States, the IMF, and the World Bank and also via the "public" institutions and foundations that are dependent on them are attempting (and not unsuccessfully) to control domestic policy processes in present-day Russia. There is no doubt that the activity of such "mondialist structures" does not receive extensive coverage but they are not strictly secret and they periodically reveal certain aspects of their activity via their publications--such as TRIALOGUE, THE FEDERALIST, AUSSENPOLITIK, THE WORLD TODAY, and so forth. In recent years these mondialist journals have devoted the largest number of their articles to Russia and the former Soviet republics. This points to the immense significance the architects of "world government" attach to events in our country. Russian readers would be interested to learn what these architects think of our situation since, most regrettably, with the present government their theoretical plans become almost instantaneously our social reality. Regional Triad Mondialists see the world as being divided into three main regions: American (with the domination of the United States), European, and Pacific (with the domination of Japan). It is for this reason that the main mondialist organization, the Trilateral Commission, is called trilateral: Its principal participants are the representatives of these three "developed, market regions." These regions, in the mondialists' thinking, should in the future become the three columns of a single world state. But at the present stage they are assigned the role of the expansive absorption into themselves of the expanses that are "undeveloped" or "insufficiently developed." Russia, naturally, falls into the category of such "insufficiently developed" states from the market viewpoint. Plans for Russia The mondialist authorities have two fundamental scenarios for Russia in the sense of its integration in the world market (and it is this that is the Mondialists' aim). The first plan anticipated a change in the economic structure of the former USSR and the transition to a market economy with the preservation of the political control of the former Soviet leadership and within the framework of a unified state. In this outlook a "democratized" USSR was to have blended into the regional European bloc. This was what Gorbachev was talking about when uttering words about the "common European home." But Gorbachev's fall forced the mondialists to abandon this version of the USSR's socioeconomic integration. The second version was the disarticulation of the USSR and, subsequently, of the Russian Federation for the entry of the intraregional expanses into the various "market blocs"--both European and Pacific and even a direct "pro-American" bloc (of the colonies or protectorate type--this model was intended for the Baltic republics, Kazakhstan, and a number of oblasts of Russia). Gorbachev's incapacity for realizing the first plan forced the mondialists to concentrate on the second, which became the main strategic line of Yeltsin's policy. But there was a certain breakdown here also. Communism, Democracy, and Nationalism The mondialist journal THE WORLD TODAY analyzed the stymieing of the second plan for the "mondialization" of Russia in its January 1994 issue. From the experts' viewpoint, the main obstacle to Russia's entry into the market is "collectivism," a quality that is not compatible with market individualist ideology and mentality. And this collectivism has been manifested at three levels, what is more. There is historically in residual but strong form in Russians "communist-type collectivism" (first level). When on this instinctive collectivism the policy of "democracy" (second level), that is, another "collectivist" political form, was superimposed, a new type of collectivism--"nationalism" (third level)--was manifested. This occurred, what is more, not only in the Russian milieu but also among other peoples that were left in an uncertain state following the disintegration of the USSR. Consequently, new obstacles to subsequent mondialist integration in market regions arose in this version of fragmentation of the single political space also. It was as a forced abandonment of democracy under such conditions (inasmuch as it indirectly contributes to the appearance of a new and very dangerous, anti-mondialist, form of "collectivism"--"nationalism") that the mondialists perceived the shooting up of the Supreme Soviet and the abrogation of the current constitution. The authors of THE WORLD TODAY and THE FEDERALIST make no secret of the fact that this was an antidemocratic measure, necessary, however, for combating "collectivism." Crisis of Mondialism in Russia But even this extraordinary measure involving the shooting up of the parliament did not do much to improve the situation concerning Russia's membership of the "new world order." Nationalism has not been conquered (the results of the December elections are a striking example of this); the communist opposition has not surrendered; and democracy has not renounced its political embodiment (the critical position of certain democratic publications in respect to the liberal terrorism in October 1994 [as published] is an example of this). It was after December that a majority of mondialist voices began to talk about the "return of Gorbachev," that is, about the need to bring to power in Russia a force, obedient to the West, of a "social democratic" persuasion with the possible reconstitution of a "common space on the territory of the former USSR." Thus Gorbachev himself snatched from the opposition "Eurasian" slogans, which were also usurped by certain Yeltsinites--Shakhray, Stankevich, and so forth. However that may be, the mondialists today believe that the second version of integration has failed hopelessly and that it is necessary to return to the first version or its new modernized form. Patriotic Plan Patriots today do not have the right to ignore the plans of the mondialists since their strength both in the foreign policy and the domestic life of the country is immense. It is the mondialists who initiated the changes in Russia, which the people and the opposition resisted merely passively, constantly several moves behind. Today the mondialists are in crisis and they frankly acknowledge this in their semiclassified publications. The opposition must not miss its opportunity on this occasion. It is required not only to end the processes of the disintegration of the motherland for its inclusion bit by bit in a regional triad but also to prevent the "return of Gorbachev" or a "collective Gorbachev" in the shape of "centrists" and repainted "reformers" in the service of mondialism. Russia's patriots must formulate their own plan of the country's future. But it should be remembered that the simple isolationism that existed up to perestroyka is hardly possible today. The mondialists are strong and powerful. They would never permit this. The patriotic plan should, therefore, be, in my opinion, in a sense "international" and totally anti-mondialist since only the mutual solidarity of all the world's anti-mondialist forces--left, right, center, and so forth--can alter the fatal course of contemporary geopolitical transformations. Only the solidarity of various peoples and states of the planet united by a common desire and a common will to themselves determine their historical destiny and the particular features of their internal arrangement can be the alternative to "world government."
