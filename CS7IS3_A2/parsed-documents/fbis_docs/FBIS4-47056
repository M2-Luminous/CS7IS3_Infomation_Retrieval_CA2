Today Russia and China call themselves partners. And this is not without foundation. Not only have political and economic relations become fully reestablished in recent years--these relations continue to develop intensively today. Nonetheless, quite a number of problems remain. Both sides are therefore placing great hopes in the visit to Beijing of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, which began yesterday. Paradoxical though it may seem at first glance, the greatest problems have accumulated precisely in that sphere where a qualitative leap has recently been achieved--in trade, the volume of which increased 30 percent last year, amounting to $7.68 billion. Among Russia's trading partners, China has pushed Italy aside and now occupies second place, after the FRG. A number of experts have hastened to predict that by 1995, the bilateral trade turnover will pass the record level of $10 billion. However, indices for the first two months of this year have poured water on the hopes of the optimists--trade was reduced by almost 50 percent as compared with the level for the same period of 1993. The reason? As the poet expressed it, "there is one answer and it is terribly simple." Bilateral trade has to date been extensive in nature and based on two key elements--"shuttles" and barter (up to 65 percent of the trade volume). The first of these was eliminated by the visa mode of operation introduced at the beginning of the year, curtailing what used to be a virtually unrestricted flow of goods out of the PRC (as this KOMMERSANT-DAILY columnist was told in Blagoveshchensk, steamships used to come from the Chinese bank of the Amur loaded just about to the top of their smokestacks). While the blow to barter, the Chinese believe, was inflicted by Russia's introduction of high import duties. But this is just one side of the coin. The other side is the low quality of Chinese goods offered for exchange. Thus, in 1992 the Chinese managed to purchase 26 Su-27 fighters from Russia, paying for them with sneakers and feather beds, most of which, a Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations employee told the KOMMERSANT-DAILY columnist, are today gathering dust in warehouses, unsold because of their poor quality. [begin box] Status of Russian Indebtedness to China Russia's Credit Indebtedness to China --$570 million--settlement-clearing indebtedness for goods delivery shortages to China, 1986-1990; --$350 million--credits extended by China in 1990 for the purchase of food, raw materials for food production, and consumer goods; --$670--credits extended by China in 1991 for the above-mentioned purposes; In 1994 Russia must deliver goods to the PRC amounting to about $290 million, to pay off 1990 credits and the interest on these credits. Settlement-clearing indebtedness for 1986-1990 will be paid off almost entirely in 1994 through deliveries of military equipment and other special property. [end box] During his visit to China, Chernomyrdin must find a way out of this situation which is capable of bringing economic ties between the two countries to an impasse. The two sides will evidently try to reach compromise on the visa mode of operation--visas for inhabitants of the border regions will either be canceled or replaced by multiple-use visas (true, it is up to the Chinese to do something here--they have not yet been able to determine their "multiple-exit" citizens). While barter may be replaced by mutual accounting operations using currency. Chernomyrdin might also convince the Chinese of the advantages of expanding military-technical cooperation. Russia is counting on the shipment of another consignment of Su-27's, Il-76 transport aircraft, and military helicopters. Moscow also hopes to sell submarines to Beijing. But rumors regarding the sale of an aircraft carrier have turned out to be exaggerated. They were refuted on the eve of the visit by Mikhail Belyy, director of the First Asia Department of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in an interview with ITAR-TASS. [begin box] Most Important Items in Export-Import Transactions Between Russia and China Russia exports to China (percentage of total exports): --machinery and equipment (30 percent) --ferrous and nonferrous metals (13 percent) --mineral fertilizers and raw chemicals (45 percent) Russia imports from China (percentage of total imports): --machinery and equipment (10 percent) --chemical products (4 percent) --raw minerals (7 percent) --industrial and consumer goods (45 percent) Volume of trade in 1993--$7.68 million. Of this amount, exports constitute $4.99 million, imports--$2.69 million. Russia's positive trade balance is $2.3 million. [end box] But Moscow should not be counting on much in the export of arms. After all, even during the years when "Russians and Chinese were brothers forever," the USSR transferred to the PRC about 25,000 packages of documentation enabling the PRC to set up their output of tanks, small arms, and other armament. But it is precisely these types of armament that essentially constitute Russian export items. And with regard to military equipment not produced in China, Beijing is asking that it be sold production licenses (for those same Su-27's, for example). One other circumstance should not be permitted to disappear from view--the fact that Moscow is not (and most likely never will be) the leading partner of the PRC. Trade turnover between the PRC and United States, for example, has already reached $40 billion, and Washington's threats to deny Beijing most-favored-nation trade status because of its human rights violations in Tiananmen will apparently remain only words. Bill Clinton does not intend to confirm this status today or tomorrow. And Beijing has a real chance to become a member of GATT by mid-1995. Production in the most developed Chinese regions--the southern regions--is oriented toward the West. In this regard, the conclusion drawn by the British publication FINANCIAL TIMES--that the PRC views Russia not as a prospective equal-rights trading partner, but exclusively as a source of inexpensive raw materials and customer for second-rate Chinese consumer goods--does not appear all that groundless.
