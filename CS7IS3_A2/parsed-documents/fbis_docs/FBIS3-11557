Good morning from Havana, Rey. [Rodriguez] Good morning Cavada, and good morning to all your Radio Rebelde listeners. [Cavada] Well, according to PRENSA LATINA, I understand that the Cuban foreign minister has a heavy agenda there and that he also met with the Vietnamese Communist Party [VCP] first secretary. What is the story about this and what other details can you tell the Cuban people? [Rodriguez] Well, I have a very few minutes to tell you all about the foreign minister's acitivities today, that is, on his second day in Hanoi, capital of Vietnam. But as you said, only a few minutes ago the Cuban foreign minister was received by VCP General Secretary Do Muoi. This meeting, which was termed by Robaina as very fruitful, lasted almost two hours. Do Muoi expressed interest in the Cuban foreign minister's visit to seven Asian countries which in addition to Vietnam, includes Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, India, and Myanmar [Burma]. Robaina explained to the VCP leader that the objective of his tour of these Asian countries is to explain what we are doing in our country and to listen to many points of view as part of an offensive being carried out by the Cuban Foreign Ministry. This offensive began in the Caribbean, then continued in Latin America and Africa, and now in Asia. During this meeting Robaina handed over to Do Muoi a message by Commander in Chief Fidel Castro which conveys the feelings of [word indistinct] for what the Vietnamese people are doing. Do Muoi said he is convinced that current difficulties affecting the island are transitory and that the Cubans will know how to overcome them. He added that we must be very careful in taking the right path in this renewal process, especially the one being carried out by Vietnam, because there are many detours from the correct path that can jeopardize the sovereignty and independence of the two countries. He added that in times like this, the party's ideological nature must be strengthened to keep it united and sound. Well, the Cuban foreign minister had previously held several meetings with the ministers of commerce and agriculture, with the chairman of the State Committee for Cooperation and Investments, and in all these meetings both parties have expressed their interest in strengthening commercial ties in areas such as biotechnology, construction, agriculture, and maritime transportation. As I was saying, the importance of creating joint ventures was stressed, especially in the areas of construction and of veterinary pharmaceuticals. I also want to tell you that Robaina held a meeting with members of political and grassroot organizations here in Vietnam. During those meetings we obtained an exclusive interview granted to Rebelde by Ho Duc Viet, secretary of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union. [Begin Ho Duc Viet recording in Vietnamese with simultaneous translation into Spanish] We are organizing a campaign for a contribution of 5 million [currency not specified] worth of school supplies for the Cuban children. Practically all people have responded favorably to this campaign. In the beginning we organized this campaign among the youth alone, but then we extended it to the country's overall population, including the women, the aged, and state organizations. The campaign has already concluded. We collected more than $500,000, and all that money will be used to purchase notebooks, pencils, and other school utensils for children. We are now waiting for a ship to transfer these supplies to Cuba. [end recording] Tomorrow the Cuban foreign minister will grant a news conference. Present at the news conference will also be the diplomatic corps accredited to Vietnam. Then Robaina will leave for the southern part of Vietnam, namely to Ho Chi Minh City where he will have an intensive working schedule, including a meeting with the provincial party first secretary. He will also visit the special industrial processing zone developed in cooperation with Taiwan. Robaina today also met with the minister of youth and sports, with the chief of the VCP Central Committee International Relations Commission. He indeed had an intensive working schedule, but in all these meetings the friendship and love between these two peoples have prevailed, in addition to their traditional ties of friendship. Thank you, Cavada, and greetings to all listeners of Rebelde. [Cavada] Thank you Rey for these expanded details of the Cuban foreign minister's activities in Vietnam.
