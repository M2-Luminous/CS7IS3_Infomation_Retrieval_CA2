Abramov and M.S. Chernyakov under the ``Antenna and Waveguide Technology and Wave Propagation'' rubric; received after rework Nov.18,1991; UDC 621.396.96] [Abstract] Discrete control of phased antenna arrays (PAAs) causes additional errors in setting the angular position of a beam. In some cases discreteness errors considerably limit the accuracy of angular measurements. The objective of the work was to synthesize an aperture algorithm for calculating phase distributions (FDs) of PAAs with discrete phasing that do not have the drawbacks of other known methods for reducing the total error. The proposed algorithm for calculating phase distribution of a two-dimensional PAA of N x N elements with discrete phasing makes it possible to compensate for errors of discrete direction of a PAA. In terms of the accuracy beam guidance the algorithm is equivalent to averaging the directivity diagram by isophase supports. It makes it possible to reduce the angular error of beam setting with low aperture expenditures and high speed of the FD computer. Figures 2, tables 2, references 2.
