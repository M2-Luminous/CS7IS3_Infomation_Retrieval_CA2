Speaking at a meeting with Egyptian correspondents in Washington, Field Marshal Tantawi said: In view of the changes dictated by the new world order, there is a constant need to develop and strengthen the Egyptian Armed Forces in the armaments and training fields. He added: Our Armed Forces should maintain a particular standard of strength and efficiency to play their role in establishing regional security in participation with the international community. He stressed that achieving this will be an investment in human resources, which will benefit society in every field. The defense minister noted that the Armed Forces are constantly working to introduce advanced technology and modern training and armament systems and that this will be among the issues he will discuss in his meetings with U.S. officials. Field Marshal Muhammad Husayn Tantawi said: The Egyptian Armed Forces belong to the Egyptian people alone. According to this concept, the Armed Forces serve the Egyptian people and their development is an extremely important investment. The stronger these Armed Forces are the more capable they will be of protecting society and the homeland from any aggression. The defense minister stressed that strengthening the Armed Forces will make them a deterrent force that others would have to consider, because any aggressor will have to think deeply before committing any aggression if he realizes that these forces can repel him. Field Marshal Tantawi went on to say that U.S.-Egyptian cooperation in the military production sphere, both with regard to the advanced M1A tanks and other weapons, is proceeding well and that there are numerous opportunities for developing and expanding the scope of this cooperation.
