FR940825-1-00114 FR940825-1-00009 A common concern raised by both Tribes and States during the development of this proposed rule was the potential for sources located on State or Tribal lands to adversely impact air quality on downwind State or Tribal lands. EPA is proposing in this rule that the CAA protections against interstate pollutant transport apply with equal force to States and Tribes. Thus, for example, EPA is proposing that the prohibitions and authority contained in sections 110(a)(2)(D) and 126 of the CAA apply to Tribes in the same manner as States. Section 110(a)(2)(D), among other things, requires States to include provisions in their SIPs that prohibit emissions activity within the State from significantly contributing to nonattainment, interfering with maintenance of the NAAQS, or interfering with measures under the PSD or visibility protection programs in another State. Section 126 authorizes any State to petition EPA to enforce these prohibitions against a State containing an allegedly offending source or group of sources. 2. Exceptions to Tribal Implementation EPA notes at the outset that recurring provisions for which EPA is proposing not to treat Tribes in the same manner as States involve certain Clean Air Act submittal deadlines. The Act contains many deadlines that mandate the submittal of a State plan, program or other requirement by certain dates. However, Tribes are not similarly compelled to develop and seek approval of air programs. Section 301(d)(2) provides for EPA to promulgate regulations specifying ``those provisions of this [Act] for which it is appropriate to treat Indian tribes as States'' but does not require Indian Tribes to develop CAA programs. Further, the State program submittal deadlines in the statute are based upon a relatively long history of Clean Air Act planning and implementation by States. 14 States have assumed an active role in Clean Air Act implementation since the 1970 Amendments to the Act. By comparison, in substantial part, Tribal authority for Clean Air Act programs was expressly addressed in the Act for the first time in the 1990 Amendments. Tribes, therefore, are at best in the early stages of developing air program expertise and planning efforts. Accordingly, EPA believes it would be both infeasible and inappropriate to subject Tribes to the State program submittal and related deadlines in the statute as explained in more detail below. 14 Note also that many of the submittal deadlines run from the enactment of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act on November 15, 1990. Therefore, Tribes submitting programs in response to the final rule authorizing the treatment of Tribes as States for those provisions would already be substantially behind in meeting the deadlines. A related set of provisions are the sanctions and other Federal oversight mechanisms in the Act which are triggered when States fail to meet the air program submittal deadlines called for in the Act or when EPA disapproves a program submittal. In several instances, the Act mandates the imposition of sanctions, such as Federal transportation funding restrictions and two-to-one new source review offsets, by a specific deadline if a State fails to timely submit a required program or submits a program that is not fully approvable. E.g., CAA sections 179 and 502(d)(2)(B). Similarly, the Act often imposes specific deadlines upon EPA for issuing a Federal program within a certain period after a State fails to submit a program or after EPA disapproves an inadequate State program. E.g. , CAA sections 110(c)(1) and 502(d)(3). For the reasons stated above, EPA is proposing not to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for certain provisions contained in these sections.
