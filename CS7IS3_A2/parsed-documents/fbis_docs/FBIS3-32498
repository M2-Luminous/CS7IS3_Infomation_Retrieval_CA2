The Central Reserve Bank today reported that 42 percent of El Salvador's overall exports go to Central America, 30 percent to the United States, 7 percent to Germany, while the remainder are distributed among several other nations. The bank also reported that Guatemala is El Salvador's main trading partner. Meanwhile, exports to Mexico doubled over the past two years from $8 million to $16 million in 1993. The bank also reported that the GDP rose 5 percent in 1993, and it is expected to increase 6 percent in 1994. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2047 GMT 1 Feb 94) An economic analysis indicates that exports have doubled from 1989 to 1993, going from $600 million to more than $1.1 billion. This translates into a better standard of living and more resources for the people and the nation. Overall export growth has been driven by an increase in nontraditional exports, particularly in the assembly plant sector. Also, while coffee prices have fallen, coffee exports have increased.

The bank's goals are to contribute to economic growth and to generate jobs by financing capital investments in the private sector. Orellana reports that the bank will receive a $30 million credit from the International Development Bank to implement a program to bolster small businesses. This new banking institution will only grant loans to the private sector for investment projects.

Among those product groups that have shown signs of growth are basic grains, coffee, and sugar cane. An increase in the number of manzanas cultivated nationwide helped increase the overall harvest from 18.4 million quintals in 1989 to more than 21 quintals in 1993. In addition, credits to the agricultural sector have increased from 1.3 million colones in 1989 to 3.2 million colones in 1993. (San Salvador EL DIARIO DE HOY in Spanish 4 Feb 94 p 13)
