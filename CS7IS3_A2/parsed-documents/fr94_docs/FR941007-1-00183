FR941007-1-00183 FR941007-1-00011 These regulations will improve the efficiency of the Federal student aid programs and, by so doing, improve their capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. Encouraging students to graduate from high school and to pursue high quality postsecondary education are important elements of the National Education Goals. The student aid programs also enable both current and future workers to have the opportunity to acquire both basic and technologically advanced skills needed for today's and tomorrow's workplace. They provide the financial means for an increasing number of Americans to receive an education that will prepare them to think critically, communicate effectively, and solve problems efficiently, as called for in the National Education Goals. Proposed Regulatory Changes The Secretary proposes to amend the following sections of the regulations to reflect changes needed to conform the FFEL Program to the proposed regulations for the Direct Loan Program. Those changes not related to the Direct Loan Program are otherwise noted. Section 682.200␣Definitions Estimated cost of attendance _The Secretary proposes to delete this definition from this section. This definition will be added as an appendix to the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations at 34 CFR Part 668. Estimated financial assistance _Language that was inadvertently deleted from the FFEL Program final regulations published on June 28, 1994 (59 FR 33334) has been restored and slightly revised. This change would make the regulations consistent with the current definition in the Direct Loan Program NPRM and the definition previously included in the December 18, 1992 FFEL regulations, with a minor revision to reflect the 1993 statutory change that includes the amount of the origination fee and the insurance premium in calculating the student's cost of attendance. Section 682.201␣Eligible borrowers Section 682.201(a)(4)(i)_The Secretary proposes to remove the requirement that, to receive a new loan, a borrower must reaffirm any FFEL loan amount that previously was canceled due to the borrower's total and permanent disability. Section 682.205␣Disclosure requirements for lenders Section 682.205(a)(2)(ix)_The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations to require a lender to answer questions from borrowers regarding the loan application process and provide information about the terms and conditions for consolidating FFEL Program loans and the types of loans that may be consolidated. The Secretary believes that borrower access to this information is critical in light of the expanded repayment options available to consolidation loan borrowers. This proposed change is also consistent with the obligation assumed by the Direct Loan servicer in the Direct Loan Program that, although not specified in Direct Loan Program regulations, is assumed by the servicer as part of its contract with the Department. Section 682.207␣Due Diligence in Disbursing a Loan Section 682.207(d)(2)(iii)_With regard to late disbursements, the Secretary proposes to permit a lender in certain circumstances to make a late disbursement more than 60 days after the student ceases to be enrolled at the school on at least a half-time basis, or after the end of the period of enrollment, as applicable. However, a lender may make a late disbursement within 30 days after the standard 60-day period provided for in §682.207 only in documented exceptional circumstances, such as a student's serious, unexpected illness, with the prior approval of the guaranty agency. The Secretary has proposed a comparable provision in the Direct Loan Program. Section 682.402␣Death, Disability, Closed School, False Certification, and Bankruptcy Payments Section 682.402(e)(13)(iii)_The NPRM proposes to simplify the language of this provision to conform to the Direct Loan Program proposed regulations. Section 682.602␣Schedule Requirements for Courses of Study by Correspondence Section 682.602(a)_The Secretary has modified the language in this section to conform to the Direct Loan Program proposed regulations. Section 682.604␣Processing the Borrower's Loan Proceeds and Counseling Borrowers Section 682.604(d)(1)(ii)(B)_The Secretary proposes to modify the requirement that the school, as a fiduciary for the benefit of the student, must retain loan proceeds held at the student's request to assist the student in budgeting, in a designated trust account. Instead, the regulations propose to allow the school to maintain these funds in a separately-designated subsidiary account under its general bank account. The Secretary has proposed a comparable provision for the Direct Loan Program.
