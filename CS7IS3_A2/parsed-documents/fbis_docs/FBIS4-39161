People's deputy Petro Sheyko said that in accordance with the application, Vasyl Durdynets was dismissed from the post of chairman of the "Center" group. Anton Buteyko was elected its chairman and Volodymyr Yavorivskyy and Valeriy Kolomoytsev were elected his deputies. An issue on the draft law "On introducing amendments and additions to the law "On the formation of local bodies of power and self-government," approved at the first reading on 2 June, was put on the agenda. Serhiy Sobolev, member of the commission for issues of legal policy and judicial and legal reform, reported that at the sitting of the commission on 2 June, attended by all interested deputies, it was resolved to submit only one amendment for consideration by the session: to cancel direct elections of chairmen of oblast councils and hold elections of chairmen of the Kiev and Sevastopol city councils. According to Serhiy Sobolev, such an amendment to the law will essentially change the election procedure and, therefore, relevant amendments should be introduced to the constitution of Ukraine. After a brief discussion two proposals were submitted for consideration: one by Serhiy Sobolev and also a proposal by Vasyl Kornelyuk not to consider amendments to the law at all, because there is only little time before the elections. After a break, representatives of groups and groupings were given the floor to speak on the issue under consideration. Representatives of National Democratic groups insisted on the necessity to cancel direct elections of chairmen of oblast councils because, in their opinion, this would inevitably lead to the emergence of "25 princes accountable neither to the Supreme Council nor to the head of state." Serhiy Holovatyy reminded that the decision on direct elections was approved at the request of Ivan Plyushch with no written text available to the deputies and in the absence of a quorum. Representatives of left-wing groups as well as the interregional deputy grouping and "Unity" group insisted on the necessity of preserving direct elections of chairmen of oblast councils. By a majority of votes the proposal by the Supreme Council commission for issues of legal policy and judicial and legal reform to cancel direct elections of chairmen of oblast councils was declined, After this the deputies continued to approve the composition of the Supreme Council standing commissions.
