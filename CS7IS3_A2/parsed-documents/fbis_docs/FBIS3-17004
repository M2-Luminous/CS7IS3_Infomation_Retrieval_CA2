A senior Russian delegate told Interfax on Friday that the negotiators "agreed on a number of points in the inter-state accord, on which they earlier disagreed." In his words, "Kazakh representatives responded with understanding to Russia's arguments that the launch site should be leased for no less than thirty years." He also said that a positive solution to the issue was taking shape among both the military and civilians at Baykonur. He pointed out that there was the narrowing of positions on tripartite cooperation in the exploration of space between Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. The sides are near an agreement on the joint use of the launch pad for a Russo-Ukrainian Zenith booster at Baykonur. He confirmed that the problem of compensation to Kazakhstan for the use of Baykonur over the previous two years would be discussed by a special commission separately from the overall talks. The Kazakh delegation is flying back to Almaty Friday night to finally coordinate its position in preparation for further negotiations in Moscow next week. According to the Russian representative, it now remains for the sides to work out the wording of an agreement on terms for the launch site's lease, and complete their work by March 26 when the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan are to sign the accord. He said the negotiators stood a real chance of completing their job by that date. As Interfax has learned from a well-placed source, President Nazarbayev is tentatively scheduled to visit Moscow on March 28-29.
