Who is to blame? ['Asfur] Beyond the self-understood condemnation, the violent event at the Ibrahimi Mosque (the Cave of the Patriarchs) reflects the collective mentality of the settlers, and not only the individual mentality of the perpetrators. The settlers would like to ruin the process over which we have been toiling so hard. They are not a threat merely to the Palestinian people, they are a threat to all those who want stability in the region. Basically, if Israel wants stability -- and it does -- the settlers are its enemies. The Israeli Government should therefore act against its enemies, hard as it may be. They are the ones who would like Israel to remain a ghetto in the region. They are a barbaric mob whose activities should be terminated. [Bekhor] How should Israel put an end to the settlers' activities in the territories? ['Asfur] I would place the emphasis on turning the settlers' acts into criminal offenses -- a criminalization of acts. That would mean that they should be tried genuinely, and not in the forgiving manner prevalent until now. They should be shown for the murderers and criminals that they really are. It is now up to Yitzhaq Rabin to prove that he can act, and not just express his regret and shame, as he told President Yasir 'Arafat. [Bekhor] The Oslo agreement, the drafting of which you took part in, acknowledges the existence of settlements during the interim period. The agreement forbids you from arguing against them remaining in place at this time, and yet senior PLO officials are now calling for their removal. ['Asfur] We agreed to the settlements remaining in place on the assumption that the settlers would be human, cooperate with the others, and that they would not pursue their activity which is barbaric and even worse, like that of animals. In the present situation, their presence has become a hazard and a threat. [Bekhor] Do you intend to reopen the settlement clause of the Cairo agreement, as we have just heard? ['Asfur] What happened in Hebron is a direct message to Yitzhaq Rabin to reconsider his security stands. As of now, he should think of more than the settlers' security; on the contrary, he should think of protecting the Palestinians. They are not the threat, they are themselves threatened. Everything we have committed ourselves to is still firm and abiding and valid as far as we are concerned, and we will remain committed to it. But what happened at the Ibrahimi Mosque will be tantamount to an Israeli violation of signed commitments, unless the matter is given genuine and serious attention. [Bekhor] How will the Hebron massacre affect the continuation of the talks with your organization? ['Asfur] The peace process is not a transient thing that is related to any one event. Anything can threaten the peace process. What is needed is a substantive change in the Israelis' political thinking. [Bekhor] Why has the PLO called for international intervention? ['Asfur] Our demand for international protection is not new, and the Oslo agreement validates it in a way. When we asked for international protection, the Israelis thought we were making slogans. Now they realize we meant it. Who will protect the Palestinians? You? When a settler is killed, all Israel is in turmoil. You contact us demanding condemnation and even threatening us. But today, a condemnation by Rabin is not enough. [Bekhor] What will happen when Palestinian rule is set up in the future? Will a similar event, in which Palestinians are murdered, suffice to ruin everything, or alternatively, will one Palestinian murderer killing settlers do it? ['Asfur] The Government of Israel should start worrying now about the possibility of Israelis being murdered. We will be responsible for the security of Palestinians. In any event, if the Israeli Government intends to protect Israelis by perpetrating daily massacres against the Palestinian people, then peace will never materialize. [Bekhor] What is your version of the chain of events during the Hebron massacre? ['Asfur] The PLO has issued an official communique, and I refer you to it. I do not believe the Israeli version. Do you believe a single man could murder so many people, and without any intervention of Israeli soldiers to boot? It was all prearranged, and there was more than one killer.
