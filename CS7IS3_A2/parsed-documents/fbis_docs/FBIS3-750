"The government accordingly believes that very firm action is now required to ensure stability within Bophuthatswana and to ensure that free and fair elections will take place throughout the territory," Mr de Klerk said in a statement to SAPA. An earlier statement released by the IEC on Saturday made no reference to the failure to obtain President Mangope's cooperation in regard to the election. "As indicated yesterday, Judge Johan Kriegler, the chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission, at the request of the government, visited President Mangope as a follow up to the announcement made earlier by President Mangope with regard to his participation in the forthcoming election," said President de Klerk's statement. "The purpose of judge Kriegler's visit was to ensure the full cooperation of President Mangope with regard to the election and all other aspects related to the electoral and constitutional process in Bophuthatswana. I have now been informed that the assurances that were sought by the IEC could not be obtained. "The government accordingly believes that very firm action is now required to ensure stability within Bophuthatswana and to ensure that free and fair elections will take place throughout the territory. I have consequently instructed Minister Roelf Meyer, who is attending this (Saturday) morning's meeting of the management committee of the TEC [Transitional Executive Council], to obtain the cooperation of the TEC for all steps which might reasonably be necessary to ensure this. Minister Meyer will be making certain specific proposals on behalf of the government in this regard." The earlier IEC statement said that during the meeting between Mr Mangope and the commission "full and cordial discussions took place regarding President Mangope's announced recommendation (to take part in the April election)". The IEC statement recalled that Mr Mangope had on Friday "issued a statement relating to a recommendation he intended making to the Bophuthatswana Parliament concerning the upcoming South African elections. Pursuant thereto and in view of the unrest that had broken out in Bophuthatswana, the IEC resolved to communicate urgently with President Mangope and also with the South African Government and the TEC. Thereafter, at the joint request of President de Klerk and Mr Mandela, Judge Kriegler and Advocate (Dikgang) Moseneke, chairman and vice-chairman of the IEC, met urgently with President Mangope in the early hours of this morning... "The IEC representatives were also requested by President Mangope to convey to Messers de Klerk and Mandela his concerns about the violence and consequent loss of life, damage to property and 'politically instigated intimidation' in his country. The IEC has reported accordingly to Messers Roelf Meyer and Cyril Ramaphosa on behalf of their principals."
