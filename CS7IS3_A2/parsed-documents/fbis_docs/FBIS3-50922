The president made these remarks the same day that Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella announced that negotiations instrumental to the mines' removal "might begin after the islands' council informs the UK Government" of the Argentine proposal. The announcement that the Argentine Government had made an offer to the United Kingdom to sweep the mines left in the archipelago after the 1982 war caused a strong controversy with regard to who would finance the operation. Menem said today: "It has been established that Argentina will remove the mines, but the UK will pay for it." During a casual chat with journalists accredited to Government House, he added: "The work might cost about $5 million."
