Therefore, their initial reaction was to reject transferring the "dirty war" to Bolivia. In this regard, the three opposition congressmen lashed out at the fact that Bill Clinton's administration has decided to give more attention to its "domestic policy," leaving the producing countries at the mercy of clashes between drug traffickers and antidrug forces that, more often than not, kill peasants and not the criminals deeply involved in drug trafficking activities. Landivar exclaimed: "We will not allow our country to become another Colombia." Paz pointed out: "A bloodbath involving innocent people will be the result of an antidrug war." Medinacelli stressed: "We cannot pay for Clinton's pragmatism." Like the Industrial Field Medinacelli compared the U.S. decision with a situation that arose a few years ago in the industrial field when the United States purchased mineral complexes from Bolivia and paid for tin alone. Nevertheless, when the United States realized that refining tin damaged the U.S. environment, it preferred the refining to be carried out in our country. The MIR congressman added: "The same happens with drug trafficking. First, the United States waged a cruel war against drug trafficking in which even politicians were involved, and now it wants this dirty war to be waged outside U.S. territory." The Armed Forces Will Not Join the War After pointing out that the U.S. contribution always involved interdiction, with its consequences of violence and death, Paz ruled out the possibility that the Armed Forces might join the struggle against drug trafficking because in the past few years the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) has managed to accumulate more "firepower" than the Bolivian Army. The CONDEPA deputy noted: "The U.S. decision will promote an antinational discussion on the viability of alternative development in our country." He Is Not Acquainted With Latin America For his part, Landivar said Clinton's decision seems to be a result of his unawareness of the positive results yielded by alternative development in the Latin American countries. In Bolivia, Landivar said, the Repentance Decree was the outcome of the social isolation to which the drug traffickers have been exposed through well-developed consciousness-raising campaigns.
