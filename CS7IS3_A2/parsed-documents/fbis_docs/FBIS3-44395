It made comprehensive arrangements for the province's 1994 propaganda and ideological work. After this conference, all comrades should arrange next year's propaganda and ideological work well in line with the guidelines of this conference and the specific conditions of all localities and departments. The propaganda and ideological fronts have always been very important because a very important advantage of our party is its ability to mobilize and organize the masses through propaganda and press work. Without this work, our party will have no advantage, and neither will our political work. This was true in the revolutionary period and will still be true when the party's work focus is shifted to economic construction. At no times should we neglect the party's propaganda and press work. Propaganda and press work is needed in our efforts to arm the entire party and the masses with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, especially with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Propaganda and press work should also be in the lead in our endeavor to implement the party's line, principles, and policies. Conditions are continuously changing in the socialist undertakings we are developing, and we are always faced with the issue of how to correctly understand the changes. This also requires that we use propaganda and press work to guide the masses to correctly understand the objective things and unify their thinking. In short, we should have correct ideology as the guide and do a good job in propaganda and press work if we are to make all our work successful. Therefore, propaganda and press work and ideological and political work are very important at all times. It represents the party's trust and is very glorious for you, comrades, to engage in the work. Our province has done a very good and effective job in propaganda and ideological work. It has provided the entire country with many good experiences in deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, and developing economic construction. This has been done through propaganda and ideological work and, therefore, embodies the painstaking efforts of our propaganda and ideological workers. On behalf of the provincial party committee, I will extend thanks to comrades on the propaganda and ideological fronts. Now, I will speak on some views on how to make Liaoning's propaganda and ideological work even better. First, to make propaganda and press work successful, a very important issue is the need to always adhere to the party's basic line to promote economic construction and other work. Currently, an important task for us is to comprehensively publicize and implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee. In particular, we should give priority to key areas according to Liaoning's reality. The ninth plenary session of the seventh provincial party committee approved the "opinions" on implementing the guidelines of the third plenary session. The "opinions" concern the general demand on Liaoning's implementation of the guidelines of the third plenary session, the guiding thoughts we should adhere to, and other work, especially the work closely related to the market economy, such as how to enter the market economy by deepening reform and opening wider to the outside world. Therefore, we should successfully implement the guidelines of the ninth plenary session of the seventh provincial party committee, with the focus on the "decision" of the third plenary session. Second, to make propaganda and press work successful, we should have the ability to give priority to key aspects. What are Liaoning's key aspects? The ninth plenary session of the seventh provincial party committee held that priority should be given to the following three aspects: 1) The modern enterprise system should be popularized in state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. The modern enterprise system represents the direction of the in-depth enterprise reform and the basic way to invigorate state-owned enterprises. Whether state-owned enterprises can be invigorated and enhance their strength as soon as possible is an issue determining whether the mainstay of the socialist market economy can be strengthened. When large and medium-sized enterprises lack strength, the mainstay of the market economy cannot take shape, and it will be difficult to establish the socialist market economy system. Therefore, we should have a sense of urgency and never take a wait and see attitude toward invigorating large and medium-sized enterprises. Comrade Xiaoping said that we should have the courage to experiment and blaze new trails for endeavors whose worth we are certain. Many years of reform and past experience show that the modern enterprise system should be popularized if state- owned large and medium-sized enterprises are to be invigorated. State-owned enterprises will have been truly pushed to the market when the modern enterprise system is popularized. Therefore, an issue we should study with great effort is how to implement to the letter the modern enterprise system in line with the reality of enterprises. Enterprises are currently faced with problems and difficulties in many areas. It should be easier to popularize the modern enterprise system in good and fairly good enterprises, and this will also provide very good experiences to difficult and fairly difficult enterprises. 2) We should deepen the rural reform and, on the premise that the responsibility system that has the household- based and output-related contract as the major form and the dual- management system that combines unified management with the persistent institution of independent management, actively develop high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture. We should properly facilitate intensive management and management of scale, greatly develop township enterprises, establish rural socialized service system more rapidly, and speed up construction of small cities and towns. Aiming at increasing peasants' income, we should accelerate the development of various rural undertakings so that rural commodities can all enter the market. Township enterprise development, in particular, plays a leading role in increasing the rural per capita income, shifting the rural surplus labor forces, promoting intensive management and management of scale, and effecting a change in the outlook of the entire rural area. Therefore, we should give priority to great development of township enterprises when carrying out rural work. 3) We should speed up establishment of the market system. Judging from the current conditions in establishing the market system, the markets for means of subsistence, consumer goods, and tangible materials have been built more rapidly, the markets for means of production, essential elements of production, and intangible materials have been built slowly, and futures markets have been built even more slowly. Therefore, we should give priority to the markets for the essential elements of production and speed up their construction. The provincial party committee holds that priority should be given to the above-mentioned three key aspects to promote other work. They represent not only the key aspects of economic work but also the key aspects of propaganda and ideological work. Third, propaganda and press work must play a leading and encouraging role, and prevalence of erroneous public opinion on the propaganda front should be prevented. We should always use the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's line, principles, and policies to guide the vast number of cadres and the masses and continuously boost their morale. In this way, we will be able to make the good situation still better, overcome unfavorable factors, and turn negative factors into positive ones. To achieve this, we should summarize and disseminate some good typical examples, methods, and experiences. This is very important. We may also criticize and expose problems, but they should be followed by results. This should still play an encouraging role because it is yet another method to mobilize cadres and the masses to overcome their deficiencies, solve existing problems, and promote work. These two aspects of work supplement each other, but guidance with positive examples should be the major method. Everybody has both strong points and weak points. Pointing out their weak points may not result in overcoming their weak points. We need to work on affirming and commending their strong points so that they can use their strong points to overcome their weak points and use their correct ideas to overcome incorrect ideas. Taking advantage of people's characteristic of having a strong sense of self-respect, which in itself is motivating, we should do a good job in giving guidance through positive examples. When the masses' enthusiasm is boosted, many difficulties will be conquered. This is also the case with improvement of leading bodies. It might not work if we only criticize a person's defects. After overall appraisal, if we affirm the major achievements of a cadre and then point out his defects, it will be easier for the cadre to admit his deficiencies and overcome them rapidly. Therefore, propaganda and press work should have the ability to lead and encourage the people and to guide them to carry forward fine traditions, good work styles, and good experiences. Fourth, propaganda and press work should conform to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. This is an important guarantee to win the trust of the masses and achieve good results in propaganda. Adherence to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts is an issue concerning work attitude, realistic spirit, and correct understanding of objective things. In doing propaganda and press work, we should make it conform to the reality of the period as much as possible, master the trend in the changes of things, and also guide things to advance in a correct direction. To achieve this, we should explore the necessary work procedure in addition to being conscientious and responsible in doing work. In each period of great change when central authorities transmit important guidelines, we all face the issue of how to correctly understand and implement them. Under such circumstances, it is very important what public opinion will prevail in propaganda and press front. In publicizing central guidelines, we should not only follow them closely, but we should also refrain from overstepping the boundary, which will lead to problems. Therefore, in doing propaganda and press work, we should not only have sharp-witted ideas, the ability to discover new things, and the courage to publicize them, but we should also have a good command of principles, strictly abide by propaganda discipline, and avoid the misleading role of propaganda. It is often not easy for most people to accept new things and new experiences at the beginning. It is the propaganda and press units that should be the harbingers. How can new things and new experiences be accepted by most people if we do not vigorously create public opinion? If the propaganda and press front lacks sensitivity and still persists as though in a planned economy, we have no hope. Comrade Xiaoping's inclusion of emancipating the mind in our party's ideological line indeed represents significant developments in Marxism. It is metaphysics to view things as stagnant and static. Dialectical materialism views things in a continuous flux. To see the law governing the changes in the development of things, we should emancipate our minds and remain keen toward fresh things. Meanwhile, we also require that propaganda and press work be carried out in line with principles and in unity with the central authorities. We should never be vague on this. Maintaining unity with the central authorities is not contradictory to the effort in creation and development based on one's specific conditions and in being good at summarizing new experiences. Fifth, to make propaganda and press work successful, we must often investigate and study life's realities. Our party has always emphasized the need to persist in the work style of going deep into the reality of life to conduct investigation and study and the need to respect the creative spirit of the masses. We should often go deep into the reality of life to conduct investigation and study if we are to make propaganda and press work vivid, lively, and capable of coping with problems. Only when we turn to the masses and the reality of life can we summarize good experiences and good ideas to replenish our minds and acquire a more comprehensive and complete understanding of all things. Investigation and study should focus on our central work. In- depth investigations are currently needed on the following aspects: 1) what problems do all fronts encounter in in-depth reform, that hinder the development of productive forces and the promotion of work; 2) how does the unitary planned economy primarily influence and manifest itself in all layers, and what are the problems that need solution; 3) regarding the endeavor to open wider to the outside world, what fields need further opening, to whom should we open to, and what advantages do our development zones have; 4) concerning the product mix and industrial structure, what products and industries cannot be replaced by others, what products and industries are at the same level as other provinces, and how can we surpass this level through development, and 5) undertakings that have inherent relations. For example, how can some large enterprises that are in a slump and some township enterprises that urgently need development, coordinate the advantages of large enterprises in personnel, equipment, management, and funds with the needs of township enterprises, and have large and medium-sized enterprises learn from the mechanisms of township enterprises? We should conduct systematic investigations on the above-mentioned questions and study measures to resolve them. Conducting investigation and study is an issue concerning whether the propaganda and other fronts can implement the central guidelines to the letter in line with Liaoning's reality and whether they can effectively guide Liaoning's undertakings to advance. In short, the propaganda and press front is very important in the new situation in which reform is deepened and opening up is expanded. The work of this front has a bearing on whether our party has strong leadership and can truly guide cadres and the masses to avoid detours and deviation in building socialism with Chinese characteristics and whether the healthy trends in society can be developed and some ugly and unhealthy trends can be checked quickly. Therefore, it is hoped that party committees at all levels, especially their top leaders, will attach importance to the work of this front and make it successful. It is also hoped that all localities will conscientiously implement the guidelines of this conference of propaganda directors and truly take economic construction as the central task and development as an essential criterion.
