Within this context, the crime puts the peace process at a serious crossroad. This requires urgent measures to uproot its causes. The ugly crime -- in which many martyrs and injured fell at the hands of the herds of settlers who enjoy official Israeli protection and support -- shows that peace will remain fragile as long as the settlements are still there and as long as the herds of settlers do whatever they want, carry out systematic killing against our people, and encroach on their sanctities in front of the international community which is turning a deaf ear to its own calls on human rights and liquidation of colonialism. The crime, which has shaken the conscience of official and popular world public opinion, [break in transmission for 3 seconds] just denunciation, condemnation, and regret. It is a warning to all those who are involved in the peace process to review their stands and prove their credibility toward the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights to their land and homeland. What took place in the Ibrahimi Mosque was not an accident, but an organized crime for which the Israeli leadership -- which is still alleging that it is concerned about security and peace in the region -- is responsible. It is an ugly crime in which the Palestinian blood was shed to put everyone to the test, particularly the United States in its capacity as the main sponsor of the peace process. The crime has dealt a severe blow to this process and warns of dangers whose future dimensions cannot be predicted. The Ibrahimi Mosque crime shows the consequences of not providing international protection for the Palestinian people under the yoke of occupation. This issue does not tolerate any indifference or postponement under the pretext of giving the Israeli authorities enough time to look into the matter. Experiments showed that the Israeli authorities only aim at repressing and annihilating the Palestinians. They are far away from the truth regarding their claims to provide them with security and safety. Colonialists are only concerned about their own security, entrenching their occupation of land, annihilating its people. It is time for the international community, particularly the Security Council, to look into the bare facts and take urgent measures to provide international protection for the Palestinian people. It is also time for the United States -- if it is really interested in rendering the peace process a success -- to practice its influence on the Isareli leadership to bring it to the right path. The Palestinian people have made great sacrifices, but they never weakened. Palestinian blood was never cheap and will never be so.
