FR941221-2-00018 FR941221-2-00011 • Selection Procedures. _The selection process for awards is a multi-step process based on the criteria listed above. •In the first step, called the ``preliminary screening,'' representatives from both governments (hereinafter the ``Joint Panel'') will review the applications and will eliminate those that do not meet the threshold Eligibility Requirements listed above. Further disqualifications will be made if the application is deemed to have serious deficiencies in the technical and/or business plan, if the application does not fall within the overall scope of the Program, or if the application is more appropriately funded by other U.S. or Israeli government-funded research and development efforts. •In the second step, referred to as the ``technical and business review,'' applications are evaluated under the preceding Evaluation Criteria. Applications are rated as ``not recommended'' or ``recommended.'' Applications must have high scientific and technical merit to be recommended. Only those applications rated as ``recommended'' are considered further. Such applications are referred to as ``semifinalists.'' If a majority of either country's representatives rate an application as ``not recommended,'' that application will be disqualified. •In the third step, referred to as ``selection of finalists,'' the Joint Panel will prepare a final scoring and ranking of recommended semifinalist applications, based upon evaluative criteria. A list of ranked finalists is then submitted to each respective nation's Selection Official. •In the final step, referred to as the ``selection of awardees,'' the Selection Officials select funding recipients from among the finalists, based upon the rank order of the applications on the basis of all Evaluation Criteria (see above), assuring appropriate distribution of funds among technologies, activities and recipients, the availability of funds, and upon a determination as to the responsibility of the applicant. The decision of the Selection Officials is final. Applicants not chosen will be notified. •In the event that a U.S.-Israeli joint venture is ranked as a finalist, but is determined to contain weaknesses in its structure or cohesiveness that may substantially lesson the likelihood of the proposed project's success, the applicant may be informed of the deficiencies and negotiations may be entered into with the applicant in an effort to remedy the deficiencies. If appropriate, funding up to 10% of the amount originally requested by the applicant may be awarded by the Program to the applicant to assist in overcoming the organizational deficiencies, or in the conduct of feasibility studies. If the Program determines within six months that the organizational deficiencies have been corrected, the Program may award over the life of the project the remaining funds requested by that applicant to that applicant. •The Program reserves the right to negotiate with applicants selected to received awards over the cost and scope of the proposed project, e.g., to add or delete a task in order to improve the probability of success. Funding Logistics _Funding will be made directly to the U.S.-based firm(s) that is/are party to the U.S.-Israel joint venture. Rights to Inventions _The provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act (35 U.S.C. §201, et seq., concerning patent rights in inventions made with Federal assistance) and the Government Patent Policy set forth in President Reagan's memorandum to the heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, dated February 18, 1983, shall apply to all Federally-funded research and development activities performed under this Program. Other Requirements_ (1) Federal Policies and Procedures _Recipients and subrecipients are subject to all Federal laws and Federal and Department of Commerce policies, regulations, and procedures applicable to Federal financial assistance awards. (2) Past Performance _Unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for funding. (3) Preaward Activities _If applicants incur any costs prior to an award being made they do so solely at their own risk of not being reimbursed by the U.S. Government. Notwithstanding any verbal or written assurance that may have been received, there is no obligation on the part of the Department of Commerce to cover preaward costs.
