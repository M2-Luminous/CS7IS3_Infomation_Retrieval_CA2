For this reason, he added, the Greek Government did not make a corresponding reduction of Albanian diplomatic personnel in Athens. The spokesman made this statement in response to a question on the status of relations between Greece and Albania before the meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries, Karolos Papoulias and Alfred Serreqi, on 3 May in Geneva. Venizelos also referred to the recent statements by Albanian officials, which have contributed to the artificial tension. We do not pay attention to these statements, he said, because we wish for the improvement of Greek-Albanian relations; we are a country that accepts a large number of Albanians who, either legally or illegally, work in our country; and we feel our responsibility as a country trying to achieve stability in the Balkans. Finally, the government spokesman said that respect for international law and the rights of the [Greek] minority in Albania does not depend on the meeting between Papoulias and Serreqi, and its outcome.
