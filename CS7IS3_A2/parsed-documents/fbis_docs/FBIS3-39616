For some time, the idea of a withdrawal of the French contingent from Bosnia had been gaining ground in Paris. The fierce controversy which had just arisen between the French and Americans on the plan to partition Bosnia, supported by Paris but described as unjust and immoral by Washington, convinced many French officials that the war would be stepped up and that there would soon be no alternative but to withdraw the Blue Helmets if a repetition of the Lebanese fiasco was to be avoided. The first stage in the operation launched by Juppe and Leotard -- two men who do not respect each other excessively but who nonetheless will overcome their feelings and work together -- is aimed at securing the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo before reopening negotiations. First, because the Bosnian capital has become a symbol over the 22 months in which is has been besieged by the Bosnian Serbs. Second, because France can no longer be suspected of only proposing to use force where it has no troops. Paris remembers with some embarrassment the objections which were made last January at the NATO summit in Brussels to the French idea -- which was nonetheless accepted but has still not been implemented -- aimed at securing, by force if necessary, the reopening of Tuzla airport and the relief of the Blue Helmets stationed in Srebrenica: No French soldier is stationed near these two areas; it is the Swedish Blue Helmets, who have no heavy weapons, who are deployed in Tuzla, and Canadians who are to be relieved in Srebrenica by a Dutch contingent. Once it was decided to no longer be paralyzed by the views of the French military hierarchy hostile, like most of the other Western military leaders, to air strikes which did not have the sole aim of helping Blue Helmets in difficulty, the foreign and defense ministers' aides asked the essential question: Is it better to go through the United Nations or NATO to carry through the French initiative? Francois Leotard was, for a time, in favor of the NATO solution, but it was finally not accepted: There was a fear that it would meet with excessively strong opposition, not only from the Greeks, who make no secret of their hostility to operations against the Serbs, even if they are Bosnian, but also from the British and Canadians who have strong reservations about exposing their contingents to possible reprisals. Moreover, nobody was certain that the idea of going through NATO would have the -- vital -- approval of the Elysee or even that of the United States which, at the NATO summit, made every effort to ensure that the Atlantic Alliance is not seen as a machine with anti-Russian connotations. Did not Bill Clinton at the last minute reject the NATO membership applications presented by the Central European countries, only conceding to them the very vague status of a Partnership for Peace, after verifying that the Kremlin had no objection to that? It is therefore the UN solution which was initially proposed by Alain Juppe to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher during a telephone conversation. The French minister proposed to his counterpart that a resolution should immediately be submitted to the Security Council demanding the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo in 10 days and the creation of a security zone with a radius of 30 km around the Bosnian capital. Surprised by the demand, which involves obvious risks for the French soldiers, Christopher made objections to the UN route, because of the risk of a Russian veto; he also mentioned the possibility of an immediate reprisal raid against the Serbian lines. The French side rallied to the NATO solution which has finally received the go-ahead from the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office] and the Elysee [president's office], but it is difficult to know what to think when you hear the remarks made by Bill Clinton who seems to link any American reaction to the result of an investigation to determine the origin of the mortar fire which killed 68 people on the little Sarajevo market place. Is Washington not playing a double game and seeking excuses to do nothing? Paris does not yet know what THE NEW YORK TIMES revealed on 15 February: On the eve of the mortar attack on the Sarajevo market, Warren Christopher sent a long study on Bosnia to Pentagon Chief William Perry and to Anthony Lake, the President's security adviser, in which he says he is "extremely uncomfortable" about the "passiveness" of U.S. policy and suggests a "new initiative." On Sunday, in the early afternoon, the French decision was made and communicated to Warren Christopher by Alain Juppe: France will call for an emergency meeting of the Atlantic Council to repeat its proposal for an ultimatum and the creation of a 30 km security zone. The U.S. secretary of state approved of the approach in principle and suggested that the United States is prepared this time to be involved in the negotiations on the partition of Bosnia, provided certain territorial concessions are made to the Muslims. Late in the afternoon, Alain Juppe and Francois Leotard solemnly announced the decision at the Quai d'Orsay. To avoid having to wait for the hypothetical results of an uncertain investigation, they specified that their proposal is valid whoever was responsible for the previous day's attack. This attack, they explained, is the result of the siege of the city and it is this siege which must be lifted. An anecdotal detail but one which is indicative of some reservations and pro-Serbian feelings: The defense minister, probably on the basis of information communicated to him by French military intelligence, explained that Sarajevo is the target of around 100 Serbian batteries, howitzers, and tanks. But the figure is much lower than the real one (it has since been corrected) because from that time the American and British intelligence services assessed it as between 250 and 300.... On Monday 7 February, the French plan was accepted with amendments by the United States. Fearing that a 30 km zone around Sarajevo would demand too much monitoring from the Blue Helmets -- it must not come under Muslim control if the West does not want to be accused of fighting for them -- the Americans, still anxious to limit the dispatch of GI's to the area to the strict minimum, are proposing to reduce it to a 20 km radius. The French, all too happy that Washington should finally agree to be diplomatically involved in the Bosnian negotiations, accepted. All that remained to be done was for Bill Clinton to telephone John Major and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien to persuade them to support the plan and thus save NATO's credibility, which was starting to be a serious problem. Late on Wednesday 9 February, the NATO Council adopted the ultimatum in principle. If this had not been done, Paris clearly states, it would have been impossible to rule out the hypothesis of a withdrawal of the French contingent in the medium term. This is a hypothesis which never had Francois Mitterrand's support but it is one to which Edouard Balladur would probably have resigned himself, because he is so afraid of the prospect of military losses. This is a risk which is now being shouldered by him, by Francois Mitterrand, Alain Juppe, and Francois Leotard.
