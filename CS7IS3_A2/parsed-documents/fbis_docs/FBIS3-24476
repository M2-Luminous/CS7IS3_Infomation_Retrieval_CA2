Myshlyayeva, Solid State Physics Institute, Moscow; UDC537.312.62] [Abstract] The title superconducting ceramic was synthesized by sintering the indicated eutectic with CuO (28 mole percent BaO + 72 mole percent CuO) and Y[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]. The superconducting ceramic had a specific current density of 400 Amp per cm[.sup]2[/] at 77 K in a zero magnetic field. It contained two superconducting phases with critical temperatures of 98 K and 86-89 K. Figures 6; references 4: 1 Russian, 3 Western.
