"The action does not represent a significant meaning for Japan," he said. The comment came after U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Tuesday that the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is considering eight trade areas in which Japan may be the target of retaliation under Super 301. The official from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), who declined to be identified, said the eight areas must have been chosen from findings in an annual USTR survey on global trading practices released a year ago. Under the revived Super 301 law, the U.S. will list trade practices deemed unfair to U.S. products, using findings from the national trade estimate report set for release at the end of March. Washington would then have until September 30 to single out priority countries engaged in unfair trading. Trade categories being named in the upcoming USTR report are not automatically subject to sanctions under Super 301, the official said. The eight named are the insurance, lumber, paper products, flat glass, computers, supercomputers, telecommunications equipment and medical products markets. On four-point market-opening measures to be released by Japan at the end of March, the MITI official said the package will be divided into two areas -- one ready for immediate enforcement and the other coming under further study for implementation. The package will feature deregulation, import and investment promotion, competition policy and reforms in the government procurement process. He declined to give further details such as which areas would be given immediate enforcement.
