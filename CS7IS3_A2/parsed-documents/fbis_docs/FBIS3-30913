Doing us the "honor" of devoting a very suspect kind of attention to our country, the favorite horse of the Russian electorate has taken up once more his original thesis about the artificial nature of the Romanian state, which, according to his precarious historical knowledge, is inhabited by Italian Gypsies. Now he has also found a final solution to get rid of the Romanians: His long-term program envisages nothing more or less than wiping out Romania from the map! The western part of our country will be given to Hungary and the southern part to a future Greater Bulgaria. Let us not delude ourselves into thinking that Czar Boris' [Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation] "clown" is dreaming in vain or that he failed to pass his geography exams, as seems to be the case with the history exam. The fact that his statement makes no mention whatsoever of the northern and eastern parts of the country does not mean that he lost sight of them. Those territories (Moldova and South Bukovina, respectively) have whetted the appetite of Russian expansionism for ages. Let us not forget that, in the disastrous summer of 1940, the Romanian Army would have still been able to defend Transylvania against the implementation of the Vienna Diktat [which allocated Northern Transylvania to Hungary]. But the Soviets mobilized their troops on the Prut River, ready to move up to the Carpathian Mountains, while the Bulgarian troops were actively dreaming of taking over all Dobrogea. In these conditions, the Crown Council decided to accede to the German-Italian verdict, which at least guaranteed the country's southern and eastern borders. Unfortunately, Romania finds itself today in a similar situation of isolation as 54 years ago. Moreover, today's situation is even worse than at that time, if one thinks of the fact that there is no longer the oil stake or other lucrative concessions which can interest the West in any way. Regardless of what one hears, the Partnership for Peace [PFP] remains for the time being a mere euphemistic formula of passivity toward the same aggressive Russian claims as ever, while the United Nations and the CSCE amount to nothing more than what the League of Nations had been in the period between the two world wars. On top of all this comes the Yugoslav inferno, where both the Islamic states and the spokesmen of the pan-Slavic trend are all so very eager to become involved. For both of these camps to reach there, there is but a single land route, namely through Romania. Washed with all waters, the Muslims are refraining from making statements, since the element of surprise and the prompt use of any favorable set of circumstances have always been the asset of the weak. On the other hand, Zhirinovskiy bangs the big drum with a brutality that defies all customs, thus making it all more threatening. It is not at all accidental that he is throwing such an appetizing territorial bait to his fellow travelers in both Hungary and Bulgaria, who are on the rise there. Encouraged by these strong statements coming from the East, it is quite likely that these forces will not take too long to begin manifesting themselves. As for the Arabs, they are very familiar with many strategic secrets of our country, since they did not cater to Ceausescu for nothing. The recent contacts established by certain extremist parties with various political forces in the respective countries -- Ilie Verdet's Socialist Party of Labor [PSM] with Iraq and Greater Romania Party's [PRM] Corneliu Vadim Tudor doing the same thing on neutral ground, in Cardiff [PRM Leader Corneliu Vadim Tudor accompanied Romania's soccer team for an international match there in 1993], where he sent obscure messages from the toilets of the Welsh stadium, as we were told by some high officials of our secret service -- come to complete the aberrant picture of an ever closer encirclement and imminent danger. The fact that the most vehement "nationalists" are the spokesmen of such interests should not come as a surprise to anyone. The wolf in sheep's clothing and the quisling have existed since times immemorial. Nevertheless, these dissolute elements have never expressed themselves more loudly, perfidiously, and destructively in the entire history of the Romanian people. There is now a real need for defining and observing the national interest. Confronted with such dangers, those at the helm of the country must be aware of the huge responsibility devolving upon them for the political decisions they are taking. After all, it is obvious that our national existence cannot be defended now with tricky statements, greasy diplomacy, or obscure maneuvers. Romania's place should be unreservedly and unequivocally alongside of the Western nations, the only ones able to credibly guarantee our existence before the ordeals ahead of us. However, in order to be accepted and protected, the Romanians must prove, through facts, not only words, that they deserve the attention they really need. By mimicking democracy, we will not manage to fool anyone. On the other hand, we will just be left to drift alone, when fate does not seem to favor us so much. President Iliescu refuses, in more or less veiled terms, to agree to the necessary change of orientation in the country's policy. He prefers to blackmail the West with our geostrategic position, pretending that he does not notice its main characteristic, namely that we are just one step away from a catastrophe, both territorial and temporal. Is his hatred or fear of the moral values of the civilized world so high? Anyhow, his fear manifests itself the same way as the feelings and attitudes of Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam Husayn, Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, and more recently Vladimir Wolfovich Zhirinovskiy do. The latter -- self- proclaimed uncontested leader of an inevitable anti-Western offensive -- has already sealed our destiny, a destiny which our national-socialist forces are ready to accept, because the civilized world will never accept a Funar [Gheorghe Funar, president of the Romanian National Unity Party], a Vadim [Corneliu Vadim Tudor, president of the Greater Romania Party], and the like of them. Consequently, their state of exaltation makes them commit suicide through isolation or self-destructive alliances. The tragedy is that, the same as the pharaohs, they want Romania also to disappear along with them.
