He said today's meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin focused on the search for possibilities of cease-fire and negotiations. The Azeri demands are not excessive, said the Azeri leader. They include cease-fire in the conflict zone, liberation of the occupied Azeri lands and negotiations to discuss the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. Aliyev is convinced that the two peoples are ready for cease-fire. He stressed he "has a reliable information that the absolute majority of Karabakh Armenians do not want to fight, they are forced to do it, to involve in the senseless war". The bloodshed must be stopped as soon as possible to terminate sufferings of Azeri and Armenian mothers, and the Armenian and Azeri presidents must agree on this, said Aliyev. He stressed he is basically not against contacts with Armenian representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh, however, being the Azeri president, do not plan to have equal negotiations with citizens of the state he heads.
