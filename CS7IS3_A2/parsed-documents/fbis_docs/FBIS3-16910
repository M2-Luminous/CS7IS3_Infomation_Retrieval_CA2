By now, the value of 1,000 cubic meters of gas is equal to $50 instead of $80. This change was introduced effective 1 January 1994. In the effect of recalculation, Belarus' debt to Russian suppliers decreased by 150 billion rubles [R]. However, the opposition's reaction was skeptical. As RID was told by People's Deputy Sergey Naumchik, the only thing for free is cheese in the mousetrap. It follows from this that shady deals are still being arranged behind people's backs.
