He visited many rural communities throughout the country to teach the officials of the rural economy and the agricultural working people how to do farming and manage the farms. After the publication of the theses, President Kim Il-song convened national agricultural conferences and meetings of agricultural officials on scores of occasions and guided the agricultural working people to effect an epoch-making turn in socialist rural construction. Vigorous efforts to implement the theses over the past thirty years resulted in the completion of irrigation and electrification of agriculture on a high level and fulfilment of the tasks of mechanization and wide use application of chemicals. In recent years grand projects of harnessing nature, among them the building of the West Sea barrage and of waterways extending 800 kilometres in the western areas have successfully been carried out to complete the irrigation of agriculture at a high level. 28.7 percent of paddy and non-paddy fields had been irrigated before the publication of the theses. But all the cultivated lands in plain, intermediary and mountainous areas have been irrigated today. Electrification of agriculture has also been completed on a high level. In a few years after the publication of the theses electricity found its way into all the rural villages and cooperative farms of the country and to all the farm houses as lighting, power and heating energies. The annual consumption of electricity in the countryside today increased 8.6 times the 1963 figure. The task to mechanize agriculture has been fulfilled. Over the past thirty years the number of the tractors and lorries serving agriculture has increased 6 and 5 times respectively. Now all the farm work from ploughing to sowing, rice-transplanting, weeding, harvesting, threshing and transport are done with the help of machines. The task of extensive application of chemicals to agriculture has been carried out. The amount of the chemical fertilizers supplied to each hectare was 300 kilogrammes in 1963 and it has shown a rise of more than two tons at present. The output of grain has leaped 1.9 times the figure of the time when the theses was published, of which rice 1.8 times and maize 2.2 times. With tens of thousands of public service establishments built in the rural villages, the farmers live without any worry. Regular agricultural universities and colleges and farm colleges and study-while-you-work training centres of various forms for training technicians have been set up in provinces. The number of the technicians and experts who serve for socialist rural construction has increased more than ten times the figure before the publication of the theses. Ideal communist villages has made their appearance in Chongsan- ri, Kangso District, in Yongrim-ri, Mundok County, in Changdong-ri, Sukchon County, in Oguk-ri, Anak County, in Wangjaesan-ri, Onsong County, and other places of the country. Houses built at the state expense have been distributed to the farmers free of charge, leaving not a person homeless. Korea's countryside has turned into a modern socialist community and the standard of the farmers' living has reached the level of well-to-do middle peasants in the past days.
