The bills were passed without any discussion as the opposition continued to boycott the session. Stating the objective of the dangerous drugs bill, the Interior Minister said it has been tabled to check the menace of trafficking of narcotic drugs which has assumed alarming situation in the recent years. It is expedient to award capital punishment to the criminals involved in offences relating to trafficking, or financing the trafficking of heroin or cocaine or opium or coca leaf, import into Pakistan, export from Pakistan, import or export inter-provincially. The Minister said the bill seeks to achieve that object by amending relevant provisions of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930, to provide death penalty and also to raise the minimum punishment of imprisonment. In order to prevent the narcotics smugglers from benefiting out of the illegal gains, acquired through narcotics trafficking, the bill further seeks to achieve this objective by amending relevant provisions of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930, to provide for forfeiture of assets of a person convicted for two years or more. Later the House adopted the bill. The Interior Minister also tabled another bill titled as The Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd Amendment) Bill, 1994, for passage. While stating the objective of this bill, the Minister said the expression "raw opium" has not been defined in The Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979 which resulted into release of accused. The Federal Shariat Court and the High Courts have, therefore, desired an appropriate amendment in the statute, the Minister added. The House passed the amended bill with voice vote. The House also adopted the Anti-Narcotic Task Force Bill, 1993 which provides for the constitution of anti-narcotics task force. Describing the objectives of the bill, the Interior Minister said that with a view to inquiring into and investigating all offences relating to, or connected with, preparation, production, manufacture, transportation, trafficking or smuggling of intoxicants, narcotics and chemicals, precursors or reagents used in the manufacture of narcotics or dangerous drugs or assets derived therefrom, the Federal government decided to constitute an anti- narcotics task force, and empower its members with necessary legal powers for the aforesaid purpose. He said the bill seeks the necessary legal frame work for constitution of the said anti-narcotics task force, by the Federal Government and empower its members with such powers, including the powers relating to search, arrest of persons or seizure of property and such duties, privileges and liabilities, as a police officer has in respect of offences under the Code of Criminal procedure, 1898 or any other law for the time being in force.
