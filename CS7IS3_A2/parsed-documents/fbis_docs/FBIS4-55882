DS leader Zoran Djindjic has submitted to parliament an amendment to the law on the conditions and procedure of transforming public property, said the DS press office on Tuesday. The amendment envisages a revaluation of all deposits made during 1993, when annual hyperinflation soared to a record 116 trillion per cent. The DS believes that the abuses in the privatization process had taken place during the hyperinflation, because public property was sold at a price which was as many as hundred times less than its real value. The DS moved that an agency in charge of evaluating and revaluating the public capital examine what was the price of the shares enterprises had sold to their employees. It also proposed that experts determine the value of the public capital as against the German mark according to the market rate of exchange on the payment date. The privatization process was made official under the federal law on public capital, adopted in 1990, prior to the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia. Serbia and Montenegro, who constituted the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992, have been enforcing their respective laws on public property transformation since 1991.
