FR940817-0-00011 FR940817-0-00005 This policy also applies to countries with respect to which the United States maintains an arms embargo (e.g., Burma, China, Haiti, Liberia, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, the former Yugoslavia, and Zaire) or whenever an export would not otherwise be in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States. Comprehensive arms embargoes are normally the subject of a State Department notice published in the Federal Register . The exemptions provided in the regulations in this subchapter, except §§123.17 and 125.4(b)(13) of this subchapter, do not apply with respect to articles originating in or for export to any proscribed countries or areas. * * * * * (c) Exports and sales prohibited by United Nations Security Council embargoes. Whenever the United Nations Security Council mandates an arms embargo, all transactions which are prohibited by the embargo and which involve U.S. persons anywhere, or any person in the United States, and defense articles and services of a type enumerated on the United States Munitions List (22 CFR part 121), irrespective of origin, are prohibited under the ITAR for the duration of the embargo, unless the Department of State publishes a notice in the Federal Register specifying different measures. This would include, but is not limited to, transactions involving trade by U.S. persons who are located inside or outside of the United States in defense articles and services of U.S. or foreign origin which are located inside or outside of the United States. Dated: August 9, 1994. Lynn E. Davis, Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Affairs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20218 Filed 8&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4710&hyph;25&hyph;M
