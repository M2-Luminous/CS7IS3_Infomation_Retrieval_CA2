"The market is not leading automatically to the development of information superhighways," Roulet added, emphasizing that the development of Minitel in France demonstrates that "a political will" is also required. When questioned about the announced privatization of the Belgian telephone company Belgacom, the president of France Telecom suggested that France Telecom might be a candidate, explaining that he is hoping for the "widest possible development of partnerships among European operating companies." He added, however, that "the stand taken by European authorities will be the determining factor in that trend, and it would not be in Europe's interest if alliances only with non-European operating companies were possible for Belgacom." Lastly, Roulet reaffirmed that his objective is to get his group out of debt and reduce its financial costs to less than 3 percent of turnover by 1998, that being the year when all telecommunication services in the European Community will be opened up to competition.
