FBIS4-45555 "jptdd028__l94055" JPRS-TDD-94-028-L JPRS Narcotics 21 June 1994 LATIN AMERICA PERU Military Source Cited on Resumption of Trafficking in Military Source Cited on Resumption of Trafficking in Huallaga Valley PY2206172094 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1144 GMT 21 Jun 94 PY2206172094 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Lima, 21 Jun (EFE) -- A military source reported today that, following the suspension in May of U.S. logistic support to combat the transportation of cocaine by air, trafficking in Peru has regained what it lost over the past couple of years. The source added that drug mafias have increased their flights. He said they resumed operating in the Huallaga Valley from where they were forced to withdraw in 1993 in view of effective repressive operations by the Peruvian Air Force (FAP), which operated with the support of U.S. radar installations. Opposition Legislator Julio Castro Gomez has stated that if the current level of trafficking flights is maintained, it will reach 10,000 by the end of the year. With each flight, the Colombian drug "cartels" transport guns and money to Peru in exchange for cocaine paste which is later transformed into cocaine hydrochloride in Colombian laboratories. Castro Gomez stated that according to official sources, the Colombian planes transport between 1,300 to 1,500 metric tons of cocaine paste per year, and leave in Peru somewhere between $1.5 and $2 billion. Trafficking has been back to normal since May when the U.S. Government closed down the only fixed radar it operated in Peru. It also decided to suspend flights of its AWACS E-3 and Orion P-3 planes, equipped with modern flight detection equipment. The U.S. withdrawal, which took Peruvian officials by surprise, compelled the Peruvian Government to issue a formal protest. They reasserted, however, their firm political willingness to continue the antidrug struggle with their own resources. Achieving this goal is, however, very difficult because Peru lacks the indispensable economic and material means to stop the shipments. A high-ranking FAP official has stated that the U.S. decision "has left us virtually blind. We are frustrated because drug traffickers are flying right under our noses and we are unable to do anything about it." The same source noted that the only means available to the FAP to combat the drug cargoes are four battered T-27 planes, two helicopters, and eventually, two more A-37 planes. By comparison, the traffickers are equipped with modern planes that can easily dodge FAP planes and make night flights with special equipment. The military source stated: "A T-37 flies at 200 knots and at 26,000 feet, while drug mafia planes reach 300 knots and 30,000 feet." A U.S. technical mission arrived last week in Peru to explain the reasons for withdrawing its logistic air support. The result of the negotiations have been kept strictly secret. The Peruvian press reported, nevertheless, that U.S. support was suspended for fear of legal complications for the United States in the event of a downing of a civilian plane "by mistake." This comes following a recent experience in which a U.S. warplane mistakenly shot down two U.S. helicopters in Iraq. The FAP spokesperson stated that U.S. Government's concern does not apply in Peru's case because experience has shown that the FAP complies with international regulations for the interception of planes. He said: "When we intercept a plane we comply with the steps of verification, identification, and communication. Only then, and if it refuses to comply with orders, do we fire at non-vital parts of the plane and, as a last resort, shoot it down." The Peruvian press has reported that it seems the United States wants to establish "specific legal guidelines" under which Peru will assume full responsibility if a civilian plane is mistakenly downed. Some trafficking experts have stated, however, that Washington's fears do not justify withdrawing U.S. air logistics support from Peru. They added that the U.S. decision "causes doubts about its political willingness to combat the issue."
