In a draft decision, the country's top legislature will empower the people's congress and its Standing Committee of Xiamen the rights to formulate laws and regulations, and the city government to issue government decrees for the zone. The first city was the Shenzhen SEZ in Guangdong Province, which borders Hong Kong. A 4-day session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), which starts on March 2, will deliberate the draft decision, said Zhou Chengkui, spokesman for the General Office of the NPC Standing Committee. Zhou said the move is "necessary for the development of the Xiamen SEZ." Xiamen was one of the earliest established special economic zones and has become one of the country's "vanguards" in developing economic ties with Taiwan and foreign countries. The draft decision will be submitted to the second plenary session of the Eighth NPC, which is due on March 10 for further deliberation. The spokesman said the session will continue to deliberate the draft supplementary regulation on punishing the crimes of illegal border crossing and emigration, and a draft law on the protection of investments of Taiwan residents. They were preliminarily discussed in the previous session. The legislators will also review the draft labor law. "The labor law is supposed to protect the legal rights of working people, to build up and maintain the `harmonious ties' between employers and employees, and thus is conducive to the reform of the country's labor system in line with the establishment of the socialist market economy," Zhou added. The lawmakers will also make preparations for the Eighth NPC's second plenary session, such as the deliberating of its draft agenda and draft name lists of its presidium, secretary general and nonvoting delegates.
