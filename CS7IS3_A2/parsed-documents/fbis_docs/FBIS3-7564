While the United States strongly criticizes Japan for "not abiding by almost all of the agreements," MITI cites 17 concrete cases, including beef, citrus fruit, and supercomputers, to refute such a charge. MITI reports: "Imports of beef increased by 90 percent between 1988 and 1992; results have been achieved in many areas." Japan intends to use this report as data to clear up U.S. "misunderstanding" at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks and similar bilateral negotiations in the future. There are around 30 agreements and accords signed between the two countries. The United States has serious doubts about Japan's efforts to implement these agreements, as evidenced in President Bill Clinton's remark during the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks that "despite the 30-odd agreements signed, there has been no change at all." MITI believes: "Such a perception is behind the Japan-U.S. economic friction." It has, therefore, engaged in an assessment of Japan's performance regarding the agreements. Aside from beef and citrus fruit, other examples cited include: Agreements on medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, forestry products, cigarettes, computers, satellites, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation's (NTT) procurement, auto parts, automobiles, paper, sheet glass, amorphous metal transformer, textiles, steel, and machine tools, and the Structural Impediments Initiative talks. MITI emphasizes: "Japan abides by these agreements and accords, and visible results have been achieved." For example, in the case of beef and citrus fruit, as a result of abolishing import quotas, and implementing the agreement on tariffication, imports of beef grew by 90 percent, and imports of orange juice by 330 percent between 1988 and 1992. Imports of forestry products also increased by 250 percent between 1985 and 1992. In the case of auto parts, one of the focal issues at the framework talks, imports from the United States expanded from $6.1 billion in fiscal 1990 to $13.6 billion in fiscal 1992. MITI "wants to use this to refute the United States." However, the report does not touch on semiconductors and car phones, which have been the controversial issues in recent weeks. This may give rise to criticism in the United States that the document merely cites examples to suit Japan's purpose.
