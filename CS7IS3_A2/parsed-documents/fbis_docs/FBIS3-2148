Various sources of information available in Beijing on Deng's physical condition all essentially agree on this point. There are even reports circulating that say the Chinese leader, appreciating his deteriorating physical condition, has given up the idea of visiting Hong Kong, which will be returned to China in three-and-a-half years. Parkinson's disease is a nervous disorder that is marked by such characteristics as sluggish movement and rigidity of the whole body, and for which there is reportedly no cure. The disease rarely leads to sudden death among sufferers but they are, however, very susceptible to complications. Deng's physical condition, such as his trembling hands, were noted in a television broadcast which showed him meeting delegates to the CPC convention in October 1992. People in Beijing, however, were even more startled when they saw how far his condition had deteriorated during his appearance on a television newscast on 9 February, the eve of the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year). It is said that Deng's dream is to visit Hong Kong in July 1997 when it is returned to China. Deng himself, however, has reportedly acknowledged that this has become seemingly impossible. When Deng was 86, he said: "To live past 90 is victory." This coming August, Deng will celebrate his 90th birthday.
