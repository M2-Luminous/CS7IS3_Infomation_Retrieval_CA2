He said the ODS fully respected Slovakia's sovereignty and independence and its new cabinet. The Czech Republic considers Slovakia to be its primary partner and has an eminent interest in "smooth, good, and constructive relations with the Slovak Government," Klaus said. He warned against the Czech Republic perceiving Slovakia as so- called "near abroad." Klaus explained that this term is appearing in the interpretation of Russia's politics which makes no difference between domestic affairs and foreign affairs. "They have invented the term "near abroad" in reference to former republics of the former Soviet Union which Russia seeks to treat differently than other foreign countries," Klaus elaborated.
