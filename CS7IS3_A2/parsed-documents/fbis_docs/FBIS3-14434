Under the headline "The Vitality of the Syrian Stand," AL-THAWRAH notes that Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator for the peace process, has reiterated that the United States appreciates Syria's vital and important role in the peace process. The paper says: This new U.S. reiteration of the importance of the Syrian role confirms the fact that there will be no peace in the region without Syria and that Israel, through its intransigent policy, maneuvers, and aggressive course, constitutes the only obstacle to peace and the peace process. AL-THAWRAH notes that there will be no peace without Syria. The paper says: No further proof is necessary now that the world has felt the importance of the Syrian role in launching the peace process and rectifying its march and now that events have proven that it is impossible to bypass this role or ignore its importance with regard to continuing the peace process and achieving its objective; namely, a just and comprehensive peace. AL-THAWRAH says that the peace process, which began approximately two and a half years ago in Madrid and which continued over this long period of time, would not have begun or continued had it not been for Syria's agreement on the U.S. initiative and had it not been for its positive stand on all efforts aimed at activating the peace process and providing opportunities to achieve the required progress. AL-THAWRAH adds: When the importance of the peace process and the kind of peace to be achieved through this process were addressed, Syria was the first to underscore this importance, to abide by the peace process, and to adhere to the principles and points of reference of this process. Syria's only condition for the peace process and its objective is to see this process forms an effective framework and an appropriate means to achieve a real, lasting, just, and comprehensive peace based on the principles of international legitimacy, as defined by President Hafiz al-Asad in the Geneva summit -- the peace of the brave that restores rights to their owners. AL-THAWRAH also dwells on the policy and methods of deception and maneuvering that Israel has resorted to to prevent the peace process from achieving its objectives on the basis of the Madrid conference and the resolutions of international legitimacy. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Reactivating the peace process toward its objective requires, during the current stage, a clear international stand in which the U.S. Administration assumes a major role in exerting pressure on Israel to force it to abandon its policy of maneuvering, extortion, and aggression and to frankly accept the principles of the peace process, as defined by the Madrid formula, and to implement its basic principle, land for peace, without misinterpreting the content and the principle of this formula. In another commentary, AL-THAWRAH writes about the Israeli massacre perpetrated against the Palestinian people inside the holy Ibrahimi Mosque last month in which more than 400 were either martyred or wounded. The paper says that this massacre was only the beginning, and that it is another test balloon through which the Tel Aviv rulers aimed to measure the international community's reaction to and influence on the course of events. AL-THAWRAH also notes the new massacre in Hebron the day before yesterday, which coincided with the U.S. Administration's endeavor and the moves of U.S. coordinator Dennis Ross in the involved capitals to activate the peace process and to give momentum to its obstructed process. The new massacre also came in the wake of Security Council Resolution 904. In addition, Israel escalated its military attacks against the cities and villages in southern Lebanon. AL-THAWRAH notes that this does not hold out any hope that Israel will succumb to the will of peace, that it will respect its points of reference, that it will respect the resolutions of international legitimacy and its charters, that it will abandon racist terrorism, or that it will restore the Arab's usurped lands and rights. The paper emphasized the need to exert international pressure and to abandon quiet diplomacy in order to make the rulers of Israel follow the right path and accept the requirements of a just and comprehensive peace. The paper notes that Israel's terrorist practices constitute a serious threat that needs a firm and swift response from the international community and the U.S. sponsor -- whose role, initiative, and interests are being targeted -- to champion the international credibility and resolutions that are still being violated openly so that Israel will not remain above the laws of the international community and above questioning and punishment. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH calls for the resolutions of international legitimacy to be implemented, for protection for the citizens in the occupied territories to be secured, and for a firm stand to be taken to curb Israeli aggression to force it to withdraw from all occupied Arab territory.
