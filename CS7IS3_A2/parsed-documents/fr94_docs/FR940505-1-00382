FR940505-1-00382 FR940505-1-00012 (i) Maintain current records necessary to determine emissions for each oven including, but not limited to, type of each yeast-leavened baked product, yeast percentage for each product, and fermentation time for each product; (ii) Maintain monthly records of production rates, by weight, of finished baked product for each yeast-leavened product; and (iii) For control equipment subject to paragraph (f)(3) of this section, maintain daily records of key system operating and maintenance procedures which will demonstrate continuous operation and compliance of the emission control device during periods of emission producing activities. Key system operating parameters are those necessary to ensure compliance with paragraphs (f)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates. These records shall be maintained on site for at least five years and shall be made available to EPA upon request. (6) Test Methods. (i) For the purposes of this section, VOC emission factors for each yeast-leavened bakery product shall be determined in accordance with the table of bakery emission factors in this section. Annual emission rates shall be calculated by using those emission factors and the annual production rate for each yeast-leavened finished bakery product. Alternatively, VOC emission factors for any yeast-leavened bakery product may be determined by the method(s) specified in paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section, together with exhaust flow rates and oven throughput. (ii) Measurement of VOC emission control device efficiency subject to paragraph (f)(3)(i)(C) of this section shall be conducted in accordance with the EPA method described at ยง52.741(a)(4)(iv). The VOC content measured and calculated as carbon in the control device exhaust gases shall be determined by EPA Method 25 or 25A (40 CFR part 60, appendix A).
