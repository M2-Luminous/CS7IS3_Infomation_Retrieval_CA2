Lockheed Corp., which signed a contract with the Republic of China [ROC] Air Force in December 1992 for the sale of 150 F-16s and equipment worth U.S.$5.8 billion over the next six years, has decided to call a meeting of more than 10 U.S. companies in March for discussions on technology transfers and other cooperation with Taiwan in building the F-16 maintenance shop. According to David Chu, director of the Committee for Aviation & Space Industry Development under the economics ministry, the projected depot-level F-16 maintenance shop will be the first such shop outside the United States. Chu said a project assessment is expected to be complete this year. If the maintenance shop is built in Taiwan, Chu said, the shop will not only be used by Taiwan's 150 F-16s, it could also serve similar types of F-16s owned by South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia. Vice Economics Minister Yang Shih-chien estimated that the maintenance shop will create an annual U.S.$1 billion worth of contracts for domestic industry by 2000. Domestic spare parts makers will reap an additional U.S.$500 million in annual spare parts supply contracts, Yang predicted.
