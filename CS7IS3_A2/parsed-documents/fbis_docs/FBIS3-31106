Rose, commander of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia, said all heavy weapons within 20 kilometres (12 miles) of Sarajevo "will either come under UNPROFOR control or will be subject to air attack." The decision applied "to all weapons, it doesn't matter which army is in possession," he added, dispelling doubts about differences on the issue between the UN and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Last Wednesday NATO said both sides faced airstrikes if they did not withdraw heavy weapons from positions around Sarajevo or place them under UN supervision. Since then, some observers have questioned whether UNPROFOR was too lenient in allowing Serb forces to put heavy guns under "observation" rather than handing them over to full UN control. Since Friday the Moslem-led Bosnian army has put 10 mortar guns under full UN control. The Serbs have put 33 of their guns under UN observation, but at Serb barracks. No arms handover from either side took place on Monday, but negotiations to unblock the process were continuing, UNPROFOR spokesman Richard Pernod said at a press conference.
