Camacho said he received a communique from the EZLN but would "give no details due to security reasons." He answered the communique thus: San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz and the commissioner "are willing to meet at the specified place. [no closing quotation mark as received] Camacho said preparations are complete for the meeting with the rebel command, which told the commissioner of its intention to release former Chiapas Governor General Absalom Castellanos, who was kidnapped by the EZLN on 2 January at a ranch at Las Margaritas Municipality. Camacho said the Zapatists made some demands in exchange for Gen. Castellanos' release, but he did not reveal those demands to avoid hindering the liberation process, which he termed a positive gesture from the rebels within the framework of the search for a negotiated political solution to the violence. However, Camacho told the rebels that "Gen. Castellanos' exchange for people arrested in connection with the events that began on 1 January" requires "certain procedures, which are being handled" and "which must be carried out for a prompt solution to this negotiation." Camacho referred to the amnesty law approved by Congress for the people involved in the guerrilla rebellion, but he explained that its enforcement requires that the parties to the conflict reach a formal cease-fire as soon as possible. The government commissioner said there are still obstacles to the negotiations but he that insisted Gen. Castellanos' impending release is a good sign for the talks. Camaco repeatedly said that security considerations prevented him from divulging any details of his meeting with the guerrilla leaders or about Castellanos' release, but he added that this "step is an important contribution to the peace process." The guerrilla forces and the Mexican Army have maintained a cease-fire since 13 January, when the Armed Forces began to withdraw from rural communities in the conflict area to relocate in various towns and military bases. This has helped the parties reach a detente. According to local journalists' commentaries, Camacho's and Ruiz' meeting with the still unknown EZLN general command could take place in the Lacandona jungle at a town under rebel control, but such reports have not been addressed by official sources. According to previous communications between the commissioner and the rebels, the peace process will be long and difficult, but the two sides have expressed their wish to reach a political agreement as soon as possible.
