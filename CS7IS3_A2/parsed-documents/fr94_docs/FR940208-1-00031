FR940208-1-00031 FR940208-1-00011 Tuesday February 8, 1994 Part III Environmental Protection Agency 40 CFR Part 63 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Category: Gasoline Distribution (Stage I), Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 26␣/␣Tuesday, February 8, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 63 [AD-FRL&hyph;4834&hyph;5] National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Category: Gasoline Distribution (Stage I) AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (Agency). ACTION: Proposed rule and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: The Agency is today proposing standards which would limit emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP's) from existing and new bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations. These proposed national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) implement section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (1990 amendments), which requires the Administrator to regulate emissions of the HAP's listed in section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act (Act). Several of these pollutants are emitted from all gasoline distribution facilities (pipeline pumping stations, pipeline breakout stations, bulk terminals, bulk plants, and service stations). The intent of the proposed standards is to protect the public health by requiring new and existing major sources to control HAP emissions to the level attainable by the maximum achievable control technology (MACT). Pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals are the only two subcategories within the gasoline distribution network that have been found to include major source facilities. Therefore, the proposed standards would apply only to major source pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals. A public hearing will be held, if requested, to provide interested persons an opportunity for oral presentation of data, views, or arguments concerning the proposed standards for gasoline distribution facilities. DATES: Comments. Comments must be received on or before April 11, 1994. Public Hearing. If anyone contacts the Agency requesting to speak at a public hearing by March 1, 1994 , a public hearing will be held on March 10, 1994 beginning at 9 a.m. Persons wishing to present oral testimony must contact Ms. Lina Hanzely of EPA at (919) 541&hyph;5673 by March 1, 1994. Persons interested in attending the hearing should call Ms. Hanzely at the same number to verify that a hearing will be held.
