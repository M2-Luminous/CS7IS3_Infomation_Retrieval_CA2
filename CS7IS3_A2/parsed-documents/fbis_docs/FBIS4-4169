Opening the signing ceremony held in the Kremlin, the Russian president stressed the need to stop the bloody events, to remove the shadow of civil war from Russia and to put an end to civil confrontation. He noted any party, organization and mass movement can join the treaty, proposed by him in late February immediately after the State Duma (the lower house of the parliament) declared the political amnesty for his main opponents including former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy and former parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov. This can be done by all who are ready to assume responsibility for civil peace in the country, Yeltsin said. "The key idea of this document is non-violence in achieving political goals," he added. Present at the signing ceremony were the president, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the federation council (the upper house of the parliament) Vladimir Shumeyko, leaders of local regions, and heads of parliamentary groups, political parties, mass movements, trade unions and religious denominations. The president urged participants in the ceremony for reconciliation, "Let us help Russia to get rid of civil war forever for the sake of preserving the fatherland and calm of our children. Let our joint efforts be crowned with success," Yeltsin stated. Speaking at the ceremony, Shumeyko expressed the hope that "this treaty is not for politicians and public figures but for the whole people." Rybkin noted in his speech that all the participants had proclaimed "the need to ease social tension, develop normal relations between the branches of power and deepen economic reforms in the interests of the entire people." At the ceremony, Patriarch Alexiy II of Moscow stressed the need to "continue and deepen our (Russians) accord and, finally realize that we are responsible for Russia and its future."
