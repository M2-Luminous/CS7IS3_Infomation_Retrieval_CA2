He was referring to the recommendation made by the Council of Europe (CE) that every citizen be obliged to master the language of the country he lives in. Slobodnik said he did not rule out that the Education Ministry would issue a decree stipulating that Slovak could be taught only by Slovak teachers at ethnic Hungarian schools. Only this would guarantee that ethnic Hungarians would master the Slovak language, he added. Slobodnik said that Slovakia "had no reason to feel ashamed of its policy towards ethnic minorities. Quite the opposite." There is a comprehensive network of primary and secondary education with Hungarian as a teaching language, heavily subsidized by the state, Slobodnik stated. The Slovaks and Hungarians living in Slovakia are absolutely equal, he said, pointing to the fact that last year 26 Hungarian periodicals of all sorts, funded by the state, were published in Slovakia. The state also subsidizes two Hungarian regional theaters and 12 publishing houses, he added. The Culture Ministry neither influences the repertory of the theaters, nor does it interfere with the published papers and books, although "it is often not satisfied with them," he said. "The cultural autonomy of the ethnic Hungarians actually exists, although some people do not want to admit it," Slobodnik stated. Slovakia has assumed a model approach towards ethnic minorities, not only with respect to culture, Slobodnik claimed. Many ethnic Hungarians bear this in mind, and do not associate themselves with the demands of their so-called political representatives for a province. "They keep in mind that their economic position in Slovakia is more advantageous than would be possible in Hungary," Slobodnik stated.
