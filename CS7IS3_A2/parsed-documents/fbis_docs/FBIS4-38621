Flyarkovskiy, including recording of interview with Viktor Posuvalyuk, special envoy of the Russian president -- from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] The Russian president's official representative in charge of a Near East settlement is now in Israel, holding talks with the country's officials. It has to be noted that the Russian envoy's talks with the regional political leaders are taking place immediately following U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's talks and that the timing is not a coincidence. Warren Christopher endeavored to soften the contradictions between Israel's and Syria's positions, without any tangible success. [Flyarkovskiy] Viktor Posuvalyuk, the Russian president's special envoy, has ended yet another diplomatic trip round the Near East. I say another, because recently Russian diplomats have begun to appear noticeably more often in the region of the world's most protracted conflict, while Russian mediation has become even more effective. Viktor Posuvalyuk acknowledged that the talks between Israel and Syria were decisive. He expressed a merely cautious optimism concerning their possible success. Yitzhaq Rabin, Israel's prime minister, was given a special message from President Yeltsin. However, the Russian diplomat focused particular attention on visiting the new autonomous Palestinian area. [Posuvalyuk] This is the first time in modern history, in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict that Palestinians were given an opportunity to prove for the first time to everyone and, first and foremost, to themselves, that they are capable of managing their own affairs. [Flyarkovskiy] And your view is that they are coping. [Posuvalyuk] So far yes, they are. [Flyarkovskiy] Does Russia plan a more tangible, material participation now in the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho plan? [Posuvalyuk] We are discussing these issues with the Palestinians. [Flyarkovskiy] The point at issue is to give assistance to the Palestinian side now, first and foremost, is that not so? [Posuvalyuk] Naturally. [video shows Posuvalyuk shaking hands with Rabin]
