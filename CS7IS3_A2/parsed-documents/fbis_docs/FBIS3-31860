The first extension of the truce, signed on 13 January 1994 at the Turanj border crossing near Karlovac, expired last midnight. The second, newly signed extension is only a continuation of the previously signed agreements, and it will be in effect until the end of February. This signing in Knin two days ago was mediated by UNPROFOR representatives, as was the previous signing in Zagreb. This latest agreement, according to the general staff of the Serbian army of Krajina, provides for a cease-fire and readiness to continue negotiations until a general cease-fire is achieved. Armed clashes on the Knin front have significantly decreased since 23 December of last year, when the Christmas truce took effect. Croatian forces at the Benkovac-Zadar front did not observe the cease-fire. Military clashes in this North Dalmatian theater continued almost uninterrupted, but they are considerably less intense than before.
