FR940819-2-00055 FR940819-2-00030 Bonneville Power Administration Notice of Floodplain and Wetlands Involvement for Vancouver Lowlands and Western Pond Turtle Wildlife Mitigation Projects AGENCY: Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice of floodplain and wetlands involvement. SUMMARY: BPA proposes to fund the Vancouver Lowlands Wildlife Mitigation Project located in floodplains and wetlands in Clark County in the State of Washington and the Western Pond Turtle Wildlife Mitigation Project located in floodplains and wetlands in Lane, Linn, Marion, Polk, Benton, Clackamas, Yamhill, Washington, Multnomah, and Douglas Counties within the State of Oregon. In accordance with DOE regulations for compliance with floodplain and wetlands environmental review requirements (10 CFR Part 1022), BPA will prepare a floodplain and wetlands assessment and will perform the proposed actions in a manner so as to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplains and wetlands. The assessment will be included in each of the environmental assessments being prepared for the proposed projects in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. A floodplain statement of finding will be included in any findings of no significant impact that may be issued following the completion of the environmental assessments. DATES: Comments are due to the address below no later than August 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments to the Public Involvement Manager, Bonneville Poser Administration_ALP, P.O. Box 12999, Portland, Oregon 97212. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Roy B. Fox, NEPA Compliance Officer-PG, Bonneville Poser Administration, P.O. Box 3621, Portland, Oregon, 97208&hyph;3621, telephone number 503&hyph;230&hyph;4261, fax number 503&hyph;230&hyph;3752. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Vancouver Lowlands Wildlife Mitigation Project area is located along the western border of Clark County, extending north and west of the City of Vancouver, Washington. It consists of approximately 2123 hectares (5245 acres) of riparian, wetland and pasture habitat along the Columbia River floodplain. The Columbia River borders the southern and western boundaries of the project area (T2N, R1E, Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 17, 18, 20; T2N, R1W, Sections 1 and 12; T3N, R1W, Sections 35, 36, and 37; T3N, R1E, Sections 30 and 31.) Major riparian and wetland features of the area include the Columbia River, Vancouver Lake, Lake River, Buckmire and Matthew Sloughs, Shillapoo Lakebed, and Post Office, Round, Green, Curtis, and Campbell lakes. Several smaller wetlands occur throughout the project area. Land ownership within the project area includes Washington Department of Wildlife, Clark County, Port of Vancouver, Washington Department of Natural Resources and several private landowners. BPA proposes to fund implementation of a wildlife management strategy that would protect, enhance and restore wildlife habitat in the Vancouver Lowlands. Existing wetlands would be maintained or restored where possible, and enhanced to improve wildlife habitat. Enhancement activities could include control or removal of non-native fish and plant species and agricultural cultivation, planting and irrigation. The Western Pond Turtle Wildlife Mitigation Project spans the entire Willamette River Hydrographic Basin, thus including the Willamette River floodplain. the townships and ranges that approximately compose the basin are: T3N, R5W&hyph;R2W; T2N, R5W&hyph;R2W; T1N, R5W&hyph;R7E; T1S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T2S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T3S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T4S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T5S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T6S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T7S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T8S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T9S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T10S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T11S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T12S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T13S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T14S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T15S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T16S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T17S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T18S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T19S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T20S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T21S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T22S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T23S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T24S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T25S, R3E&hyph;R7E. Within the boundaries of the Willamette River Hydrographic Basin, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife's (ODFW) Western Pond Turtle Management Plan offers a system of nodes and corridors as potential mitigation lands. This proposal is called the Willamette Ecosystem Reserve Matrix (WERM). The major WERM nodes that include wetlands are: the Fern Ridge Reservoir area, the West Eugene Wetlands area, the Finley National Wildlife Refuge area, and the Buckhead Slough-Hospital Creek area. Land ownership within the project area includes the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the United States Forest Service, the United States Bureau of Land Management, the State of Oregon, Lane County, the Nature Conservancy, and several private parties. BPA proposes to fund implementation of the ODFW Western Pond Turtle Management Plan in order to protect, enhance and restore western pond turtle habitat in the Willamette River Hydrographic Basin. Enhancement activities could include control or removal of non-native fish and plant species, the restoration of native vegetation, coalescence and/or augmentations of western pond turtle populations in secure habitats, application of wire enclosures to protect nests, and/or alterations of current land management/use patterns. Maps and further information are available from BPA at the address above. Issued in Portland, Oregon, on August 8, 1994. Roy B. Fox, NEPA Compliance Officer, Office of Power Sales.
