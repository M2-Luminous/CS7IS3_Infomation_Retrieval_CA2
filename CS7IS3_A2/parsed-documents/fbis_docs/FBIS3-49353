Let us follow the telephone report by our correspondent Sherif Konjuca: [Konjuca] We hope that this year will be the year of agreements and peace in the Balkans, president of the republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim Rugova said, acquainting reporters with the results of his visit to several Western European countries. Mr. Rugova said that all these meetings displayed a great concern over the situation in Kosova and, in all the high-level talks, the question of Kosova was put forward as an international question. We were promised that the international community will commit itself to solve the Kosova issue fairly. To avoid the present conflict in Kosova, posing grave consequences for the whole region, we asked that Kosova be placed under an international protectorate so that life returns to normal, democratic institutions be established, and talks about Kosova's future be more eased. The visit of the U.S. President Bill Clinton to Europe and Russia is a good occasion to bring the attitudes for the solution of the problems in former Yugoslavia and the Balkans closer. Mr. Rugova said that, unfortunately, the Serbian regime is continuing its hard repression against the Albanians in Kosova. Also during last week, many homes of Albanians were raided and many citizens and political activists were maltreated. The attack of the police against the Kosovar sportsmen was particularly very primitive. Severe tortures are being used against prisoners, while their apprehension is illegally prolonged. Lately, groups of Serbian civilians, too, have started to attack people in the streets, something that is worsening relations between neighbors. Answering a question on the present importance of the Bujan conference, Rugova considered this historic meeting as a permanent inspiration and a strong support for peacefully satisfying the will of the Kosovar people for freedom and independence. Answering a question by a correspondent as to how long this situation in Kosova will last and how long the people will support his peaceful option, Mr. Rugova answered that the people understand that the other road [the non-peaceful option] will be very tragic for Kosova, because we are completely unprotected here. He said that our movement is developing on the basis of the people's consciousness and the situation we are undergoing. However, we consider the criticisms about our road to be normal. Mr. Rugova denounced articles in the Serbian mass media on the alleged commitment of hundreds of Albanian fighters in the ranks of Muslims in the world, which aim to compromise our peaceful movement. The truth is that in Bosnia-Herzegovina [words indistinct] 200,000 Albanians live, whereas only in Trajeve, about 100 unprotected Albanians were killed and massacred. A total of 200 others are still detained in the university, and, despite our persistence, they are not allowed to go out as the others have.
