The Fatherland. Morality. Professionalism"] [Text] Aleksandr Rutskoy, former Russian vice president, chairman of the Social Democratic People's Party, and hero of the Soviet Union: "New Russians" Are West's Fifth Column Before it is too late we must explain to people and make the masses conscious of the fact that as a result of the bloody slaughter in Moscow and the dissolution and bombardment of the supreme constitutional organs of power, an antipeople police regime has been established in the country, whose basic levers of control are force and disinformation. We have an obligation to explain unambiguously to society what we can expect in the future from the antipeople regime which has taken under its wing a tyrannical clan of power-seekers, unprincipled political posers, and skilled adventurists who are selling Russia lock, stock, and barrel.... The class of so-called "new Russians," comprising representatives of the most well-off strata of society who have managed to grow fantastically rich by plundering the country and redistributing material wealth and resources, has formed and established itself.... The "new Russians" are those mafia clans which are ruling the country, the corrupt bureaucrats who serve their political, ideological, and social interests, the section of the intelligentsia which has sold out to the the regime, and the criminal world.... We have every right to claim that the regime which has become established in the country is serving the interests of Western powers, international financial circles, and their fifth column in Russia -- the "new Russians".... Even the destruction of the country's industrial potential caused by the bloody war with fascist Germany cannot be compared to the damage which the enthusiastic reformers have inflicted at the behest of their Western sponsors. According to many indicators, the level of the country's economy and the population's standard of living has fallen twice as much as during the four years of the war.... If such a policy is continued, Russia may in the very near future come up against mass unemployment for the first time in 75 years, which in some regions may affect up to 30 percent of the working population. In such circumstances a social explosion will become inevitable.... Today you cannot help but broach the subject expressed by the slogan: "Let's live in harmony." Suffering from an ill-concealed inferiority complex after the coup d'etat and the failure of December's electoral farce, the regime decided to pin the blame on everybody and cover their wound with the fig leaf of the "Social Accord Treaty." This would have been funny had it not been so sad. Because for a head of state to sign a treaty with heads of administration and a government whom he himself had appointed and to attempt to negotiate an agreement with social and political organizations on a series of self-evident issues, which are incidentally regulated by law, is no more than a display, a farce, whose tragic finale is known in advance. But the treaty appeared. Everybody has now finally seen who is who. The alignment of socio-political forces has become precise and clear. Those supporting the antipeople police regime lifted the veil themselves and shattered the various myths surrounding left-wingers, right-wingers, and centrists supposedly representing the opposition. Now everything has fallen into place, now even a political novice can grasp who is on whose side and who is against whom or what. Fortunately, the myth about "centrism," which confused the public consciousness, has also been shattered. Today everyone has begun to understand that Russia lacks a social base for refined centrist policies, since its basis -- the middle class -- does not exist. What kind of pure "centrism" can we be talking about when during three years of "reforms" the most fundamental social and property-based stratification of the people has taken place? What kind of centrism can there be when 3 percent of people in the country are rich, 7 percent are moderately well-off, 50 percent are poor, and 40 percent are destitute? Today there is a struggle in progress between two parties: the party of national betrayal which is in power, and the national opposition party which is defending the people's and the state's interests, and comprises both left-wingers and right-wingers, who are nevertheless united about one thing -- love for their Homeland and serving their people patriotically. ...It is necessary to state in a precise and clear manner the movement's strategic aim which is as follows and cannot be otherwise: to come to power and implement a series of measures to restore order, revive the economy, and reestablish the country's unity within the borders of the Soviet Union. The route to achieving this is based on victory in the elections. Therefore, we should unambiguously state that we demand that early elections of the Russian Federation president should be held.... A government in opposition should be formed and proclaimed at the assembly, and candidacies for all positions in the state administration nominated right down to regional level. In conclusion I would like to point out that if we form a line, a scrimmage, in the struggle for power, we can only expect defeat. We should act as a united front, forget all squabbles, rows, disputes, and insults. We do not have all that much time left. It is time to put a stop to unprincipled behavior, spinelessness, and compromise. Either we, having once genuinely united, resolve the issue of power and save the country, or we will be crushed by the approaching colonial democracy and orgy of crime, and the next of the regime's proteges will get into office under the cover of the political hullabaloo. Gennadiy Zyuganov, deputy of the State Duma and leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation: Repeal the Criminal Belovezhskaya Deal! What does the present state power actually represent? It is the power of a parasitic minority over the vast majority of the people. The dominion of a handful of people, linked by a network of mutual support and rich from plundering public property, is becoming more and more firmly established in Russia. As plunder and thieving on a wide scale have become possible with the permission and encouragement of the present authorities, they themselves are becoming criminal and are turning corruption into an ordinary everyday phenomenon. The support of Western capital is turning the Russian authorities into an exclusively comprador, antipeople force.... The second Russian conference of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, which took place in April of this year, came to the conclusion that this regime has no constitutional and legal basis whatsoever, and is one of the main sources of civil confrontation and a serious obstacle on the path to social accord. The conference drew up a series of general democratic measures in the area of politics aimed at overcoming the present situation by peaceful means, and I think that the "Accord for Russia" movement could use these proposals of ours as a basis. The preparation of proposals for the creation of a government of national confidence is the most important part of our work and should be commenced immediately. The names of the candidates for such a government should be published and its members' work should be organized with a view to studying the situation in the appropriate areas of public life, with appearances in the press and on television. A detailed program should be produced and highly professional managers selected. On the basis of the election results, such a shadow government could be transformed into an actual government of national confidence.... Preparations for a presidential election should run alongside those for the general elections. Here "Accord for Russia" should clearly direct its attention to forming a kind of state council of its most authoritative leaders. In the event of a presidential election being called, it would be possible to nominate one or two agreed candidacies from among them, which need not be advertised before the election is announced. Opposition candidates for the post of president could make a general statement to the effect that the presidency as a state institution contradicts Russia's historical practice and traditions. One of the new president's first actions should be to make an amendment to the Constitution abolishing the institution of the presidency and restoring genuine people's power in the form of the unified system of soviets of people's deputies.... The struggle to recreate a renewed Union of the Soviet peoples on a voluntary basis will be an inseparable part of the "Accord for Russia" organizations' activities. The most important action here would be for the parliaments of all states formed on the USSR's territory to denounce the Belovezhskaya agreements. The first public step in this direction could be the adoption by the second congress of USSR peoples of the general idea of resurrecting the Union, and the holding of a meeting in Belovezhskaya Forest in December 1994 involving representatives of all the Soviet republics' patriotic forces, who will declare in the name of their peoples that the criminal agreement between the three presidents has been repealed.
