He was commenting on the outcome of the three-nation summit ending in Moscow on Friday [14 January]. "After all, all those missiles are part of the former Soviet Union's property and each republic, including Ukraine, can claim for part of it. We will handle it in a way wanted by the Ukrainians," the minister said. "As far as I know, they prefer to obtain fuel grade uranium reprocessed from the nuclear warheads, he said adding "we respect their right". On the other hand, said the minister, "the Belarussians want to receive their share of the weapons in money, and why not?" The minister ruled out any extra payment to Kiev, saying it would be humiliating to Ukraine itself and a very strange thing for Russia to do. Kozyrev said the United States had agreed to allocate some $60-70 Mn to pay for the cost of transporting the weapons from Ukraine to Russia. He described the spending involved as high but inevitable, given that the operation must be carried out in a way that would preclude any new Chernobyl-style accidents. Incidentally, said the minister, the operation was caused by a technological necessity rather than by a desire to snub Ukraine. The missiles must be dismantled where they were assembled and Russia alone had such facilities, Kozyrev said. More importantly, he went on to say, the leaders of the three countries meeting in Moscow on Friday reaffirmed their political will to get the problem resolved. The minister believes technical problems to be secondary. The assurances of security guarantees given to Ukraine by Russia and the United States were similar to those which the co- founders of the non-proliferation treaty - the U.S., Britain and Russia - offered to all signatories under a Security Council resolution, Kozyrev said. These automatically covered any country, including Ukraine, if it gives up its nuclear status, he said. However, the minister said that security guarantees would be effective only after Kiev joined the non-proliferation treaty as a denuclearized nation. But he does not rule out the possibility of some sort of "Ukrainian specifics." On the Russian-American summit itself, Kozyrev said human rights had also been high on the agenda. The two sides were somewhat at odds on the issue of Russian pullout from the Baltic states and the plight of ethnic Russians there, he said. Unlike the Americans and other western countries which start with troop withdrawals, said the minister, we think it more correct to begin in reverse order. "We are ready to pull out troops," he said, "but will the Balts be prepared to observe human rights in full measure?" While sharing President Yeltsin's position on the issue, I think Mr. Clinton's statement of commitment to the human rights situation in the Baltic states is one of the achievements of the Moscow summit, the Russian minister said.
