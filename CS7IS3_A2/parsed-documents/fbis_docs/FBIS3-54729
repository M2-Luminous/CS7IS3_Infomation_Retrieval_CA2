Russia's foreign minister [Andrey Kozyrev] is the next to give us his New Year's greetings. [Begin Kozyrev recording] I would like to wish the residents of Russia more self-assurance. If we begin to respect ourselves, the whole world will respect us -- there are ample opportunities for that. Therefore, more self-esteem and less panic! Do not succumb to any provocations. Let us simply live normally in our own country, cooperate normally with other countries, and be the way we ought to be, the way we really are. I think this, in fact, is my wish for 1994 -- that it should be a year of stabilization and a year which should see the transformation of Russia into a normal, self-respecting great power.
