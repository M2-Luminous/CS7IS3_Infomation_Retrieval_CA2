FBIS4-58408 "drnes086_m_94003" FBIS-NES-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 JORDAN `Sources' Review Attendance at Signing `Sources' Review Attendance at Signing JN0405104794 Amman JORDAN TIMES in English 4 May 94, pp 1, 10 JN0405104794 Amman JORDAN TIMES English BFN [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] [Text] Amman--Jordan on Tuesday [3 May] dispatched its State Minister for Foreign Affairs Talal al-Hasan to Cairo to attend Wednesday's signing of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO)-Israel self-rule agreement after visible hesitation and an earlier decision to boycott the ceremony. Informed sources said Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali on Tuesday gained support for his argument to send a top-level Jordanian representative to the signing ceremony despite Jordanian dismay at the lack of PLO coordination with Jordan and the continuing naval blockade on al-'Aqabah. The decision, which seemed to have been a compromise between sending a more senior-level delegation or dispatching no representative at all, was taken by the Cabinet at its regular meeting yesterday. "President Husni Mubarak had personally invited His Majesty to attend the ceremony and this invitation was declined," said a well-informed source. Another source said that the King had excused himself by pointing to the 40 days of mourning at the Royal Court over the passing of Her Majesty Queen Zayn al-Sharaf. Egypt later extended another invitation to the prime minister and the minister of state for foreign affairs to attend the cermeonies, but this suggestion was also turned down, with Jordan opting finally for sending the minister of state. A senior Jordanian official told the JORDAN TIMES on Monday that Jordan had sent a letter regetting that it would not be able to attend the ceremony. A PLO official also confirmed that the organisation had received a negative reply from the Kingdom. It was not immediately clear what caused the change of heart between late Monday and Tuesday. According to well-informed sources, Dr. al-Majali himself was arguing for a Jordanian representation at the ceremony, especially that 43 other foreign ministers from around the world were scheduled to attend. Jordan had intended to use the occasion to register its growing displeasure at the low level of coordination by the PLO with Jordan over decisions that ultimately affect vital Jordanian interests. The Kingdom also believed that attending the meeting would contradict a vow to suspend its active role in Middle East peace negotiations until it finalised an agreement with Washington whereby inspections of vessels heading to al-'Aqabah would be conducted by Lloyds Register of London. Dr. al-Majali, according to the sources, had argued that with 43 foreign ministers attending the signing ceremony "Jordan's presence can be treated like that of any of these countries." According to the sources, the premier also believed that Jordan's absence would cause "more embarassement for the Kingdom than would serve its purpose." Other sources said that at least one other factor figured in the decision of the government to attend the Cairo meeting. After several delays the Joint Egyptian-Jordanian Higher Committee was scheduled to begin talks here Thursday headed by Egyptian Prime Minister Atif Sidqi and Dr. al-Majali. "If only to show good will to this scheduled meeting, Jordan probably could not have boycotted a ceremony hosted by Egypt," a well-informed analyst said. PLO sources also said Tuesday that the organisation had insisted on Jordanian attendance till the time the decision was taken by the Cabinet and that the PLO would have liked Jordan's prime minister to be present at the signing ceremony.
