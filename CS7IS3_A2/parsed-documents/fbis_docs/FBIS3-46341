He stressed: In studying the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, it is necessary to persistently integrate theory with practice, pay attention to investigating new problems, and sum up new experience. The ceremony for completion of the course, presided over by Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and president of the Central Party School, was held at Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai this afternoon. During the 3-week study course, comrades have systematically studied Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," discussed it in line with reality, and heard a report on the current economic situation presented by Zhu Rongji, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier. At the ceremony, Wan Guoquan, executive vice chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association [CDNCA], who also attended the study course, gave a briefing on the studies and discussions during the course. Wang Yiming, deputy director of the State Bureau of Technology Supervision; He Luli, vice chairwoman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and vice mayor of Beijing Municipality; Lu Ming, vice chairman of the CDNCA Central Committee and vice governor of Gansu Province; and Zhao Weizhi, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, successively talked about what they had learned in the course. They summed up their rewards from participating in it, saying: "This study at the beginning of the year will drive us forward throughout the year and benefit our whole lives." They maintained: The political basis of the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC is the supporting and upholding of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line. As close and friendly parties with the CPC, the democratic parties and the CPC have treated each other with sincerity, and have shared weal and woe. Only on the basis of this greatest common ground can they participate in the administration and discussion of state affairs, and constantly push the cause of the united front forward. Having heard the remarks of course members, Li Ruihuan said: The common ground is the basis of unity and unification, the goal of joint struggle, and the norm of standardized behavior. The day of the extensive formation of this common ground is the day when the people's cause advances triumphantly. After reviewing the historical process of the new democratic revolution and the construction of socialism, he pointed out: Building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the hard-earned common ground of contemporary Chinese people. As an important member of the CPC's first-generation central leading collective and the nucleus of the second-generation central leading collective, Comrade Deng Xiaoping relied on his rich experience, extraordinary wisdom, and outstanding courage and resourcefulness as well as his historical position to integrate the basic tenets of Marxism with the newly-developed situation of today; to correctly sum up historical experiences; pool the creativeness of the people; and thus put forward the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In compliance with this theory, the Chinese people advanced bravely to bring about a tremendous change in China's appearance; to maintain high economic growth; markedly improve their living standards; increase overall national strength by the day; constantly promote China's international position; and steadily proceed with the great cause of national reunification over the past decade or so, despite many difficulties in their progress and the changeable international situation. This is obvious to all and universally acknowledged. The Chinese people have the profound personal understanding that they have benefited from these facts. It is an historical inevitability that building socialism with Chinese characteristics will become the greatest common ground of the Chinese people. Li Ruihuan said: The united front is a unity of similarities and dissimilarities. The greatest and most important similarity among the Chinese people today is building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This similarity is, namely, the common ground. Only by recognizing and adhering to this common ground can the united front retain its soul, and keep consolidating and expanding. By adhering to this common ground, we can "keep vigilance against right deviation" -- right deviation means disregarding socialism and deviating from the socialist course; we can also "guard against `left' deviation" by adhering to this common ground -- `left' deviation means denying Chinese characteristics, ignoring the development of the times, and sticking to some outdated and even seriously distorted concepts. Only by thoroughly grasping and correctly understanding the essence and gist of building socialism with Chinese characteristics can we constantly enhance and scrupulously abide by the steadfastness of this common ground; and, on the basis of this greatest common ground, better promote and expand the cause of the united front, unite more people, and further diversify ways and methods of work, so as to make greater contributions to the revitalization of China and the reunification of the motherland. He continued: Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping is the concentrated exposition of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It has comprehensively, correctly, and vividly addressed Comrade Deng Xiaoping's methods to recognize a series of important problems in the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, his ideological viewpoints, and the threads of thought that form these viewpoints. The book is the best teaching material and a powerful weapon for positively, correctly, and comprehensively following through with the party's basic line. Mastering this book is not only the CPC's fundamental measure to strengthen the construction of ideological theory, but also an important way to launch self- education in the patriotic united front and enhance the common ground. Li Ruihuan said: Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee was held, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has led the CPC to bring order out of chaos and brought about a great historical change. He has established the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts; corrected the erroneous principle of "taking class struggle as the key link"; accomplished the strategic shift in the CPC and state's work emphasis; launched the great cause of reform and opening up; made the decision to build a socialist market economic system; set the goals that reform of the political system must proceed in line with reform of the economic system and that a socialist democracy be established; stressed the need to uphold the party's basic line and that will not waver in it for 100 hundred years; put forward the criterion of "conducive to three causes" [conducive to developing the productive forces of our socialist society, increasing the overall strength of our socialist country, and improving the people's living standards]; defined the form of coexistence of various forms of ownership with public ownership as the dominating force; expounded the viewpoint that science and technology constitute a primary productive force; affirmed that intellectuals are a part of the working class; created the magnificent idea of "peaceful reunification; one country, two systems," and others. This series of new ideas, theses, and summings-up are general political principles of vital importance to the overall situation, which generally sweep away the dense fog around the cause of China's socialist construction and point out the navigation route. In the meantime, all of these expositions are closely related to the united front; they constitute an overall background for the united front in the new era and produce a very far-reaching influence on the quality, scope, targets, missions, role, and methods of the united front's work. Conforming to the situation and needs of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive in the new era, Comrade Deng Xiaoping also proposed a series of viewpoints, principles, and policies with the features of this era on united front work, adding brand-new contents to the CPC's treasure house of theory on the united front. For example, the viewpoint that the united front has developed into the most extensive league of the entire socialist laborers and patriots who support socialism and the reunification of the motherland; the viewpoint that a broad scope of the united front, instead of a narrow one, is appropriate and favorable; the viewpoint that multi- party cooperation under CPC leadership is a feature and advantage of China's political system, and that in a leading and ruling position in the state's political life, the CPC should all the more solicit and accept criticism and supervision from all aspects, including democratic parties; the viewpoint that the CPPCC is an important organization for consolidating and expanding China's patriotic united front as well as an important form of China's political system in demonstrating socialist democracy, and others. In short, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has adhered to Comrade Mao Zedong's correct views on the united front. He has provided supplements to inadequate areas and implemented things which could not be done. He has also corrected some mistakes and put forward a series of viewpoints never mentioned by Comrade Mao Zedong according to the new situation. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's exposition on the united front work in the new period is an important component part of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and is also a great invention of integrating the basic theory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought for the united front work with China's present actual situation. It has an extremely important guiding significance to our doing a good job in the united front work in the new period and developing and perfecting the system of multiparty cooperation under the leadership of the CPC and the political consultative system. Li Ruihuan emphatically pointed out: Our study of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is not for showing, but is to have a good grasp of this sharp weapon to solve actual problems in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. Only by firmly combining theory with practice can we increase our interest, study the theory in an intensive manner, and apply it permanently. He said: When we stress the need to combine theory with practice, it does not mean we can pay no attention to studying books. However, we must study books in an intensive manner, study useful things, and study for the purpose of application. In studying the Marxist theory, leading cadres must first study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's works. The greatest feature of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory is that his theory is aimed at practical things. He never wrote an article for the purpose of writing something. Most of his articles are based on his research work and are aimed at solving conspicuous and actual problems in some fields during a specific period. His articles can explain the profound things in simple terms and can be read easily. His articles hold extremely profound truth with universal significance. However, to truly understand and grasp the essence of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory is not an easy thing. We must make great efforts to have a good grasp of the essence of his works. He pointed out: Studying the new situation and summing up new experiences under the guidance of theory are to meet the need of our work, and are also very important ways to integrate theory with practice. At present, we are striving to establish a socialist market economic structure. This is a great social system engineering, which calls for carrying out profound transformation of our country's existing economic structure and necessary reform of certain inappropriate things in the superstructure. There are many problems which must be promptly solved in the course of transformation and reform, including both theoretical problems and problems in our actual work. Some problems can be considered as having been solved under past conditions, but they cannot be considered as having been solved in the new situation; some problems seem to have been solved theoretically, but they are out of line with practice; and some problems seem to be nonexistent in general terms, but they are still problems which must be solved if we study the situation in a deep-going manner. Therefore, we must study and sum up those problems in a penetrating way with the guidance of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In a certain sense, the course of establishing a socialist market economic structure is a course of study--practice--summing up experiences and restudy--practice again--summing up experiences again. It is a course of combining theory with practice to constantly deepen our understanding, to gradually improve our experiences, and to enhance our consciousness of work day by day. Meanwhile, it is also a course of constantly enriching and developing the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In the past, the CPC and various democratic parties worked with concerted efforts in good coordination. The theory and practice of the united front work have constantly been enriched and developed. In the future, we must inherit and carry forward this good tradition, create and sum up more new experiences, and jointly open up a new situation for the united front work. Responsible persons of central committees of various democratic parties and nonparty personages including Fei Xiaotong, Lei Jieqiong, Cheng Siyuan, Li Peiyao, Wu Jieping, Cai Zimin, Jing Shuping, Fang Rongxin, and Yang Jike; Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and head of the United Front Department of the CPC Central Committee; and responsible comrades of propaganda, organization and united front work departments of the CPC Central Committee and the Central Party School attended the graduation ceremony.
