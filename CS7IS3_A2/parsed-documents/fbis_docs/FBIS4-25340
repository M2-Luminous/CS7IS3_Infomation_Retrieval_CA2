The older generation of the proletariat revolutionaries and party and state leaders have shown enthusiasm, concern, and support for it ever since the first day of its birth. In September 1990, Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of China's reform and opening up, obliged a request to inscribe the title "The Hope Project" with great pleasure. In October 1989, the China Youth Development Foundation made the following announcement to the world: Let's implement the "Hope Project," set up China's first foundation to help children in impoverished areas, and enable hundreds and thousands of poor children who dropped out of school to return to school. Zhongnanhai [official residence of top leadership] shows concern about the enterprise which will not only benefit the present, but also future generations....

Arriving in a village or township, he would inquire about conditions at the kindergarten, primary, and secondary schools there. He praised Shanxi, saying Shanxi's building schools to solve children's schooling in impoverished areas was the right direction in implementing the "Hope Project." He pointed out: "Economic development and social progress, in the final analysis, are decided by the quality of the people and by the raising of the scientific and cultural level of the entire society. It takes more than 100 years to educate the people. Education is the foundation of everything. Any neglect in education constitutes a shortsighted and dangerous act. When embarking on rural education, it is necessary to proceed from local reality, readjust school setups, and train more primary and secondary-level talented people who are greatly needed for local development." In his Government Work Rreport to the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress on 10 March 1994, Premier Li Peng said: "All levels of government must foster a long-term view; have a sense of urgency; stress enrollment work for school-age children in rural areas; strive to lower the dropout rate; and implement the `Hope Project' by mobilizing all social forces." In March 1994, the China Youth Development Foundation promoted the Hope Project's "One Family Helps One Child" program. In their capacity as ordinary party members and citiznes, many party and government leaders, both in Zhongnanhai and in various localities, showed their support of the implementation of the Hope Project with practical deeds. Comrades including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, Chen Yun, Wan Li, and Bo Yibo donated funds. We saw a donor list at the China Youth Development Foundation: On 31 March 1994, Comrade Jiang Zemin asked a comrade of the CPC Central Committee General Office to send a donation to the foundation to help children who dropped out of schools in impoverished areas. On 30 March 1994, Comrade Song Ping and his wife entrusted a staff member to carry a 1,000-yuan donation along with a personal letter bearing the message: "For Hope Project in Yanan." On 26 March 1994, Wen Jiabao, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, entrusted his party branch to donate 800 yuan to the foundation for the Hope Project. On 8 April 1994, Comrade Chen Yun entrusted a staff member to carry a 5,000-yuan donation to the foundation, saying this foundation was for children who dropped out of school in old revolutionary areas and in impoverished areas. On 2 June 1994, Comrade Wang Zhen and his wife visited and donated 2,000 yuan to the foundation, saying the donation is to be used in the Bijie area. He made a stopover there during the Long March many years ago. ...... [ellipsis as published] Zhongnanhai is bound closely to Hope Project. (2) On 10 June 1992, an ordinary sedan entered Beijing's Houyuanen Temple and stopped not far from the China Youth Development Foundation. Two middle-aged people alighted from the car and went into the foundation's office. They presented 3,000 Renminbi [RMB] to the Hope Project. According to regulations, foundation staff members should write down all donator's names and give them receipts; this is a strict system. Therefore, a staff member asked the two middle-aged people: "Would you please let us know the donator's name?" The two declined to tell him the name of the donator, nor did they give a positive reply on the address, postal code, or work unit of the donator. One of the two just said: "Please accept the money. We were asked by a veteran member of the CPC to bring the money here. If you insist on writing something down, you can write that it was donated by a veteran CPC member!" After more than 100 days, on 6 October the two people returned to the foundation's office in the same car. Once again, they presented 2,000 RMB in the name of "a veteran CPC member." Who was the "veteran CPC member"? Comrades of the foundation learned the name after trying various channels. The "veteran CPC member" who refused to reveal his name was Deng Xiaoping. As early as 1990, with a proletarian revolutionary's boldness of vision, Deng Xiaoping repeatedly gave advice on the issue of education: "If we want to realize modernization, the key lies in promoting science and technology. To develop science and technology, we must attach importance to education. Empty talk cannot realize modernization. We must have knowledge and capable people." "From a long-term point of view, we must attach importance to education, science, and technology. We have already wasted 20 years; the consequences would be unbearable if we still do not attach importance to them." "We must find ways and means to properly solve the problem of education even if we have to be restrained in some other fields and slow down a little on other projects." The China Youth Development Foundation used all 5,000 RMB donated by Deng Xiaoping to subsidize education for children in the old revolutionary base area in Guangxi's Bose prefecture where Deng Xiaoping lived and fought. The children in Bose prefecture wrote a letter to Deng Xiaoping after receiving his donation. The letter says: "When we learned that you donated 5,000 yuan to the Hope Project in the name of a `veteran CPC member' and the foundation sent the money to aid children in the old revolutionary base area in Bose prefecture who cannot afford to go to school, we all cried in excitement...we feel that although you are far away in Beijing your heart is close to us." Deng Xiaoping, the general designer of China's reform and opening up, thinks about children who cannot afford to go to school and holds them in his heart; and he thinks about the future and hope of the motherland. (3) In April 1992, the Chinese Communist Youth League [CYL] committee of organs directly under the jurisdiction of the party Central Committee and Work Committee for Organs under the Central Committee jointly launched activities of "donating money to show some love" for the construction of the "Hope Primary School in Yanan." Leading comrades of the central authorities enthusiastically responded to the activities. From June to July in 1992, during activities to solicit donations for the building of the "Hope Primary School in Yanan," leading comrades of the party Central Committee and State Council took the lead in donating money for the project. From the valuable recording book for donations, we can see some familiar names, they include: Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Ding Guangen, Yang Shangkun, Deng Yingchao, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Bo Yibo, and Song Renqiong. From party and state leaders to common staff members and from veteran comrades to young people who have just started their work after graduating from college, each donation involves a deep feeling and a touching story. Li Peng, premier of the State Council, who repeatedly donated money for the project, said: "We were nurtured by the mountains, water, and people in Yanan. Today, when the people's living standard has generally been raised, the conditions there are still very poor. We cannot set our minds at ease. Helping children there solve their difficulties in attending school is our unshirkable responsibility." Comrade Wan Li said: "Education is the fundamental thing in making a vital and lasting plan. Even if we have to tighten our belts, we must make some contributions to helping people in the old revolutionary base areas." Another leading comrade said: "The amount of money I have donated is not very much, but it represents my goodwill. It is hoped that people of the whole country will show concern for and support the Hope Project, and give our children more hope." Deng Yingchao was ill when she learned of the project, and she asked her secretary to send 1,000 RMB to the fund. This revolutionary of the older generation who repeatedly donated money to the society passed away three months later; the 1,000 RMB was her last donation. As of October 1992, organs and units as well as individuals directly under the central authorities had donated more than 880,000 yuan to the fund. On 1 July 1993, the "Yanan Hope Primary School," which was filled with the good feelings of Zhongnanhai, was completed. It can accommodate 600 students in 12 classes. The leading action of people in Zhongnanhai has prompted millions of Chinese people to take similar action to show their love. (4) Since October 1989, the Hope Project has developed for over four years. In this short period, it has achieved remarkable results. According to the latest data, since initiation of the Hope Project more than four years ago, total donations have exceeded 200 million yuan. The project has assisted 549,000 children who could not afford to attend schools in 27 provinces and autonomous regions to return to school. The fund has set up 204 hope primary schools. On 1 May 1993, Wan Li, honorary president of the China Youth Development Foundation, received some staff members of the foundation at his residence in Zhongnanhai. The retired veteran comrade who was chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has profound feelings toward education. He said: Education is the fundamental and vital plan of our country. To develop education, the key lies in the work of leading cadres at various levels. Those leading cadres who do not attach importance to education are disqualified. Comrade Xiaoping always attaches great importance to education and is an outstanding leader with a far-sighted view. Leading cadres at various levels, regardless of their position, should all consider education as a major task in national construction, attach great importance to the task, and support education. "The meaning of the Hope Project is not merely to aid tens of thousands of children who cannot afford to attend school. The more important thing is that it can arouse the whole society to shown concern for, and care about the growth of the next generation. The future of the country depends on the next generation, as does the prosperity or decline of the nation." Wan Li said passionately: "The Hope Project is not just a project of the CYL or the foundation. It is a great project and a cause related to the future of our country and people. The whole society must show concern for and support this project. The Hope Project has great hope. I hope the spirit of the project will be carried forward continuously!" On 7 February this year, Wan Li made another speech on the Hope Project. He emphatically pointed out: "If everyone makes an effort, we can certainly develop education." He said: In cultivating cross-century talent, the key lies in education. Wealth is created by the people. If we have people with a good knowledge of science and technology, we will be able to make rural areas prosper and make the country rich and powerful. The Hope Project is a good thing. If we make concerted efforts, we can certainly achieve success in promoting education. On 17 July 1993, Vice Premier of the State Council Li Lanqing who is in charge of education, spoke at a forum on "implementing the `Program for Reform and Development of China's Education' and the `Hope Project.'" He pointed out: The Hope Project is "very meaningful" because it can not only aid children who cannot afford to attend school but can also arouse the whole society to attach importance to, shown concern for, and support education. He pledged to urge governments at various levels to give greater support to the Hope Project. He said: Meanwhile, the Hope Project should also be publicized to enable people to understand how to take part in the work of aiding children who cannot afford to attend school. Two months later, in meeting with representatives of winners of the first "awards for outstanding workers of the Hope Project," the vice premier again said: I fully support the Hope Project because it can arouse the whole society to support and help the development of education in the rural areas when the state is still short of money, supplies, and manpower. Meanwhile, I am convinced the Hope Project is not merely to gather money. It is significant because it can arouse the whole society to pay attention to education. On the eve of "1 June" 1992, the State Council promulgated the "program for the development of our country's children in 1990's" which considers "further promoting the Hope Project and helping children of poor families attend school" as important measures for protecting and ensuring the survival and development of children. On 31 May this year, General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng held a get-together with more than 200 children who took part in the "hand in hand" mutual assistance activities at Yingtai in Beijing. Among those children, many were able to return to school with the aid of the Hope Project. In their speeches, Jiang Zemin and Li Peng hoped China's children would grow in a healthy and robust manner under the sunshine of socialism and become a fresh force on various fronts of the motherland. The children used their young voices to express their determination: We will never let the party and people down! The revitalization of the Chinese nation needs education! For the future, for the children!
