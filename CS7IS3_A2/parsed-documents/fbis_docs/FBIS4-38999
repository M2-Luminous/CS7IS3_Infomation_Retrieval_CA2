He said that one trillion rubles over the next two months has been allocated for the transportation of cargo. The task in this period is to supply only those areas with a limited navigation season with only petroleum products, coal, and four types of food. According to the State Duma's deputy, parliamentary hearings held in April in the two chambers helped to resolve this issue. They also showed that a new legislative basis was needed for these regions. "Random market relations in the north will not produce any good results on their own. State regulatory measures are needed," he stressed. The participants in today's hearings in the Federation Council on social-economic and cultural issues came to similar conclusions, the deputy noted. "Everyone is convinced that the transformation to free market relations is a noose around the neck of indigenous peoples," he pointed out. Venison and other traditional foodstuffs prices have nothing to do with the market relations. That is why they need state subsidies. This will be less expensive than moving the northerners to towns. Sergey Shakhray recalled that in Canada and in Alaska, in spite of the market, state regulation of prices is tight. He pointed out that "the development of resources in the north is an issue of maintaining the ethnic composition of the area." That is why one of the conditions for granting contracts for the development of the natural resources will be making deductions set by the law for protecting the habitat and forms of local economic forms.
