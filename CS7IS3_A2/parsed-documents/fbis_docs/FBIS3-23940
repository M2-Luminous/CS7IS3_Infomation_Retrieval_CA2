The text of the statement is below: "Recently, attacks against the APF and opposition forces in state information organs and statements of representatives of the ruling circle have become even stronger. The accusation is being spread that the political opposition is disturbed by successes gained by Azerbaijan's army on the front and about barriers standing before the successful course of military operations. [passage illegible] "Even during the empire the APF, which was the first organization to rise to the struggle for Azerbaijan's independence and its territorial integrity, and which gave thousands from its ranks as martyrs in the struggle for Karabakh, emphatically rejects these accusations. At a time when a great portion of our soil is still under enemy control these accusations are the manifestation of a devious and malicious policy to create dissension in the ranks of the opposition within the nation and efforts to deal a new blow to our national unity under a situation when our territorial integrity is being violated. "There have been times of great success and times of crisis in the history of the APF. But always and at all times patriotism, the Fatherland and the interests of the people have been and are our most important principles. The relationship of the APF to the present foreign and domestic policies advanced by the ruling circles is well known. At the same time, from the time of the further strengthening of attacks by the occupier-Armenians and the broadening of military operations on the front as a consequence of this, the APF has supported all measures for the sake of maintaining stability within the country. [passage illegible]...Despite the cessation of the publication of some channels of information, no sharp articles have been permitted. [Passage illegible]..."although it remains questionable as to what these great military successes consist of, the organization is using all its possibilities and influence to verify these victories, and has directed the efforts of its members in this way. "But at the same time, we also see efforts to blame every possible failure and all sins on the opposition, primarily the APF, and to direct public opinion along this line. At this responsible moment, the Azerbaijan People's Front appeals to the ruling circles of the republic to refrain from the dangerous path of strengthening the fragmentation within the nation during the fourth anniversary of 20 January which was a serious tragedy for our people and to call on the population not to listen to provocations."
