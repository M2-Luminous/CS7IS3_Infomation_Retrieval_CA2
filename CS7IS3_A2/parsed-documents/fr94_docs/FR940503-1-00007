FR940503-1-00007 FR940503-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 25 [Docket No. NM&hyph;95; Notice No. SC&hyph;94&hyph;2&hyph;NM] Special Conditions: Learjet Inc., Model 45 Airplane, Lightning and High-Intensity Radiated Fields AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed special conditions. SUMMARY: This document proposes special conditions for the Learjet Inc. (Lear) Model 45 airplane. This new airplane will utilize new avionics/electronic systems that provide critical data to the flightcrew. The applicable regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the protection of these systems from the effects of lightning and high-intensity radiated fields. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards. DATES: Comments must be received on or before June 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on this proposal may be mailed in duplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attn: Rules Docket (ANM&hyph;7), Docket No. NM&hyph;95, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington, 98055&hyph;4056; or delivered in duplicate to the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel at the above address.

Box 7707, Wichita, KS 67277&hyph;7707, applied for a new type certificate in the transport airplane category for the Model 45 airplane. The Learjet Model 45 is a T-tail, low wing, medium sized business jet powered by two Garrett TFE 731&hyph;20 turbofan engines mounted on pylons extending from the aft fuselage. Each engine will be capable of delivering 3,500 lbs. thrust (3,650 lbs. thrust with auto performance reserve). The airplane will be capable of operating with two flight crewmembers and a maximum of ten passengers (standard is eight passengers). Type Certification Basis Under the provisions of §21.17 of the FAR, Learjet must show, except as provided in §25.2, that the Model 45 meets the applicable provisions of part 25, effective February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 25&hyph;1 through 25&hyph;75. In addition, the proposed certification basis for the Model 45 includes part 34, effective September 10, 1990, plus any amendments in effect at the time of certification; and part 36, effective December 1, 1969, as amended by Amendments 36&hyph;1 through the amendment in effect at the time of certification. The special conditions that may be developed as a result of this notice will form an additional part of the type certification basis. In addition, the certification basis may include other special conditions that are not relevant to these proposed special conditions. If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Learjet Model 45 because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of §21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations. Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with §11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as required by §§11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with §21.17(a)(2). Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for that model be amended later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature, or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of §21.101(a)(1).
