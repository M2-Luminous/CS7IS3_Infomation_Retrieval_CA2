FR940527-2-00217 FR940527-2-00152 _The extent to which the project addresses serious deficiencies in accessibility requirements and/or expands the number of accessible public facilities. _Extent to which the project supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. (e) Criterion 5_Expands or Retains Employment Opportunities. Consideration will be given to proposed programs that will result in the creation of new jobs or retention of existing employment opportunities. The following factors will be considered: _The number of jobs to be created or retained in relation to the identified needs. Documentation should be provided to substantiate the number and type (permanent or seasonal, full or part-time) of job claimed. Letters from local development agencies or expected participants which express more than general interest would be appropriate. With respect to job retention, evidence should be provided to demonstrate that without the proposed program, existing jobs would be lost. The applicant also must address the potential impact of job loss on the community. _The extent to which CDBG funds are used to leverage private commitments. If leveraging is proposed, applicants should analyze the actual amount of additional funds required to make the project financially feasible. In designing a program to assist existing business expansion or retention, or to encourage new business development, applicants must address whether CDBG funds will be used for infrastructure, land assemblage or other financial incentives. These factors may be important considerations for a firm deciding where to locate and whether to expand or reduce the scope of its operation. CDBG funds may be more effectively used as a loan rather than a grant. In this regard, the CDBG funds would generate additional program resources through loan repayments to the community. It is considered especially advantageous if a revolving loan fund is established and repayments continue to be used to expand or retain employment opportunities. _The relationship of the activity to other projects being implemented within the defined area. _The number of persons to benefit. _Particular attention will be given to the extent to which the Review Criteria and Submission Requirements for Economic Development Projects are addressed (see Single Purpose Program Criteria). _Extent to which the project supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. _Extent to which the project results in the employment of persons on public assistance. (f) Criterion 6_Attracts or Retains Businesses which Provide Essential Services. Consideration will be given to proposed programs which will address the attraction or retention of businesses commonly associated with neighborhood needs (corner grocery stores, dry cleaners, pharmacies, etc.). The applicant must describe clearly the nature and anticipated impact of activities. Documentation in the form of letters from existing or new potential businesses offering a commitment to the program should be included. (Letters of only general interest by property owners do not necessarily ensure their participation in the program, or their willingness to secure debt if private lending is proposed). The following factors will be considered: _The impact of the proposed program in relation to the identifiable neighborhood needs. The extent of area stability must be documented. In describing the needs of a business district or neighborhood commercial area, such factors as overall structural conditions, business turnovers, and vacancy rates over a period of time should be clearly presented. The formulation of a commercial revitalization program must be based on a thorough assessment of local needs and a realistic program design. An important consideration is whether the proposed program is designed to be marketable given income characteristics, local business condition, etc. The condition of supporting public facilities and improvements and their influence on the business environment must be established. If public improvements are proposed in connection with economic expansion or retention, applicants must address the extent to which the lack of these improvements impact on business. _Attraction/retention must be fully documented by the applicant. With respect to business retention, evidence should be provided to demonstrate clearly and objectively that without the proposed CDBG Program, existing retail/commercial businesses would curtail their operations. The applicant also must document and address the potential impact of the business loss on the community and/or target area. HUD would accept as examples of clear and objective evidence a notice issued by the business to affected employees, a public announcement by the business, or financial records provided by the business that clearly indicate the need for closing or moving all or portions of the business out of the area.
