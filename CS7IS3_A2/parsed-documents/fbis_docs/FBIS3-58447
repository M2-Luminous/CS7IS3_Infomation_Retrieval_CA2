Cindoruk received members of the U.S. Congress Defense Subcommittee. In a statement during the meeting, Cindoruk remarked that the international measures adopted regarding northern Iraq have failed to solve the problem and asked that the issue be reassessed. [Begin Cindoruk recording] The current situation creates two sets of difficulties for Turkey. First, we have sustained great material damage because of the embargo. Second, the current de facto situation in northern Iraq makes it more difficult for Turkey to wage its struggle against terrorism, and furthermore, the region is a breeding ground for elements that seek to divide Turkey. [end recording] John Murtha, chairman of the U.S. Congress Defense Subcommittee, declared that Turkey's importance is increasing with time because of world developments and the country's geopolitical position. Meanwhile, National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan expressed concern over the U.S. decision to cease military aid and the 7:10 ratio applied by the United States in its aid to Greece and Turkey. Golhan received Murtha and the delegation accompanying him. Pointing out that most of the equipment, machinery, and weapons used by the Turkish Armed Forces are U.S.-made, Golhan said that the decision to stop the aid should be reviewed within the context of common goals. President Suleyman Demirel also received the visiting delegation at the Cankaya Mansion and conferred with its members for some time.
