Jose San Gil, the Spanish ambassador to Havana, said that despite the economic difficulties which we are all going through I can assure you that the Spanish Government considers it a duty to maintain its cooperation this year. According to the ambassador, Spanish cooperation from Madrid to Cuba amounted to approximately seven million dollars in 1993. This reflects the Spanish Government's political decision. Beyond the official interpretation, this should be seen as a mark of the interest and affection of the Spanish people. Ambassador San Gil added that about 120 Cubans are trained or retrained every year in Spain. Furthermore, all the projects currently under way will continue.
