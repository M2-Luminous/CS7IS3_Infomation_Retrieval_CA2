Negotiations for the agreement were concluded last Friday. No date has been set yet for the signature, after which ratification procedures may begin in the twelve EU Member States and the Ukraine. External political relations Commissioner van den Broek told the press of the "extreme importance" the EU attaches to this agreement, not only because it enables the two parties to "institutionalize" and "intensify cooperation in many areas," but also because it is the first accord of this type concluded with one of the republics of the former USSR. Sir Leon Brittan, Commissioner for external economic relations, called it a "historic" event opening a new era in relations between the Union and Ukraine, notably because the partnership agreement establishes as an objective the creation "at some future date" of a free-trade area. "We will see if this is possible in 1998," said Sir Leon Brittan, adding that the "success of the agreement" will also depend on the progress and results of economic reforms underway in Ukraine. Despite myriad problems, this country "has not hesitated to pursue its reforms" and, of all the republics of the ex-Soviet Union, is today one of the most sound economically and politically. The agreement establishes facilities in a multitude of sectors: trade (Sir Leon mentioned steel, textiles and coal), investment, capital movements, copyright and so on, in the interest of both parties. The Commissioner also recalled that the accord contains a most-favoured-nation clause, under which the Union will treat Ukraine on an equal footing with its other GATT partners. Now that the accord exists, it will have to be implemented and given tangible effect, concluded the Commissioner. Ukraine Foreign Minister Mr. Zlenko (who spoke not only in his own language, but also in English and French) welcomed "this important step," saying it marks progress towards his country's future accession to the European Union, one of Ukraine's top priorities. "For the future, our dream and our goal is to join the European Union," insisted Mr. Zlenko (though Sir Leon noted that there is no reference to such a goal in the agreement). As to his country's reaction to the fact that, in the accord, Ukraine is not considered to be an economy in transition to a market economy (while the EU considers Russia to be a transition economy), the Minister commented that independently of the EU's assessment, "Ukraine is in a transitional period and it is unimportant whether this is stated or not. Reforms are underway for building a market economy and we will bring them to a successful conclusion," he said. Asked about the matter of the so-called referendum in Crimea (planned for next Sunday, but cancelled by the Ukraine government), Mr. Zlenko insisted on the "purely internal" nature of this matter and recalled that his government considers such a referendum unconstitutional. Hans van den Broek recalled, for his part, that respect for Ukraine's territorial integrity is an important principle for the European Union and has been incorporated into the agreement.
