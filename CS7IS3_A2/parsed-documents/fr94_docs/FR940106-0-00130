FR940106-0-00130 FR940106-0-00022 This means that State agency approved job search and relocation, and training related transportation and subsistence, must be completed on or before the termination date in the Act and that the State make a final determination on the amount of TAA program funds payable to the individual on or before such termination date. This places the requirement on the State agency to inform all individuals presently approved for such benefits of the statutory time provision that the service must be completed and a final determination on the amount payable made on or before the termination date of the program. It also places a requirement on individuals to complete the approved services and to submit all claims for such activities to the State agency in time to receive a final determination on the amount payable on or before the termination date. Individuals approved for training who began approved training on or before the termination date in the Act must have a final determination by the State agency on or before the termination date on the amount due and payable for the training costs to cover previously incurred tuition and related expenses. Determinations on tuition shall be limited to the current training term, quarter, semester, or other scheduled period, and be in accord with normal billing practices of the training provider and payment practices of the State agency. In order to conform with the intent of the law, the State agency may make a final determination on the amount payable only for the training term, quarter, semester or other time period for which payment is due and payable on or before the termination date of the program. Individuals entering training, and those currently in training programs which extend beyond the termination date of the program, should be informed that no payments will be authorized or made for any costs or expenses which become due and payable after the termination date of the program, nor will any such costs or expenses be paid prior to the expiration date of the program. Moreover, only the last full TRA benefit week, for which a final determination has been made according to normal State UI processing procedures on or before the termination date of the program, will be paid to any individual. When a claim for TRA is submitted to the State agency subsequent to the termination date in the Act, or for which a final determination on the amount payable has not been made on or prior to the termination date of the program, the State agency is required to issue a ``no-payment'' determination on the claim because the State may not refuse to take and process the claim even though it is prohibited by statute from paying the claim. These provisions apply also to claims for job search allowances under ยง617.33 and for relocation allowances under ยง617.44. Discussion of Comments and Changes In response to the proposed rule, the Department received written comments from two State Governors, fourteen State employment security agencies, three labor unions, and one public interest group. 1. Eligibility period. The Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry (PDLI) recommended that clause (i) of ยง617.3(m)(1) (defining ``eligibility period'' for basic TRA) be amended by removing the word ``first'' after the word ``individual'' in the seventh line, and by removing all language after the parenthetical clause ``(as defined in paragraph (oo)(1) of this section).'' The PDLI stated that these deletions are necessary for the regulation to conform to the eligibility requirement of Section 233(a)(2) prior to its amendment by the OTCA. The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) commented that the proposed rule incorrectly ties the eligibility period for basic TRA to the date on which the first qualifying separation occurs, and the reference to eligibility period, therefore, should be omitted. Department's response. The Department believes that these comments reflect an incorrect view of the 1981 Amendments and the effect of the 1988 Amendments in the OTCA. The Department construes the 1981 Amendments as setting the beginning of the eligibility period as the week immediately following the week in which regular benefits are exhausted following the worker's first qualifying separation. This is explicitly provided for in section 233(a)(2), as amended in 1981, and is set forth in the Department's regulations implementing the 1981 Amendments. The only change in this provision of the law was the extension of the eligibility period from 52 weeks to 104 weeks in the 1986 Amendments. No change was made in the fixed eligibility period until the 1988 Amendments, which restored the movable eligibility period based on the most recent qualifying total separation. Therefore, in ยง617.3(m)(1), the fixed eligibility period is retained for first qualifying separations that occurred before August 23, 1988. The new movable eligibility period is also implemented, in accordance with the 1988 Amendments, for decisions made on or after August 23, 1988, for other qualifying total separations which occurred before, on, or after August 23, 1988. Section 1430(g) of the OTCA provides for the retention of the pre-OTCA eligibility period which was established by the first qualifying separation occurring before August 23, 1988, even if the decision is made on or after August 23, 1988. Amended section 233(a)(2) may not be applied in a decision made on or after August 23, 1988, in the case of a more recent total separation occurring before August 23, 1988, if the effect of applying such amended section would result in an earlier expiration date of the eligibility period established on the basis of an earlier first qualifying separation.
