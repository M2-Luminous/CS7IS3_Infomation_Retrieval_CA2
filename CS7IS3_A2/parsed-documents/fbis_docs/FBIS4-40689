Parem-Eesti unites right-of-center parties and organizations that intend to go to the next parliamentary election on a coalition platform. Under the statutes, former members of the Communist Party and employees of repressive organs like the KGB cannot belong to the leading bodies of the alliance or run in election on its ticket. The eight-member board of Parem-Eesti includes, besides Estam, representatives from the Estonian National Progress Party, the Estonian National Party, and four other rightist groups and associations.
