Nasrallah's declaration was made at a commemoration ceremony for the victims of the Israeli raid on a Hizballah training center in 'Ayn Kawkab, east of Ba'labakk, held in Beirut's southern suburb and attended by Mohammad Kazem Khonsari, director of the Iranian Foreign Ministry's Middle East and North Africa Department scholar Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah; Hizballah deputies and officials; Iranian Ambassador Hamayon 'Alizadeh; Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the "Islamic Jihad in Palestine" [IJP]; Milad al-Qarih, representing Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul; Staff Brigadier General Husayn Nasr al-Din, representing Army Commander Emile Lahhud; and other influential Palestinian and Lebanese figures. Khonsari expressed "condolences and congratulations from the Iranian people and government to the Lebanese people and government." He criticized the U.S. policy "for covering up the Zionist enemy's violation of Lebanon's sovereignty." He commended "the cohesion of the Lebanese internal situation manifested in the profound official and popular support for the resistance and its right to resist the occupation." He added: "We are fully convinced that Israel and its masters do not want peace with the peoples and states of this region; they want full capitulation and submission to Zionist hegemony, to deny our Arab and Islamic peoples their will, identity, and history." Dr. al-Shaqaqi criticized the "policy of capitulation" and negotiation with Israel "while the enemy continues to break all international traditions and laws, with a direct American cover-up, by committing all kinds of terrorism against the Arab nation." He criticized Yasir 'Arafat's policy and pledged to "sustain the resistance in Lebanon and Palestine." The ceremony was concluded with a speech by Nasrallah, who listed the aims of the Israeli raid on Ba'labakk, the most important being "to strike at the resistance, create a situation of popular frustration and confusion in its relations with its people and kinfolk, isolate it, create an air of incitement and sedition between the resistance and the state, try to break the fateful bond between Lebanon and Syria, push official Lebanon into peripheral negotiations that would lead to a separate peace with Israel, and send a message to Syria in continuation of the American and Israeli pressures on its leadership to make concessions, abandon rights, and accept Israel's peace terms." He pointed out, however, that "these aims have failed." He emphasized that "continuation of the resistance is a right," and he praised the solidarity between the resistance and the people. He said that "all kinds of sedition are forbidden and prohibited and would be a great service to the enemy, who is lying in wait for all of us. The domestic peace is a red line and a great achievement which must be preserved." He denied that "we are about to call for any form of intrinsic security." He added: "We are not a security alternative to anyone." He expressed a wish for "security achievement" at the level of "exposing the Israeli groups within." He urged "confrontation of the Israeli infiltration of the Lebanese arena through agents and spies." He voiced appreciation for the "official support for the resistance," which, he said, should be "deepened and rooted." He also called for withdrawal from the negotiations. He emphasized that Lebanese-Syrian relations "are deep-rooted and strategic. They are one of the main foundations of Lebanon's strength." He praised Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad's firmness and his ability to tackle this phase skillfully and to face pressures and tribulations. He also noted Iran's support for Syria. After criticizing the U.S. policy, he said: "Dear friends, our people and kinfolk, and also the Americans carrying the threatening messages and the Israelis who have not, since the raid, stopped issuing ultimatums: These ultimatums and threats will not prevent us from carrying out the promised retaliation in the course of our continuing resistance and jihad and at a time of our own choosing, and let Israel do what it likes. What does it want to do? Destroy our homes, kill us, scorch our land, steal our water, and occupy our country? It is doing that every day, and we will not stop in the face of that threat." He concluded: "It wanted it an open war, but when has it not been open?" He reaffirmed "continuation of the jihad."
