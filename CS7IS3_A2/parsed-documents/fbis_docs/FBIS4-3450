Many people are ready to buy pirated compact discs, which have become the new favorite of people going to the mainland for shopping. Statistics show that more than 200 million pirated CDs were sold in the mainland in 1993. As Many as 50 Factories Produce Pirated CDs The main reason pirated CDs are in vogue in the mainland is that some unscrupulous businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan, taking advantage of the weak sense of copyright and loose law enforcement in some localities in the mainland, have bribed concerned local officials or solicited business for persons in charge of CD manufacturing plants so as to seek the latter's tacit approval in producing pirated CDs in an almost open way. As a result, the mainland, particularly the Zhu Jiang Delta region, has become a center for pirated CDs. Some retailers running pirated CD businesses in the mainland say that in their estimation, there are 50 illegal factories around the Zhu Jiang Delta Region engaged in producing pirated CDs. These are mainly located in Jiangmen, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, Foshan, and Maoming. In addition, some pirated CDs are smuggled into the mainland from Taiwan or Southeast Asia, whereas recently, some unscrupulous businessmen have set up pirate CD manufacturing plants in the hinterland to avoid an official clampdown. Moreover, most of these factories cover up their activities by manufacturing other kinds of industrial products. Fair Quality, Attractive Prices The production cost for pirated CDs is very low, but the investment in the production line is not that low because, generally speaking, $2 million is required. Hence, most of these unlawful factories in the mainland are funded by investors from Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Southeast Asia. In the earliest stages, as the market was not large, the retail price of every pirated CD was over HK$20, but as the market is increasing, and as the owners of unlawful factories are overtly and covertly competing with each other for better sales, the retail prices of pirated CDs have dropped drastically. For example, one can buy a large number of pirated CDs at HK$11 to HK$12 each. The retail prices of pirated CDs around the Zhu Jiang Delta Region now range from 12 to 18 yuan, whereas in Hong Kong, three pirated CDs are sold for HK$100. People can find such illegal stalls in some commercial districts from time to time, and business at these stalls is brisk. These pirated CDs are not poor-quality and can meet ordinary consumers' needs. Each of them picks 17 to 18 selected songs by noted singers, while only 10 songs or so are included in original CDs and not all of them are good songs. Under such circumstances, it is natural that pirated CDs are well-received by consumers. Although Hong Kong Customs already have put up warning posters in open spaces at every port of entry and exit, noting that "no one is allowed to carry pirated CDs; once convicted, one faces a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment and a HK$1,000 fine for each disc." However, when returning to the mainland, many Hong Kong residents cannot but buy some pirated CDs. Even in open spaces at the Shenzhen Joint Inspection Building, we can see several stalls that are selling pirated CDs quite openly, and business is brisk owing to the great demand. Zhongshan, Guangzhou Become Distribution Centers Apart from higher prices than those sold in the mainland, in Hong Kong we cannot test the sound of a CD we want to buy. Owing to fiercer competition, however, sellers in the mainland generally offer good services, and customers can test the sound of discs as they please. Therefore, a lot of people would rather buy pirated compact discs in the mainland. A friend of mine said that he bought as many as 100 pirated CDs and that most of them are of fair quality. According to some industry insiders, some of the molds used to produce pirated CDs are used and discarded molds purchased directly, and illegally, from factories producing original CDs, while others are reproduced from songs recorded from radio broadcasts. Normally, these molds should be replaced after producing a certain number of CDs, but in order to reduce costs, pirate businessmen do not replace them. Therefore, some of the pirated CDs skip over certain parts or have a strong hum. In addition, the insiders pointed out: Some of the pirated CDs produced in the mainland are smuggled to Southeast Asian, European, or American regions, whereas at present, the largest wholesale market around the Zhu Jiang Delta Region is mainly in Zhongshan and Guangzhou. The average wholesale price of each pirated CD ranges from HK$8 to HK$10 (this is the net price of the disc; that of the plastic pack is not included). Many purchasers from interior provinces also go there. Following the Law To Stop Piracy As a matter of fact, it is believed that pirated CDs will continue to exist for a long time, until there is a perfect system of legal control in the mainland. Owing to their cheap prices and fair quality (with only a certain amount of hum), it is very difficult for consumers to resist them. Many consumers hold that unless the prices of original compact discs are marked down drastically, they will not find these discs more attractive. Hence, it is believed that to put an end to pirated CDs, the ultimate method is for businessmen producing original CDs to play down their motive of making huge profits and let the market decide prices. Only in this way can the problem be solved.
