One hour after the launch, Endeavor was put into orbit at an altitude of 300 km above the ground, and experiments aboard the space ship began immediately. Shortly after the experiments were started, a water leak was found near the power system for the No. 10 rack. A water leak aboard a spaceship in space can lead to a major disaster if the floating water droplets find their way into the electrical system. The supply of cooling water to the rack was suspended immediately, and the experiment on the rack was suspended until the leakage could be repaired. A number of material experiments were scheduled to be conducted in the No. 10 rack using a sound-pressure-floating furnace, an image furnace, and a zone furnace. These experiments had been selected from among the many proposals submitted regarding experimental themes to be conducted in space. The proposals had been submitted by the public in 1979. During the next 13 years, a series of experiments had been conducted on the ground and aboard planes in flight in preparation for the space experiments. Beginning in April 1992, we conducted three mock experiments (POCC) at the Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama, to prepare for the upcoming space experiments. Since these efforts had extended over many years, the news of the water leak accident shocked us greatly. At the same time, we were impressed by NASA's way of handling the accident. Immediately after the water leak was found, a meeting of specialists was called aboard the space shuttle to determine whether the leak could be repaired safely. About 24 hours passed before they made a decision on the measures to be taken. After ascertaining safety, they cut open a layer of a material wrapping the valve where the leak was thought to be occurring. The image of the repair work was transmitted to the ground stations. The repair was made safely with the help of ground engineers. To compensate for the delay in starting the experiments caused by this accident, the space shuttle's stay in space was extended by one day. Thanks to this, we were able to carry out all the scheduled experiments (Tables 1 and 2). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

In recent years, the development of materials began to be made on a commercial basis by exploiting the above advantages of the space experiment environment (Table 3 [not reproduced]). The lasting microgravity conditions in space make it possible to melt glass materials without requiring a material container to hold them in place. This, in turn, makes it possible to create a highly pure glass, free of impurities traced to the container. The microgravity environment also makes it possible to create a glass without a crystallized structure. If a container does not have to be used, it is possible to create a high-melting point glass that is not affected by the thermal limitations of the container used. In addition, the weightless condition makes it possible to create new hetero-glasses that cannot be created on the ground and are completely different from conventional glasses. The formation of conventional glasses involve a crystallization process in which the melted materials are maintained at a quasi-stable state. In developing new materials, it is important to fully understand the phenomena that are expected to affect the results of material development in space. The experiments which we conducted aboard the space shuttle offered us sufficient time to unravel many of these phenomena, something that had been impossible in the experiments conducted using a free-fall tower, aircraft, or by launching small rockets. Through these space experiments, we obtained valuable data for creating new materials. The experiment conducted for the "research to develop the optical materials for use in invisible light range applications," that had been proposed by the Government Industrial Research Institute, Osaka (Item M-17 in Table 1), was one of those most important experiments conducted aboard the space shuttle. The purpose of the experiment was to establish the technology for melting materials using no material container and to process the melted materials to create new types of glasses, such as high-purity glass and high melting-point glass. The experiment was conducted by having the materials floated and held in place by means of sound pressure. The materials were melted by light, and then solidified by cooling, producing the high-purity and high melting-point glasses. One of the purposes of developing these glasses was to create a glass with a higher infrared transmissivity than that of the quartz glass used in conventional optical fiber communications for use in the next-generation optical communications networks. The space experiments made it possible to verify the usefulness of the ground-developed technology for floating glass materials by means of sound pressure. The experiments also involved testing the float control techniques and studying the technology's application fields. Through these experiments, the performance of the sound pressure furnace (Figure 2 [not reproduced]) used in the space experiments was also ascertained. Table 4 gives the compositions of the materials used in the space experiments and the conditions under which these materials were melted. One melt experiment was conducted using a low melting-point specimen, while two experiments were conducted using high melting-point specimens. These experiments produced a glass with a high purity that could not be obtained on the ground (Figure 3 [not reproduced]). However, since the melted glass adhered to the cage within which the materials were melted, it was impossible for us to recover the glass as the complete sphere of a high-purity glass. The experiments we conducted in space and the results of the experiments are outlined below. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 4.

(Figure 4 [not reproduced] shows a floating specimen being heated.) The results of the experiment are as follows: Float control: (1) It was ascertained that the existing software could be used to control the position of the floating specimen. The fact that we could confine the specimen to within a fixed area by adjusting the frequency of the sound waves to accommodate changes in experimental conditions indicates that the software functioned as designed. However, it was found out that the program was slow in responding to these changes. This required further improvements of the software speed. (2) The use of the cage (Figure 5 [not reproduced]) proved very useful in easing the unexpected "G-jitters." In addition, the cage was necessary not only for serving as an auxiliary heater for melting a specimen, but also for increasing the safety in handling the high-temperature molten fluid under weightless conditions. To further enhance the cage functioning, we used platinum cages coated with a carbon film. Carbon has poor wettability against platinum, preventing the platinum element from finding its way into the molten specimen easily. In addition, the carbon film is useful in preventing the molten fluid from sticking to the cage. Spot observation of specimen: The purposes for conducting the space experiments included the on-the-spot observation of the specimen floating within the cage and the observation of the melting process via a fiber scope inserted into the furnace. However, this time we failed to obtain a clear view of the melting process due to the low resolution in the images obtained through the fiber scope. The poor resolution was attributable to the inability to secure the specimen in a designated position. When a larger rack space becomes available in the future, it will become possible to obtain clearer images by introducing a reflective optical observation system. Observation of melted specimen: In order to observe the behavior of the specimen used in the first experiment, a cobalt marker was applied to the surface of the specimen that was melted by being floated by means of sound pressure. When the melted specimen was cooled and solidified, it was found that the marker had expanded in length, changing from the original shape of a tiny speck to a bar (Figure 6 [not reproduced). This change in shape indicates that a glass flow occurred during the melting and solidification process. The specimen with the expanded marker was used to calculate the velocity of the flow, the density change, and the diffusion coefficient from the melt temperature and time. In the second experiment, in contrast to the yellowish glass that had been obtained in ground experiments involving the use of a material container, a highly transparent glass was created in the space experiment. The glass contained tiny air bubbles that were formed on the surface of the glass during the solidification process. These bubbles posed a new problem that must be resolved if new glasses are to be created under microgravity conditions. In the third experiment, it was found that platinum found its way into the melted/solidified glass and crystallized at the interface between the platinum cage and the chunk of glass adhering to the inside of the cage. The invasion of the platinum into the glass formed the nuclei of nonuniform material elements inside the glass, leading to the growth of a crystal within the solidified glass. Measurement of transmissivity in ultraviolet, infrared and visible light ranges: The measurement of transmissivity was conducted using the specimen obtained from the second experiment since the measurement required the use of a highly transparent glass specimen. Because the shape of the specimen was not a parallelogram, an integrating sphere was used for measuring in the ultraviolet and visible light ranges, while a condenser beam was used in the infrared range. The transmissivity thus measured exhibited lower values in all these ranges than did that measured on the ground. However, compared with the specimens melted and solidified on the ground, the second specimen displayed better transparency. Figure 6 [not reproduced] shows the results of measuring the transmissivity in the ultraviolet and visible light ranges. It is thought that the numerous air bubbles that were formed within the second specimen affected not only light's absorption in the specimen, but also its transmissivity. Figure 7 [not reproduced] is a photograph of the bubbles existing within the melted glass fluid. By conducting these recent space experiments, we have obtained much valuable data that will prove useful in improving the purity of glass by melting the materials in the microgravity environment of space, in creating diversified types of glasses, in controlling crystallization by steep cooling of the melted materials, in studying the flow of melted glass fluid under microgravity conditions, in creating better homogenized glasses, in unraveling the reasons for the formation of air bubbles, and in reducing the content of impurities. The author hopes that this data will be used to help the R&D efforts in realizing the construction of the projected space station. At the same time, the author hopes that this data will also promote the development of these technologies for use on the ground.
