The KDH does not deem it suitable to consider the use of Hungarian as official language in Slovakia, Simko said. It is necessary, however, to look for a feasible solution which would make it possible to use the mother tongue in administrative contact, he added. Simko said that the Komarno, south Slovakia, meeting of January 8 had not contributed to straightening up of the relations between Slovaks and Hungarians.
