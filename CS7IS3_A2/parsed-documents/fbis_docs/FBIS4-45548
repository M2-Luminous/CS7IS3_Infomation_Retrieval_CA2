Thus, Mexico and the United States must continue to support joint strategies without violating the sovereignty of either country to combat drug trafficking. During the inauguration of a training course for PGR agents, at installations of the FBI Academy in Virginia, the United States, Rene Paz Horta, National Counternarcotics Institute (INCD) commissioner, said the intensification of efforts and the support of other nations strengthen the task of combating drug trafficking and related crimes, which he described as "among the most serious scourges of humanity." Representing Attorney General Humberto Benitez Trevino, who is responsible for counternarcotics efforts in the country, Paz said the training of PGR agents will help find solutions to this problem and reflects the two countries' willingness to cooperate. During the ceremony to inaugurate courses for PGR agents at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, Paz said Mexico and the United States must continue to promote joint strategies, without violating the sovereignty of either nation, to fight drug trafficking. The INCD commissioner said there is a firm conviction that drug trafficking is a worldwide problem that must be confronted jointly. He added this experience reinforces the hope of establishing a united front to combat this type of crime while respecting each other, their ethical values, and the law. He added the Mexican state headed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has promoted the establishment of a common front against crime, because the antidrug fight requires tremendous efforts and increasingly larger economic and human resources. Paz said it is painful to see thousands of human beings, particularly young ones, fall victim to drugs. He highlighted the need to expand rehabilitation programs for adults as well as the people's participation in preventive efforts.
