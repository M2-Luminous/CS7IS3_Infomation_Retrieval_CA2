The Japanese economy will step into a period of maturity but it will still be able to achieve an average growth rate of 3.5 percent in the first 10 years of the 21st century. However, this is premised on the realization of various system reforms such as financial reform, the opening of the market, and decentralization. 2. Under such circumstances, enterprises will be pressed to shift from conventional management that places emphasis only on sales to management that places emphasis on earnings from creating new markets. In addition, for future enterprise strategies, it is useful to fully utilize business econometrics that connects macro economics and individual enterprise's micro numerals (financial statements, etc.). 3. By the time 2010 arrives, the "wall of 2030," that is, global-scale resource and environment restraints will come in sight. Japan should tackle these tasks by making the most of its high economic power and technical capability. The 21st century is close at hand as we are now about halfway through the 1990's. By the year 2000, what will become of Japan's economic structure? 3.5-Percent Growth Possible if Reform Implemented Japan will face the following two tasks in this period. First is what Japan, whose economy steps from adolescence to maturity should do to avoid contracting the so-called advanced nations disease (the high unemployment rate, twin deficits, etc.). The second is how Japan, which has now become a leading economic power in the world, should relate itself to the running of the future world economy. The center has reached the conclusion that Japan will still be able to achieve 3.5-percent growth in the 2000's without contracting the advanced-nations disease, provided that necessary system reforms are implemented. Japan will have to make the best use of this economic power to actively face up to the tasks of the world economy, including the reduction of gaps between the North and the South. In this case, the 1990's will serve as a period of reform for such tasks to be put on track. By setting up a computing system suited for the long-term economic forecast, we have carried out various simulations. This system is a distributed-type simulator enabling a PC-based dialogue, and it is made up of three parts--the data base, the model computation (the econometric model, the inter-industry relations table, etc.) and the output unit (printing, AV [audiovisual], etc.). At first, we sought upper and lower limits of the growth trajectory of the future Japanese economy. The upper limit represents the continuation of the same growth as has been made thus far (average growth rate of 4.6 percent by the year 2000 as was recorded in 1975 through 1990), and the lower limit represents a case in which Japan lapses into the advanced-nations disease (the average growth rate of 1.5 percent). As a result, we have learned that either case carries its problems. First, in case of high growth, the Japanese economy cannot but continue its dependance on foreign demands, thereby becoming the sole winner in the world. Its current account surplus will reach as much as $300 billion by the year 2010. Even if part of the surplus is applied toward aid, international friction with various countries will intensify. Moreover, concerning the environmental issue, carbon dioxides (CO[.sub]2[/]) emission will increase by 10 percent over 1990, making it impossible to abide by Japan's international commitment to "stabilize the amount of emissions by the year 2000." On the other hand, in case of low growth, there will be a burst of economic issues such as the rising unemployment rate (a little under 5 percent by 2010), the hollowing out of the industrial structure, and twin deficits (fiscal and international payments deficits). <graphic> </graphic> Then, would there be no way to avoid the advanced-nations disease and at the same time to coexist with other countries? We have conducted various simulations to search this feasibility, and as a result we found that system fatigue must be eliminated by carrying out the following reforms: 1) Establish healthy finances through restraints on spending and the innovations of the tax system and annuities. 2) Promote "decentralization" by shifting all activities from unipolarization in Tokyo to key cities (hereafter referred to as local "decentralization"). 3) Facilitate women's social participation by improving nurseries and increasing part-time jobs. 4) Open the market to foreign countries. 5) Revitalize industries and restore agriculture by means of multimedia as a driving force. As a result of such system reforms, the Japanese economy, which is to achieve a growth rate of 3.5 percent by the year 2000 will assume the following aspects. Need for Enterprises To Cultivate Markets 1. The Japanese economy will assume a domestic demand-oriented growth. This is attributed to: growth in durable consumer goods and leisure time-related consumption due to decentralization, annuity expansion, and the increase in leisure time; and purchasing houses will become much easier due to local decentralization (in key local cities, the price of a house will be about five to seven times annual earnings). 2. The leading industry will be that of information such as PC's, electronics, and communications devices in terms of both hardware and software. The realization of multimedia is the key to the development of the information industry in the future. We explored the possibility in the information industry by introducing multimedia in this forecast system. For example, reports on this project are distributed by means of video, and their details are outputted directly from the database and the computing system. On the other hand, the automobile industry, the leading industry at present, will reach maturity. Domestic production will go down to about 9 million cars (of which, 4 million are to be exported) by 2010. In addition, as for agriculture, there is a need to actively restore agriculture in terms of food security, particularly when there is the possibility that the United States will decrease its export of agricultural products in the future. Rice production by the year 2010 is estimated to be 12 million tons. 3. Finances will go into the black through restraints on spending, and the innovations of the tax system and the annuity system. Meanwhile, the current account will also acquire a balance. That is, the balance of trade will go into the red, and this deficit will be offset by invisible trade surplus. This means that products are imported and earnings are made through investment. The transfer payments will continue to be in the red to a large extent because of assistance to developing countries, etc. In our study, we set the change in business behavior as our central subject. All the enterprises had to do in the past was secure the growth of sales in step with the high growth of the Japanese economy. This linked to the assurance of their long-term profits. <graphic> </graphic> However, when the economy attains maturity, because of a rise in the cost of raw materials and personal expenses, enterprises will find it hard to secure sufficient profits by simply keeping step with the macro growth. Accordingly, it becomes important for future enterprises to cultivate profitable markets by themselves. In short, importance should be shifted from sales to earnings. Whenever one studies such an issue, it is important to build business behavioral models. Since the beginning of the 1980's, a field called business econometrics has developed in the United States, and econometric model-building on business structure is in progress. However, such a move is sluggish in Japan. In this forecast, using business econometrics, we tried to obtain forecast numerical values based on macroeconomics and inter-industrial relations. We also sought to consolidate financial statements (P/L--the profit and loss statement and B/S--the balance sheet). First, we built P/L and B/S models on an all-industry basis (corporate business statistics) and then models on each industry basis (electric machines, transport equipment, construction, retail, iron and steel). In working out a long-range management plan, each enterprise has thus far separated the forecasting sector, which estimates sales, etc. on the basis of macroeconomic predictions, and the financial sector dealing with P/L and B/S. Therefore, it appears that the contacts between the two sectors have not always been smooth within an enterprise. This is where the Japanese enterprises compare quite poorly with their U.S. counterparts. In order for Japanese enterprises to lead the world economy in the future, they require a philosophy regarding future management of the world economy and business strategies which indicate the philosophy in concrete and fixed quantities. The full utilization of business econometrics will be indispensable for putting this into practice. Resources and Environment Are To Restrain Prosperity Our business analysis through this method revealed several mooted points with regard to a conventional break-even analysis largely adopted in conventional P/L analysis. That is, the linear hypothesis on the cost function and an arbitrary classification of fixed and variable costs, on which the current analysis is premised, have mooted points, and, in essence, the analysis is possible only by using the model we worked out herein. For example, the break-even point of "all industries" is 85 percent by 2010 under the conventional method, but it is 68 percent according to our model. This smaller percentage for our model is because the gradual rise in the cost curve is clearly reflected and because fixed and variable parts are distinguished in all items. This alone indicates that the break-even analysis of the conventional type has many mooted points. In this context, if necessary reforms in various fields are carried out, Japan will be able to attain considerable prosperity and fulfill its appropriate role in the management of the global economy by the year 2000. Will Japan be able to continue its prosperity for long thereafter as well? We cannot necessarily have an optimistic view in this regard. This is because by the year 2010, "the wall of the year 2030" (the actualization of the resource and environment restraints on a global scale) will come in sight beyond the horizon. First, with regard to resources, the exhaustion of oil will become a problem. According to our calculation, the RP ratio [given by dividing reserves by annual consumption) will be 31 by 2010, but it will go down as low as 14 by 2030. That is, the reserves will meet only 14 years of consumption. Reflecting this, the oil export dependence rate on the Middle East will reach as high as 65 percent, a critical level, by 2010. Moreover, turning to the environment issue, there is a fairly high possibility that the atmospheric temperature will begin to rise around 2030 unless effective measures are taken to restrain CO[.sub]2[/] emissions. The ozone layer destruction is a more impending problem. An agreement has already been made on the disuse of specific and alternative fluorocarbons among the Montreal Protocol signatories; the use of alternative fluorocarbons, however, will continue for refrigerators, etc., for some time. Some alternative fluorocarbons have large short-term ozone layer destruction effects, and the warming-up effects of the alternative fluorocarbons are several hundred and several thousand times as great as CO[.sub]2[/]. A campaign launched in some quarters to retrieve them is hardly expected to be a cure-all. Accordingly, if the present situation continues, it is strongly possible that in the near future an ozone hole will be created in the northern hemisphere as well and that the intensity of ultraviolet rays on the Earth's surface will increase in Europe, the United States, Japan, and elsewhere in the northern hemisphere. How could we best cope with these problems? This is the very task that Japan should tackle by taking advantage of its economic affluence, powerful production means, and technology by 2010.
