Ibrahim Ghawshah, the official Hamas spokesman, told QUDS PRESS: We (in the Movement) consider the Palestinian alliance formula as not being sufficiently ambitious to the degree Hamas was seeking. It is rather a reconciliatory formula which does not achieve the desired aspirations, he added. Ghawshah, who recently participated in the Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF] meetings held in Damascus on 19 and 20 February, urged upgrading the current alliance formula. He said this is a temporary formula which should be upgraded. He pointed out that the Palestinian factions should work for a formula to establish an elected Palestinian parliament, similar to all democratic states. Such a parliament would truly express the Palestinian people's position on all issues related to their destiny and future, as he put it. Ghawshah stressed his movement's refusal to consider the popular conferences as a political reference from which a representative council can emanate. He said: This formula partially expresses the people's opinion, but we believe in total expression. This is a point of difference with the democratic (leftist) factions in particular. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] had called for holding conferences in the places where the Palestinians are present in order to create a leadership representing the Palestinians. Regarding the meetings of the APF Central Command recently held in Damascus, Ghawshah said they discussed three issues: first, the internal arrangements (the alliance); second, the regulations pertaining to these arrangements; and third, the activity in the territories and among the Palestinians in Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Ghawshah pointed out that the meetings touched on ways to enhance coordination in the territories in light of the APF's failure in (the elections of) the Doctors Association in Gaza. He stressed that this failure resulted from lack of coordination among the opposition factions. Ghawshah added that the Damascus meetings worked out preliminary programs to activate the APF on the political and popular levels. The conferees also agreed to organize visits by APF representatives to hold contacts in the world in general and in the Islamic world in particular on the official and popular levels. He pointed out that these visits aim to stress to the world that the Palestinian people adhere to their land, future, and homeland. Ghawshah revealed a draft for internal regulations for the APF. A dialogue will be held in order to endorse these regulations during a meeting of APF officials whose date will be set soon.
