The kind of attack suggests that Arizkuren Ruiz, Aguirre Lete, and Soledad Iparraguirre Guenechea may have been involved. These same Basque Fatherland and Liberty [ETA] members are allegedly responsible for the death of General Dionisio Herrero last October. Two of them may have committed nine other attacks. Defense Minister Garcia Vargas has asked the public at large as well as the media for help in finishing off with terrorism. "We fear the worst, that ETA has a stable infrastructure in Madrid," he added.
