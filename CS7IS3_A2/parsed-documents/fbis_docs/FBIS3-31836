The town is definitely disappearing under the onslaught of several thousand artillery shells. This afternoon two Luna missiles were fired at Maglaj, killing and wounding several civilians. The Maglaj defense lines are also ablaze under the unabated attacks by masses of equipment, weapons, and manpower coming in waves. The enemy has been intensifying his attempts to break through with infantry at Lijesnica, and has been using tanks in frontal attacks on Plane on the northern part of the front. The fighters of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade have been resisting these attacks. It was said here a long time ago that even a retreat of just one meter would mean deserting the people of this town to a horrible massacre. That is why the morale, the will, and the heroism of the Golden Lilies [Bosnia-Herzegovina flag] are superhuman.
