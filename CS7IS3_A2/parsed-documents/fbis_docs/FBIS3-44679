Hence, the so-called "case of Beijing's Prison No. 1 exporting goods to the United States" -- which was concocted in 1991 by Wolf, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives -- has finally come to light. In Sino-U.S. trade and other bilateral ties, problems and misunderstandings of one kind or another may occur; this is quite natural. The problems can be resolved easily and misunderstandings can eventually be dispelled as long as the two sides respect each other and hold consultations based on equal footing, with sincerity and cooperation. With a serious and earnest attitude, the U.S. Federal Government, in cooperation with the Chinese Government, meticulously investigated and eventually drew realistic conclusions on the case, which had remained "unsettled" for more than two years. On the question of prison goods, the policy of the Chinese Government is clear and its measures are resolute. As early as 10 October 1991, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economy and the Ministry of Judiciary jointly promulgated the "Regulations Reiterating the Ban on Export of Prison Goods." According to the provisions, prison enterprises do not have the right and are not allowed to carry out activities involving foreign trade and economy. Responsible officials of the Chinese departments concerned, emphasized this position on numerous occasions. Since the signing in Washington on 7 August 1992 of the "Memorandum of Understanding on Banning Exports of Prison Goods" between the representatives of China and the United States, the Chinese side has strictly enforced the relevant provisions of the memorandum. Meanwhile, China's concerned departments also offered positive cooperation to U.S. political figures, including Representative Wolf, during their visits to Beijing's Prison No. 1. All of this fully indicates the sincerity of the Chinese side in resolving the question of prison goods. In recent years, U.S. Government and public figures have visited China one after another. Through what they have seen and heard, most of them have gained a practical understanding and an objective and a just appraisal of the tremendous progress made in China's reform over the past decade or so, which has further increased their confidence in the future of Sino-U.S. ties. Nevertheless, a handful of people still have prejudices against China. In spite of the facts, they spare no efforts to create trouble, mix up black and white, confuse the public, and harm Sino-U.S. relations, eventually resulting in an unpleasant conclusion. We hold that there should be more sincerity and less prejudice in order to improve Sino-U.S. ties. Since the Sino-U.S. Seattle summit, a good development trend has appeared in Sino-U.S. relations. China is the largest developing nation, while the United States is the most developed nation in the world, and the two sides share a wide range of common interests. As long as both sides are sincere and make efforts to increase mutual understanding and trust, we believe that the obstacles in bilateral relations can be removed and that Sino-U.S. ties can be established on a solid basis.
