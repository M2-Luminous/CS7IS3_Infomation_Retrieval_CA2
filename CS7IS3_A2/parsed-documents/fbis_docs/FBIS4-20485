These sequences were compared with other published dengue-2 envelope sequences. The result showed that the homology of nucleotide sequences between D2-04, D2-05, and D2-43 were 95.76-95.96 percent. The similarities of amino acid sequences were 92.12-94.3 percent. The nucleotide changes between each other of those strains were not obvious. However, when D2-04, D2-05, D2-43 were compared with NGC in transition and transversion respectively, the transitions were more than the transversions. The transversion of D2-05 was more than D2-04 and D2-43. The changes of codons in the third position were mostly observed in D2-04, D2-05, and D2-43, but we found that the changes in the first and second position of D2-05 were more than D2-04 and D2-43. It may be a factor affecting the changes of biological properties. When D2-04, D2-05, and D2-43 strains were compared with JAM, NGC, M3 and PR159(S1) strains, it showed that these three strains were most similar with JAM strain, most dissimilar with PR159(S1) strain at nucleotide level. The similarities of amino acid sequences corresponded to homology of nucleotide sequences between each other of D2-04, D2-05, and D2-43 strains. The results indicated that D2-04, D2-05, and D2-43 were more closely related to JAM strain than NGC and M3 strain and less related to PR159(S1) from Puerto Rico.
