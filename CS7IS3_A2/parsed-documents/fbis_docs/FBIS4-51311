Wei Jianxing is member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and 'Abdallah al-Ahmar is assistant secretary-general of the Syrian ruling party. During the talks, the two sides reviewed the development of relations between the two parties in light of an agreement signed between the two sides in 1991 and highlighted the necessity of bolstering their relations. Wei briefed the host on the major achievements China has registered since it adopted the policy of reforms and opening to the outside world in 1978. He also expounded the Chinese stance toward the Middle East issue, stressing a political solution to the issue based on U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of land for peace. He underlined the necessity of restoring all the occupied territories including the Syrian Golan Heights, the necessity of restoring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and ensuring the security and territorial integrity of all the states in the region. He voiced China's unswerving support for the Palestinian people and the Arab people in their struggle for winning independence and reclaiming the occupied land. On his part, 'Abdallah al-Ahmar stressed Syria's principles for the establishment of a new society and its stand toward the Middle East peace process. He pointed out that the cause behind the stumbling Middle East peace process is Israel's stubbornness and refusal to comply with the U.N. Security Council Resolutions, especially 242, 338 and 425, which stipulate its withdrawal from all the Arab lands.
