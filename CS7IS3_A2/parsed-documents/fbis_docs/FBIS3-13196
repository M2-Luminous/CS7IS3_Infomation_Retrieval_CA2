According to a Majles decision today, ministries, public organs, establishments, and companies are empowered to pay a maximum of 40,000 rials per day as mission allowance to those sent on foreign missions providing the travel expenses incurred are not personal. [sentence as heard] Any other payments, or the receipt of any other payments, whether in rials or foreign currency, is forbidden and shall be construed as illegal appropriation of public assets. Our correspondent adds: The 1373 budget bill was presented to the Majles on 21 December 1993 and since then it has been under review by various Majles commissions, especially the Plan and Budget Commission. The bill was debated and approved in Majles open sessions in two stages: first the section on income and then the expenditure section. The Majles is to hold an open session on the morning of 12 March to discuss the Guardian Council's views on the 1373 state budget bill.
