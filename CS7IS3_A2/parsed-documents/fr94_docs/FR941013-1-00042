(6) The identification of any information on the application which is considered by the applicant to be a trade secret or confidential and entitled to protection under U.S. laws restricting the public disclosure of such information by government employees. (c) The administrator may require the applicant to submit such additional documents or written statements of fact relevant to the application which he deems necessary for determining if the application should be granted. (d) Within a reasonable period of time after the receipt of a completed application for an exemption under this section, the Administrator shall notify the applicant of acceptance or nonacceptance of the application. If the application is not accepted, an explanation will be provided. The Administrator is not required to accept an application if any of the information required in paragraph (b) of this section or requested pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section is lacking or not readily understood. The applicant may, however, amend the application to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. If the application is accepted for filing, the Administrator shall issue and publish in the Federal Register an order on the application, which shall include a reference to the legal authority under which the order is based. This order shall specify the date on which it shall take effect. The Administrator shall permit any interested person to file written comments on or objections to the order. If any comments or objections raise significant issues regarding any findings of fact or law upon which the order is based, the Administrator shall immediately suspend the effectiveness of the order until he may reconsider the application in light of the comments and objections filed. Thereafter, the Administrator shall reinstate, revoke, or amend the original order as deemed appropriate. §1310.15 Exempt drug products containing ephedrine and therapeutically significant quantities of another active medicinal ingredient. (a) The drug products containing ephedrine and therapeutically significant quantities of another active medicinal ingredient listed in paragraph (e) of this section have been exempted by the Administrator from application of sections 302, 303, 310, 1007, and 1008 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 822&hyph;3, 830, and 957&hyph;8) to the extent described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. (b) Records and reports: All regulated persons who manufacture an exempt drug product must keep complete and accurate records and file all reports required under §§1310.05 and 1310.06 on all listed chemicals used in manufacturing the exempt drug product. Transactions involving approved exempt drug products contained in paragraph (e) of this section are not regulated transactions and thus records and reports are not required to be kept for listed chemicals once they become part of an exempt drug product.
