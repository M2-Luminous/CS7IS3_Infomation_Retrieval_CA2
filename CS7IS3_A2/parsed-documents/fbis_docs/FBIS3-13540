Undoubtedly, we in Syria are very concerned and worried about what is taking place here out of our concern for Algeria's unity and its role in the Arab and Islamic arenas, and on the basis of our conviction that President Zeroual's statement on the dialogue was positive and it is bound to lead to the easing of the brotherly people's suffering and to the establishment of security and stability in this country.
