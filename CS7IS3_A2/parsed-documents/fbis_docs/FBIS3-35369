Gen. Shahaq whether he could at this point give us an estimated timetable for the signing of the agreement. [Shahaq] I do not think I can give you an exact timetable. I can only tell you that the talks in the last two weeks have been more businesslike and that if they continue at this pace and in the same businesslike manner, there is a chance that we may soon wrap them up. [Engel] Would you describe the issues still in dispute as being mainly technical and marginal -- as other members of the delegation described them this morning -- or are they matters of substance which may only be concluded after a summit meeting between Rabin and 'Arafat? [Shahaq] I would say that they are both. What we consider matters of substance may be perceived by the other side as being less important or vice versa. In my opinion, some of the pending issues may be termed matters of substance, while others are technical issues. Therefore, I think quite a lot of work remains before we reach an agreement. [Engel] We understand that one of the disputed issues is the release of security prisoners. Is there a timetable for their release and is it an inevitable phase? Will it include members of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and other rejectionist organizations? [Shahaq] There is as yet no timetable for the release of prisoners, which is part of a broader issue known as confidence-building measures. In this context, we will have to deal with other issues, and not just the question of the Palestinian prisoners. There is no doubt that the issue of the prisoners is an important and painful matter to the Palestinian side which would like to reach an agreement on the matter. We will try to reach an agreement on this matter, too. There is as yet no agreement about a timetable or the number of prisoners to be released. For example, we set several criteria which we will have to discuss. According to this criteria, anybody who engaged in terror after 13 September 1993, the day the agreement was signed in Washington, will not be included in such an agreement. Members of Hamas will not be included either, because they are opposed to the peace process and constitute an opposition to the Palestinians we are sitting with, and because they continue to murder people and to declare that they will go on doing so. Therefore, as long as there is no change in this issue, the entire question of the prisoners will not be concluded. [Engel] Will we, at least in the first stage, make a one-sided gesture of releasing prisoners? [Shahaq] Even if such a gesture is made, it will have nothing to do with the negotiations. The negotiations about the release of prisoners are not yet over. To repeat, I believe the moment an understanding is reached it will be publicized. [Engel] Could you point to any progress with regard to the whereabouts of Israel's MIA's? [Shahaq] We do not directly deal with this issue in the negotiations, but the fate of Israel's MIA's has come up and the matter is being dealt with. On this issue, too, I cannot point to any spectacular news. However, we will not let go of it, either within or outside the negotiations until we attain some results. [Engel] Sir, thank you very much and have a nice day.
