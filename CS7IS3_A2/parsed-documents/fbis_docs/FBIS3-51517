He said this after he inaugurated the Huamanga-Huanta road, a project requiring an investment of more than 3 million soles, in Ayacucho Department. President Alberto Fujimori inaugurated 20 km of the Huamanga-Huanta road in Ayacucho Department. He was accompanied by (Pierre Ramba), UN permanent representative in Peru. This road represents a 3.3 million new soles investment and will allow trade in this area of the country to be stimulated. It includes the (Ayaorcuna), (Guaiguas), and Cusca bridges. [Begin unidentified resident recording] We wish to express our deepest gratitude because we now know the jobs are being completed. [applause] [end recording] In response to the residents' repeated requests, the president pledged to undertake the Rashuillca project, which will use lake water for irrigation. The president took the opportunity to briefly visit the Santa Clara Convent where he spoke with the nuns. Alexander Watson was not present. President Fujimori and Ayacucho Bishop Monsignor Juan Luis Cipriani both agreed that the U.S. official should verify human rights accomplishments in situ and not from a desk. [Begin Fujimori recording] I do not believe the human rights problem can be viewed simply from a desk, taking into account the partial speculation and information that reaches him. Human rights is an issue to be discussed here in Ayacucho, (Huancasanco), and Huanza, where there are so many orphans. Here, the Army, the Armed Forces in general, the peasant patrols, and the people have defended human rights. That is why we can talk of human rights now, and here human rights are respected because we have defended them. [end recording]
