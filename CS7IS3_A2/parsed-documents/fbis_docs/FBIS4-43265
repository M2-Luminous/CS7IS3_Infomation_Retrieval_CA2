But the difference between yes and no has been halved since November. The clearest change in the poll carried out by the Central Bureau of Statistics [SCB] when compared with the corresponding poll in November is that the no side is losing ground. Men still take a more positive view of EU membership than women -- 35 percent against 25 percent. However, in both cases the proportion of those in favor of membership has increased by around 5 percentage points since last November. The proportion of those against EU membership is of a similar size in the case of both sexes, around 40 percent. Around 23 percent of men are undecided, while 33 percent of women do not know how they will vote. As far as age is concerned the proportion of those in favor of EU membership is greatest among people in the age range 50-54, around 38 percent. The smallest proportion in favor of membership is found among the very old, around 20 percent. The highest proportion against EU membership -- around 46 percent -- is to be found among first-time voters. Among the supporters of the parties represented in the Riksdag the proportion of those in favor of membership has increased in the case of all parties with the exception of the Left Party. There has been a particularly dramatic improvement for EU supports among those who support the Liberal Party. They increased from 49.1 percent in November to 63.1 percent in May. However, the Moderate Coalition Party has the biggest percentage in favor of membership -- 68.5 percent in May, compared with 59.9 percent in November. The figures for the other parties show changes as follows: - Social Democrats from 15.7 to 18.7 percent. - Center Party from 17.5 to 26.9 percent. - Christian Democratic Party from 17.7 to 26.3 percent. - New Democracy from 27.1 to 36.0 percent. - Left Party from 6.0 to 5.9 percent. - The Green Ecology Party from 14.9 to 9.8 percent. In November the no side had over 50 percent of all party supporters with the exception of the Liberal Party and the Moderate Coalition Party. In May the no side had an absolute majority only in the Left Party and the Green Ecology Party. The no side has suffered its biggest losses among Center Party supporters, from 58.3 percent to 45.2 percent. The figures for the other parties show changes as follows: - Social Democrats from 52.3 to 47.4 percent. - Liberal Party from 23.7 to 19.1 percent. - Moderate Coalition Party from 15.4 to 12.9 percent. - Christian Democratic Party from 53.9 to 46.2 percent. - New Democracy from 51.9 to 48.3 percent. - Left Party from 84.0 to 83.9 percent. - Green Ecology Party from 73.2 to 76.5 percent. The SCB used a random sample of 9,300 people. Of these around 20 percent refused to respond, were too ill to respond, or could not be contacted. A little under 7,500 replied to the SCB's questions. The SCB asked: If we were to have a referendum today on Swedish membership in the EU, how would your vote: for or against joining? Those interviewed were then asked whether they were certain or uncertain in the choice they have made. In the don't know category, SCB asked whether people were leaning toward a no or a yes. [Report is accompanied by a bar chart that breaks down the yes, no, and don't know votes. The figures it gives are as follows, with changes in parentheses: Yes -- 30.5 percent (plus 4.5 percent) -- of which uncertain 9.9 percent (plus 1.0 percent) and certain 20.6 percent (plus 3.5 percent).
