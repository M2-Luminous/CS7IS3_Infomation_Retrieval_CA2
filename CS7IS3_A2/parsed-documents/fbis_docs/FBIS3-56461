In his view, this decision "is likely to bring about serious negative consequences." Kovalyov emphasized that it had been a mistake to regard Russia's Choice as the government party. "I kept repeating in every speech I made that we could not be a government party without having a decisive influence in the government," he said. The Russia's Choice group intended to nominate Mikhail Mityukov to the position of deputy speaker. In his words, the group will not let Liberal Democratic Party [LDPR] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy chair the International Affairs Committee. "We will vote against this, and democratically-minded deputies have enough votes to make this impossible. What is more, I suspect that the communists also do not intend to let the LDPR have that position," Kovalyov explained. He said that his group will support election of either Vladimir Lukin of the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc or former first deputy foreign minister Anatoliy Adamishin to that position.
