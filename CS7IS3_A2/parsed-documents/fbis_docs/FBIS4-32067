From their strongholds in the so-called autonomous region of Krajina, chetniks shelled the outlying districts of Cazin. They also targeted the wider area of Buzim. Although the members of Fikret Abdic's traitorous units were reinforced with chetniks among their ranks in their attacks on Pecigrad and Todorovo. Their attempts to recapture lost territory were in vain. Mirza Sadikovic reports: [Sadikovic] The truth is rapidly finding its way to Velika Kladusa. This afternoon the fighters of the 5th Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army liberated new territories as they were returning fire to constant artillery and infantry attacks launched by members of Fikret Abdic's forces, fully supported by the chetniks of the so-called autonomous region of Krajina. They also disarmed yet another group of some 100 soldiers of the self-styled people's defense of Velika Kladusa, thus bringing total disarray into its 1st Brigade. A considerable amount of artillery and infantry equipment, weapons and ammunition was captured in this operation. At the same time a large number of people have crossed into the liberated territory, while Fikret Abdic's war-mongering headquarters is being gripped by panic because even the private radio station of Velkoton [Velika Kladusa Radio] has started to disobey orders. Overall, conditions are being rapidly created for the normalization of living conditions and the legality of the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina across the entire region of Bihac.
