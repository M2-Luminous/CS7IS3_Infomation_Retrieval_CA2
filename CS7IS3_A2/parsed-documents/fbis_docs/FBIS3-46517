Commenting on the landslide victory of the ultra-right Liberal Democratic Party led by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Hata noted "that was partly because the Russian public is very frustrated with the present circumstances of the reform process." On that ground, He stressed: "Japan strongly hopes all members of the new Russian parliament will demonstrate their sense of responsibility to both the Russian public and the international community, and further promote the nation's reform efforts." In conclusion, he added: "There is absolutely no change in Japan's policy to offer appropriate assistance to Russia's reform efforts."
