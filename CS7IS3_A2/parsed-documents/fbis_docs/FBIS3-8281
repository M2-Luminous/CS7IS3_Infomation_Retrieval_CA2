This statement was made by RDP Group Director General Jan Vlcek at yesterday's news conference in Prague. He added that the "consortium rejects any suggestions that it would act at variance with the state's interests." According to Director Vlcek, the RDP Group has not asked for permission to export modernized tanks or for a license to export equipment to Iran for repairing tanks; the company was merely "mapping out the market." The modernized tank, if it is exported, will not, according to him, be oriented toward regions engaged in conflict. The consortium will always consult the Foreign and Trade and Industry Ministries on the export of all military materials. The fact that representatives from these ministries and the Defense Ministry have free access to each board meeting also contributes to the "transparency" of the company's commercial and manufacturing activity. The consortium has already concluded agreements abroad for certain orders, while others are being negotiated. Vlcek refused to specify them, however, in view of commercial confidentiality. The three-year stoppage has not benefited Czech arms exports on foreign markets, and many orders were canceled; nevertheless, the customers have remained aware of their quality. The main objective of the RDP Group, however, is not exports but coordinating production activity, conducting research and development, securing new projects, financing them, and, last but not least, holding a dialogue with the Czech Army. In this connection, the consortium's representatives criticized the Army's inadequate approach to its rearmament program, whose implementation has constantly been postponed. The RDP Group is trying to make sure that as many Czech enterprises as possible are involved in this state order. "We will produce whatever Czech industry can produce in the Czech Republic. Whatever it cannot produce will be guaranteed by linking up to a foreign partner," said Vlcek. If transferring production to the Czech Republic is unsuitable, the RDP Group will endeavor to agree upon countershipments at the same cost. A number of projects, the criteria for which are price, high standards, and quality, have been prepared for the Czech Army. Modernizing the existing hardware will be one of the most comprehensive projects; new types of wheeled vehicles (including a licensed product from Avia Letnany, which is already being tested by the Interior Ministry) are also being prepared. Other projects involve hand weapons, including antitank missiles, the development of new ammunition, including intelligent ammunition, and communications systems. The projects should be put forward in the very near future. Cooperation with the Army, however, is not proceeding as the producers, who need to sell as much as possible in the shortest time possible, had hoped. The Topfin banking hous, which is, in fact, a consortium of banks involving, for example, the Investicni banka and the Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka, is prepared to provide finance for the projects. The company also has links to banks in Paris and Washington and is organizing representation in Moscow.
