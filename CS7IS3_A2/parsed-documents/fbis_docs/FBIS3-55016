Speaking on Lithuanian television on Tuesday, the president said he had sent a letter to Secretary General of NATO Mr. Manfred Woerner, by which, taking into account a parliamentary resolution, he had officially appealed to admit Lithuania to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In his letter, Mr Algirdas Brazauskas expressed hope that the NATO summit, due January 10 through 11, would open possibilities for the central and east European states to join that organization. The president said Lithuania's standpoint toward its membership in NATO was not aimed at confrontation with either the neighboring countries or any other European state. Lately the right-wing opposition has been criticizing the Lithuanian president and the governing Democratic Labor Party for too irresolute a position toward Lithuanian membership in NATO. Meanwhile, the leader of the right-wing opposition, Mr. Vytautas Landsbergis, has expressed hope that the letter of the Lithuanian president to the NATO secretary general will attract attention in the West. As the opposition leader put it, then Lithuania will stand side by side with Poland, not only on the map of Europe, but also on the list of candidates for membership in NATO. Mr. Landsbergis on Tuesday made a statement falling in line with that by the president, that Lithuania is seeking stability and protection, and that this, in his words, is not a threat or humiliation for anybody. The opposition leader said Lithuania's desire to join NATO did not run counter to the U.S. partnership for peace initiative.
