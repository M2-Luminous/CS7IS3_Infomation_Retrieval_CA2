[Bohl] Good morning. [Wiese] How does the FRG Government assess the fact that the NATO ultimatum has expired without the threatened air strikes having been necessary? [Bohl] Well, the situation is that NATO and the United Nations are making it clear after all that air strikes are not required now and this development is very positive. I think it is always good if war-like and military conflicts or strikes are not necessary. In this respect, it is certainly a good development. [Wiese] International deliberations on a new peace initiative for Bosnia are to be held in Bonn tomorrow. Chancellor Kohl is said to have suggested these talks in a telephone conversation with Russian President Yeltsin. Is this correct? [Bohl] Well, over the past few days the chancellor had many telephone conversations, particularly with the U.S. President and the Russian president. I think one can say the chancellor has done his decisive share in the fact that we will now have an apparently good round of high-standard talks in the diplomatic sector. I think that major credit for the present development goes to the chancellor. [Wiese] What will be the contents of these talks, Mr. Bohl? Can you give any details? [Bohl] No. I neither can nor want to do this. The FRG foreign minister already made relevant statements yesterday evening. Nothing more can be said at the moment. It would also be inappropriate to do this now. I ask you to understand this. However, as I have said, I hope that we now have a positive basic tendency and we will make progress now. [Wiese] You referred to FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. He also called for a solution for the Bosnian areas that are still contested, for example, Bihac and Tuzla. Is another NATO ultimatum conceivable for these areas? [Bohl] I really ask you to understand that I do not want to comment on this. I do not want to make any statement that goes beyond what the foreign minister has already said. [Wiese] How does the Federal Government assess the role of Russia in connection with the NATO ultimatum? [Bohl] Well, I think it has already been expressed in my response to your question regarding the decisive progress in this respect made by the chancellor, the U.S. President, and the Russian president and mention of the fact that Russia has certainly made a decisive contribution to the present development. Altogether I think it has to be very positively assessed that all those who are responsible are making great efforts to prevent the further escalation of this conflict and to achieve a tendency toward peace. I think it is important that the Balkans not become a powder keg, that all responsible persons are making efforts to prevent this -- apparently with success -- and to achieve a peaceful development in the Balkans, which will probably be unstable for many years. [Wiese] However, Mr. Bohl, rather threatening voices were still heard from Moscow yesterday. For example, Churkin, Russian envoy to the Balkans, urgently warned NATO against going ahead with its threat. Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev said he is not at all interested in the ultimatum. Are these arguments to achieve a strong position or what does that mean? [Bohl] Well, I do not want to comment on that. For me, the result counts. I want to continue to evaluate it as has already been done. [Wiese] My last question: What are the Federal Government's ideas of the next steps in and around Sarajevo? In other words, what do you think of the proposal to place Sarajevo under UN control? [Bohl] We want to leave that for the further talks. [Wiese] Thank you for this interview.
