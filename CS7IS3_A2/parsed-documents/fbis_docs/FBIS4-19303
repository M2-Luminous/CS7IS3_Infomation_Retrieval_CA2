Therefore, this issue will top the agenda of the German EU Presidency, which starts on 1 July, Kinkel said in Budapest today, at a forum organized by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, the Hungarian opposition Alliance of Young Democrats (FiDeSZ), and the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) on the subject of "The Visegrad Countries and the European Union." The successful regional integration of the Visegrad states, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland [as received], and Hungary was a preliminary stage to EU integration, the German foreign minister said. However, great efforts by all sides were still necessary before these countries could become members of the Union. Kinkel affirmed his proposal of a "Marshal Plan for the minds," under which, among other things, thousands of students from Central and East Europe should go to the EU states and college teaching staff should be exchanged. In the area of security too, integration rather than exclusion was necessary. The correct way to achieve this was, for instance, the "evolutionary concept" of a Partnership for Peace, Kinkel said. In addition, association with the WEU [Western European Union] needed to be possible in order to bring the East European states closer to the European Union.
