Patten also spoke personally to the Legislative Council yesterday afternoon in order to continue to cheat Hong Kong people. After that, the British Government and the British Hong Kong authorities flagrantly violated the principle of keeping the talks confidential and unilaterally published the White Paper "Representative Government in Hong Kong" to reveal the contents of the Sino-British talks, in which they deliberately distorted and covered up the fact that the British side, especially Chris Patten, undermined the Sino-British talks in an attempt to shirk the historical responsibilities that they should bear. Chris Patten came to Hong Kong to take office as governor in 1992, and he brought with him a sinister intention. At home, he was discarded by a British constituency, and lost his opportunity to play tricks in British political circles. He thus accepted the appointment to the Hong Kong governorship. Before the British policymakers decided to send Patten to Hong Kong, they spied out the land and made their own judgment on the international situation and China's future prospects. The British press has revealed this many times. The reunification of Germany, the political changes in some East European countries, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union made the gentlemen in London feel that they might again hold high their colonialist banner, or at least play the game of election politics, which they thought that they were good at, in Hong Kong against China in order to create a political structure similar to that in Britain before 1997 by changing Hong Kong's existing system. They also planned to put an "elite" they had painstakingly fostered for their colony inside Hong Kong's political structure, thus turning Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity and prolonging de facto British rule in Hong Kong so that they might continue to gain political and economic interests from Hong Kong. They even had a very fantastic idea, being blinded by lust for gain, and thought that the Chinese Government would soon collapse and China would become divided, so they did not scruple to violate the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the seven diplomatic letters exchanged by the two foreign ministers on the Hong Kong political structure, challenge the Basic Law that they hated to the very marrow of their bones, and set various obstacles to the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]. As soon as he took office in Hong Kong, Patten began to prepare for making major changes in Hong Kong's political structure according to the plan he had brought from London. His action was one taken by London as the spearhead of the new China policy. In order to change Hong Kong's existing system, Patten wantonly damaged the consultation mechanism specified by the Joint Declaration, and unilaterally dished out a so-called constitutional reform package, the impact of which he tried to make extend beyond 1997, without consulting the Chinese side. It was certain that the package would encounter the Chinese side's criticism and rejection. For the sake of Hong Kong's smooth transition, and also in order to observe the deeds of the British side while listening to its words and to give the British Government an opportunity to change course, the Chinese side agreed to hold talks with the British side on the 1994-95 election arrangements for Hong Kong. However, for the British side, the talks were just a fraud. They took the talks as a means of playing tricks, and tried by every possible means to achieve the purpose of putting Patten's package into practice. Therefore, they called for holding talks one day, and refused to talk another. On the one hand, they pretended to be willing to reach a compromise with the Chinese side; on the other hand, they actively made arrangements for forcing the Legislative Council to pass Patten's package and put it into practice while the talks were going on. In their plan, the talks only served the purpose of implementing Patten's package, so they were only willing to talk about what was favorable to the implementation of Patten's package, and refused to talk about what was not favorable to the implementation of Patten's package. This was exactly what they wanted to do in the talks. In the 17 rounds of talks, Patten did his utmost to deceive public opinion, and this was also a fact witnessed by all. Patten's show in the last two days was just the epilogue to the fraud, because their real features had been completely laid bare and they would not be able to deceive people any longer. In Hong Kong and overseas, Patten is now bogged down in an increasingly isolated position, just like the British cabinet led by John Major, which is now besieged on all sides. The British side and Patten tried to describe the dispute between China and Britain as a difference over whether there should be democracy for Hong Kong or not. This was the point expressed by the white paper published by them yesterday. In fact, this was just an out-and-out lie. In reality, the dispute just reflected the sharp confrontation between the Chinese side's "three conformities" and the British side's "three violations" and the serious difference between the Chinese side's adherence to abiding by diplomatic agreements and the British side's behavior of ignoring its international commitments. To put it more clearly, this was the contradiction between the Chinese side's determination to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the British side's attempt to hinder and undermine the process of China's resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. No matter what blandishments the British side and Patten offered, and no matter how the authors of the British white paper engaged in phrase-mongering, the facts could never be obliterated. Of course, they would just be working to no avail if they tried to shirk the British side's responsibility for undermining the talks. The biggest mistake Patten and his like have made is that they still think like their ancestors in the 19th century although they are living in last decade of the 20th century. They think that they are still facing the decadent Qing government and that the Western system and values must be imposed on Asia. Such conceit and such an arrogant attitude has been scathingly denounced by many leaders of Asian countries. Patten and his like absolutely have no right to talk about democracy and freedom in Hong Kong, because it is China's territory. The British colonial authorities will have to quit in just 40 months. The three-tier councils they are going to rig up in Hong Kong will certainly be disbanded and reorganized after they leave. Patten's fraud will bring no benefit to Britain. People who originally conceived illusions about Patten have also seen clearly that it is the British side that will eventually incur losses as it refuses to cooperate with the Chinese side. Yesterday, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry separately issued statements on the fact that Patten's constitutional package had been passed in part by the Legislative Council, and pointed out that the practice of the British side had tightly closed the door to the resumption of talks. The behavior of the British side has damaged the foundation for Sino-British cooperation, and will inevitably sour the atmosphere for the settlement of the new airport problems and other problems. As Patten and his like perversely stick to their course, they will certainly eat their own bitter fruit. People may wait and see if they do not believe this will come true.
