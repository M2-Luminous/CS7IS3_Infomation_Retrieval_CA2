FR940527-2-00167 FR940527-2-00127 DEPARTMENT OF STATE [Public Notice 2012] United States International Telecommunications Advisory Committee, Radiocommunication Sector, Study Group 1, Ad Hoc Group, Basic Automated Spectrum Management System (BASMS) For Developing Countries; Meeting Notice The Department of State announces that the United States International Telecommunications Advisory Committee (ITAC), Radiocommunication Sector, Study Group 1 Ad Hoc Group BASMS will meet on June 7, 1994, 9:30 am to 12 noon, in room 1412, at the Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC. In November 1993, the Radiocommunication Assembly of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) approved a resolution calling for the rapid development of a computer software for BASMS and the necessary training to implement this program in developing countries. The purpose of the BASMS program is to give developing countries a tool to efficiently and effectively manage the radio spectrum and therefore to accelerate the development of wireless technology in the country. In March 1994, ITU Radiocommunication Study Group 1 approved a recommendation on the ``Design Guidelines for a Automated Spectrum Management System (BASMS).'' The recommendation describes the software and hardware functional requirements that should be used to develop BASMS. The Telecommunication Development Bureau (BDT) of the ITU requested the U.S. (and other Administrations) to assist the BDT in developing BASMS by distributing information about BASMS requirements to appropriate private companies that are interested in developing this software. It is important that (1) the software be developed at minimum cost since the BDT has limited resources and (2) that the software be developed based on existing X based software to minimize cost and to develop the minimum time. The development time should be less than five months from the award of the contract. Proposals for the development of BASMS should be sent directly to the BDT by August 1, 1994. The award of the contract will be held within two months of this date. U.S. Radiocommunication Study Group 1, Ad Hoc Group BASMS will meet on June 7, 1994, to describe the technical specifications for BASMS and to answer questions concerning the development of the software. Anyone planning to attend the meeting should contact Robert J. Mayher by phone at (202) 482&hyph;1139 or by fax at (202) 482&hyph;4396. Dated: May 12, 1994. Warren G. Richards, Chairman, U.S. ITAC for ITU Radiocommunication Sector. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12979 Filed 5&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4710&hyph;45&hyph;M
