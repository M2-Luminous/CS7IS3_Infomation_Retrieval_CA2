The manats exchange rate against the U.S. dollar has gone down by 90 per cent and against the Russian ruble by 2.5 times correspondingly. Thus, today one U.S. dollar costs 1000 manats and the Russian ruble 0.6 manats. The Azeri currency's rapid downfall provoked a feverish mood in the country. At Baku's parallel market on Molokanka square, the exchange rate of the foreign currency is being updated up to three times a day. However, official exchange rates have not been adapted yet. According to the information available, the Azeri national bank pays 182.5 manats per dollar and 1 manat per 10 Russian rubles. That is why the center of currency transactions has moved from banking offices at the parallel market. According to specialists view, this is one more factor provoking the disastrous downfall of the local currency. Azeri experts consider the principal reason of the present economic situation the absence of a flexible monetary policy in Azerbaijan. Some experts explain this situation by the small amount of foreign currency that is being earned by Azerbaijan since the Republic's industry has virtually stopped working. Moreover, the manat has not become an independent currency and its condition depends on fluctuation of rate of exchange of the Russian ruble as the national bank has not determined the manats real value so far. One of the local televisions observers has expressed a very original opinion concerning this situation. He explained it by the reason that governmental officers take their bribes in freely convertible currency only. However, he may guess all too near: Baku newspapers give many examples of this kind. Though predictions are dismal -- experts think that dollars rate will increase in about 40 per cent every month -- the Republic is trying to find the way out from this crisis. Abolition of the law of limitation on export of strategic goods will undoubtedly provide more constant flow of currency. The experts think that the situation might be improved by creation of currency exchange offices where monetary transactions will be done in accordance with the reasonable rates of currency. The experts also say that development of the local industry and creation of normal conditions for small enterprises will be more effective in this case. However, present monetary and credit crisis resulted in retirement of administration of the national bank. Through the ever falling manats exchange rate more people live below the poverty line. Now 60 per cent of the republics population -- about 4 million people -- live in poverty. According to one of Baku's newspapers, each of the poor needs 12,600 manats monthly, if not to take inflation into consideration, in order to satisfy the minimum needs. This amount of money is 70 and 170 per cent as much as it was necessary in March and January this year. According to Ministry of Labour and Social Security, one citizen needs 16 thousand manats for showing a sign of life, it is a so-called physiological minimum. Meanwhile, a minimum salary of 900 manats is enough to buy half a kilogram of meat. So an average citizen of the Republic has to display miracles of resourcefulness in order not to kick the bucket.
