P.A. Sudoplatov ("Special Tasks: The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness"), which he coauthored with his son and the American Mr. and Mrs. Schecter. A whole section of the book is devoted to what the author calls "atomic espionage." Certain passages of this section are clearly intended to be sensationalistic. In this connection, the Foreign Intelligence Service Press Bureau considers it necessary to declare the following: Nuclear, and later thermonuclear, weapons were developed in the Soviet Union thanks, first of all, to the presence there of a powerful scientific-technical and intellectual potential. A large group of Soviet scientists made the decisive contribution. As for the contribution made by intelligence activity to developing the Soviet atom bomb, its important, highly skilled work played a significant role. Judging by the archive material which the FIS has, one can state that P.A. Sudoplatov's book "Special Tasks" is a jumbled mosaic of authentic facts, half-truths, and obvious fabrications. Special services usually avoid talking about their work and their concrete sources of information. However, in the case at hand, we consider it possible for us to declare that the assertion contained in the book--that Soviet intelligence received information about the atom bomb directly from such famous scientists as E. Fermi, L. Szillard, R. Oppenheimer, and some others--does not correspond with reality.
