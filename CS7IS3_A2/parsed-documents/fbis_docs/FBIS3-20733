At the beginning of next week, the new dinar will be put into circulation, even though there is little chance that the dilemmas surrounding the question of how the economy will function with two domestic currencies will be resolved by then. Since last Wednesday, SLUZBENI LIST has probably been one of the most sought-after commodities, since that is where the federal government's decree on the new dinar was published. However, the decree in question is only the beginning of the dilemmas. The federal government has introduced the new dinar as a means of payment in the territory of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], but the old, existing dinar has also been preserved. The new dinar is divided into 100 paras and can be exchanged for foreign currency, while the National Bank will use its previous mechanism to determine the relationship between the new and old dinar--although we are not allowed to exchange the old dinar for the new one, and thus not for foreign currency either. Everyone who is obligated to keep business records is obligated to indicate their status in new dinars (the recalculation from old into new dinars will take place on the date when the new dinar is put into circulation), and they will be used to indicate all prices of products and services. Finally, both the new and the old dinars will be used in trade payments in the FRY, but in separate accounts with the Trade Payments Service (with the noted obligation to keep business records in new dinars), while all monetary amounts will be in new dinars, except for those instruments of trade payments that are earmarked for old dinars (e.g., checks issued to citizens). Beneficiaries of the Budget The federal government has decided that the average exchange rate of the new dinar will be equal to the value of one German mark and that it will be uniform, except for clearinghouse payments, where it will be 30 percent lower than the exchange rate of the new dinar to the U.S. dollar. Businessmen, at least those consulted by VREME, are confused and worried, precisely because they expect the economic and state authorities to halt the hyperinflation and protect the stability of the domestic currency. The confusion comes primarily from doing business with two dinars--while the worry comes from the inability to perceive the authorities' ultimate intentions. The introduction of yet another dinar to the trade payments system brings with it the practical need to open up a completely new line of account settling--from companies, through commercial banks, to the trade payments service and the central bank. It is inherent to the way that they operate that commercial banks will be the most overburdened, precisely because they are forced to develop new banks within themselves for all ordinary bank transactions, but with the new dinars. While some are utterly desperate because of the congestion that is already present only in the sector of private checking accounts, others are hoping that the onslaught will not come all at once, since the new dinars will not come flooding in either. The fact that the state has allocated around $4 million to back the complete issue of new dinars clearly does not mean that the entire new money supply will be put into circulation immediately. In fact, businessmen do not know how many new dinars will be in circulation next week, nor who will have them, but it can be assumed, judging from statements--albeit imprecise and inadequate ones--made by officials that beneficiaries of the budget will be the first to get new dinars. Thus, all the hirelings of the state apparatus, from the military and police to health care, education, and the other budget beneficiaries. Pensioners will be included with them, but it is unclear what will happen with the mass of nearly two million people who are genuinely unemployed. It is certain that this figure will be reduced, but it is still unknown by how much and at what pace. Naturally, one particular unknown is how much wages will be and how much the subsidies to uncontroversial budget beneficiaries will be. From the Baker On This much appears indisputable: Everyone who does not get the new dinars, individuals or enterprises, but who needs them, has only one legal way to get them. That is by selling convertible currency to the bank. That is the only way to open an account in the new dinars. Anyone who goes to a commercial bank with foreign exchange, to buy dinars or for some other payment, will wait for his bank to do the same thing with the SDK [Public Auditing Service] or the central bank. People and enterprises will be forced to sell off foreign exchange by the fact that old dinars will progressively drop in real value (if the authorities keep their promise that the issue of those dinars has been definitively halted). The amount of dollars and German marks in the reserves of business and the population remains unknown, even as a rough estimate. If it is true that the new dinars will go only to budget beneficiaries, then it will quickly become apparent which companies have foreign exchange reserves at their disposal: After all, in order to pay their employees, they will have to sell the corresponding sum of foreign exchange to their commercial bank, and based on that foreign exchange it will get the equivalent value of new dinars from the central bank. Foreign exchange or gold remains in the state reserves, and there are no more prime-issue loans, as long as feeding the budget with the bought-up foreign exchange reserves of citizens and business is not understood as a continuation of the credit arrangement. The commercial banks will be able to supply credits to their representatives only once both parties fill their accounts with new dinars. For example, bakers will first get new dinars from pensioners and state employees, but anyone who knows anything about the scale of the national economy knows that this and similar flywheels are too small and slow for the functioning of the overall economy. All that remains is the aforementioned way of speeding things up: the sale of foreign exchange reserves, in effect, to the state. Straw Mattresses and Holes One special, and especially big subject is the fate of those who in fact have no foreign exchange reserves. Another question is this: What the state will do with those firms that offer foreign exchange for sale, but are not registered for foreign trading, i.e., had no legal right to foreign exchange accounts? Who acquired dollars legally under sanction conditions? Naturally, this is only a scarcely likely turn of events if the main goal of the authorities is to extract as much foreign exchange as possible from citizens and business. But this is in fact the catch: If the straw mattresses and secret accounts are opened up, the collectors of the foreign exchange will have no reason to inquire into the money's origin; if, despite draconic penalties, business continues to be done primarily in German marks instead of in superdinars, the authorities, such as they are, will have to turn to a less subtle way of collecting foreign exchange reserves. And although their size is unknown, those reserves are running low. On Wednesday the federal government allocated another $300 million: The central bank is authorized to go that far into debt, at the state's expense, with enterprises and individuals, for no longer than one year. Is it only malicious people who will say that this is a new link in the well-known chain of old and semi-old Dafina-type foreign exchange savings? At the same time, the old foreign exchange savings are becoming the state's public debt; there is a semblance of honesty: The state accepts the obligation to pay out every cent, although depositors' claims are frozen for several years, and to then begin payments in the established monthly and annual portions. In the meantime, this debt, through tiny monthly payments, is reduced to a little more than $3 billion. In banking circles, the theory is circulating that approximately 90 percent of all depositors possess only 10 percent of that total, and these are generally old people, in view of when most of these savings came into being. Paying them off quickly and completely appears painless, and this would provide a large number of people with basic living expenses for several years: on the one hand only 10 percent of the total old foreign exchange deposits, while on the other hand a huge number of pensioners who are currently receiving "stamps" or some coupon for financing the pension fund over several decades. But this "little sum" is equivalent to what the federal government is promising to return if the central bank buys up that much foreign exchange, in other words, what it is able to offer, even if it is as a mere promise. Trust in Promises Anyone who does not want a thorn in his healthy foot will reason something like this: It is perfectly all right that no one will be able to convert the old dinar into the new, i.e., into foreign exchange. However, the schoolgirl's happiness is spoiled by the fact that on Wednesday evening before the cameras of "Studio B" the head of the government's project, Dragoslav Avramovic, had no response to the direct question-conclusion by Dr. Tomislav Popovic, the director of the Institute of Economic Sciences, that hyperinflation began in the FRY in the summer of 1992--to be more precise, with the adoption of the stabilization program of the Radoman Bozovic government, with this same Avramovic as the author of the program. This same schoolgirl's happiness is also spoiled by Serbian state television's failed efforts to hide the fact that the entire expert team (two institutes and the School of Economics) renounced authorship of the document signed by three governments and Mr. Avramovic: The director of the Economic Institute did not comply with state television's wish that he deny the conflict between experts and the authorities pushing "certain lists," because he only said that the experts have not given up on what they proposed to the governments, upon which he was cut off in mid-sentence. Will the new dinar too settle in like the Serbian foreign exchange loan at the pinnacle of Milosevic's power four years ago, or will this type of power prove to be a financial ruin in the coming weeks and months? It is not right to the reader to end an article with a dilemma, neither under normal conditions nor under our conditions, but all hope must nevertheless be ceded to those who believe that man can change, only if he decides to do so, beginning tomorrow, or beginning Monday, or perhaps beginning at the first of the month....
