Sellasamy, general secretary of the Ceylon Workers Congress and state minister, has appealed to President D.B. Wijetunge and A.S. Senaviratne, inspector general of the police in Colombo, to take immediate steps to stop these arrests. During the harvest festival of Pongal, Tamil people go to temples, visit their relatives, and participate in festivals. State Minister Sellasamy told VIRAKESARI that he appealed to the president to issue orders halting arrests over those days, and that the president had accepted the appeal and given assurances that he would issue orders to that effect. On Thursday [13 January] alone, 97 people were arrested in seven police station areas. The minister said that he asked Inspector General of Police Seneviratne to release all of these Tamils before the Pongal festival, and that Seneviratne informed him that he would take action to release them.
