The honorific title of "Township and Town Enterprise Entrepreneur in Hunan Province" was also conferred on 100 comrades, including Comrade Tao Guoqing and others. Yesterday's meeting was presided over by Comrade Yang Zhengwu. Vice Provincial Governor Wang Keying made a work report on township and town enterprises. He said: The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have promulgated a series of measures for economic structural reform. Such economic reform will, in the long run, benefit economic development as a whole, and the development of township and town enterprises as well. However, in the course of implementing some specific measures, and especially those connected with financial, tax and monetary reform, township and town enterprises are directly affected. It is obvious that those measures will give sharp shock to some trades and services, and enterprises with poor economic efficiency in particular. This has required that leaders at all levels strengthen their confidence and determination in speeding up reform and development, and truly do well in ensuring a smooth transition in light of practical conditions. Township and town enterprises must deepen their internal reform, further improve their quality, and strengthen their capability in dealing with emergencies and enduring difficulties. On the one hand, they must truly do well in adjusting industrial setups and product mix, and they must strengthen and improve internal management of enterprises to promote their export-oriented economy. On the other hand, the development strategy for township and town enterprises should be changed from the previous main reliance on extensive expansion into tapping intensive potentials to broaden enterprises in scale, promote their technical level, and upgrade their products. Vice Provincial Governor Wang Keying also stressed: Pursuing a shareholding system and a shareholding cooperative system is a nucleus of deepening the present reform of township and town enterprises. Through popularizing the shareholding and shareholding cooperative system, various localities must solve the three main difficult problems facing the development of township and town enterprises: Enterprises' vague equity relationships, severe degeneration of operational mechanisms, and utterly insufficient input of funds. In his speech, Governor Chen Bangzhu pointed out: Governments at all levels and various departments must support township and town enterprises in terms of policies, input, import and export trade, and mass media guidance, whereas township and town enterprises must scale new heights in terms of mechanisms, management, technical progress, and their ability to earn foreign exchange. This will enable them to make new progress in the production of the second quarter.
