FBIS4-8528 "dreeu072_i_94024" FBIS-EEU-94-072 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Bosnian Official Asks Rose To Visit Gorazde Bosnian Official Asks Rose To Visit Gorazde AU1204195794 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian 1700 GMT 12 Apr 94 AU1204195794 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Statement by Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency adviser Kemal Muftic in Sarajevo on 12 April -- recorded] [Text] The statement by General Rose has caused justified dilemmas among our (population). According to his statement, which carries critical undertones, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army shelled the forces of the Serb aggressor near Gorazde. Unfortunately, and as you will see from this statement, we have many reasons to doubt the reliability of the sources of information used by General Rose. General Rose also failed to explain whether our forces merely responded to an attack, that is, fired in self-defense, or in order to defend civilians as they have a duty to. The UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] have obviously still not undertaken adequate measures to prevent the advances of Karadzic's forces in Gorazde, and effectively to protect the lives of innocent people. Some 20 days ago we warned of the grouping of the aggressor's forces [words indistinct]. The safe haven of Gorazde was soon afterward attacked with enormous forces [words indistinct] of Karadzic's Serbs. Every day we reported on the heavy shelling of the town and the aggressor's advances into the safe haven. UNPROFOR consistently denied our reports. Finally when the situation really got out of hand, the UNPROFOR Command decided to launch air strikes of limited intensity against the forces of the attacker. However, the mere selectiveness and limits of the strikes seemed to encourage the enemy. The invasion of Gorazde has continued. Yesterday alone the aggressor's shells killed at least 23 civilians and wounded many others. We are ready for a cease-fire, and not only around Gorazde but on the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, on condition that it is followed by the withdrawal of the Serbian invasion forces from the protected area of Gorazde, and that it does not predispose the final political solution. In no event will we agree to the current situation being frozen, which would perpetuate the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Because of the great differences between the information provided by UNPROFOR officials and our own reports, that is, reports by doctors and others who are in Gorazde at the moment, we believe that it is necessary for General Rose and a team of reporters to go to Gorazde as soon as possible in order to dispel any dilemmas when it comes to obvious things. We are ready to join General Rose on that trip. We also believe that UNPROFOR [word indistinct] and in accordance with the UN resolutions is obliged to provide the delivery of humanitarian aid to the many civilians in Gorazde, as the reserves of medicine and food in the town are depleted.
