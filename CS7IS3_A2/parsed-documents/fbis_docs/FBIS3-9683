In Geneva, UNHCR spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said all convoys to the northern enclave of Banja Luka via Serb-held territory would be suspended until further notice. Radio Sarajevo reported clashes between the Moslem-led Bosnian army and Bosnian Serb forces around the northern town of Maglaj. In Vitez, a UN Protection Force spokesman said Moslem and Croatian forces had pushed back Bosnian Serb forces by several kilometers (miles) to the west of Maglaj, echoing the radio report. Spokesman Rod Tracy, citing Moslem sources in Maglaj, said the Moslem and Croat forces had advanced to Mount Gavranic, 7 kilometers (4 miles) to the west of the town. Tracy added that the British battalion based here had given Moslem forces at Zenica a 24-hour ultimatum to withdraw six anti-aircraft guns deployed in the region in violation of a ceasefire agreement. Echoing these reports, a Belgrade newspaper said Tuesday that eight civilians, including three children, were killed in Moslem shelling of the Bosnian Serb-held town of Doboj, also in northern Bosnia. The daily BORBA cited military officials as saying that the Moslem-led Bosnian army opened fire from positions at Matuzici to the southwest of the town, launching several dozen mortars onto the town. Bosnian Serbs have reported an upsurge in fighting in the region around Doboj, as well as around Brcho, Kupres, over the last few days. Their leader Radovan Karadzic threatened on Sunday [27 March] to launch a counter-attack. In Geneva, Foa said the decision to suspend aid convoys to Banja Luka had been taken after an incident on Saturday at the UNHCR depot in the enclave, in which police seized 12 palettes of aid supplies from two UN trucks. She said only local officials had been at the time of the seizure. The police said the aid was to be distributed in Banja Luka, but they had not been authorized to take the aid, Foa said. Foa added that the suspension of convoys in the region would remain in force until the issue was resolved. "We have suspended convoys through the Banja Luka area until this is settled," she said. The UNHCR warehouse in Banja Luka is used to store supplies not only for the town but also for other Moslem-held enclaves in central Bosnia. Radio Sarajevo also reported fighting Tuesday around the eastern enclave of Gorazde, with Serbs launching intense mortar attacks on the town. One person had been killed and eight injured, the radio said. It added that Serbian reinforcements had arrived in a dozen trucks on the other side of the Drina river. Meanwhile Tracy added in Vitez that the head of British forces, Sir Charles Guthrie, was scheduled to arrive in the region Tuesday for a two-day visit taking in Vitez, Gornji Vakuf and Zepce. Separately here Tuesday, the resumption of a session of the Bosnian parliament was delayed for procedural reasons. Lawmakers are due to discuss the adoption of a constitution of a future Moslem-Croat federation.
