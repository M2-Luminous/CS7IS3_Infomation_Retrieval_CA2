The negotiations also cover a projected 2.6 percent growth target for gross national product (GNP) for the year, the officials said. GNP, the value of goods and services produced by a country, includes income remitted to Japan by Japanese companies and individuals here or Japanese companies overseas. GDP does not. The final targets may be revised upward from the projections under study, since the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) are calling for a GDP growth target ranging from 2.5 to 3.0 percent, the officials said. But the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) has insisted on a growth target of slightly over 2.0 percent, in the belief that full economic recovery will be delayed until the second half of fiscal 1994. The estimate for GNP growth in fiscal 1993 is likely to be cut to 0.2 percent from the initial forecast of 3.3 percent, the officials said.
