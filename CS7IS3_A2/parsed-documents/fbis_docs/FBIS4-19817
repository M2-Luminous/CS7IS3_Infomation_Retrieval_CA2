FBIS4-19817 "drweu078__a94022" FBIS-WEU-94-076-A Daily Report 22 April 1994 ANNEX Germany Inflation To Fall Below 3 Percent in May Inflation To Fall Below 3 Percent in May AU2004101094 Hamburg DPA in German 0906 GMT 20 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2004101094 Hamburg DPA German BFN [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federation of German Industrial Credit Cooperatives (BVR, Bonn) expects a two in front of the decimal point in the inflation rate this May at the latest. Import prices as well as industrial producer prices have remained almost stable for months, and the pressure of prices in services and rents is also declining, the BVR writes in its economic report, published on Wednesday [20 April]. As a result, the prospects for economic development have further improved regarding prices. Since, at the same time, foreign orders have increased strongly in the wake of the international economic recovery, the BVR expects a slightly increasing output for the coming months, even though domestic demand remains rather weak. In general, framework conditions for economic recovery have improved strongly over the past few months. The revival of the international economic development is now also reflected in orders received from abroad, which were about 7 percent higher during the first two months of this year than a year ago. The companies' measures for rationalization and cost reduction are beginning to have an effect. The wage negotiations, which have practically been concluded, will lead to a clear reduction of costs for the companies. The development of collective wages and salaries in the most important fields amounts to 1.5 percent in gross terms and is thus lower than the expected increase in productivity. Improved expectations for income and sales have a positive influence on investments, in particular since tax conditions have improved as a result of the Location Safeguarding Law.
