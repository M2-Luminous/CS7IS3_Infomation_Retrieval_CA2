They illegally introduced recoilless guns into the southern portion of the DMZ in the central sector of the front from June 20 to 22. They also brought by stealth large-caliber machine guns into the MP [military police] posts in the central sector of the front and in the eastern sector of the front. On June 22, they brought 25 vehicles and 500 armed personnel into the southern portion of the DMZ to build military setups. If the South Korean bellicose elements continue aggravating the tensions in the DMZ despite our repeated warnings, they will have to bear full responsibility for all consequences arising therefrom.
