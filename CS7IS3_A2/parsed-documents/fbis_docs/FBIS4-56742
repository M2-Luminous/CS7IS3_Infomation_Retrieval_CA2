The COB, however, did not want to include the government's last wage offer, which the COB considered unsatisfactory, in the signed agreement. The government's pledges not to raise the price of fuel and to guarantee job stability for public employees are among the highlights of the agreement signed early this morning. The government also pledged to build 10,000 "social interest" housing units for low-income families. In exchange, the COB set aside all pressure tactics, which have paralyzed the country for several weeks and placed it on the brink of a state of siege. As for the wage demands, the government offered to raise the national minimum wage from 160 bolivianos a month ($34) to 190 bolivianos ($41). It also offered a 12-percent raise to health workers and teachers, a 9-percent raise for those earning less than 1,000 bolivianos a month ($216), and a 6-percent raise for those earning more than that. The COB turned down those proposals as its wage demand is based on a national minimum wage of 400 bolivianos ($86) a month. The average wage for teachers, for example, is currently 350 bolivianos a month ($75). The government plans to implement the new salary rates even though the COB turned down the wage offer. At the conclusion of negotiations with the government, the COB warned that a new social conflict may flare up in a few days over the education reform bill.
