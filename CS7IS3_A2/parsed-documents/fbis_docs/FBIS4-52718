FBIS4-52718 "dreas093_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-093 Daily Report 13 May 1994 North Korea Democratic Front in South Urges Anti-U.S. Struggle Democratic Front in South Urges Anti-U.S. Struggle SK1305102094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1004 GMT 13 May 94 SK1305102094 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) on May 10 issued an appeal on the occasion of the 14th anniversary of the Kwangju popular uprising, calling upon the South Korean people of various strata to rise in the nationwide struggle for anti-U.S. independence, according to Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation. The Kwangju popular uprising was sparked by the frantic repressive offensive the U.S. imperialists and their stooges "Yusin" remnants launched after proclaiming the "Emergency Martial Law" all over South Korea in May 1980. It was an anti-U.S., anti-fascist resistance and a death-defying massive armed uprising against the fascist suppression. Our people suffered a terrible disaster in Kwangju 14 years ago owing to the United States, the appeal says, and continues: Before the grudge of those days vanishes, the cursed United States is bringing a horrible nuclear holocaust to our people and our nation. The United States is running amuck in putting pressure on the North even through the United Nations in a bid to open the way out for the U.S. war industrial complexes facing marketing difficulties with the end of the cold war and to jumpstart the sluggish U.S. economy by turning the land of our country into a nuclear war theatre and making our nation a sacrifice of a nuclear war. Our nation cannot overlook the present grave situation. Our nation must determinedly rise in a struggle to get the U.S. troops and nuclear weapons fraught with nuclear holocaust withdrawn from South Korea and to smash the U.S. pressure to open rice and weapon markets. Let us all put an end to the colonial rule and intervention of the U.S. imperialists and retake the sovereignty of the nation with the nationwide anti-U.S. struggle. Let us all overthrow Kim Yong-sam, the arch traitor to the nation, who has reduced South Korea to a colony and nuclear forward base of the United States and is scheming to ignite a nuclear war in this land, and realize the sovereignty of the nation.
