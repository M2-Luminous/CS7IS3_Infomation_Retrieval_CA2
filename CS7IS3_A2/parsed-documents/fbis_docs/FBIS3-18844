[Barucci] The Italian Government had no doubts about it. The Italian economy deserves trust. After the storm on the international markets things are better today. However, we should all be worried by rising global interest rates. [Volcic] Would we be worse off without the 1992 devaluation? [Barucci] We certainly would. The 1992 devaluation was a very painful operation. You know, when a country has to devalue it remains a defeated country for some time. But both the Amato and Ciampi governments very rigorously managed the devaluation by exploiting its positive aspects. Let us be frank: the current account balance over one year is 50 trillion [currency not specified] in debt. We heard today the surprising data referring to the balance of payments for January: a surplus of more than 5 trillion lire. The devaluation was a very painful operation, but I think that Italy has much to gain from it. Everybody is envious of these results. [Volcic] After the devaluation, privatization. It looks like a success story. [Barucci] The privatizations are the result of a cultural change in the country. The Milanese judges have helped us to privatize better. It was a very complex and difficult operation. One day I will publish the documents and letters which will prove the great difficulties we had to face in privatizing. [Volcic] After you have done it, anything looks easy. [Barucci] After you have done it, it seems very easy. The international press did not even think we could privatize a needle. [Volcic] What are the next stages? [Barucci] Steel and the last parts of SME [food]. Then the big things: INA [insurance company], STET [telecommunications], and ENEL [electricity]. [Volcic] The stock exchange in Italy seems to be going through a second -- or maybe first -- flush of youth. [Barucci] Let us say that it is its first youth. I remember that when I became treasury minister, 70-80 billion lire were traded at the bourse every day. Today, even if the criteria to calculate the figures have slightly changed, 1 trillion lire are traded daily. Things have definitely changed. [Volcic] Will it last? [Barucci] It must last because the country has everything that is needed to be a mature country, even as far as the stock exchange is concerned. Savers are now interested. For one year the press and commentators have been telling me: You want to privatize but there are no savings. Private companies are launching share issues, you see they are trying to make life difficult for you. What will the fate of state bonds be? Well, private companies have launched big share issues and state bonds are doing just fine. Yields have been cut by half in little more than one year. And, last but not least, we have had a great success with privatizations. We are going in the right direction. [Volcic] What about public accounts. Any bad surprises around the corner? [Barucci] The situation is obviously not good. The country still has a huge public debt. However, Italy is also the only country with a primary surplus over the past two years. [passage omitted]. The data for the first two months are surprisingly good. But we cannot be too optimistic. We thought that in the second half of 1993 we would have had some growth -- 0.5-0.6 percent. The Italian economy actually went backward. [passage omitted] [Volcic] What about unemployment, a world phenomenon? [Barucci] For the time being, in this sphere there have been only defeats. But we are not alone. [passage omitted] [Volcic] Does the confusion before the elections disturb the economy? [Barucci] More than the economy, it disrupts markets. [Volcic] Could you give a one-line definition of the Ciampi government's economic policy? [Barucci] It is a very compact government which has greatly exploited the work done by the previous government, and which has kept a cool head when making decisions. There is a lot of harmony within the Cabinet, and we are able to provide action which has an immediate effect on things. [Volcic] So why are you not a candidate? [Barucci] It is not my job. At my age one cannot change one's way of life. I have another job. [passage omitted] [end recording]
