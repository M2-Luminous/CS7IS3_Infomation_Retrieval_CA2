In the following interview with BILD AM SONNTAG, FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel contradicts Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who announced that the solidarity surcharge would be levied for an indefinite period of time as of 1995. [Schmid] In Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, the Free Democratic Party [FDP] foundered on the 5-percent hurdle. Do you not have to fear that your party will be voted out of the Bundestag? [Kinkel] I am sure that we will do fine in the Bundestag election. I think that we might achieve a double-digit result. [Schmid] Why should the people vote for the FDP? [Kinkel] Those who want to prevent a grand coalition or an alliance between the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and the Greens must vote for the FDP. We support the medium-sized enterprises, particularly in the new laender, we fight against the hostility toward technology, and we are making sure that Germany will not fall into insignificance because, for example, gene and biotechnology research is absolutely neglected. Plus, we support hard work and elitist performers. The upper half of taxpayers provide 90 percent of total tax revenues. [Schmid] The tax burden will increase next year as a result of the solidarity surcharge.... [Kinkel] We must take some burden off the people who are filling the coffers. This is why, in my opinion, we should reexamine after three years whether the solidarity surcharge should still be necessary. [Schmid] What is the FDP's view on a 130 km/h speed limit for highways? [Kinkel] We are against general speed limits. One must not take the pleasure of driving away from people. There is no point in reducing the speed on the few kilometers of highway that do not have a speed limit yet. I also enjoy driving, and sometimes I like to drive fast, too. Besides, I am also in favor of keeping the legal blood alcohol limit of 0.8 per milliliter. [Schmid] There will be a lack of 8 billion German marks [DM] to finance the debts of the federal railroads as of 1996. Will the gasoline tax be increased? [Kinkel] Increasing the gasoline tax would be poison for the economy. I am against it. [Schmid] Why is the FDP making so much fuss about a coalition statement? [Kinkel] We will make this decision at the party congress in Rostock in early June, where we will also outline the future course of the FDP. [Schmid] Friends within your party, such as Juergen Moellemann, have accused you of being too close with the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], and have called for confrontation with Kohl. [Kinkel] In difficult times we have done very good work in the coalition with the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU]. The voters do not appreciate if somebody suddenly begins to hysterically dance on the table before the election. I am for efficient work and against show performances. We will very clearly emphasize the differences between us and the CDU/CSU. We are calling for double citizenship, for example, for an immigration control law, and less rigid guidelines for naturalization. We must quickly reconstruct our social system because otherwise it will strangle us. Still, nobody will be stripped of justified social benefits. We also have to make it clear to the people that the percentage of elderly people in the German population is constantly increasing -- in the year 2000, 25 percent will be 60 and older -- and that fewer and fewer children are being born. This means that we have to think about the treaties between the generations, because a shrinking number of young people has to take care of an increasing number of elderly. [Schmid] Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger has said that criminal Kurds must not be deported. FDP legal expert Burkhard Hirsch and FDP Vice Chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt are in favor of deportation. So what is the FDP's position on this issue? [Kinkel] Several hundreds of thousands of Kurds enjoy the right to be guests in Germany and have to behave accordingly. Those who incur a penalty here must be taken to court and prison. Under our law and under the circumstances, deportation is only possible in absolutely exceptional cases. It has to ensured that he who is deported is not threatened with torture, the death penalty, or any treatment that is inconsistent with the principles of the law-governed state. Within the Federal Government we are examining whether this can be or is guaranteed on the basis of a treaty or agreement. The justice minister said nothing else. [Schmid] The Turkish Government has signed international agreements; nevertheless, people are tortured there. [Kinkel] Yes, unfortunately violations of human rights do exist in Turkey. Now as then there are reports of torture in police prisons. It is particularly because we have had friendly ties with Turkey for decades, because it is our partner in NATO and has an important bridging function, that the protection of human rights has to be called for openly. This is what I have done and what I will continue to do. The last time I did it was the day before yesterday in a long telephone conversation with the Turkish foreign minister, who, by the way, is a Kurd himself.
