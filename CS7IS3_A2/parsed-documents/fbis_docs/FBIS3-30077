The message said the conference which is open in a significant year in which falls the 30th anniversary of the publication of the socialist rural theses is a historical conference which will proudly review the great victory in brilliantly fulfilling the tasks set by the rural theses and display the validity of the theses and the vitality of the socialist agricultural system in our country and a glorious conference which will demonstrate the invincibility of our-style socialism. With the chuche-based socialist rural theses carried into reality under the wise guidance of the party and the leader, a brilliant example has been set in the solution of the rural question and a change of the century has taken place in our countryside, the message noted, and stated: With the ideological revolution carried on vigorously in the countryside, our agricultural working people are being prepared to be dependable chuche-type revolutionaries who always breathe and struggle as intended by the party, regarding loyalty to the party and the leader as their life and soul, and are honestly working for the country and the people, the society and the collective under the slogan "One for all and all for one!" As a result of the successful implementation of the party's policy of the rural technical revolution, irrigation has been completed on a high level and electrification realized with success in the rural communities, and a great progress has been made in the mechanisation of agriculture and extensive use of chemicals, enabling the farmers to do farming easily and efficiently with the help of machines and chemicals. And the chuche farming method has been strictly applied, with the result that agricultural production is rapidly developing on the basis of modern science and technique. And the vigorous rural cultural revolution has helped remarkably enhance the level of general knowledge and technical and cultural standard of the agricultural working people and turn our countryside into a cultured and affluent modern socialist rural areas. With the constant improvement of the guidance and management of the rural economy and enhancement of the guiding role of all-people property over cooperative property, a great success has been made in eliminating the distinctions between towns and the countryside in the form of management and ownership. The WPK Central Committee in the message noted that our agricultural working people in the past 30 years have made great contributions to the building of a new socialist life in the motherland and to the prosperity and development of the country and a greater happiness of the people with their devoted struggle and creative labour, cherishing in their hearts the firm faith in socialism, and highly estimated their feats in labour. Calling upon the entire party members and working people in the agricultural domain to make redoubled efforts to effect a new upswing in rural construction and agricultural production in hearty response to "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Question Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses", the historical letter sent by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song to the conference, the message elaborated on the tasks for this. It said: The ideological revolution must be deepened, first of all, so as to push ahead with the work of arming the party members and other working people with the great chuche idea and the chuche-based idea of rural construction of the party and assimilating the farmers to the working class and revolutionizing them. And the technical revolution must be powerfully pressed ahead on a higher stage, to ensure that the material and technical foundations of agriculture are further consolidated and a constant upsurge is effected in agricultural production. Through a more dynamic cultural revolution, the number of agro-technicians must be largely increased, the technical and cultural level of the agricultural working people who are directly responsible for agricultural production be lifted to a higher stage and a cultural and hygienic practice in and out of work be developed to build up our socialist constryside into ideal villages good to work and live in. The WPK Central Committee in the message expressed the hope that all the agricultural working people, united behind the party and the leader as firm as a rock, will determinedly struggle to firmly defend and further glorify Korean-style socialism under the banner of the chuche idea and thus creditably live up to the deep trust and expectation of the party.
