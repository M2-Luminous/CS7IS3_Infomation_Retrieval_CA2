The international community expected to see peace in Cambodia after the United Nations-organised elections in May last year, Mr Surin said. "When things do not go well, they try to find a reason for it. One easy reason is (to allege that) the Khmer Rouge is receiving assistance from Thailand." The deputy foreign minister was commenting on an article written by former US ambassador to Thailand Morton Abramowitz in THE WASHINGTON POST on May 29. In the article, Mr Abramowitz said the Khmer Rouge had established control over areas in northern and western Cambodia. "The ineffectiveness of the Phnom Penh government and an ill-conceived military campaign are key reasons for Khmer Rouge successes. But a major external factor is Thailand's help for the Khmer Rouge," he wrote. "The Thai military provides them goods and, reportedly, arms and gives their leadership sanctuary," Mr Abramowitz said. But Mr Surin commented that the author may be "holding on to an old image" of the Khmer Rouge as a member of a tripartite coalition which fought against the former Phnom Penh government. There is no need for Thailand to respond to the allegation as the author "has a right to express his opinion," Mr Surin said. It was Thailand's policy "not to support any one faction," the deputy minister stressed. Thailand "wants to see national reconciliation take place in Cambodia as soon as possible". "Some foreign countries now understand Thailand's position," he said. He refused to give names but said they included Western countries. Mr Abramowitz also suggested that the U.S. raise its concerns about Cambodia during pending dialogue in Bangkok with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The deputy minister welcomed the suggestion, saying: "It is better than discussing the issue outside the region." The U.S. is one of ASEAN's seven "dialogue partners" and is due to join an 18-nation forum on security issues taking place on July 25. [passage omitted]
