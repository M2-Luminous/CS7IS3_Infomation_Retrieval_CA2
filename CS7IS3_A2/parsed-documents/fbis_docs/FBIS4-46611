This segment is dedicated to the economic plight of Russia's military industrial complex, and carries interviews with P. V. Romanov, deputy of the Federation Council and general director of Yenisey Chemical Combine Production Association in Krasnoyarsk, and A. A. Piskunov, deputy chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee. The interview starts with Romanov describing the situation in the country as a "threefold economical, political, and social dead end," and calls for an urgent review of the market policy to prevent unpredictable consequences. Video cuts to show footage of an unidentified plant manufacturing engines while announcer compares Russian military production, which shrunk 42 percent in the last three years, to that of the United States and European countries. In answering a question on the military industrial complex's economic situation, Piskunov says that soaring armament prices cause increasing tensions in both military units and the defense industry. Outlining national defense expenses, Piskunov says that pay for military personnel and expenses for energy, transportation, maintenance, and housing construction amount to about 70 percent of the defense budget, while expenses for purchasing arms and for research and development are close to 31 percent. Romanov then criticizes the privatization program as ill planned and too headlong, and says: "Three years ago, our economy was grinding to a halt, to put it mildly. Today the Russian economy is close to collapse. The difference between a collapse and a halt is while we used to have plants, factories and working crews, today all of this is entering a stage of dissolution." He goes on to say that an industrial system built around central state control cannot be converted to a market economy overnight, without a transition period. Commenting on the possibility of strikes in the military industrial sector, Romanov says that the labor unions are "completely passive" and do not protect the interests of workers, who get no pay for several months on end. He says: "Proudly looking the Russian people in the eye from television screens, we say that we have lowered the inflation rate. But we lowered it by withholding pay and lowering the production rate." Video cuts to show more shots of unidentified machine plant production line while announcer says that while several years ago the lives of about 30 million people were connected with the defense industry, today the number has fallen to 14 million. Piskunov then further comments on defense expenses, saying: "We have reduced expenses for arms purchases sevenfold or eightfold in the last two or three years. While we used to buy thousands of units of certain categories of weapons, today we buy single units." He then cautions that the virtual stoppage of production at military plants causes irreversible processes, such as loss of specialists and cutting edge technologies. Piskunov then says: "In complex production spheres, such as plane building, missile building, and ammunition chemistry, we are close to finding ourselves in a situation where we are no longer able to produce armaments." In speaking of workers' pay, Romanov tells of the inability to attract skilled personnel, who leave for better paying enterprises, some of them abroad, thus channeling military technologies there. He concludes his interview by emphasizing the need for a clear economic plan and the determination to carry it out.
