Unfortunately, many of you had to wait in queues for a long time, and some were unable to vote. We salute you for your patience and fortitude. The ANC is in constant contact with the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission], and problems at polling stations are being addressed. We appeal to you not to be discouraged. Where there are still problems, please be patient. No one will be denied the right to vote. Today is a public holiday. I appeal to all of you who have not yet voted to use this opportunity to go to the voting stations and exercise your right to vote. Where workers have come to work today, I appeal to employers to give them whatever time they need to vote. Your vote is sacrosanct. Do not allow anyone to take it away from you. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Mandela, do you think that there's still a large number of people who haven't cast their votes? [Mandela] Undoubtedly, because in many areas where blacks are to be found -- that is, Africans are to be found -- ballot papers were either not delivered [one-second break in transmission] regrettable if that situation is allowed to continue, and a solution must be found to ensure that everybody who wanted to vote and was qualified to vote, exercises his vote. I spent a lot of time yesterday discussing with the Transitional Executive Council, Mr. de Klerk, as well as the Independent Electoral Commission, addressing this problem, because it is clear to me that there has been a massive sabotage. It is striking that in areas occupied by whites, coloreds, and Indians, voting went smoothly. Ballot papers arrived on time, although there are one or two cases like Alberton and so on, where white areas had problems, but these are few and far between. The problem has occurred in African areas. It is a situation which is totally unacceptable. We have to address it. But I can tell you that I am not alarmed. Apart from the fact that it is quite clear that there is this massive sabotage, nevertheless we are addressing it, and I think we are going to resolve it. And South Africans of all racial groups can look forward with hope and joy because we have men and women from all sections of our population who are prepared and ready to address such shortcomings. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Mandela, would you be in favor of an extension till tomorrow, perhaps, as a practical solution to the problem? [Mandela] Absolutely. I think that if we come out today and make a statement that in the light of what has happened today.... [pauses] Because many people may not be aware that today was a public holiday, I think that is a problem, because the situation in areas where Africans live is totally different from the situation in the cities, where people are literate, where they have facilities like television and the radio. That's not the position in the African areas. I think that if we come out today and announce that tomorrow will be a public holiday people, will turn out in large numbers, and we will have addressed the question.
