"We have begun a process of withdrawal of a certain number of battalions we have there, first the one in Glina in Krajina (Serb-controlled territory in Croatia) and then the one in Bihac in northwest Bosnia," Leotard said in a radio interview. "Before the end of the year, there will be about 2,500 fewer French soldiers on the territory of the former Yugoslavia," he said. The move came after Foreign Minister Alain Juppe threatened to pull out all French troops, who make up the largest contingent of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia, if progress towards a peace settlement was not made. The French UN troops are deployed in both Croatia and Bosnia. There are also French naval forces patrolling the Adriatic Sea and French aircraft based in Italy.
