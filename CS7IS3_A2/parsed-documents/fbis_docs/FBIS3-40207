Aggregate gross investment for the 115 foreign-funded enterprises in the zone has reached US$600 million, while foreign capital attracted is at $360 million, of which there are 15 projects (about 14 percent of the 115) funded with at least $10 million each. Within the Caohejing Zone, Shanghai Beiling Microelectronics Mfrg. Ltd., Shanghai Microelectronics Engineering Research Center, and Shanghai Philips Semiconductor Corp. have formed a technologically advanced microelectronics industry mini-zone integrating research, development, intermediate testing, production, and sales. This mini-zone has an industrial-grade, communications-grade, and consumer-grade large-scale integrated circuit (LSI) production capacity outfitted with 0.65-micron IC design technology, technology for producing 4-5-inch silicon wafers, and technology for fabricating l.2-3-micron ICs. A Shanghai fiber optic communications industrial base has taken shape around the Shanghai Fiber Optic Communications Engineering Co., Shanghai AT&T Communications Equipment Ltd., and the Sino-U.S. joint venture AT&T Fiber Optic Communications Ltd. Some 30 firms, including Shanghai Foxboro Co. and Shanghai Qiming [0796 2494] Software Ltd., have formed a computer software industrial group engaged in R&D of products for industrial and office automation, information and enterprise management, finance, insurance, and commerce. The wholly U.S.-owned 3M China Ltd., the Sino-U.S. joint venture Shanghai Ruikan [3843 0170] (Electric) Cable Accessories Ltd., and the British firm ICI Co. have formed an international-state-of-the-art production base for industrial new materials. Finally, Caohejing has the nation's first bioengineering R&D/intermediate-testing base--the Chinese Academy of Sciences' (CAS) Shanghai Bioengineering Research Center and other Sino-foreign joint ventures have formed an embryonic bioengineering industrial development zone. As of the end of 1993, the Caohejing Zone's industrial gross output value exceeded 4.2 billion yuan, business sales income exceeded 5.5 billion yuan, industrial profits approached 700 million yuan, annual per capita sales income for foreign-funded enterprises within the development zone reached 330,000 yuan, and annual per capita profit was 70,000 yuan.
