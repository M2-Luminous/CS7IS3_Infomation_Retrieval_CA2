FR941006-1-00013 FR941006-1-00006 In 1988, the Commission addressed the issue of customer limit order protection in the NASDAQ market. 3 In the Manning decision, the Commission affirmed, based on principles of agency law, an NASD determination that it is inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade for a market maker to trade ahead of a customer limit order unless the customer is first informed of the firm's limit order policy. As a result of the Manning decision, the NASD filed a proposed rule change with the Commission stating that a member firm will not be deemed to have violated NASD Rules of Fair Practice if it provides customers with a statement setting forth the circumstances in which the member firm accepts limit orders and the policies and procedures that the firm follows in handling these orders. 4 3 See In re E.F. Hutton & Co. (the so-called ``Manning decision''), Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25887 (July 6, 1988), 41 SEC Doc. 473, appeal filed, Hutton & Co. Inc. v. SEC, Dec. No. 88&hyph;1649 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 2, 1988), (Stipulation of Dismissal Filed, Jan. 11, 1989). 4 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26824 (May 15, 1989), 54 FR 22046 (May 22, 1989). The proposal included model disclosure language to be used by firms whose policy is not to grant priority to customer limit orders over the member's own proprietary trading. In July, 1993, the NASD Board of Governors reviewed the handling of limit orders in NASDAQ securities and concluded that ``the continuation of the disclosure exception appeared inappropriate.'' 5 The NASD solicited member comment on eliminating the disclosure ``safe-harbor'' approach for members trading ahead of customer limit orders and the effect a rule prohibiting trading ahead might have on integrated broker-dealers, on limit orders received from other firms, and on market liquidity. 6 5 See File No. SR-NASD&hyph;93&hyph;58, p.6. 6 See NASD Notice to Members 93&hyph;49 (July 23, 1993). After full consideration of the concerns articulated in the comment process, the NASD withdrew its rule filing proposing the disclosure safe harbor approach, 7 and submitted a proposed Interpretation to its Rules of Fair Practice, prohibiting member firms from trading ahead of their customers' limit orders in their market making capacity. 8 The Division of Market Regulation's Market 2000 study examined this practice and recommended that a ban apply to trading ahead of all customer limit orders, not just those of a firm's own customer. 9 The study noted that the adverse effects of trading ahead exist whether the customer's order is handled by the customer's firm or by another market maker. 10 7 See Letter from Robert E. Aber, Vice President and General Counsel, NASD, to Selwyn Notelovitz, Branch Chief, Over-the-Counter Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, SEC (October 13, 1993). 8 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33697 (March 1, 1994), 59 FR 10842 (March 8, 1994). 9 Division of Market Regulation, SEC, Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments (``Market 2000 Study''), V&hyph;5 (1994). 10 Id. The Commission approved the NASD Interpretation on June 29, 1994, but expressed concern that the prohibition did not extend to trading ahead of limit orders of other firms' customers that have been sent to the market maker for execution. 11 The NASD also convened a special task force to study the potential effect of expanded limit order protection on market liquidity and market maker capital commitment and to report back to the Board in September. The Commission stated that while such a study could be helpful to a future consideration of this issue, the Commission believed that member-to-member trades raise significant concerns that should be addressed and, if necessary, the Commission would consider instituting its own rulemaking proceeding for that purpose. 12 11 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34279 (June 29, 1994), 59 FR 34883 (July 7, 1994). 12 Id. .
