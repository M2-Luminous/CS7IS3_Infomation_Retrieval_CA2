He was referring to the demands included in the 18 points submitted by the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. He added: "They are imposing things on us; we accept, for the sake of unity." This came in an exclusive interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT at Shaykh al-Ahmar's home in Sanaa in which he said: "Our view is that everything possible has been done but there should be agreement on the constitutional amendments." He also said that the "points are acceptable (in principle), go in stages, and could be carried out by the government." He added: "Out of our concern for unity we accept everything they impose, which is a bitter pill to swallow." Political sources in Aden have confirmed that Yemeni Planning and Development Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani has resigned in protest against an order issued by Prime Minister Eng. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas calling for discontinuation of the Yemeni population and establishments census. Sources close to al-Iryani said that he considered that decision to favor partition and division. Out of his concern for Yemeni unity, Shaykh al-Ahmar is making efforts as speaker of the House of Representatives which is the only unity institution still functioning regularly. He stressed that he is by no means acting as YRG leader. He said: "Responsibility has made it incumbent upon us to be passive and not to say what we believe should be said." In reply to a question about views expressed by political observers to the effect that the YSP is exerting pressure "for a stable state system but is working for a continuation of the state of unrest and anticipation for as long as possible to get as many concessions as possible," Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar said: "Why should we preoccupy ourselves with analysis and speculation? The situation is clear. That is the position of the (YSP) Political Bureau and Central Committee." Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar emphasized that the decision about the state system and whether it should be a parliamentary or presidential system "should be a part of the constitutional amendments." He added: "We have our own views regarding the local councils system which is in harmony with the current Constitution, and regarding financial and administrative decentralization." On the divisive military movements within the state of unity, the speaker said: "There have been movements which nobody can deny such as the transfer of some units from the eastern areas to Shabwah, but there has been no confirmation of other things and we hve not heard about them." He reaffirmed the importance of preserving unity. He said: "Despite everything, we are prepared to come to some understanding with them (the YSP) for the sake of unity, which was a precious achievement, dear to us. We are prepared to offer many times the sacrifices we have already made for its sake." Shaykh al-Ahmar denied that the YRG had "any part in causing the crisis." He stressed that "there are no differences within the presidency of the House of Representatives. There can be no doubt about that. We all work together" because "the House of Representatives is the only unity body still functioning, albeit with little output." He said that "the Socialist deputies attend and we have had no disagreement with them on any measures, because we have not reached the point of decision on the measures which should be taken and to which the House of Representatives is entitled." He said that "the House of Representatives, like other state institutions, has been affected by the crisis but we are still holding together and there has been no dispute within the House." [passage omitted] It should be noted that the prime minister and the ministers of defense, oil, transport, and housing, and the deputy prime minister for manpower are all in Aden and do not discharge their ministerial duties or take part in the cabinet meetings in Sanaa. The cabinet holds regular meetings under the chairmanship of Dr. Hasan Makki, member of the General Committee (Political Bureau) of the General People's Congress [GPC] and first deputy prime minister. In reply to a question about the absence of these ministers and whether there is justification for withdrawing confidence from the cabinet and forming a new cabinet, a YSP source said that the reason they have stayed away from Sanaa was the discovery of a plan for their assassination. He added that senior state officials knew that. [passage omitted]
