Responding to this call, I spent a long time rereading this accumulation of stories in order to get a hold on something about which I could argue. The "superarticle" was indeed a slow read, you had to concentrate in order to grasp the real reasons why the article was written -- reasons abundantly flooded with dirty "water." And the reasons were quite understandable: Mr. Kozlovskiy, who praises Zhirinovskiy both moderately and immoderately, has become popular in the United States, where Mr. Navrozov obviously considers himself to be the sole expresser of Russian thinking. Which is why he was "smashed to smithereens" by the famous author who has "published over 200 articles in 14 Russian publications." The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI editorial office asked V. Zhirinovskiy "to put his counterarguments and arguments" in the newspaper but if the party's leader were to "counterargue" and "argue" in the pages of all newspapers in which the authors of such "studies" pour dirt on him, he would need at least 30 hours of strenuous work a day. That would be a good gift for our political rivals. Mr. Navrozov undoubtedly considers himself a specialist in everything which concerns the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] and its leader, but it is very strange that in his accusations he relies on "a publication with the charming name `Off With Their Heads' [`k toporu']." That publication has never been an LDPR organ and was published by former LDPR member S. Zharikov, who left the party because of his extreme right-wing convictions. That publication has never had anything to do with the LDPR. If Mr. Navrozov had really been seeking the truth he would have found it in his own home in the United States in the "Viktor Kamkin" bookstore, well known to all emigres. The store regularly sells the newspaper PRAVDA ZHIRINOVSKOGO, the official organ of the LDPR. If the "specialist on our issue" wants to dig through our old publications we will be pleased to offer him a full selection of our newspaper's issues, which do not contain a line calling for war or racial or national hatred. Only the truth. It is strange that Mr. Navrozov has decided to publish his article in Russia. If it had been published in the United States and had frightened the Americans the aim sought by the author would have been achieved 100 percent. Another wave of hatred and fear would have been stirred up. But what is the aim of the author in publishing in Russia an article which contains not a trace of anguish for the hungry and humiliated citizens of that country, in which each line contains concern only for citizens of Jewish nationality? That article will produce nothing but another wave of ordinary anti-Semitism and if that was the author's main purpose he can consider it achieved. The LDPR's program and its leader's statements do not contain a hint of discrimination against citizens for ethnic reasons, on the contrary the program declares "the right to preserve traditions and customs, to develop one's own ethnic culture and freedom of religion." That is what Zhirinovskiy is blamed for. It turns out that Hitler too failed to warn the Jews he would destroy them. Forgive me, but what then of the presumption of innocence? Mr. Navrozov condemns Zhirinovskiy for intentions he has not voiced, guided solely by his own convictions formed from reading some dubious publications which have nothing in common with the LDPR. Proceeding from that principle one can accuse any party and any leader of criminal intentions, seeking dubious analogies in our history. What the author calls "the threat to the West" is called in the language of international relations a policy from a position of strength and was used by the United States in Grenada, Panama, and Cuba, and today under the UN flag the United States is pursuing this same policy the author finds unacceptable in Somalia and Yugoslavia. Zhirinovskiy merely expressed an intention, but the United States is already pursuing that policy, yet the author is more frightened by Zhirinovskiy's intentions than by the U.S. Government's specific actions. Zhirinovskiy does not intend to "destroy the West" or to fight it. It will be enough for our party if the West interferes less in our strictly domestic affairs, especially since "specialists" like Mr. Navrozov are turning to us more frequently with their advice, thanks to which we are in our present situation. All accusations of chauvinism, nazism, and the desire for world dominance are unfounded. It is simply foolish to accuse Zhirinovskiy of seeking world dominance. In each of his speeches and publications the LDPR leader accuses the United States of this desire and expresses himself in favor of regional cooperation between countries in order to rule out global military conflicts and criticizes the former USSR leadership for attempting to extend its influence to the whole world, which was one reason for the state's collapse. The author's opinions on the "superfluidity" of Zhirinovskiy's thinking are surprising. It is very rash of him to accuse the LDPR leader of being disloyal to his ideas or statements. In Russia today Zhirinovskiy is one of the few party leaders, if not the only party leader, not to have changed his position by a single degree in four years. His tactics of struggle change, conditions change, the state is collapsing, former comrades in arms are shooting each other, political leaders are changing color more often than trees in the course of a year, but the LDPR is prepared to put its name to every document which has emerged from the party's nether regions in this time. What place is there here for the lack of principle of which the author tries to accuse Zhirinovskiy? The "appeal to the officers and employees of the special services and special subunits of the counterintelligence organs and Internal Affairs Ministry." Mr. Navrozov explains it as a call to compile lists of people to be destroyed, although the document made no mention of any "destruction" but merely contained an appeal to uncover the criminals who are robbing our people and to do their immediate job of eradicating crime, and retribution in accordance with the law will come for today's mafiosi only after the LDPR has come to power, because of the present leadership's inability to fight this evil. Any patriot will support this appeal and it can only frighten Mr. Navrozov's friends, the "new emigres" who are flocking into defenseless Russia in order, under the guise of "U.S. businessmen," to catch a free fish in Russia's murky waters. The freeloading will soon end for them and they will have to answer to the U.S. tax administration. The notorious article devoted a lot of room to the problem of selling arms abroad. Nothing about hunger in Russia, nothing about the Russian children who are not being born today, nothing about our destroyed economy, but a lot of space devoted to the problem of arms sales. It is true that our weapons are better than the Americans'. For the time being. And we will sell them, and if we do not then the Americans will and it will be the worse for us, but Navrozov will feel better. And there is no point in arguing about whether there will be money from arms sales. If we do not sell arms there will be no money and the military industry will wither away. Not bad thing for those who are paying Mr. Navrozov money for his articles. And the transatlantic journalist completely disconcerted me with his conclusion: The Russian press, he says, writes good things about Zhirinovskiy and does not write bad things because it is mortally afraid of that gentleman. That's the limit. If Zhirinovskiy were to set himself the task of simply reading all the dirty articles about him published in the Russian press he would have not time even to wash, let alone to work. Yes, some people do write the truth, but they are few even in the provinces where a conscience has not yet become a source of laughter. Moscow journalists cannot allow themselves that luxury. As for our "red-brown" press, as the authors puts it, we are indeed make efforts not through fear but for the sake of our conscience, the only thing is that under the present regime this is difficult in the face of the "yellow" press. Mr. Navrozov from the height of his moral position complained that the word "dictatorship" which sounds like the word "slavery" to Americans is an ordinary word to Russian ears, but he has forgotten to add that U.S. democracy found its feet by relying for a whole century on the forced labor of slaves. The fine articles of their constitution did not prevent the democratic Americans from using people with a different color skin as work animals. The American path of development is unacceptable to Russia, we do not intend to rob other peoples by exporting cheap raw material from underdeveloped countries in exchange for chewing gum, and the Americans would not allow us to do so, realizing that two such parasitical states will not survive on one earth. The best option for the United States is a weak Russia mining its own mineral resources for U.S. needs and for that to happen the United States needs to "keep" its own man in the Kremlin, but if Zhirinovskiy gets there.... Mr. Navrozov's article is correct. For the Americans. It was for them that he wrote it. In approaching one more subject which, in my opinion, seems the main one in the article I am criticizing, you cannot help feeling awkward. In Russia you can openly call the Russians cattle and Russia a land of fools (or the motherland of goats, as MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS did) if you are a citizen of another nationality but god forbid that a Russian say anything prejudiced about a person of another nationality. You will immediately be known as a fascist. And dragged through the courts. So Russians are tying themselves into knots in their own country, thinking up terms like "persons of a criminal (or commercial) nationality." Our party is in favor of full equality for people irrespective of sexual, racial, ethnic, or religious differences, but for that we must first of all give Russians equal rights wit regard to other ethnic groups. We must abandon the double standards for treating ethnic groups, we must allow Russians to rid themselves of their occupiers' complex. After all, we were not the ones who killed Indian children to acquire their ancestors'land, we were not the ones who used Africans as working animals. We worked on the outskirts of the empire in the same way and perhaps even better than others and we deserve equal rights with other peoples living on the same land as us. The aim of Navrozov's article is not only to discredit Zhirinovskiy. The topic of Zhirinovskiy is only the tip of the iceberg. The author persistently puffs up the Jewish topic, dividing the world into Jews and non-Jews. Presenting the fascist challenge banner to the Russian people, he is convinced this banner will never fly over a zionist movement thanks to the enormous harm done to the Jewish nation by German national-socialism. Yet far more Russians were killed in that war! A double standard again? We should all know the description of national-socialism adopted in Germany today: "National-socialism is the determination of a person's nationality on the basis of his blood." In that connection what do the Jews' attempts to "accuse" Zhirinovskiy of being a Jew look like? And in general what is the purpose of this whole campaign? To prove that such a talented man could only appear in a Jewish environment or, by using ordinary anti-Semitism, to turn Russian voters away from a leader they do not like? Both purposes are undoubtedly vile and in addition are a very clear example of double-dyed national-socialism of the German type. The charge leveled against Mr. Kozlovskiy that "in a good 20 years in the West he never once spoke of his national origin" is also loathsome. From that it follows that a Jew who does not advertize his nationality is violating some special Jewish laws while a Russian who asserts that he is Russian is transgressing some other Jewish laws. The double standard once again, and it stinks. Somehow it is unseemly even to mention the literary worth of this article. Reading Navrozov is harder than listening to Gorbachev. I feel very sorry for our emigres who encounter this kind of thing in "Russian" newspapers. I want to advise Mr. Navrozov not to take the trouble to paraphrase Russian sayings. The saying "the elder tree is in the yard and uncle is in Kiev" of itself signifies the meaningless nature of what has been said and does not require the interference of "specialists," and nor indeed does anything concerning our domestic life.
