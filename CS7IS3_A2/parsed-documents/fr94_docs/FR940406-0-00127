FR940406-0-00127 FR940406-0-00011 (iii) The official evaporative emission test results for each evaporative/refueling emission-data vehicle at the selected test point shall be adjusted by the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of this paragraph. (iv) The emission value to compare with the standards shall be the adjusted emission value of paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section rounded to two significant figures in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in §86.094&hyph;28(a)(4)(i)(B)( 2 )( ii ))for each evaporative emission-data vehicle. (8)(i) Paragraph (b)(8) of this section describes the procedure for determining compliance of a new vehicle with refueling emission standards. The procedure described here shall be used for all applicable vehicles in the applicable model years. (ii) The manufacturer shall determine, based on testing described in §86.098&hyph;21(b)(4)(i)(B), and supply a refueling emission deterioration factor for each evaporative/refueling emission family-emission control system combination. The factor shall be calculated by subtracting the emission level at the selected test point from the emission level at the useful life point. (iii) The official refueling emission test results for each evaporative/refueling emission-data vehicle at the selected test point shall be adjusted by the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of this paragraph. (iv) The emission value to compare with the standards shall be the adjusted emission value of paragraph (b)(8)(iii) of this section rounded to two significant figures in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in §86.094&hyph;28(a)(4)(i)(B)( 2 )( ii )) for each evaporative emission-data vehicle. (9) Every test vehicle of an engine family must comply with all applicable standards (and family emission limits, as appropriate), as determined in paragraphs (b)(4)(iv), (b)(7)(iv) and (b)(8)(iv) of this section, before any vehicle in that family will be certified. (c) through (d) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;28. (e) [Reserved] (f) Fuel dispensing spitback testing waiver. (1) Vehicles certified to the refueling emission standards set forth in §§86.098&hyph;8, 86.099&hyph;8 and 86.001&hyph;9 are not required to demonstrate compliance with the fuel dispensing spitback standards contained in these sections: Provided, that_ (i) The manufacturer certifies that the vehicle inherently meets the Dispensing Spitback Standard as part of compliance with the refueling emission standard. (ii) This certification is provided in writing and applies to the full useful life of the vehicle. (2) EPA retains the authority to require testing to enforce compliance and to prevent non-compliance with the Fuel Dispensing Spitback Standard. (g) Inherently low refueling emission testing waiver. (1) Vehicles using fuels/fuel systems inherently low in refueling emissions are not required to conduct testing to demonstrate compliance with the refueling emission standards set forth in §§86.098&hyph;8, 86.099&hyph;8 or 86.001&hyph;9: Provided, that_ (i) This provision is only available for petroleum diesel fuel. It is only available if the Reid Vapor Pressure of in-use diesel fuel is equal to or less than 1 psi (7 Kpa) and for diesel vehicles whose fuel tank temperatures do not exceed 130 ○F (54 ○C); and (ii) To certify using this provision the manufacturer must attest to the following evaluation: ``Due to the low vapor pressure of diesel fuel and the vehicle tank temperatures, hydrocarbon vapor concentrations are low and the vehicle meets the 0.20 grams/gallon refueling emission standard without a control system.'' (2) The certification required in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section must be provided in writing and must apply for the full useful life of the vehicle. (3) EPA reserves the authority to require testing to enforce compliance and to prevent noncompliance with the refueling emission standard. (4) Vehicles certified to the refueling emission standard under this provision shall not be counted in the sales percentage compliance determinations for the 2001, 2002 and subsequent model years.
