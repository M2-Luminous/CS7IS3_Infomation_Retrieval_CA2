Minister Valentin Mikhaylov sharply reacted to the petition and in a 28 February letter to the initiators he stressed that the legion's activists have crossed the limits of democracy, and that agitators will not be tolerated in the Army. On the same day the president discussed the situation in the Army with his military advisers. On 1 and 2 March the leadership of the Ministry of Defense had a working meeting with commanders and officers from the 1st, 2d, and 3d Armies, the Press Center of the Ministry of Defense announced on 2 March. Later, at a "special meeting," the ministry's leadership and the General Staff discussed the issues posed at the meeting related to the structural reform in the Army, the officers' wages and housing conditions, and the everyday life of the soldiers. The same issues have been repeatedly posed in the past by the Rakovski Legion which, in recent weeks, energetically insisted on adopting the 37-billion-leva military budget requested by the General Staff. The parliament voted only 12 billion leva for defense needs. Despite the limited budget possibilities, the defense minister ordered that proposals be prepared on resolving the most acute problems. The Press Center of the Ministry of Defense noted that "violations of the military regulations and discipline on the part of certain officers," were discussed at the meeting. However, the written announcement does not indicate whether the petition's initiators will be punished.
