B. Safonov; UDC 538.566:533.93] [Abstract] The reflection of electromagnetic waves from an inhomogeneous semiconductor transfer layer with a perfectly conducting screen is examined. Using an analytical solution of the wave equation, an expression is obtained for the reflectivity of the electromagnetic waves, depending on the thickness of the layer, the width of the transition region, the concentration of electrons, the degree of absorption and the length of the irradiating wave.
