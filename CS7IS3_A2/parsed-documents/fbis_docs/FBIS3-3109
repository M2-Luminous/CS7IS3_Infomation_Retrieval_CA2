Zou said that China's economy had developed fast since the country adopted its opening-up and reform policies in 1978, adding that entrepreneurs from Canada are welcome to invest here. China follows two principles in its economic cooperation with foreign countries, the vice premier said. One is equality and mutual benefit. If the cooperation benefits only one side, it is doomed to fail. The other is that it is in the long-term interests of both sides. Zou noted that the cooperation should take this into consideration. He pointed out that China has rich resources and a huge market, adding that the future of the economic cooperation with China is promising. Bougie briefed Zou on ALCAN's plan of conducting further economic cooperation with China, saying that he believed the aluminum industry in China would enjoy a bright future.
