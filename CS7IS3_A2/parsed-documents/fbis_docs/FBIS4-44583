Dr. Xue Yusheng [5641 4416 0524], chief engineer in the Ministry of Electric Power Industry's Nanjing Automation Institute, has created a completely new electric power system computation method, the Expanded Equal-Area Criterion (EEAC). After a year of on-line application in China, it has successfully achieved power grid transient state safety monitoring and control. This achievement is an indication that an acute technical problem that has troubled the world's electric power industry for a long time has been solved. EEAC, called "Xue's Method" by international academic circles, was invented while Xue Yusheng was studying for his doctorate at Liege University in Belgium in 1986. At the time, it was internationally recognized that all representative electric power system transient state direct safety analysis methods were established on their own empirical assumptions and that they were very ill-adapted to the quick and accurate analytical computations required by extremely complex large power grids. Thus, for many years electric power S&T circles in all countries have continuously striven to explore new routes. The EEAC direct method, the unique creation of a Chinese person, effectively simplifies the extremely complex stability problems of large electric power systems into an equal-value dual-machine system stability problem, and is the only rapid computation method in the world at present using a purely analytical mode to resolve electric power system stability. It has a high degree of precision and its actual applied speed is two numerical grades faster than the numerical integration methods of the past. In 1991, the French Electric Power Company (EDF), the largest in the world, applied EEAC in its power grid system and operating program. Because of its obviously superior computation precision and speed, many countries are now tracking this achievement. Because EEAC was still in the static stage at the end of 1991, Dr. Xue Yusheng and a scientific research group led by him, further developed a dynamic state EEAC and developed a critical identification method. This raised the precision of EEAC up to a new stage and freed operating personnel from their a priori knowledge and took a major step toward its use in engineering. In China, the Nanjing Automation Institute has placed EEAC into formal on-line operation in the East China Grid's real-time energy management system. The results over the past year confirm that EEAC provides great assistance in avoiding power grid destabilization accidents. At the EEAC examination and acceptance meeting held on 2 April 1994, Ministry of Electric Power Industry minister Shi Dazhen [0670 1129 2923] called on power grids in all areas of China to extend and apply this internationally advanced stability computation method to raise safe and stable operation of China's power grids to a new level.
