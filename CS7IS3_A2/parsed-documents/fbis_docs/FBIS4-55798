The only real solution to the deepening political and economic crisis in the country is to hold early parliamentary elections. 2. It is impossible in the present parliament to formulate positive goals for carrying through the reform. The SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] unequivocally declares that any attempt to extend the life of the government or to form a new government within the term of this parliament will lead to irreparable and disastrous consequences for the country. 3. The SDS links its participation in the work of the present parliament with the fate of the government. If the government is retained or altered or a new one formed, the SDS National Coordinating Council and parliamentary group are to take immediate actions to provoke early parliamentary elections -- rallies, marches, demonstrations, a boycott of parliament, and civil disobedience within the law. 4. When candidates are proposed for seats in the National Assembly, it is essential to observe the principles of party political responsibility, eligibility for election, and the effectiveness of the candidates. On the basis of the resolutions of the SDS's Fifth National Conference and the proposals made by the Sixth National Conference, the National Coordinating Council is to draft, in collaboration with the local coordinating councils and full SDS members, mechanisms to ensure that the above principles are observed in the best possible way and to prevent any new substitution of the electoral vote. The following persons may not be proposed in the lists of SDS parliamentary candidates, be members of the National Coordinating Council and municipal councils, or be proposed by the SDS as mayors and oblast administrators: sons and daughters of active fighters against fascism and capitalism, of members of the Politburo or Central Committee of the BCP [Bulgarian Communist Party], of communist generals and colonels, and of secretaries of BSP okrug and city committees, or persons who have applied for membership in the BCP. 5. The following new Paragraph No. 2 is added to Article 1 of the SDS Statute: The leading political organs of the SDS are the national conference and the National Coordinating Council, whose decisions are binding on all SDS structures and institutions. Sentences two and three in Article 36 of the SDS Statute are deleted. (Editor's note: "He has the right to postpone the adoption of decisions by the National Coordinating Council that have to be implemented by the SDS parliamentary group until they are discussed by the parliamentary group, until the next meeting of the National Coordinating Council. In the event of any differences in views, the decision is adopted following joint discussion of the issue between the National Coordinating Council and the SDS parliamentary group.") 6. The aim of the SDS to increase to the maximum its influence in Bulgarian society and politics remains the leading trend in its development. The chief criterion governing the attitude of the SDS to other democratic formations is the idea of real decommunization of society.
