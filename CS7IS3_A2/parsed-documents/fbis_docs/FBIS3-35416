FBIS3-35416 "drnes037_o_94001" FBIS-NES-94-037 Document Type:Daily Report 24 Feb 1994 SYRIA Press: Israeli Stands Threaten Peace Opportunity JN2002084394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0545 GMT 20 Feb 94 JN2002084394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [From the press review] [Text] Press editorials have focused on the bilateral peace talks between the heads of Arab and Israeli delegations, noting that these talks have so far not resulted in any moves that would help the peace process achieve its objectives in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy. In an editorial under the headline the "Vicious Circle," TISHRIN says: The third week of bilateral peace talks has ended in nothing. The suspension of the talks, as requested by the Israeli side to hold consultations with its government, has resulted in nothing new to advance the peace process. Thus, the Washington talks were stalemated again, just like all rounds of talks that have been held since the Madrid conference. TISHRIN stresses that Israel is still unwilling to establish and make peace or to respond to the requirements of a just and comprehensive peace. It is also trying to conceal its evasive policies, intransigence, and rejection of the terms of peace in an attempt to prolong the talks and undermine their objectives and tracks. Israel considers the talks an end, rather than a means to achieve a just, comprehensive peace. The paper says that in all that, Israel is pursuing the policy of Yitzhaq Shamir, who declared that the negotiations will continue for 10 years. This is in order to change the situation on the ground so that the Arabs would have nothing to demand when Israel controls all the occupied Arab territories through the settlement building. In the context of the same Israeli maneuvers, Yitzhaq Rabin made statements which do not differ in form or content from the Shamir policy. In his statements, he accused Syria of not being serious about the peace process. TISHRIN stresses that by his statements, Rabin wants to conceal Israel's objectives and intentions which have not led to any positive move for the sake of peace. The paper adds: Because its malicious objectives and intentions have been exposed, Israel has failed to undermine the Madrid formula. Therefore, it began to cast doubts about the U.S. role and its effectiveness and to aim its poisoned arrows against the Geneva summit. This is because the meeting of Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton has proved beyond any doubt that there will be no peace in the region without Syria's leading role in the peace process and without the enforcement of the resolutions of international legitimacy. Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN stresses that only a decision to give up Israel's usurpation and occupation of the Arab territories without any conditions as demanded by the resolutions of international legitimacy is the key and basis for the achievement of a just, comprehensive peace. In an editorial under the headline "The Deception," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: It is not enough for Shim'on Peres to hint at the possibility of evacuating a settlement or two and then to claim that Israel is working for peace and that it wants to provide the appropriate atmosphere for continuing the negotiating process. Nor can he convince anybody that the Rabin government has abandoned expansion and settlement schemes and that it is now ready to accept the UN Security Council resolutions which consider the settlements illegitimate, a violation of international law and conventions, and demand their immediate removal. Casting doubts about the Israeli position, the paper says: Had Israel been truly seeking to prove its peace intentions and to push the peace process in the right direction, it would have reconsidered its entire settlement plans, rather than to evacuate some settlements. The paper stresses that Israel should explicitly and clearly declare full commitment to the principles, resolutions, and trend of the international legitimacy. It should also accept the principle of full withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories. It should also halt the policy of military escalation in southern Lebanon and its arbitrary and terrorist measures inside the occupied territories. The paper adds: Only such moves will convince the Arabs and international community of Israel's seriousness about working for a just, comprehensive solution in the Middle East. The paper cautions that the available peace opportunity is now being threatened by the intransigent Israeli stands. Unless there is a fundamental change in these stands and unless Israel stops methods of maneuvers and deception, the opportunity will be lost, together with many hopes for arriving at the aspired solution. Concluding, the paper says: The Arabs have offered all they can to maintain this opportunity, and it remains for Israel to show enough courage to show interest in not wasting it. This can only be achieved when it clearly and explicitly announces its acceptance of the conditions of peace, primarily withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories.
