He pointed out that, in the absence of a law on ministerial responsibility, one cannot talk of legal proceedings unless proof can be supplied that a legally envisaged crime has been committed. Chebeleu said that the delay in submitting a law on the budget, due to objective conditions, cannot be considered a crime; therefore, one can only talk of political responsibility, at best. However, it is up to the Parliament to examine these aspects. The presidential spokesman also denied rumors according to which the relations between President Ion Iliescu and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Adrian Nastase have become cooler. He said that the current slander campaign against Nastase is politically motivated and aimed at weakening the government party. In answer to another question, Chebeleu reiterated the hope that, after the elections in Hungary, the new government will adopt a realistic approach toward bilateral relations, thus removing the artificial tensions that have emerged in recent years.
