As is customary among today's Romanian politicians, the four-hour congregation of gentlemen representing their parties was held behind closed doors. Under the stale-water circumstances of our recent domestic political life, the PNTCD proposal had a similar effect to that of throwing a rock into a lake covered by duckweed. The surface of the lake, which used to be smooth and lacking any trace of the slightest swell, now suddenly began to churn and roar. It was discovered that beneath the layer of mud, there were some diverging points of view, even philosophies, dormant, just like the frogs in the pond. Obviously, as soon as the press got wind of the opposition's closed-doors meeting on the issue of suspending the president, the journalists flocked in front of those doors eagerly awaiting the news. What on earth could they have been talking about for such a long time? What colossal blow is the opposition preparing against Iliescu, giving them sufficient reason to whisper, so that not a single word could be heard outside through the keyhole? Every now and then one of the members of the congregation would come out and head for the bathroom. They were walking with such gravity that none of the journalists dared to approach them or ask them any questions. Each of the journalists was simply paralyzed at the thought that the politician in question was carrying a huge load of secrets to this designated place and his deep concentration not to drop it made him move like a sleepwalker. Heaven forfend that anyone should pull his sleeve! On would run the risk of seeing him collapse to the ground and wriggle convulsively! After four hours of waiting, the doors were eventually kind enough to open. The assumed coup perpetrators stepped outside and, having been authorized to open their mouths, told the journalists what had been decided inside, after so much mystery. In the beginning, before entering the hall, the politicians had seemed to be raging, extremely furious about the president exceeding his constitutional prerogatives. To this the journalists had added other elements as well (the fact that the meeting was held behind closed doors and its unusual length, exceeding four hours), so that after they came out of the conference hall, everyone expected them to announce draconian measures to punish this constitutional criminal. Everyone assessed that, compared with the steps to be announced, the PNTCD's previous proposal to suspend Iliescu would seem like gently tapping Iliescu on the shoulder. After the opposition representatives finished their announcement, everyone was totally baffled. After four hours of discussions, they decided to punish the president by writing a letter to him, inviting him to come to Parliament to tell them the story of what happened in Satu-Mare. Not a single word condemning Iliescu for stepping from the path established by the Constitution! They even renounced the PNTCD proposal to begin gathering the signatures of members of Parliament needed to begin the procedure of suspending the president. The participants in this glorious congregation reached the conclusion that, owing to the great distance separating Satu-Mare from Bucharest, they had not heard very well what Iliescu had actually said. Curious as they are, they now invited Iliescu to hear from him personally what had happened. For over four hours the mountain quivered and trembled with all its might, so that the walls of the club were shaking and the very fish in the pond were becoming nervous, until eventually it gave birth to a little mouse! Nothing was easier for Cotroceni [seat of the president] than replying to this puerile provocation with a gesture that reminds one of a slap given to someone who is following much too closely. The haughty representatives of the opposition were presented with a text that actually repeated what the president had stated in Satu-Mare. His excellency did not even bother to convey it to them personally, but rather preferred to send it to them via television, an institution that, as is known, actually works like a post office box by which Iliescu sends his letters without even having to pay the postage. The ridiculous decision reached at the Nastase Club has baffled many people. However, it did not puzzle those who have been keeping an eye on what is happening within the opposition. Those observers were not at all surprised to see that the representatives of the PD [Democratic Party] and the CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania], instead of seconding the PNTCD initiative, rather considered it sufficient to address an timid invitation to Iliescu, asking him to explain his statement. All this clearly signals -- more clearly than anything else -- a process that has recently been going on in our political life: the dissolution of the opposition. It is a very slow, sometimes contradictory process, as are all political phenomena that are still hidden from the eyes of public opinion, but that stand a good chance of eventually reaching completion. About this, however, in our next issue. [18 Jun p 1] [Text] In the previous issue of our daily, I pointed out the childishness of the decision taken after a four-hour meeting of the representatives of the opposition that intended to discuss President Iliescu's statements made in Satu-Mare. The PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party] proposed initiating the procedure to have the president suspended from his office. After having examined that proposal, the representatives of the PD [Democratic Party] and the CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania] rejected it and preferred to issue a declaration by which Ion Iliescu was invited to come and personally offer explanations to parliament. Doubtlessly, such a flabby decision -- which was possibly taken so that no one could say that they had wasted four hours just chatting -- was the result of a compromise. The PNTCD's proposal had caused various reactions, some of them were even violently against it, among the representatives attending the meeting on the shores of the lake. In order to avoid a brawl among them -- as brawls may be admirable among street cleaners, but totally unaccepted among intellectuals -- they eventually reached a obtuse conclusion upon which all of them could agree: To call the president to parliament. Abiding by this ridiculous stance, the opposition parties' representatives then elaborated a solemn letter sealed with numerous signatures, which they subsequently sent to Iliescu. Yesterday afternoon, via his spokesman, the president replied that he is no mood to go from Cotroceni to Metropolitan Hill [parliament headquarters] to offer explanations. An arrogant reply given to an arrogant invitation! The opposition parties' diverging stance regarding the president's Satu-Mare declarations was not the sole instance in which they held conflicting opinions recently. There have been other issues as well, in the judgment of which some of them went to the left, while others went the right: Such were the proposal to take [Prime Minister] Nicolae Vacaroiu and [Finance Minister] Florin Georgescu to court on penal charges [for having failed to elaborate the 1994 state budget in due time], the issue of reinstalling monarchy, the draft law on [the legal status of] the nationalized dwellings, or the no-confidence motion against the government. There have always been divergent opinions among the opposition. However, they have never been so absolutely divergent and, above all, they have never found expression in contradictory action. Formerly they used to manifest themselves by the different personal opinions that were expressed. Now, however, those discrepancies have also manifested themselves in deeds. During the debates on the law on the nationalized dwellings, the CDR walked out of parliament hall, while the PD representatives remained seated. The unity crisis did not merely show in contradictory actions, but it also went as far as discrediting each other. The PL-93's [Liberal party '93] proposal to initiate a no- confidence motion is being continuously postponed from one CDR conference to the other. Its coalition partners say neither yes, nor no. The prefer ambiguity. This new turn taken by the divergence among the opposition parties has its origins in the profound rift existing among them regarding the strategy they think best with respect to the current ruling coalition headed by Ion Iliescu. One part of the opposition wishes to return to the radicalism that preceded the amiable phase during which they held negotiations with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania]. The other part considers such a move to be an enormous mistake. The latter are pleading in favor of a policy of compromise. Of course, this rift is also visible within the CDR itself, namely between the PNTCD--PL-93 pole, on the one hand, and the PAC [Civic Alliance Party]--UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania] pole, on the other. However, in the CDR's relations with the PD, this rift has already developed into a deep crevice. Following the [1992] elections, Petre Roman's party [the PD] was, over a certain period of time, an untamed enemy of the PDSR and Ion Iliescu. In Romania's parliament, the PD deputies represented the spearhead of the opposition. Compared to their dynamic and audacious way of acting, the stance adopted by the rest of the opposition seemed to be akin to the shyness of untouched brides. Recently, however, the PD has changed so much that one can hardly recognize it. It is not just the fact that Petre Roman's party has lost its former radicalism, but it has also become a fervent advocate of the compromises and even of the harmony that should exist between the opposition and the rulers. Intelligent as they are, the PD leaders do not lack reasons that they keep bringing up to convince their opposition partners, and generally, public opinion, of the rightness of their surprising softness. Within the broad process of trying to find out the real reasons for their softness, some malevolent observers even linked it to the safes in which the General Prosecution is keeping the files of the corruption cases initiated against certain PD leaders. Others explain this abrupt faintness of the PD by the fact that its leader, Petre Roman, is travelling abroad most of the time, rather than being at home. No doubt about it, the future will disclose the true nature of the reasons that made the PD change in such a baffling way. Until then, however, two things are already certain: a) The PD will have to face the consequences of this compromising policy. For instance, left alone in the parliament hall during the debates on the nationalized dwellings, it was unable to have even one single amendment of its own passed. The majority of the opposition was "not amused" seeing this "constructive" stance adopted by the PD. b) The dissolution of the opposition, as far as CDR--PD relations are concerned, is already a visible process. If the CDR fails to perceive this, that process may spread to the relations among the CDR member parties as well.
