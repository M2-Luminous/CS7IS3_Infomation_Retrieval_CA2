According to a press release from the Federal Office of Justice and Police [DFJP] published on Friday [4 March], espionage is considered a political crime, which excludes all judicial assistance. However, three Swiss bank accounts held by Ames have been frozen. The American request is based on the 1973 Treaty on Mutual Judicial Assistance in criminal matters. The request, which was made as part of an investigation into the spying activities of Aldrich Ames, a high-ranking CIA official, and his wife, Maria del Rosario Casa Ames, was received in Bern on 25 February. Since 1985, the couple allegedly transmitted information on secret operations and on CIA agents to the former Soviet Union, and later to Russia, in exchange for over $1.5 million. Part of this money was deposited in Swiss bank accounts in Zurich and Geneva. The United States has requested that the accounts be frozen and that all banking documents be confiscated and turned over to it. Switzerland cannot grant United States judicial assistance in this case, because spying, for which the Ames couple stands accused, constitutes a political crime, meaning it is exclusively directed against the state's political and social organization. The treaty on mutual judicial assistance rules out its inapplicability to political crimes. The Public Ministry and the cantons concerned are making every effort to determine whether the Ameses have committed crimes within Swiss jurisdiction. On Thursday evening, they ordered the freezing of three bank accounts in Zurich and Geneva.
