FR940527-2-00111 FR940527-2-00094 The Department has promulgated an exemption procedure 3 which provides, among other things, that an exemption will not be granted until a notice of pendency has been published in the Federal Register , and interested persons have been given an opportunity to comment on the proposed transaction. Following consideration of the entire record, the Department then makes its final determination whether to grant the exemption. If the Department contemplates not granting the requested exemption, the procedure also provides an applicant with the right to a conference. 3 See 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990). In most instances, the Department grants individual exemptions for specific transactions involving particular plans and parties in interest. Such exemptions are generally made at the request of the parties involved. In certain cases, however, the Department believes that an exemption applicable to a class of transactions would be appropriate in order to eliminate the need for individuals exemptions. In this regard, the Department granted Prohibited Transaction Exemption 79&hyph;15 4 to permit parties to engage in transactions or activities that are specifically authorized or required, prior to the occurrence of such transactions or activities, by a court order of the United States District Court provided that the transaction is specifically described in such order or settlement, and the Secretary of Labor or the Internal Revenue Service is a party to the litigation. PTE 79&hyph;15 was granted in recognition of the fact that under these circumstances the court has the benefit of the views of the Department and the Internal Revenue Service as to the propriety of rendering a judgment which approves a settlement contemplating transactions which might be prohibited under ERISA and the Code. 4 44 FR 26979 (May 8, 1979). Similar considerations apply to non-judicial settlement agreements involving a plan and the Department following the Department's investigation of a plan. PWBA, through its various area offices, conducts investigations regarding the operation of plans covered by ERISA. Following the completion of an investigation, the Department notifies the responsible plan fiduciaries of its findings by letter. In many instances, this letter (the Voluntary Compliance Letter) provides the fiduciary with the opportunity to avoid litigation with the Department over the issues raised in the Voluntary Compliance Letter by taking voluntary corrective action. In some cases, the corrective action that is most advantageous to the plan involves a transaction with a party in interest that would be prohibited under section 406 of ERISA. The following examples illustrate the types of transactions that may arise in the context of settlement discussions. Example (1) A plan purchased a building comprising 60 percent of the plan's assets. Following an investigation of the plan, the Department notifies the responsible plan fiduciary that such transaction appears to violate several provisions of ERISA. As part of the settlement agreement, the Department and the fiduciary agree that the plan sponsor will purchase the building from the plan, and will reimburse the plan for any losses which may have accrued up to the date of the sale. Example (2) Upon investigation of a plan, the Department discovers that the plan owns a promissory note evidencing a loan to a company wholly owned by the plan fiduciary. At the conclusion of its investigation, the Department notifies the plan fiduciary that such transaction violates the restrictions contained in section 406 of ERISA. The plan fiduciary and the Department agree to settle the matter without resort to litigation. As part of the settlement, the plan fiduciary will purchase the note from the plan for the greater of fair market value or the outstanding balance of the loan plus accrued interest. Example (3) In 1991, a plan's fiduciaries invested a significant percentage of plan assets in a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) without a proper investigation of the investment merits of the transaction. Following receipt of a complaint from a participant of the plan, the Department contacts the plan's fiduciaries and discovers that the value of the plan's investment in the REIT has declined since its acquisition and is now less than 50 percent of the amount of the plan's original investment. The Department informed the fiduciaries that they breached their fiduciary responsibilities under ERISA by investing plan assets in the REIT. The Department agrees to settle the matter without resort to litigation by among other things, accepting the plan sponsor's offer to purchase the plan's interest in the REIT and to reimburse the plan for any losses which the plan has suffered during its investment in the REIT. Because the transactions relating to the settlement agreements described above would be prohibited under section 406 of ERISA, each plan fiduciary would be required to seek an administrative exemption from the Department prior to entering into each transaction. Requiring the plan fiduciary to file an exemption application with PWBA's Office of Exemption Determinations could result in an unnecessary delay in implementing the settlement agreement and effectuating the remedy for the plan. The purpose of the proposed exemption is to permit such transactions or activities to proceed without the need for an individual exemption, provided the conditions of this exemption are met. Discussion of the Proposed Exemption 1. Scope The proposed exemption would provide relief from the restrictions of sections 406(a)(1) (A) through (D), 406(a)(2), 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of ERISA and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975(a) and (b) of the Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code of transactions authorized by the Department pursuant to a settlement agreement, following an investigation conducted by the Department. The Department notes that the proposal does not provide exemptive relief for the transactions or activities cited as violations by the Department in the Voluntary Compliance Letter. Rather, the proposed exemption provides relief for prospective transactions which are specifically agreed to by the Department as part of a settlement of the issues raised in the Voluntary Compliance Letter. Accordingly, the parties to the alleged violation(s) would remain liable for any excise taxes owing under section 4975(a) and (b) of the Code with respect to the transactions or activities cited in the Voluntary Compliance Letter as prohibited under section 406 of ERISA. In addition, the proposed exemption would not affect the liability of any person for the civil penalties imposed on applicable recovery amounts under section 502(1) of ERISA. 2. Proposed Conditions The proposed exemption contains conditions, as discussed below, which the Department views as necessary to ensure that any transaction or activity covered by the proposed exemption would be in the interest of plan participants and to support a finding that the proposed exemption meets the statutory standards of section 408(a) of ERISA.
