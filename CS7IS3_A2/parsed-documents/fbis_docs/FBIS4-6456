Klongluek-Poipet border point, inside Thailand, where thousands of traders from both countries meet to trade mostly Thai goods to Cambodia--was closed by Thai authorities two weeks ago after artillery shells from Cambodia landed on Thai territory. None of the Cambodian warring factions has claimed responsibility or paid damages. The Cambodian traders told Thai authorities they were informed by Cambodian officials that the border was open and they were allowed to trade in Thailand. They said they had paid a fee of 10 baht each to Cambodian officials to get a border pass. The 500 Cambodian traders, after being told of the situation, decided to return after two hours, according to the report. One trader, Linda Ree, 18, who trades in silverware along the border, said she had been happy with the news the border was open. She has rented a small stall at the border point in Thailand where Thai people still owe her about 4,000 baht. She wants to get the money, said Miss Linda. She said that following the border closure, the Poipet market place had been quiet. All kinds of goods from Thailand have been soaring in price and the people are suffering. In a related report, the Committee for Controlling Trade along the Thai-Cambodian border said they would meet on April 25 to discuss the border opening. Measures to protect Thai people along the border and their property need to be discussed with the Cambodian Government before the border is opened, said the report. There is also a need to discuss the two countries' trading systems at the local level before the border can be reopened, expected early next month.
