The commissioning of Monju fully reveals Japan's undisguised scheme to become a nuclear power by securing a large quantity of plutonium for itself and manufacturing nuclear weapons any moment. It is an open challenge to the Korean people and the Asian and world people who are desirous of peace. Japan is already possessed of elements for the manufacture of nuclear bombs including electronic explosive devices and their technologies. Before commissioning Monju it launched the large long-range rocket "H-2" in February this year. Its nuclear armament has now reached the danger line. Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities are now crying for "additional inspection" and "economic sanctions" over the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. This is as base as a thief crying "stop thief " the Japanese authorities must give up their criminal nuclear design, mindful of the grave consequences to be entailed by their moves to make Japan a nuclear power.
