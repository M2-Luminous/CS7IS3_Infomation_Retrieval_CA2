Lithuania is the only country with which Poland has not signed a new treaty so far, Presidential Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski said Monday [25 April]. The presidents of Poland and Lithuania will sign a treaty on "friendly relations and good-neighbourly cooperation" on the first day of the visit. The visit is also important because of its psychological aspect: it is to overcome the domination of the past and history over the present and future relations between the two countries," Drzycimski added. "The treaty is an expression of a compromise and political realism of the two sides. Poland and Lithuania found themselves in a new world, a new Europe and a new geopolitical situation. Good relations are necessary for both sides. The treaty carries the hope and awareness that cooperation will bring benefits and perhaps will help avoid potential threats," head of the presidential political office, Andrzej Zakrzewski said. He added that Lithuania, which strives to cooperate with the Visegrad Triangle and feels to be a part of central Europe, needs Poland. Likewise, Poland needs Lithuania, Zakrzewski said and stressed that "this is a strategic foundation of a new geopolitics of the regions of the two countries." According to the Polish Foreign Ministry, the Polish-Lithuanian treaty creates a solid foundation for the normalisation of mutual relations also as regards the issue of minorities. Also, by signing the treaty with Lithuania Poland will be included in a network of regional links creating new political and economic prospects. Stefan Meller of the Department of Europe at the Polish Foreign Ministry claims the treaty is concordant with respective international standards. Under the treaty, both signatories have the duty to respect human rights. Meller said that the implementation of the treaty might call for changes in the internal legislation of the two states. The text of the treaty continues to arouse controversy both in Poland and Lithuania, but nobody in Lithuania denies the fact that the two countries need the document of this rank and that the Polish president's visit to Vilnius is much desired, PAP correspondent in Vilnius, Alina kurkus wrote. Economic problems are also to be tackled during the visit. After a dramatic collapse of economic relations between Poland and Lithuania, caused by the systemic changes in the two countries, economic contacts at present aim at normalisation. Poland is 6th among Lithuania's trading partners, and the value of the Polish-Lithuanian turnover during 10 months of last year ammounted to some 100 million dollars. According to Poland, there are possibilities to increase mutual turnover, expecially in agriculture, the construction and timber industry and maritime economy. during his 32-hour stay in Lithuania Walesa will meet twice with President Algirdas Brazauskas. He will also meet with Chairman of the Lithuanian Sejm (parliament), Ceslovas Jursenas, and Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius, and address the Sejm on Tuesday. A joint press conference of the two presidents is scheduled for Wednesday.
