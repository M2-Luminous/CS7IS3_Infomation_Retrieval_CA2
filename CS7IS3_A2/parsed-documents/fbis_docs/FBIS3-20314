EU membership is a long-term investment which has its costs and at the beginning may be loss-making, he said. The Czech Republic must be aware it is a difficult process, be aware of possible pitfalls and prepare for entry with the help of specialists able to negotiate on EU admission, he told journalists during the first full day of his visit, which lasts until Sunday [27 March]. Klaus pointed out that Finland's entry to the EU would, ironically, mean the end of its free trade agreement with the Czech Republic, which has lasted 20 years, and the limitation of mutual trade. When asked to respond to Polish criticism that the Czech Republic is seeking EU entry ahead of the other members of the Visegrad Four -- Slovakia, Hungary and Poland -- Klaus said, "Would Finland wait for, say, Norway if Helsinki could get into the EU before Oslo?... We ourselves could have reason to be disappointed that Warsaw did not consult us about submitting its official application for the EU," he said. He said political developments in the Czech Republic would not follow the same course as in Poland, where reform communists have returned to power. He said in the Czech Republic the political situation was stable, the parties politically were clearly defined and the reforms had not provoked calls for a return to the past. Klaus denied he was orientated to the West, saying he was "European." He said Europe should not demonize Russia, but expressed concern that the process of reform had all but stopped and that Russian foreign policy was now reflecting domestic problems.
