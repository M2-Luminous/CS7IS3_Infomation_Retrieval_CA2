They complained and, to judge by press reports, went to create one more economic security service or to repeal the latest unconsidered decision such as increasing import tariffs. Can you imagine a situation in which some state, prefecture, province, or even canton in another state ventured to withhold state taxes? Only in a nightmare. It simply does not happen, since it means the collapse of the state. But in our country right now a single-channel system has in fact been introduced for the collection and transfer of taxes by Russian Federation republics like Bashkiria, Tataria, and Chechnya. Yakutia, Karelia, and other components of our Federation are making claims on the revenue earmarked for the federal budget. The authorities' reaction? In the majority of cases it is a strikingly passive indifference. Last year attention was successfully drawn to this issue and the president's edict on sanctions for nonpayers was published. Separatist agreements between the center and the components of the Federation were not undertaken. You form the impression that many of our eminent politicians have confused federation and confederation. What separate agreements can there be, what ownership of land, the subterranean depths, resources, and property by components of the federation, and what single-channel budget can there be? All this is a direct path to Russia's collapse. The people will hardly agree to that without objecting. The legal assignment to components of such rights for components within the framework of some agreements or additions to the Federation Treaty is intolerable. It is already clear that it was the center's weakness which led to the adoption of an incomplete Federation Treaty, to the issue of countless benefits and privileges on a purely political basis in exchange for alleged support. It is characteristic that the more unjustified the concessions, the less respect for the center. Everything has been turned upside down. Any recognition of the legitimacy of the single-channel system for collecting taxes and of the special rights of republics inside Russia leads to similar demands from the oblasts. A number of them are already raising these questions officially. Ideologists of the Ural Republic and other similar plans are well represented in the Federation Council. The principle of budget federalism -- the separation of the budget and taxes and a precise revenue base for the center and the components of the Federation -- has successfully been included in the new budget system elaborated by the Ministry of Finances last year. If this system is adopted by the Federal Assembly we have a chance of resolving the problem peacefully. We desperately need a tough political solution which would ideally contain the following points: -- unity of status and equal rights and powers for all components of the Federation; -- the categorical rejection of any forms of a single-channel budget system and of the adoption of the principle of the property of components of the Federation; -- the rejection of the Center's separatist agreements with individual components of the Federation which infringe on Russia's interests as a unified state, of endless subisidies to the regions for political reasons, and of attempts to isolate "national" banks in the republics; -- the banning of any attempts to discriminate against the republics' nonindigenous population; -- the toughest sanctions against those who have violated the principles of the federation. What has been said does not mean that it is necessary to continue the separation of the powers of the levels of power, to decentralize the budget system, develop a two-channel taxation, or expand the rights of the components of the Federation in the economic field. But delay in this field is like death. The state's strikingly unprofessional and impotent policy in this field is surprising. History will not forgive us the collapse of Russia, it must be halted.
