They finally began turning up at the camps before Christmas, but apparently didn't like what they found or did not find, in particular the poor facilities and the lack of food, water, and clothing. Now, up to 600 Renamo soldiers are reported to have walked out of the camps in central Sofala Province. On the line to Maputo, Dan Isaacs asked Tom Cadel of the UN mission, Unomoz, who is in charge of the demobilization operation how he responded to the Renamo complaints. [Begin recording] [Cadel] Yesterday, we have identified this problem and it was informed to Renamo delegation. The Renamo delegation at the Cease-Fire Commission said that they were not aware of this problem and that it would immediately check and then take appropriate action. [Isaacs] Now, this isn't the first time that this has happened. Renamo soldiers a few weeks ago apparently went on hunger strike, complaining about the quality or the lack of food. Do you think that there are real problems getting enough food to the assembly areas? [Cadel] I don't think there are any problems at all. There is a basic agreement between the World Food Program which is providing food to the assembly areas and the government. Unomoz offered that in the cases where there are difficulties in logistics that it could help. At the same time, on Renamo side, we had proposed, in the additional funding that Unomoz obtained, to provide some additional items, like dried meat, dried fish, and salt to Renamo assembly areas. [Isaacs] And yet there do seem to be problems because Renamo personnel are walking out of assembly areas. Clearly, they are upset about something? [Cadel] My position here at the moment, I am not aware of the exact reason, nor Renamo head of delegation yesterday in the Cease-Fire Commission was able to explain to the commission what reason could be. [Isaacs] Now, apart from these problems there do appear to be a large number of Renamo and government soldiers arriving in assembly areas. What are the latest figures on those? [Cadel] The latest figures are that on the government side, 8,334 soldiers have arrived. On the Renamo side, 4,632, adding up to a total of 12,966. [Isaacs] Now, that is quite a large number but it is slower than the UN had anticipated. Do you think the proposed election date of October of this year is possible, given those limitations? [Cadel] I think from the demobilization point of view, definitely, it is very well possible. Of course, it depends here on the inputs from both parties to provide the information on which people are going to the new army and which people, they will be demobilized and this can be a fact that it will delay a little bit, but in the overall planning, technically, we still have a [word indistinct] of one month spare, we can call it. So, we are still confident that we can finalize the demobilization till the end of May. [Isaacs] And therefore elections are possible in October? [Cadel] And therefore elections should be possible in October. [end recording]
