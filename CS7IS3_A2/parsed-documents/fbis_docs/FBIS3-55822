The discussion was not only interesting but instructive, since it touched not only on the essence but the psychology of the problems which Clinton will encounter in the course of his visit. NEW YORK TIMES observer William Safire asked Clinton whether there is anyone within his administration with a view different from the Clinton-Christopher-Talbott line. In particular, is there anyone who would dare say this to the White House incumbent -- if you do not accept the East European countries into NATO now, when Russia is weak, you will never be able to do so when Russia is strong again. Clinton's reply was very laconic -- nobody in my administration holds such a view. Justifying this policy, Clinton described himself as a "force for optimism," particularly as regards Russia's future. "I believe," he said, "that if they continue as a democratic, market-oriented, reformist, noninterventionist nation, they will become a great power in the traditional sense of the word, and not an empire.... The whole history, character, and texture of Russia confirms this." Unfortunately, the whole history, character, and texture of Russia not only do not confirm this but resolutely refute it. President Clinton's above statement demonstrates the danger posed by the absence of a "devil's advocate" among his foreign policy advisers on Russia -- someone who could somehow balance the influence exerted by the former TIME observer, translator of Khrushchev's memoirs, and friend from Clinton's Oxford student days. It would be interesting to know whether there is a "devil's advocate" in President Yeltsin's entourage who, despite official policy, would recommend that he not prevent the East European countries from joining NATO. Speaking purely logically, there clearly is such an adviser in the Kremlin or close to it. After all, somebody prepared Boris Yeltsin's famous visit to the East European capitals, his meetings, and the texts of the speeches in which the Russian president by no means objected to his hospitable hosts joining NATO. Of course, it is possible to cite changed circumstances since then -- currently defined in both Russia and the West by the single code word "Zhirinovskiy." Admittedly, everyone deciphers that code in their own way. Moscow claims that expanding NATO to cover East Europe would merely be grist to the mill of the ultraright-wingers and fascists, resurrecting the dark shadows of the policy of containment and even roll-back. Roughly similar arguments are being used in Washington, which has invented the elastic "Partnership for Peace" formula. Whereas the East European capitals, on the contrary, see the Zhirinovskiy factor as an argument in favor of NATO membership. There is no room in this report to provide the extensive arguments in favor of each approach. I believe that right is on the side of Walesa and Havel rather than Yeltsin and Clinton -- and that it is reinforced by the whole history, character, and texture of postwar international development. It is hard even to imagine where Yalta would have led had NATO not negated its effects. Of course, Yeltsin's Russia is not Stalin's Soviet Union. But NATO membership for the East European countries would make this transformation even more decisive, if not irreversible. One more point. Which is more important for peace in Europe -- Poland or Portugal, the Czech Republic or Greece? Hypocrisy dictates the reply that they are all important in their own way. Real politics and history -- with its rich texture -- tell us something else. But the fact is that, as was the case before World War II, the United States is not sufficiently mature in moral terms to fight for Warsaw or Prague even hypothetically. (All the more so in the nuclear era). But it was this reluctance to fight that was one of the main reasons why it ultimately proved necessary to fight. Oscar Wilde claims in one of his famous paradoxes that the best way to avoid temptation is to give in to it. In politics such paradoxes can be catastrophic. In politics it is better not to tempt fate, but to put the tempters in their place from the very outset. Whatever they may be called -- Hitler or Zhirinovskiy. After all, Clinton is essentially not making a concession to Yeltsin but placating Zhirinovskiy. At any event, Vladimir Volfovich is entirely capable of drawing this interpretation from Clinton's "Partnership for Peace" lifesaver. Any concession which Clinton makes or will make to Yeltsin in this area strengthens both objectively and subjectively not the Russian president but his neofascist opponent.
