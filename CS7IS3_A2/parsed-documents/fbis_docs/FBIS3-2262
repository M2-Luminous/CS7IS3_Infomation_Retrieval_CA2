"No foreign country, organisation or individual has the right to make irresponsible remarks or interfere," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. The spokesman did not mention the United States by name, but his remarks clearly referred to comments by senior U.S. officials on a recent sweep by Chinese police that has netted at least eight political activists, including the country's most famous dissident Wei Jingsheng. "China is a sovereign state," the spokesman said. "To summon and interrogate according the law those who violated criminal law and other laws fall entirely within the scope of China's sovereignty." He said the police action was not related to this week's visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. "This issue which is purely an internal affair of China has nothing to do with the forthcoming visit to China by the U.S. secretary of state," he said. Christopher's visit is seen as crucial to determine whether Beijing has made the "significant overall progress" in improving human rights set as a pre-condition for June's annual renewal of China's most-favoured-nation status.
