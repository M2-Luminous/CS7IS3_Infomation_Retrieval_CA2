Election- related spending could reach R1.5-billion by the end of May. In a document, "Estimated Expenditure December 20 1993- May 31 1994", the IEC outlined the expected cost of the election. Appropriations for IEC directorates and departments include R154-million for monitoring, R26-million for voter education, R29- million for communication and R29-million for election adjudication. Salaries take up a chunk of the bill, and at the top of the scale are the 16 commissioners who earn up to R25,000 a month and receive. R2,000 a month entertainment allowance and a R50 a day subsistence allowance. During international and local trips, they receive an additional allowance of R500 a day. The budget for the commissioners' office is R5.5-million. Chief directors of IEC departments receive R17,000 a month, while heads of departments are earmarked to receive R14,000 a month. Lower grade officials are receiving around R58,000 for three-month contracts. The IEC salaries are supposed to be on the same scales as those of civil servants, but in practice they are much higher. Assistant directors in the civil service receive up to R70,000 a year, while scales of assistant directors in the IEC start at R70,000. South African civil servants working for the IEC complain that their salaries are fixed, while those appointed by the IEC are linked to what they would have lost had they carried on with their normal jobs. A bonus plan for civil servants is being worked on to even the pay structure. The IEC has also equipped its headquarters and regional offices with modern technology and the commission has purchased 450 computers. Provision is made for 2,500 cellular telephones, which are expected to cost R4.5-million. There is also R10.5-million for satellite back-up equipment. Vehicles are also on the IEC's shopping list and it is looking for 10 4x4 vehicles, 100 micro buses and wants to hire 3,000 vehicles at a cost of R3,000 a month. Although the budget has yet to be approved, the IEC has had to go ahead with many of the purchases. Until the budget is approved, the IEC is living off R140-million appropriated by the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) at the end of last year, grants from foreign donors and credit. The government of national unity will be committed to picking up the bill for the election. The TEC -- which has a budget of R18.9-million -- does not have the responsibility of approving the budget, and the final appropriation will have to be approved by parliament. In terms of the Act setting up the commission, money matters are the responsibility of the commission's chief executive -- who has a budget of R1.7 million -- although his records will be audited by the auditor-general. However, IEC staff point out that until last week, there were no set guidelines for the requisition of personnel and equipment and rules were made as issues cropped up. Although the TEC is not responsible for the IEC's budget, it has appropriated money for other election related expenses. The council has ordered that policemen receive the same pay as members of the National Peacekeeping Force for the duration of the election. This will add R120-million to the R150-million the police planned to spend on election operations. The council also decided to grant the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] R31.5-million to cover debts incurred to the corporation by the Democracy Broadcast Education Unit (Debi) and to subsidies election coverage. If it is any consolation to South Africans, foreign taxpayers are also chipping in a fair bit to ensure free and fair elections The European Union Election Unit in South Africa has a budget of R27-million. This is in addition to the R20-million it granted to the Independent Forum for Electoral Education, in July 1993, and a further R10-million towards the State Election Fund for South African political parties. --The United Nations mission will be spending R129-million to cover the costs of its observers but will not be funding any projects. --The Commonwealth, which will also only be observing, has budgeted R2.65-million for its mission. --The Organisation of African Unity, which already has a presence in the country, is finalising the size of its mission and its budget this week.
