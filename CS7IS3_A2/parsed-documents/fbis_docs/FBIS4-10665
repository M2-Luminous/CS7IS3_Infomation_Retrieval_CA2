April is very important to the objective of increasing the quantities of raw product produced, and May must be the month in which operations are concluded, although a number of mills may continue to grind in June, said Torres during an analysis of the harvest in Camaguey, Las Tunas, and Holguin. He stressed that a greater effort is necessary on the days when there is activity, and pointed out that it would be a good idea to increase the direct transportation of cane from the fields where it is being harvested to the mills. He also called attention to the fact that it is indispensable to apply alternatives at each place to reduce dependency on electric power provided by the national system, because during recent working days, collection centers were affected by interruptions in electric service. During the analysis meeting, which was presided over by Carlos Lage, member of the Politburo and secretary of the executive committee of the Council of Ministers, it was reported that Las Tunas obtained the best results in principal indicators during the period 1-10 April, pushing Camaguey into second place. Camaguey had been in first place.
