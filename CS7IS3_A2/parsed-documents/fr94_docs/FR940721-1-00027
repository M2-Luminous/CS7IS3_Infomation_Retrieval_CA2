FR940721-1-00027 FR940721-1-00009 The emission projection methodologies used for the maintenance demonstration are the same as those used for the attainment inventory and discussed above. The emission projections show that the emissions are not expected to exceed the level of the base year 1993 inventory during the 10-year maintenance period. Further emission reductions that will occur during this maintenance demonstration that are not accounted for in the emission projections presented in the tables above such as title III maximum achievable control technology for air toxics, and onboard refueling vapor recovery. The projected emission inventories were prepared in accordance with USEPA guidance. Finally, USEPA's Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD contains more in-depth details regarding the projected emission inventories for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. To demonstrate maintenance out to the year 2005 following redesignation, the State did not rely on certain SIP-approved measures. The State now requests that these measures (discussed below) be moved from the applicable SIP into the maintenance plan as contingency measures. The State has demonstrated maintenance without basic I/M, Stage I expansion 12 , Stage II and NO X RACT. The Act required a SIP submittal for these control measures prior to the submittal of the redesignation request, and consequently, they are required to be fully adopted and fully approved into the SIP prior to or at the time of full approval of the redesignation request. However, since the State has demonstrated attainment and maintenance without these programs these measures can be incorporated into the area's maintenance plan as contingency measures (see, e.g., September 17, 1993 Shapiro memorandum). The June 28, 1994 Proposed I/M Redesignation Rule proposes to allow basic I/M to be included as a contingency measure in the form of enabling legislation. Stage I must be fully adopted since it is a SIP element that was due prior to the submittal of the redesignation request. Stage II, however, does not have to be fully adopted. In fact, since the ``onboard rule'' was published on April 6, 1994 Stage II is no longer a requirement (section 202(a)(6) of the Act). However, if the State chooses to include this program as a contingency measure, enabling legislation would suffice. Michigan has chosen to retain Stage II as a contingency measure in the maintenance plan. Finally, the State submitted to USEPA a section 182(f) NO X exemption petition based on 1991&hyph;1993 ambient air quality data that demonstrates that the area is attaining the ozone NAAQS. The USEPA is currently taking action on this submittal. Since the Detroit-Ann Arbor area has demonstrated that it can maintain the standard without the implementation of these programs, USEPA proposes that the maintenance plan be approved with these elements as contingency measures. In addition, based on the maintenance demonstration, the USEPA plans to propose approval of the basic I/M enabling legislation (based on the June 28, 1994 proposed I/M Redesignation Rule), and the Stage I rule and 182(f) NO X exemption petition in a separate FR action. 12 The expanded applicability of Stage I to county boundaries of each nonattainment area classified as moderate and above. C. Verification of Continued Attainment Continued attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area depends, in part, on the State's efforts toward tracking indicators of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The tracking plan for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area consists of two components; continued ambient ozone monitoring and inventory updates. To demonstrate ongoing compliance with the NAAQS, Michigan will continue to monitor ozone levels throughout the area. The State will also conduct periodic inventories for the redesignated area every 3 years using the most recent emission factors, models and methodologies. The inventories will begin in 1996 with completion of the 1996 inventory by July 1, 1998. Periodic inventories for 1999, 2002, and 2005 will be completed with submittal to the USEPA on the first of October 2 years after the inventory year. The periodic inventory will consist of reviewing the assumptions of the maintenance demonstration such as VMT, population, employment, etc. If substantial changes are discovered, the State will reproject the emissions for the maintenance period.
