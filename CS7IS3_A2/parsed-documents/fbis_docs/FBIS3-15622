This was stated today in an address at the 50th daily session of the UN Commission on Human Rights by the head of the Russian delegation, the human rights representative of the Russian Federation Sergey Kovalev. After stressing that "Russia, too, is facing plenty of transition period problems and difficulties," he thanked countries and international organizations which had sent observers to the parliamentary elections and the referendum on the new Constitution of the Russian Federation for their assistance. The Russian representative said that "fruitful contacts" had been established with the Council of Europe, the Center for Human Rights [as heard], the United States, the European countries, and Australia. More than 30 non-government organizations, including "Amnesty International" and "Helsinki Watch," had opened missions in the Russian Federation. "We welcome in every possible way intervention of this kind in Russia's internal affairs and believe that the more vigorous and the more large-scale it is, the more hopes and guarantees there will be that the internal life of Russian society will change for the better." "We hope that our partners will not be indifferent to a problem which is so painful for Russians like the situation of their compatriots in the countries which previously were part of the Soviet Union, including Latvia and Estonia. Not only Russia's democratic future, but also the fate of many states which were formed after the break-up of the USSR, and in the final analysis, international peace and security, depend on how timely and clear their voice is." After touching on the situation in the Yugoslav conflict zone, Sergey Kovalev stressed that the presence of Russian soldiers and officers in Sarajevo is "an example of Russia's sincere interest in a peaceful settlement of the crisis in former Yugoslavia." Russian servicemen had come to the Bosnian capital in order to "prevent further suffering and death in this town." He warned against an unbalanced approach towards the Yugoslav crisis and attempts to blame one of the conflicting sides for everything, "to play down the crimes by one side and to indulge yet another side." Inevitably such an approach "will hamper the possibility of a peaceful settlement of the conflict and will undermine trust in the Commission on Human Rights." The address voiced concern at the situation in the human rights sphere in Iraq, Iran, Myanmar, and Afghanistan. "So far the problem of the release of former servicemen has not been resolved," the head of the delegation said. "Some Afghanistani politicians are continuing to block this issue. Our position is that the problem of prisoners of war is of a strictly humanitarian nature and needs to be solved immediately and without linkage to any conditions whatsoever." "We are disappointed by the lack of progress in ensuring human rights in Cuba, for whose people Russia has the warmest feelings," Sergey Kovalev said. "We call on the Cuban authorities to ensure democratic rights and freedoms and also to establish cooperation with the Commission's special rapporteur." After recalling that at the 48th session of the Commission on Human Rights the Russian delegation "had raised the issue of the arbitrariness of the state bodies of North Korea vis-a-vis DPRK citizens at timber procurement enterprises in Russia," he said that "at the Russian side's initiative the bilateral agreement between Russian and the DPRK on cooperation in the sphere of timber procurement, in spite of considerable financial advantages, had been cancelled." In future such an agreement is possible only "given the observance of the rights and freedoms of the individual and the respect of Russian legislation."
