FBIS4-36865 "drnes114dd_94010" FBIS-NES-94-114 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Al-Husayni on Delays in Release of Detainees Al-Husayni on Delays in Release of Detainees JN1306120894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic 0930 GMT 13 Jun 94 JN1306120894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Arabic BFN [Interview with Faysal al-Husayni, member of the Palestinian National Authority, by Sa'id Mu'addi; place and date not given; from the "With The Midday Events" program--recorded] [Text] [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal al-Husayni: The families of Palestinian detainees and prisoners are staging protest marches. What are you doing as a Palestinian leadership? [Al-Husayni] In fact, we are facing a problem over the interpretation of the agreement that was signed in Gaza, as well as the agreement that was signed in Cairo first and then in Gaza. Our view of this agreement is that 5,000 Palestinian prisoners should be released before 11 June and that all Palestinian detainees should return home, except those involved in criminal cases -- murders or ordinary criminal cases; those should be turned over to the Palestinian Authority. We were surprised that the Israelis interpreted this as meaning that he who killed a [Israeli] civilian is covered by this formula. They then came back to add that he who injured a [Israeli] civilian is covered by that formula even if he was tried at a military court. We now want to have, once again, a distinction; that what we were talking about was the criminal aspects and not the military cases, which, as is well known, had reasons connected to the confrontation with the occupation and ended with the signing of the peace process and should not remain unresolved. As regards the other prisoners, negotiations on their release must start immediately after 11 June. Now because of this Israeli position, we demanded an end to the prisoner release according to the Israeli way. The prisoners should be released according to our concept, or a new agreement must be drafted with the Israelis on the way the prisoners should be released. We and the prisoners will be facing major complications if we accept the Israeli concept. What I would like to clarify here for our brother prisoners is that their cause is one of our priorities. We insist that in the end all Palestinian prisoners must be released and returned home. This is a peace process and within this context -- the peace process -- all Palestinians must be released regardless of the acts they committed. [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal, the security liaison committee will meet today in Gaza to discuss this issue. Are there any proposals on the agenda? [Al-Husayni] Yes. We are supposed to raise at this meeting the issue which we are facing in Jericho. A large number of Palestinians who were released should return to their homes immediately. The formula agreed upon in the past -- that is; he who killed a Palestinian must remain in Jericho -- means that he should remain in Jericho only if his leaving to his place of residence would cause problems. But if his leaving to his place of residence does not create anything that may harm the security of that person, then he must return to his home. Those who were arrested for wounding or harming others, these must return immediately, even if this is done gradually, but they must return because their cases are resolved. [Mu'addi] Mr. Husayni, how many prisoners have been released so far on the basis of the Cairo agreement? [Al-Husayni] So far, less than half the number have been released, that is less than 2,500 prisoners. Some 300 prisoners are now in Jericho, and at least half of them must go immediately to their homes. [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal al-Husayni, naturally you are now making arrangements in preparations for Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in the self-rule area. Has 'Arafat informed you of the date of his arrival and have you informed the Israeli authorities of 'Arafat's date of arrival? [Al-Husayni] I can say that it will be in the second half of this month, not before 15 June. [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal al-Husayni, thank you. [Al-Husayni] Thank you.
