FR940722-2-00064 FR940722-2-00042 [Docket No. 94D&hyph;0149] Miscellaneous Compliance Policy Guides; Revocation AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the revocation of eight compliance policy guides (CPG's) because either they are outdated, their issues are addressed elsewhere, or they no longer reflect current FDA policy. This action is being taken to ensure that FDA's CPG's are accurate and reflect FDA policy and sound scientific principles. DATES: Effective July 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Judith A. Gushee, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;236), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1785. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FDA is revoking eight of its CPG's because either they are outdated, their issues are addressed elsewhere, or they no longer reflect current FDA policy. The following eight guides are being revoked: (1) CPG 7125.02 ``Quantity of Contents Declaration on Labels of Liquid Animal Feeds'' CPG 7125.02 was established in 1980 under the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (15 U.S.C. 205b) to clarify FDA's preference for metric labeling for liquid animal drugs. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 was amended by the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (ATPA) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;245). Section 107 of the ATPA amended the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) (15 U.S.C. 1451 et seq .) to require that the most appropriate metric units be used as the primary system for expressing quantity of content. Section 107 of the ATPA was repealed by Pub. L. 102&hyph;329, which provided certain technical amendments to the FPLA, including dual (metric and English) labeling and certain exemptions. These amendments provide a more appropriate basis for metric labeling. Therefore, CPG 7125.02 is unnecessary. (2) CPG 7125.04 ``Diethylcarbamazine'' CPG 7125.04 was established to provide monograph criteria for diethylcarbamazine-containing drugs instead of requiring new animal drug application (NADA) approval. Since establishing this CPG, FDA has determined these products are not exempt from the NADA approval process. Therefore, CPG 7125.04 no longer reflects FDA policy. (3) CPG 7125.07 ``Impact of CGMPR Violations on NADA'' The Center for Veterinary Medicine has routinely been involved in reviewing results of inspections and district endorsements involving NADA's and abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADA's). For those facilities unable to manufacture in compliance with current good manufacturing practices (CGMP's), approval of applications was delayed pending reinspection and satisfactory corrective action. Compliance Program Guidance Manual (CPGM) 7368.001, part V, describes district responsibilities in reporting their findings for preapproval inspections. The current CPGM is adequate to cover this issue of CGMP noncompliance in the preapproval stage. Therefore, CPG 7125.07 is superfluous. (4) CPG 7125.08 ``Hexachlorophene in Pet Shampoos'' Pet shampoos are considered grooming aids if they contain hexachlorophene at not more than 0.1 percent (as a preservative) and are not labeled with therapeutic claims. CPG 7125.21 ``Animal Grooming Aids'' and 21 CFR 500.46 adequately address the issues. Therefore, CPG 7125.08 is not needed. (5) CPG 7126.15 ``Crotolaria Seeds in Grains and Feeds'' At FDA's urging, the feed industry has become meticulous in inspecting incoming raw ingredients for foreign materials, including crotolaria seeds. Crotolaria, although once a nuisance and a toxin, has not been a compliance problem for years. Therefore, CPG 7126.15 is no longer relevant. (6) CPG 7126.30 ``Diethylstilbestrol Residues in Edible Animal Tissue'' The approval for use of Diethylstilbestrol in animal drugs or feeds was withdrawn in the Federal Register of July 6, 1979 (44 FR 39618 at 39619), as confirmed by the Commissioner's decision in the Federal Register of September 21, 1979 (44 FR 54852 at 54900). Therefore, CPG 7126.30 is obsolete. (7) CPG 7126.32 ``Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) Violations in Medicated Feed Mills_Direct Issuance of Regulatory Letters'' Compliance Program Guidance Manual (CPGM) 7371.004 describes current policy concerning warning letters and provides model letters. Therefore, CPG 7126.32 is obsolete because it describes regulatory letters that are no longer issued. (8) CPG 7126.39 ``Ammonium Chloride Used in Ruminant Feeds'' CPG 7126.39 concerned a formerly approved use of ammonium chloride in 21 CFR 558.45 for treating urinary calculi (see the Federal Register of March 3, 1986 (51 FR 7382 at 7395)), which has since been withdrawn (see the Federal Register of October 26, 1987 (52 FR 39911 at 39912). There are no approved drug claims for use of ammonium chloride in ruminant feed and the agency has not documented any evidence of misuse of the compound in several years. Therefore, CPG 7126.39 is obsolete. Dated: July 13, 1994. Gary Dykstra, Acting Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs.
