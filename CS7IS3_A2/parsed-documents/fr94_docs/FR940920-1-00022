FR940920-1-00022 FR940920-1-00005 POSTAL SERVICE 39 CFR Part 111 Revisions to Standards for Palletization AGENCY: Postal Service. ACTION: Proposed rule; notice of public meeting. SUMMARY: In response to requests from postal customers, the Postal Service has decided to hold a public meeting to facilitate the receipt of comments regarding a proposal to implement revised Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards prohibiting mailer use of ``courtesy'' pallets (pallets that do not meet DMM standards). DATES: September 29, 1994, 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. MEETING ADDRESS: Sheraton Washington Hotel, Maryland A Room, 2660 Woodley Road at Connecticut Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20008. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Cheryl Beller, (202) 268&hyph;5166, or Robert Sheehan, (202) 268&hyph;4305. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 18, 1994, the Postal Service published proposed rule changes in the Federal Register (59 FR 42536&hyph;42540) to amend Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards concerning the preparation of mail on pallets. See also the notice published in the proposed rule section of the Federal Register on September 19, 1994. That notice extended the period for comment on this proposal to November 3, 1994. The proposed revisions are intended to establish consistent preparation standards for all classes of mail that result in the lowest combined costs of handling palletized mail for the Postal Service and its customers as well as to facilitate consistent service for palletized mailings. Numerous customers have indicated that implementation of the provisions prohibiting courtesy pallets would have catastrophic implications for their businesses and have requested an opportunity to present their views and concerns in person regarding the provisions in the proposed rule change pertaining to courtesy pallets. The Postal Service generally does not hold, nor does it generally find a need for, public meetings concerning proposed rules. Nevertheless, in this limited instance, the Postal Service has determined to grant the request for a public meeting. Interested parties may, of course, submit written comments in accordance with the instructions in the Federal Register notice. Comments submitted at the meeting may be written or oral. Oral comments will be transcribed for future reference and will be available for inspection and photocopying between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, in room 8430 at U.S. Postal Service Headquarters, 475 L'Enfant Plaza, SW., Washington, DC 20260&hyph;6808. Individuals wishing to present comments are asked to limit their oral presentations to 10 minutes. Stanley F. Mires, Chief Counsel, Legislative.
