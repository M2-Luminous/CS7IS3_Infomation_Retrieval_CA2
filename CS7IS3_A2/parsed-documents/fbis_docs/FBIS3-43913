For that reason, everyone is watching the figures for confined and demobilized soldiers, as such figures are made available. What we are witnessing from both sides is worrisome, particularly from the government's side. The truth is that practically no government forces went into their confinement points between 21 December of last year and 16 January. The UN Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, report cites zero government soldiers joining their confinement centers for almost each day that has passed since 21 December. By the way of an example, let us look at government soldier entries between 6 and 16 January: 6 January: zero soldiers; 7 January: zero soldiers; 8 January: zero soldiers; 9 January: zero soldiers; 10 January: one soldier; 11 January: zero soldiers; 12 January: six soldiers; 13 January: zero soldiers; 14 January: zero soldiers; 15 January: two soldiers; 16 January: zero soldiers. Deputy Minister Tomas Salomao was the surprising head of the government team to yesterday's important meeting of the Supervision and Control Commission, CSC, to discuss the slow troop confinement. He provided two justifications for it: the accommodation centers' inability to take in so many soldiers -- after all, it seems that they take less soldiers than had been thought -- and some logistical problems. The truth, though, is that those explanations make no sense whatever. How can one say that the problem has to do with lack of accommodation if not even one soldier has made it yet to seven of those centers? Can it be that they are already full before even one soldier has arrived? It is also difficult to believe that logistical problems could be a reason. For example, the city of Quelimane has one of the centers where not a single soldier has arrived yet. Can it possibly be that the soldiers stationed in the capital of Zambezia Province cannot be moved to a confinement center in the city itself? Can it be so difficult to supply centers that are mostly located in cities and villages? Deputy Minister Tomas Salomao expressed optimism because the last few days have already seen some entries. However, Unomoz only reports movement at one troop confinement point, that of Casa Banana, where 241 men arrived on 17 January. Not a single soldier made it to the other 20 assembly points. In view of this, the reasons presented by the deputy minister are less than convincing. Mozambican society has a right to know what is really happening. If there are fundamental reasons for this situation, then let them out so that everything can return to normal. If there are no such reasons, then let the troops be ordered immediately to go into the assembly points. What must not happen is a continuation of this situation.
