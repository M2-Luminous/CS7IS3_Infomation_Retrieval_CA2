It is an action that deeply hurts us, and me particularly, because this is an attack on a human being. In addition, it is against a noble man, a good man, who seeks to serve others and to serve his country. I have already heard many voices express their consternation with this incident and their all-out rejection of this attack. I am in constant contact to learn about Colosio's condition. I have sent my sympathy to his family. I have sent my personal physician and an expert to help the doctors attending him. I have been informed that arrests have been made. I have given instructions to the attorney general to travel to Tijuana to help in the investigation. We will get to the bottom of this and the full weight of the law shall be applied. The most important thing right now is Luis Donaldo Colosio's health. I am certain that if we all join in our sentiments of compassion and serenity and direct them positively, it will be good for him and good for all of us. Personally, this is a very painful matter, as he is a beloved Mexican. I offer him and his family all my affection and warmth. [end recording]
