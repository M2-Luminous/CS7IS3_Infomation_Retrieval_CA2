They were being transported on two trucks apparently loaded with tomatoes. This announcement was made here today by Rafael Aguilera Carrillo, the commander of the Federal Highway and Ports Police (PFCyP) in Ensenada. He claimed that this discovery alerted federal authorities to the possible existence of laboratories specializing in the processing of the alkaloid, addiction to which can prove fatal to a person within five months. Interviewed at the Tijuana airport, the police chief explained that the members of this force's patrol 33,403 discovered the shipment when they responded to an automobile accident reported on the San Vicente-San Quintin section of the federal highway leading from Tijuana to Cabo San Lucas. He added that they spotted the two trucks and, after noticing that the vehicles' drivers were visibly nervous, began inspecting them. He indicated that the federal agents found the 100 kg of ephedrine and 679 kg of marijuana under the loads of tomatoes in the center of the vehicles. In conclusion, he reported the arrest of Gerardo Montoya Villaman and Alberto David Rodriguez Leon, who were driving the trucks loaded with drugs to Tijuana, intending to smuggle them into the United States.
