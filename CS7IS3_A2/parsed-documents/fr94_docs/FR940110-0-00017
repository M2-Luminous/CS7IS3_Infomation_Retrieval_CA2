FR940110-0-00017 FR940110-0-00005 Paragraph (a)(3) of ยง932.52 of the California olive marketing order provides that processed olives smaller than the sizes prescribed for whole and whole pitted styles may be used for limited uses if recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary. The sizes are specified in terms of minimum weights for individual olives in various size categories by variety groups. This is to recognize the different sizing characteristics of the individual varieties and types of California olives. Olives used in limited use styles are too small to be desirable for use as whole or whole pitted canned olives because their flesh-to-pit ratio is too low. However, they are satisfactory for use in the production of limited use styles. The committee unanimously recommended to authorize establishment of minimum sizes for use in the production of limited use styles during the 1993&hyph;94 season. These minimum sizes would be the same as those established for the 1992&hyph;93 season. The sizes are specified in terms of minimum weights for individual olives in various variety groups and are the same for both domestic and imported olives. An extra category is continued in the import regulation to apply comparable requirements for varieties not grown domestically. The minimum sizes are as follows: Variety Group I, except the Ascolano, Barouni, or St. Agostino varieties_1/105 pound Variety Group I of the Ascolano, Barouni, or St. Agostino varieties_1/180 pound Variety Group 2, except the Obliza variety_1/205 pound Variety Group 2 of the Obliza variety_1/180 pound Olives not identifiable as to variety or variety group_1/205 pound Each of the categories includes a 35 percent tolerance for olives weighing less than the specified minimum size. This action is necessary because section 8e of the Act provides that when domestically produced olives are regulated under a Federal marketing order, imported olives must meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements. Thus, authorizing the use of smaller sized California olives in the production of limited use styles and establishing size regulations for such olives requires that the same or comparable regulations be issued for imported bulk olives. Permitting the use of smaller olives in the production of limited use styles will allow importers to take better advantage of the strong market for halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped canned ripe olives. Importers will be able to import and market more olives than would be permitted in the absence of this relaxation in size requirements. This additional opportunity is provided to maximize the use of the available olive supply and facilitate market expansion. In the absence of this action, the smaller fruit could not be imported for limited uses, and would have to be disposed of through less profitable, non-canning uses under the supervision of the inspection service or exported. A change in paragraph (c) to be implemented indefinitely, updates the list of regional inspection offices listed in the import regulation. The change reflects consolidation of the Southeastern and Central offices into the Eastern Regional Office and the relocation of the Western Regional Office. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the U.S. Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of this final rule. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee, and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rules, without change, as published in the Federal Register [FR 58 48592 and 48595], will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. List of Subjects 7 CFR Part 932 Marketing agreements, Olives, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. List of Subjects 7 CFR Part 944 Avocados, Food grades and standards, Grapefruit, Grapes, Imports, Kiwifruit, Limes, Olives, and Oranges. For the reasons set forth in the preamble 7 CFR parts 932 and 944 are amended as follows: 1. The authority citation for 7 CFR Parts 932 and 944 are revised to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674. PART 932_OLIVES GROWN IN CALIFORNIA 2. Accordingly, the interim final rule revising the provisions of ยง932.153, which was published in the September 17, 1993, Federal Register [58 FR 48592], is adopted as a final rule without change. PART 944_FRUITS; IMPORT REGULATIONS 3. Accordingly, the interim final rule amending the provisions of ยง944.401, which was published in the September 17, 1993, Federal Register [58 FR 48595], is adopted as a final rule without change.
