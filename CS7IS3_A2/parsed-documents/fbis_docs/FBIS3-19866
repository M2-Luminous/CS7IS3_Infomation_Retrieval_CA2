Piacenza is still drowsing, wreathed in a veil of mist. Mino Martinazzoli steps down from the sleeping car that has brought him up from Puglia and vanishes into a hotel. He begins the day's first election rally. He accuses [Achille] Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] of being "a Dr. Strangelove." The RAI [Italian Radio and Television]: "It is no good their inviting us to an extra debate to make up for all the time that they have taken away from us. What they ought to do is show us what happens in the wings, where the third-rate showmen who fawn on us from the right and left put on their silk stockings and plaster themselves with greasepaint. That way, everyone would realize that it is all a show." He has it in for the PDS again: "If what they call new is a throwback to [former communist party leader] Togliatti-style duplicity, I am becoming a reactionary. The new is on the way, and by that I mean way out." To Don Dossetti, who called on Catholics to subject themselves to a bit of purgatory, he replies: "We already have done so, while others are selling false paradises." The audience (not a very large one at this time of the morning) wakes up and claps. He goes on: A blow to the Left and a blow to the Right. "Occhetto? He has been to London and has elevated Gramsci and Trotsky to the ranks of liberal-democratic thinkers." [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi? "Those who are quick to promote their own interests are usually not so good at promoting other people's." What is more: "You get three for the price of one vote: Berlusconi, [Northern League Secretary Umberto] Bossi, and [National Alliance leader Giafranco] Fini. Berlusconi holds their hands, while they kick each other in the shins." The Mammi Act [on media ownership]? "The regulation of a sector like broadcasting is a matter of freedom. A public service in the true sense is a must, as is real pluralism on the private front." Bossi? "I have known lots like him in the taverns of Lombardy. Fun, but only there, in the taverns...." Fini? "I would buy an ice cream from him, but nothing more." [Correspondent] What is it like, Senator Martinazzoli, at the center? In Rome they would say in the middle, as in "caught in the middle...." [Martinazzoli] And they would be wrong... [Correspondent] Mrs. Thatcher's adviser, the one who "updated" Macchiavelli's The Prince, said that those in the center get knocked down. [Martinazzoli] Yes, if we are talking about the center of the road... [Correspondent] But? [Martinazzoli] But the center is a political point of view. It is not a matter of geography, but of ideals. [Correspondent] According to MSI [Italian Social Movement] Secretary Fini, you are utterly failing to get into the game. You are at the center of a tennis court, watching the ball bounce backward and forward. [Martinazzoli] What I really see is people battering one another over the head with their rackets, both on the Right and on the Left. Bossi versus Berlusconi. Occhetto versus [Communist Renewal leader] Bertinotti. Just what sort of a game is this? [Correspondent] There you are, you see: You want to umpire the game. [Martinazzoli] No, all I ask is a bit of reasonableness. I am offering the Italians a serious pact. [Correspondent] In a match played by others? [Martinazzoli] No, in a match played by us as well. This is not a two-man race. It is like a cycling race. There will be candidates who will be voted in by just one vote, and the idea that there are those who have already won is simply grotesque. So I am calling for votes for the center. To win. [Correspondent] Is that not an overambitious goal? [Martinazzoli] Not at all. We are gaining ground. [Correspondent] Is the center running to win? [Martinazzoli] Why else should it be running? [Correspondent] However, the opinion polls show you struggling. [Martinazzoli] Claiming that our disappearance is inevitable, almost as if we had no right to be around, is a tactic devised to further the designs of the Right and the Left. [Correspondent] To put it in a nutshell, you deny that a vote for the center would be a wasted vote, as Berlusconi and Fini are claiming? [Martinazzoli] If I remember rightly, Fini lost against [Rome Mayor] Rutelli.... [Correspondent] What do you mean by that? [Martinazzoli] I should merely like to remind moderate Italians that the reason why the Left won the last local elections was that the center had been bombed, and its opponent was this highly radical Right. [Correspondent] But now there is Berlusconi as well. [Martinazzoli] This, in my opinion, merely aggravates the phenomenon, because Berlusconi's major contribution has been a thorough application of mass psychology. What you do is proclaim yourself the winner, invent a string of opinion polls predicting a landslide victory, and call on gamblers to bet on you, thus guaranteeing victory. But what do you win? Without political consistency, I fail to see what moral consistency success can have. [Correspondent] Is this the reason why you did not side with Bossi and Berlusconi? [Martinazzoli] The proposal that they made us for merging with their alliance was that we should disappear, no more and no less. It was an unacceptable option. [Correspondent] Nevertheless, you have said that you are now watching the League with interest, explaining that it is "at a crossroads." [Martinazzoli] Yes, it strikes me that it has reached a critical point of transition, that its strategic weakness is now emerging. Bossi could not keep the protest vote unless he could hold out a chance of entering government, which is why he sided with Berlusconi. But now he does not know how to explain to his supporters (who are tradespeople, manual workers, and small farmers) what they have in common with this capitalist. That is why he attacks him. It is an ambiguous position that, in my view, is worth watching. [Correspondent] Do you mean that you are watching this side more than the other, expecting changes? [Martinazzoli] Yes, I believe there could be developments on this front. More so than on others. [Correspondent] [Pact for Italy member] Valerio Zanone has identified the League, AD [Democratic Alliance], and some fringes of Forza Italia as potential associates for the center in the event of no party winning outright and alliances having to be sought. Do you agree? [Martinazzoli] Yes, although talk of this type tends to become excessively vague. If there is no outright winner, we must work out what the electorate was calling for with its vote. However, we shall definitely never enter into alliances with the Rete, the MSI, or Communist Renewal. [Correspondent] But when you reject a government of "technicians," are you also rejecting the Ciampi hypothesis of an institutional, or caretaker government? [Martinazzoli] I simply refuse to join in this pointless juggling with names. Apart from anything else it is unpleasant.... [Correspondent] What is? [Martinazzoli] That Ciampi's name should be taken in vain by the very people who never did anything to help him over recent months, and by that I mean the Left. We were the strength of the Ciampi government. As to the rest, my position concerns the limitations of "technical" governments in general. Politics must be brought back onto the field. [Correspondent] It might be pointed out that Italy has had quite enough of incompetent politicians appointed ministers just because they were the leaders of this or that wing of a party. [Martinazzoli] But you would have to be stone deaf to give what I said that meaning. I am not calling for a reversion to the old ways of conducting politics. What I want is to put authoritativeness back in politics. Because technical competence is not neutral. [Correspondent] Which do you fear most: a victory for the Right or for the Left? [Martinazzoli] In both cases, not I, but the Italians, ought to fear something. There is nothing reassuring in those camps. With their unrealistic promises, which they are not in a position to keep, Right and Left are the two sides of the same coin. [Correspondent] And are you equidistant from both? [Martinazzoli] I have already said that if I win I shall govern, and if not I shall go into opposition. [Correspondent] And if nobody wins? [Martinazzoli] I repeat: We shall have to work out what the electorate is demanding of us. As to the allegation that we are the Trojan horse of the Left, my answer is: Stop pestering me with this nonsense. That is not the way it is. If the Left has been kept out of government in this country, the merit is ours, not anybody else's. [Correspondent] Do you regret passing the law adopting this electoral system? [Martinazzoli] It was the only one possible. We are not its only progenitors. It was the...least common denominator. [Correspondent] There is talk of changing it, perhaps turning it into a two-tier system. [Martinazzoli] I have no hesitation about saying that it should be corrected if possible. [Correspondent] How? [Martinazzoli] Moving toward a two-tier system; not the one with a second ballot. That way they will no longer be able to say that the center is against alternation. The center is against a crazy, deceitful idea of alternation. [Correspondent] Who is it that is lying? [Martinazzoli] Those who appeal for votes from the center and then retreat into their right-wing or left-wing strongholds, doing deals with their extremist fringes. [Correspondent] But if all this had not happened, where would the Popular Party be? On the Right or on the Left? [Martinazzoli] As far as I am concerned, the answer would be easy. I am not a man of the left. Be that as it may, the party would have had to reflect on this scenario. [Correspondent] Does Catholic unity in politics still have any meaning? [Martinazzoli] What I defend is a tradition, values. I force no one. Of course, I would not want Catholics to take up arms to defend somebody else's values. [Correspondent] Do you agree with [Interior Minister] Mancino on the Mafia vote? [Martinazzoli] I do not know what information Mancino has. All I know is that the Mafia will certainly not be voting for us. [Correspondent] Who will be the next secretary of the Popular Party? [Martinazzoli] I do not know. As far as I am concerned, if I succeed in upholding the future of our tradition in this difficult moment of transition, I shall be content. I shall have done my bit. [Correspondent] So you confirm that you will not be running for the party leadership again? [Martinazzoli] Precisely. [Correspondent] Do you have a favorite of your own for the succession? [Martinazzoli] No. [Correspondent] Not even a short list? [Martinazzoli] Neither a short list nor a Rosy [Bindi].
