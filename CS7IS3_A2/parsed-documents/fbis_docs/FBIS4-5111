The repatriation concerns the interests of South and North Korea as well as Russia, making the issue a difficult one to resolve, said the radio, monitored here by NAEWOE press. Some 60,000 Koreans were taken to Sakhalin during World War II when Korea was under Japanese colonial rule, and about 4,000 first-generation members remain, according to Radio Moscow. More than expected said they wanted to return to Korea in a recent poll, apparently attracted by their mother country's economic growth and living standards, it reported. Seoul insists that Tokyo is responsible for bringing them back to Korea since the majority were taken forcibly by the Japanese military to work at labor camps. But many descendants of Koreans in Sakhalin have settled down with stable careers and Seoul officials predict the Russian Government would be unwilling to let them go.
