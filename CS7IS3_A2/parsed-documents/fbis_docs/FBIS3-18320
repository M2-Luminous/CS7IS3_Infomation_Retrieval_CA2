One precondition, however, is that the East European reformist state creates the necessary economic conditions for it, Kohl said on Tuesday [1 March] after a meeting with Boross in Bonn. In return, Germany is ready to provide help for self-help. The FRG is by far Hungary's most important trading partner, with an almost 30-percent share in exports and imports. In April, the federal chancellor is planning a visit to the Hungarian capital Budapest following an invitation by Boross. Kohl once more pointed to the opening of Hungary's borders, which meant freedom for thousands of GDR [German Democratic Republic] citizens in the summer of 1989. This is a particularly important chapter in the long history of German-Hungarian relations that will never be forgotten, Kohl said. Boross expressed his thanks for the FRG's readiness to help in the difficult process of political and economic transformation of his former socialist country. He emphasized Hungary's desire to become a full member in the European Union as well as NATO as soon as possible. He was optimistic that this would soon be the case as far as the OECD is concerned, Boross said. During his one-day visit, Boross signed a German-Hungarian culture agreement. In the afternoon, talks were planned with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of the Free Democratic Party of Germany, and with representatives of the German economy.
