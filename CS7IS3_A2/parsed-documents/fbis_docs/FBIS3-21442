Upreti: "Khurana Government Has Many Handicaps"] [Text] After over 100 years since Mughal rule ended, the Bharatiya Janata Party's [BJP] first empire in Delhi shows an ironic resemblance to the reign of the last Mughal King who had the high-sounding title of Badshah without any effective power. BJP chieftain Madan Lal Khurana is finding it hard to have his say in the affairs of the capital city under the dominant presence of the Congress under Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao. With a truncated statehood under his arm, the Chief Minister's announcements are evoking amusing responses from his Congress rivals. His recent threat to cut off water to VIPs [very important persons], including Union ministers, in the wake of a water crisis in Delhi, illustrates the queer status of Delhi's Chief Minister. The dispute on the sharing of Yamuna waters between Haryana and Delhi has been used by the Haryana Chief Minister to bully the newly-stalled BJP Government in Delhi. The decision of Mr. Bhajan Lal to stop water supply to the Haiderpur water treatment plant in Delhi despite last month's agreement had placed Mr. Khurana at the mercy of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, who in all such cases happens to be the final arbitrator. The Haryana Government's action had reduced the daily supply of water to the capital by 25 mgd [million gallons per day], severely affecting parts of the city. Notwithstanding Central assurance, the Haryana Chief Minister has kept cocking a snook at his counterpart in Delhi. Well aware of the Delhi Government's status vis-a-vis other State Governments, the Congress leaders were only too amused with Mr. Khurana's threat to cut off water supply to VIP areas, prompting Delhi Congress Pradesh Committee chief H.K.L. Bhagat to describe the threat as "childish." The toothless Khurana Government, which was elected by an overwhelming mandate last year, finds itself caught in a cleft. The limited powers of the 70-member Delhi State Assembly would not permit the BJP to implement the promises it had made to its supporters in the capital and yet it remains vulnerable to their criticism for its apparent non-performance. The constitution of the Assembly excludes it from having any jursidiction over land and land use, law and order and allows full Central control over financial matters. Subjects related to the land are of vital importance in relation to the planned development of the metropolis but the powers of making any change in the status quo in land relations are largely vested in the Union Urban Housing and Development Ministry. Similarly, in the case of surface transport, law and order and other major subjects, the Central Government still occupies the driver's seat and retains the relevant powers which would be required by the BJP Government to bring about any meaningful improvement in the lot of about 93 lakh inhabitants of Delhi. The megacity, which has the highest suspended pollution in the world and is virtually crammed with over 30 lakhs vehicles, requires major legislative changes to streamline the vehicular traffic and restrict the rising rate of pollution. The short-lived populist moves in the past, including that of Ms. Maneka Gandhi, former Union Environment Minister, to check vehicular pollution had evoked more ire than applause from Delhites. The political power attained by the BJP has, so far, allowed it to implement only those key promises which were also bandied about by its rival political parties, including the Congress. The regularisation of 600 jhuggi-jhopri clusters which existed before March 1993, has, thus, come on the top of BJP's agenda and is likely to find a smooth passage in the Assembly. Apart from taking small steps towards the development of Delhi which includes making roads better by removing encroachments, improving streetlights and cleaning right the abysmally bad lavatories, the Khurana Government has made its first major political move to book the culprits of the November 1984, Sikh riots in Delhi. The nine-member panel constituted by the BJP Government has recently indicted over 70 persons, including Congress leaders like Sajjan Kumar and Mr. Bhagat. The panel with Mr. Justice (Retd) R.S. Narula at its head has accused the Home Ministry of not responding to the CBI's [Central Bureau of Investigation] application to file a charge-sheet against Mr. Sajjan Kumar since 1992. However, the recommendations of the panel, which had Lt-Gen. (Retd) Jasgit Singh Aurura and academician, Dr. Mahip Singh, as its members, are unlikely to carry much weight with the Central Government. It may be noted that even the recommendations of the Jain-Aggarwal Committee, which was appointed by the Union Government itself, have not been implemented. The twin status of Delhi has all the elements which could create more complications than resolve them. The partial status of statehood and overlapping jurisdiction of Centre and State is sure to stoke the fires of political controversy in the coming months. The Delhi State BJP currently busy in the selection of the candidates for the municipal elections will, however, have relatively more freedom to function in the local body if it manages to get as big a majority as it did in the Assembly elections. A pitched battle is on the cards for the municipal elections as Mr. Bhagat, the Congress supremo in Delhi, is making a last ditch effort to re-establish himself and gain the political ground which he had lost in the Assembly elections.
