And a senior source in the human rights movement has indicated China may release famous dissident Ren Wanding in the near future. In meetings officials in the Justice Ministry earlier this week, Mr Kamm was given information concerning the whereabouts of 10 little-known detainees. "The judicial authorities were willing to give a systematic account of a number of prisoners of conscience I raised with them, including age, sex, occupation, health conditions and their attitude in prison," Mr Kamm said in Hong Kong yesterday. "This is an encouraging development." For example, the lobbyist was told that Zhai Decheng, sentenced in 1983 to 15 years, escaped after 10 months in jail. Zhai (sometimes known as Cai), a worker who was detained for putting up "counter-revolutionary posters", escaped from Kaifeng Prison in Henan province in October 1984 and has not been recaptured. Qi Dafeng, a former graduate student who is serving two Years in a re education through labour camps for meeting America-based student dissident Shen Tong in late 1992, has had his sentence extended by three months. Qi, originally due for release this year, was criticised by judicial officials for "refusing to submit to discipline," Mr Kamm said. Details of the conditions of Yu Dongyue, Kajikhumar Shabdan and Jampel Changchup were also given. Yu, 29, is serving a life sentence in Hunan No. 1 prison for spilling ink on Chairman Mao's portrait in Tiananmen Square. Shabdan, 71, a Kazakh was detained in 1987 for alleged espionage. He was given a 15-year term to be served in Urumqi No. 1 Prison. And Tibetan Changchup, 33, is serving a 19-year term in the Lhasa Prison, also for espionage. Mr Kamm said he was told the number of jailed "counter-revolutionaries" in China was 2,935 at the end of March, compared with 3,036 at the end of 1993. He said Chinese officials were aware that while President Bill Clinton had delinked human rights from trade, "that's not the same as saying that the human rights issue has been resolved". Meanwhile, a source in the human rights crusade said yesterday he was given hints by officials that dissident intellectual Ren, sentenced to seven years in prison in 1991, might be paroled later this year. "I was told that Ren's behaviour in jail is good and that he has followed the rules and regulations," he said. The source said, however, he was less optimistic about former senior official Bao Tong, the principal secretary of ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang. Western government have been pressing Beijing to grant "medical bail" to Bao, who is serving a seven year term. "The authorities do not dispute that Bao is ill," the source added. "But they claim they do not think he can receive better medical treatment out side prison.
