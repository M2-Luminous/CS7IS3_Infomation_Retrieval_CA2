The Ukrainian first deputy minister for external economic relations, Mikhail Reznik, said the trade between the two countries did not as yet correspond to the economic potential of the two countries. "The documents signed will make it easier for entrepreneurs to make trade contacts, and this will definitely show up in the volume of trade," he said. More than 50 per cent of Ukrainian goods came to Slovakia via a third country, Reznik commented. Last year the trade turnover between Slovakia and the Ukraine amounted to $280 million, which is more or less the level of previous years, Reznik said. Ukraine wants to continue importing iron ore to Slovakia, and also sees a market for its chemical industry. From Slovakia it wants to import consumer goods. The number of Ukrainian-Slovak joint enterprises is around 120, Reznik said. Cooperation will be increased in the fields of engineering, the manufacture of vans and lorries, the mining and arms industries and agrocomplexes.
