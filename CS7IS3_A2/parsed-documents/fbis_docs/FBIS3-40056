Reform must develop China's productive forces to increase the overall national might of our country, which is a socialist country, not any other kind. Forgetting this point would lead our reform astray. For a time now, some have been setting forth the so-called "party-government integration" political reform view, wantonly publicizing it in the press, beginning to practice it in some regions, and regarding it as a successful reform experience for dissemination and introduction. Its great impact and rapid spread merit much attention. "The integration of the party with the government" means integration all the way from the center to provinces, cities, and townships in one version, and integration of the party and government within enterprises in another. The first version is detailed as: "The so-called merging of the party and government into one refers to merging party and government organs where certain functions are identical or similar, to reduce operating links and staffs, and basically achieve a single organization flying two flags, with one capable hand taking on the two jobs of the party committee and the government." This plan says that "as every administrative level from the center to provinces, cities, and townships has the two huge governing organs of the party committee and the government," they must all be merged into one. The second version is detailed as: "This mechanism has four features: 1) It makes staffmember duties consistent, with overlapping party and government jobs, and dual responsibilities for dual posts; 2) It integrates the organizational leadership structure, forming two separate leading bodies into one integrated group in charge of both economic and party work; 3) It consolidates the organizational structure, dissolving and merging administrative offices with similar functions into a single track; 4) It unifies work goals, using systems such as joint party-government meetings and responsibility zones to coordinate party and government work." These two positions both violate the party central committee spirit on political reform. The party constitution passed by the 14th CPC Congress points out that "the party's grass-roots organs are its combat fortress in primary social organization, as well as the foundation for all of its work and combat effectiveness." Can this "foundation" be merged with administrative organs? And if it is, will the party still be combat effective? Comrade Deng Xiaoping notes that: "The substance of political reform needs deliberation. I believe that political reform should be aimed at stimulating public initiative to raise efficiency and overcome bureaucracy. The substance of reform is primarily to separate the party from the government, with the key being to resolve the matter of how the party should lead and be adept at leadership." So can "party-government merger" replace separating the party from the government as the particular key to political reform, to become our reform direction? Just take a look at Comrade Jiang Zemin's opinion: "To deal correctly with party-government relations within enterprises, we need to bring the crucial political role of the enterprise party organization into full play, while ensuring the effective application of the factory director responsibility system. Leading party and government personnel can have appropriately overlapping jobs, and qualified enterprises can have one person concurrently holding the key party and government posts. But we need to intensify our political and ideological work to bring the role of grass-roots party organs into full play, by teaching professional ethics to the vast numbers of party members and employees, advocating a spirit of contribution, strengthening the sense of responsibility of the working class as the master of its own fate, and firmly opposing money worship, hedonism, and extreme individualism, in an attempt to build a corps of employees that can unite in struggle in the midst of market competition." (From a speech on 24 August 1993 at a conference of some large and midsize enterprises from the north and northeast regions) This speech indicates that while party and government leaders can be appropriately overlapping, and key party and government posts can also be held concurrently by one person, enterprises must bring the key political role of party branches into full play, with enterprise party branches having the major responsibility for ideological and political work among the vast numbers of employees. So enterprise grass-roots party organs must not be dissolved and merged with administrative organs, making "party-government integration" impossible. The argument that party and government organs need to be merged all the way from the center to provinces, prefectures, counties, and townships--advocating the merger of leading organs with those that are led, the CPC Central Committee with the State Council, all provincial party committees with people's provincial governments, prefectural party committees with prefectural commissioner's offices, and county party committees with county people's governments--stands essentially for dissolving the party into the government, and substituting the government for the party, to completely change China's political system. While the separation of the party from the government is in order to ensure that party committees at all levels focus their energies mainly on keeping close ties to the masses, by studying new situations and issues to better implement the party's line, principles, and policies, and in order to improve and strengthen party leadership, "party-government integration" dissolves the party into the administration (which is so even though the sign party committee still hangs over the doorway), thus downplaying and even eliminating the leadership of the party. Some time back, the press criticized the fallacy of "political pluralism." While this so-called "political pluralism" denies the leadership status of the CPC, holding that all political parties in China can become ruling parties, by assuming power and ruling in turn just like in the various European and American countries, the current "party-government integration" is even worse than "political pluralism," dimming even the very name of the Communist Party itself. If the CPC could not speak in the just and honorable name of the CPC, but had to speak jointly with administrative organs, what would be left of it! The practice of "party-government integration" within enterprises, by eliminating grass-roots party organs, would leave the party hanging in midair, severely divorcing it from the masses and ultimately resulting in its demise. Early in Comrade Zhao Ziyang's tenure as general secretary, he used the pretext of thoroughly practicing the factory director responsibility system to issue documents weakening the key political role of enterprise party organizations, severely undermining the combat effectiveness of grass-roots party organs. The stand for "party-government integration" within enterprises would similarly weaken the key political role of enterprise party organs. As to the huge role of grass-roots party organs, as far back as November 1928, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in an article entitled "Jinggang Mountains Struggle" that "a key factor in the Red Army's brave fight instead of defeat and dispersion were the company party branches." These "company party branches" ensured the absolute leadership of the party over the army, becoming the heart of the company, enforcing party orders, sharing weal and woe with the rank and file, and having a common destiny, to ensure combat victory. This was the origin of the post-Liberation establishment of party branches in enterprise shops or teams and groups. This is a very effective organizational establishment that has stood a longstanding test of practice. It is only when shops or teams and groups have party branches that they can have a leadership center and guiding organization to keep direct and widespread ties to the masses, by transmitting to the masses the party's principles and policies, without which they would turn into a loose sheet of sand, or even be controlled by unhealthy trends and evil practices. It is only the party branches that bring the unity to complete production tasks, make the situation at the lower levels known to the higher levels in a timely way, and inculcate and standardize the words and deeds of every party member, so that they can play the role of advanced models, understand and teach the surrounding masses, and attract advanced elements from the masses into the party ranks, to strengthen party might. Liu Shaoqi pointed out in "On the Party" that: "As party branches are the party's working units among the masses, as well as its bridge linking leadership organs with the masses, they must closely connect the masses with the party's leading organs." From the perspective of leadership work, this "bridge" is absolutely indispensable, as a party with only leadership organs but no party branches would be inconceivable. A party without a sound grass-roots organization, just like water without a source or a tree without roots, would eliminate both the regular ties to the masses, as well as work among the masses, so could not exist. Saying that enterprise party organizations must play a key political role demonstrates precisely their irreplaceable impact. While enterprises are production and economic organizations, not political ones, they absolutely cannot be divorced from politics. In China, while state and collective enterprises must strictly submit to socialist political demands, private, Sino-foreign joint-venture, and individual enterprises also cannot violate basic socialist interests, which is the politics of enterprise. It is absolutely wrong to think that a socialist market economy can deemphasize politics and does not need political indoctrination. While those who promote bourgeois liberalization say that it is unnecessary to emphasize politics so much, they actually do all they can to promote bourgeois politics and eliminate proletarian politics. So who ensures the realization of proletarian political objectives? It is only enterprise party branches, as this is their major responsibility. As enterprise administrative organs are heavily burdened with production tasks, they have very little energy to devote to this. The party committee secretary at the Beijing Internal Combustion Engine Plant says that: "If I was now forced to carry all of the weight [of party and government duties] on my shoulders alone, I would be exerting 99 percent of my energy on business, leaving only 1 percent for party building. As I have been a party committee secretary for so many years, I am still tied to the line of thinking that I ought to be strengthening the party establishment." Such straight-from-the-heart talk provides much food for thought. The key grounds of those who advocate "party-government integration" is that it will raise work efficiency, an argument which is very one-sided. Higher work efficiency depends on many factors, mainly increased personnel initiative, not "party-government integration." While enterprises must of course focus on economic development, this focus needs political guarantees. An economy without political guarantees can hardly adhere to a socialist orientation, to strictly enforce party principles and policies. In particular operations, while enterprise party and administrative organs must both emphasize business, they each have their particular slant, substance, and style, which are not interchangeable. It is only when both parties display their strengths that they can fully arouse the initiative of talented personnel in all areas to jointly push forwrad with enterprise economic development. Merging the party with the government would "meld" the method of diversified channels and substance into a dependence mainly on administrative means, sharply weakening political and ideological work, not helping to stimulate initiative, and even leading people astray into money worship. As "party-government integration" centralizes power, it easily leads to the patriarchal system in which one person alone has the say, weakening the party's democratic centralism. While some use the pretext that enterprise party and government leaders are often subject to "internal waste" (dissenting work views) as a stand for "party-government integration," except for unprincipled disputes, differing work views is actually a normal thing, which is similarly unavoidable under "party-government integration." While "one person laying down the law" involves no "internal waste," it is also undemocratic. Unprincipled disputes need to be settled with the criticism and self-criticism style, not being in the category of political reform. "Party-government integration" loses the force of mutual restraint between the party and government, making it hard for administrative organs to exercise self-control, and engendering corruption. As "party-government integration" often leads to factory directors having the say, it also abets rule by man, being adverse to the establishment of rule by law. Theoretically, "party-government integration" is also wrong. A political party is a class organization, representing class interests, which is the case in all contemporary social systems. So the CPC is a Chinese proletarian organization, representing the interests of the Chinese working class and all working people. The Chinese regime is a people's democratic dictatorship organization, in which all democratic parties that support the CPC can take part in organizations of political power. Enterprises are economic organizations under the leadership of the state. As the Communist Party, state power, and domestic economic organizations differ completely in nature, they cannot be merged. Merging them would mean eliminating the leadership of the proletariat over the state represented by the party, which would basically violate our constitutional provisions, as well as China's political reform directions and principles. In short, the "party-government integration" view is hardly tenable!
