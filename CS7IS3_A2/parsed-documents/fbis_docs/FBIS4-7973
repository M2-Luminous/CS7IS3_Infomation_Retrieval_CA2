Any excuse suffices for the president to dissolve the present parliament, the leader of the Confederation for an Independent Poland [KPN], Leszek Moczulski, maintained in an interview with a SLOWO POLSKIE journalist on 8 April. According to him, the "KPN parliamentary floor group as well as several other political groupings in the Sejm are capable of providing the president with such an excuse when the time is right for them." Moczulski is also of the opinion that a breakup of the governing coalition is unavoidable. Should it happen, it will be difficult to establish a majority in the present Sejm. The KPN leader warns that Poland is facing events similar to those of 1980. According to him, none of the problems put forward "so forcefully" then have ever been resolved. "If society realizes now that the confidence placed in all corners of the political scene, apart from the Confederation, has been ill-placed and that it has been let down, we are going to have events similar to those in August [1980]," Moczulski maintains.
