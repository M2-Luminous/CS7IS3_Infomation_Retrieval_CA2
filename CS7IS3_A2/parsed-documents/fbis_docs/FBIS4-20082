In other words, she has imposed an effective "embargo" on north Cyprus.... However, not satisfied with that, she conveyed a message with Minister of State Mehmet Ali Yilmaz to the effect that she "will solve the problem. Therefore, Rauf Denktas must not create any difficulty." "Two separate lobbies" have been established in Turkey on the subject of Cyprus. A very high-ranking official has jokingly said the following: "A U.S. lobby and a Turkish lobby exist in Ankara on the Cyprus problem.... President Clinton and Prime Minister Ciller make up the U.S. lobby and President Suleyman Demirel, Speaker of Parliament Husamettin Cindoruk, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, and the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] Government make up the Turkish lobby!" Two opposing groups have confronted each other in the full meaning of the word at the present time.... The promise Prime Minister Ciller made to President Clinton in the United States last week to the effect that she will resolve the Cyprus problem and the statement President Clinton made later to the effect that "Ciller has promised that an important development will take place in a few days" have created a turmoil in Ankara. A TRNC parliamentary delegation accompanied by Husamettin Cindoruk called on President Demirel at about the time when Ankara was informed on President Clinton's statement. The delegation arrived in Ankara to hold contacts "within the framework of the parliament but not with the government." The arrival of the TRNC delegation on the eve of a possible development on the Cyprus problem brought to light the existing rift in Ankara. General Session on Cyprus To Be Held Earlier The Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] decided to hold a general session on Cyprus some time ago. A decision was made a few weeks ago to hold the convocation on 3 May. A general session would be held on that day on Cyprus... However, Ciller's visit to the United States and the differing views in Ankara prompted the TGNA to change that date. A decision was made to hold it on Tuesday, 26 April. The Cyprus problem suddenly became the focus of attention in domestic politics and the difference of views in the higher echelons of the administration came to light. According to the information the TRNC parliamentary delegation has conveyed to President Demirel and Husamettin Cindoruk, "Turkey suspended its financial aid to north Cyprus during the past few months." "A serious financial crisis exists in north Cyprus" because Ciller has suspended Turkey's financial aid. The TRNC Administration is unable to pay its employees. Although Ciller was informed of the situation a few times, she responded by informing the TRNC Administration that Turkey's aid will be "conditional." And, the condition she put forward was as follows: "The transfer of any kind of financial aid will be impossible until a political solution is found to solve the problem." Turkey's annual aid to north Cyprus has totaled $50 million or $60 million so far. That amount was automatically transferred to the TRNC. However, it was suspended in 1994 in accordance with Ciller's instructions. That state of affairs has placed the TRNC in a difficult situation. Tense Relations Between Ciller and Cetin Ciller refused the requests the TRNC conveyed to Ankara several times for the resumption of Turkey's financial aid. Consequently, the TRNC Administration became inclined to "replace the Turkish currency, which is used in north Cyprus, with either the U.S. or the British monetary units." The TRNC Administration is studying the question of which monetary unit it should adopt at the present time. The TRNC delegation briefed President Demirel on the situation in detail yesterday. It has been reported that Demirel and Cindoruk assured the visiting delegation as follows: "Do not worry. Excluding Rauf Denktas is impossible. Solving the problem without Denktas is out of the question." It has also been reported that Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin shared Demirel's and Cindoruk's views.... According to very high-ranking sources, "a difference of opinion exists between Ciller and Cetin on the matters related to the TRNC." In fact, it has been claimed that "Ciller and Cetin have not been on speaking terms because of the tense situation between them for some time now. It has also been said that Demirel is trying to mediate to remove the tension between the two officials, that Cetin informs Demirel instead of Ciller on government affairs, and that Demirel later transfers the information he receives from Cetin to Ciller." All that indicates that Ciller has made a promise to President Clinton "without consulting with anyone in Ankara." Nevertheless, the question as to what extent her promise can be fulfilled was unclear right from the beginning. What is crystal clear, however, is the fact that the officials in Ankara have clashed on the Cyprus problem and that a deep difference of views exists among them....
