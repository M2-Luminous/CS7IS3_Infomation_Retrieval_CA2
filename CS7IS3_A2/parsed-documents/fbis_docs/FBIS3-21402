However, in an interview with AL-HAYAH, he explained that the Palestinian economy is tied in with the Israeli economy, and they cannot be separated at the present time. The hope is that the Palestinian economy will become an independent economy in the future. Al-Natshah said that Arab economic unity would be encouraged and not Middle Eastern economic unity, because that would include Israel and other countries. He mentioned that world trade and industrial delegations have visited the West Bank and Gaza Strip to study future investment opportunities in the autonomous areas. "However, we would prefer future investments to be Arab." He added that the initial numbers indicate that the size of investment in the autonomous areas would reach $10 billion. He explained that this figure is not large, in view of the fact that there is a need for 800,000 housing units in the Gaza Strip and, possibly, the demand in the West Bank may reach more than 100,000. With this amount of work, activity will open up in about 30 professions and will provide jobs for all those out of work. Regarding the nature of the investment laws that Arab investors will be dealing with and whether they will be Palestinian or Israeli, al-Natshah said: "When autonomy is applied, Israel will have no connection with these investments. Laws will be subject to the Palestinian autonomous government." As to the role of the anticipated normalization process between the Arab nations and Israel, in places where there are Arab-Israeli investment agreements coinciding with Arab-Palestinian agreements, he said that the Palestinian people are not unanimously agreed regarding the autonomy agreement. "I am one of those who oppose it, but autonomy will be applied because it was imposed by the United States. Ideologically, I would not encourage any form of normalization, because the Jews dream of reaching all Arab countries on the backs of the Palestinian people." He said that, at the present time, the Palestinian people suffer from economic pressure because the Israeli authorities have imposed a security cordon around the West Bank and Gaza Strip since last March, referring to the fact that before work started on this measure, there were 250,000 Palestinians working in Israel, including 120,000 who used to work legally. He explained that Palestinian citizens from the West Bank and Gaza Strip could only enter Israel with a permit, "but permits have only been granted to 35,000 workers so far. This means that there are about 21,000 workers who are mostly unemployed." Al-Natshah said that industry in Hebron constitutes about 50 percent of West Bank industry, which includes, for example, the shoe industry. In addition, 90 percent of West Bank production is in building stone, ceramics, glass, and canned food. "We expect to give future incentives for the export of products to Arab nations, since exporting at present is limited to a very few products to Jordan. We used to export to certain Arab Gulf states." Al-Natshah advised that Israeli officials have rejected a request submitted by a group of businessmen in the West Bank to provide them with a license to open an Islamic Palestinian bank, capitalized at $10 million. He added: "We hope that the Palestinian government will agree to open this bank, since the Cairo-Amman Bank is now subject to the Jordanian Central Bank, as well as the Israeli Central Bank. The Bank of Palestine is subject to the Israeli Central Bank." He pointed out that the Federation of Palestinian Chambers of Commerce is made up of 13 Chambers of Commerce, which meet periodically. He said that the population of Hebron totals 300,000, with some 3,000 merchants participating in the Chamber of Commerce.
