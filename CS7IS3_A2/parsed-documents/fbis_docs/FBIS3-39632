The new applicant countries are expected to be net contributors to the EU's joint coffers, and this will give the applicant countries a good card to play in the final phase of the negotiations. As yet Norway has not offered the EU any particular sum, and this will be one of the last areas that will be resolved. On the basis of the rules that exist today for the calculation of membership contributions, Norway's gross contribution will probably be around 8.5 billion kroner per year. EU cooperation is financed through various taxes, import duties, a percentage of value-added tax, and an element proportionate to countries' GNP. In the past the government has estimated Norway's gross contribution at around 7 million kroner. Compensating for price rises in the intervening period, this sum will now be somewhere in the region of 8.5 billion kroner. However, Norway's net contribution will be much less. This is because Norway will get back money from the EU system in the form of regional support and agricultural support. It is difficult to determine exactly how much this will be, because these central elements in the negotiations have not been resolved as yet. As a result no one knows the exact effect on the figures the outcome of the negotiations will have. The fact that Spain now wants more money from the applicant countries for its own regions and the poorer areas of the EU is being viewed by the Norwegian side as yet another illustration of the fact that Spain is the most difficult country to deal with. But people are hoping that the other member countries will succeed in disciplining Spain in the final phase. The trump card in the negotiations is the same "membership money," which Spain wants more of. The argument runs that if Spain behaves in such a way that the negotiations break down there will not be any money either for Spain or the EU.
