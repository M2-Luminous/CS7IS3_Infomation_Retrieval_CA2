The first incident broke out when three Tuaregs tried to seize a land cruiser near the central mosque. One of the bandits, caught by the crowd, was stoned and later burned while one of the remaining two was killed in an exchange of fire as he tried to run away. A few hours later, several men belonging to the Tuareg community attacked the hospital, killing three civilians and wounding an undetermined number of people. Also, on the night of 13 May, some Tuaregs threw grenade canisters into a house in Gao, killing one woman and injuring one child, the same source added. These incidents come at a time when representatives of the Malian Government and the Unified Movement and Front of Azaouad (MFUA, former Tuareg rebels) have been meeting since 10 May in Algeria to work out measures that are likely to bring an end to the violence in northern Mali.
