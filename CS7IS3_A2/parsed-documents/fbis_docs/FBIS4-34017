The president made this remark after studying the letter that the Chilean Foreign Ministry sent to Mercosur's Pro-Tempore Secretariat, in which it officially requests admission to the group consisting of the four River Plate nations. The Paraguayan position is that Chile must adapt itself to the demands that will arise when it becomes a full-fledged member of Mercosur. The Chilean document requests an outline of the obligations it will have to comply with, but also gives to understand that it is not willing to comply with them. The document, which is signed by the Chilean foreign minister, indicates that its admission will be accomplished through bilateral tariff protocols to be signed with each Mercosur member. These protocols presumably contain implementation regulations responding to the conditions and intents specified in bilateral relations, to be accomplished within a certain period of time. It is precisely Chile, though, that will be setting this period of time, as well as the number of years that cannot be exceeded. All of these demands are practically unacceptable to Paraguay, and therefore, according to official sources, Chile's possible admission to Mercosur must be very carefully studied. On 13 June Wasmosy also confirmed that Paraguay will abstain from voting in the hypothetical case that the economic embargo against Cuba comes up for discussion. The president announced this position, but did not explain why. Wasmosy also indicated that he does not agree with the military intervention in Haiti being considered by the United States, indicating that this would be his government's position if a decision has to be taken on the subject.
