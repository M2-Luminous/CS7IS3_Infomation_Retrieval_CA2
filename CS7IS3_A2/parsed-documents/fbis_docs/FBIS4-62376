All suspicions and rash accusations that the government is prepared to abandon the policy of financial stabilization under pressure from sectoral and regional lobbyists are refuted by dry figures. We propose that the federal budget deficit will amount to 68.8 trillion rubles [R] this year and that it will not exceed 9.5 percent of GDP. At the same time the expenditure part of the budget is increasing by R10.1 trillion -- which, in toto, will give R193.3 trillion. The increase in revenue will be a more modest R3.7 trillion -- which, in the final analysis, will amount to R124 trillion. These key indicators speak for themselves. Whether we will manage to consolidate our hold on these positions and not blow the budget to pieces with new "expenditure" decisions is another matter. But the draft's discussion in the State Duma and the assistance given us by deputies in the course of its correction make me confident that we have managed to arrange businesslike cooperation and work fruitfully on common problems. Of course, it is impossible to reach a consensus that satisfies everyone without a search for sensible compromise solutions acceptable to both sides. In working on the draft budget, the Ministry of Finance endeavored to take the deputies' valid demands into consideration as far as possible. We agreed that the structure of expenditure must be shifted toward an increase in the size of funding for the agro-industrial complex, industry, and the social sphere. For example, cultural and health care establishments will receive an additional R968.4 billion. Appropriations to support the mass media (particularly television and radio broadcasting) will increase by R434 billion. One percent of personal income tax will henceforth remain at the disposal of the local authorities.
