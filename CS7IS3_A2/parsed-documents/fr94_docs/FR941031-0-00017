This action is taken in response to the end of the civil war in Yemen, which has reduced the threat of hostile actions against persons and aircraft engaged in flight operations in Yemen. effective date: October 21, 1994. for further information contact: Mark W. Bury, International Affairs and Legal Policy Staff, AGC&hyph;7, Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591. Telephone: (202) 267&hyph;3515. supplementary information: On May 18, 1994, the FAA published a final rule (59 FR 25284) prohibiting certain aircraft operations within the territory and airspace of Yemen. In the exercise of its statutory responsibility for the safety of U.S.-registered aircraft and U.S. operators, the FAA determined that the civil war in Yemen justified the imposition of certain measures to ensure the safety of U.S.-registered aircraft and operators conducting flight operations in the vicinity of Yemen's territory and airspace. SFAR 68 prohibits flight operations within the territory and airspace of Yemen by any United States air carrier and commercial operator, by any person exercising the privileges of an airman certificate issued by the FAA, or by an operator using an aircraft registered in the United States unless the operator of such aircraft is a foreign air carrier. The civil war in Yemen ended on July 7, 1994. With the end of the war has come a corresponding reduction in the threat to civil aircraft operating in the territory and airspace of Yemen. There now appears to be no continuing specific threat to civil aviation arising out of, or related to, the civil war and its end. The FAA has been advised by Yemen's civil aviation authorities that its international airports are open and operating normally. The FAA, however, has no specific information on the facilities or level of services available at individual airports in Yemen. Yemen reports that it expects to issue a new Aeronautical Information Publication by the end of 1994. Information concerning the civil aviation system in Yemen is available from the Director of the Aeronautical Information Service, Sana'a International Airport, Post Office Box 1438, Sana'a Republic of Yemen. Telephone: 011&hyph;967&hyph;1&hyph;250820. Telex: 2434. Commercial Telegraph: CIVILAIR SANA'A. On the basis of the foregoing information, I have determined that the immediate removal of SFAR 68 from 14 CFR part 91 is appropriate. The Department of State has been advised of, and has no objection to, the action taken herein.
