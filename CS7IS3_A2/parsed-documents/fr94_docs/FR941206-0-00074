FR941206-0-00074 FR941206-0-00011 (b) Applicability of emission limits. The emission limitations of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section apply during sterilization operation. The emission limitations do not apply during periods of malfunction. (c) Sterilization chamber vent at sources using 1 ton. Each owner or operator of a sterilization source using 1 ton shall reduce ethylene oxide emissions to the atmosphere by at least 99 percent from each sterilization chamber vent. (d) Aeration room vent at sources using 10 tons. Each owner or operator of a sterilization source using 10 tons shall reduce ethylene oxide emissions to the atmosphere from each aeration room vent to a maximum concentration of 1 ppmv or by at least 99 percent, whichever is less stringent, from each aeration room vent. (e) (1) Chamber exhaust vent at sources using 10 tons. Each owner or operator of a sterilization source using 10 tons shall either reduce ethylene oxide emissions to the atmosphere by manifolding emissions from each chamber exhaust vent to a control device used to comply with paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section or shall reduce ethylene oxide emissions by at least 99 percent from each chamber exhaust vent (without manifolding). (2) Chamber exhaust vent at sources using 1 to 10 tons. Each owner or operator of a sterilization source using 1 to 10 tons shall limit ethylene oxide emissions from the chamber exhaust vent to the atmosphere to a maximum concentration of 5,300 ppmv from each chamber exhaust vent. If the owner or operator chooses to limit emissions to 5,300 ppmv concentration through the use of a control device, the owner or operator may choose either to manifold ethylene oxide emissions from each chamber exhaust vent to a control device used to comply with paragraph (c) of this section or to reduce ethylene oxide emissions by at least 99 percent (without manifolding). §63.363 Compliance and performance testing. (a) (1) The owner or operator of a source subject to emissions standards in §63.362 shall conduct an initial performance test using the procedures listed in §63.7 of subpart A of this part according to the applicability in Table 1 of §63.360, the procedures listed in this section, and the test methods listed in §63.365. (2) The owner or operator of all sources subject to these emissions standards shall complete the performance test within 180 days after the compliance date for the specific source as determined in §63.360(g). (b) The following procedures shall be used to determine compliance with the emission limits under §63.362(c), the sterilization chamber vent standard: (1) During the performance test required in paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator shall determine the efficiency of control devices used to comply with §63.362(c) using the test methods and procedures in §63.365(b)(1). The owner or operator shall also determine the following:
