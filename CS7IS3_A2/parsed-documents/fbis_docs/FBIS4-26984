Over the past four decades, these norms have become commonly known as the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. At the end of World War II, a wave of national liberation swept across the world. Many nations shook off the yoke of colonialism and became independent. They needed a foreign policy that could safeguard their hard won freedoms and protect the development of their economies. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence reflected their aspirations and were warmly welcomed by them. China not only participated in the initiation of the five principles but has observed these principles as a responsible member of the world community. China adheres to these principles not only in its relations with the developing countries but also in its relations with developed countries, despite differing political systems. By upholding these principles, China has won successive diplomatic victories and made more and more friends across the world. Owing to the efforts of peace-loving countries such as China, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have helped to preserve world peace, resolve conflicts, and enhance harmonious relations among nations over the past 40 years. With the end of the Cold War, the 1990's has witnessed great changes on the world political map. However, in the new and fluid political situation, the five principles are more important than ever. They embody the spirit of the United Nations Charter, reflect the essentials of a new and equitable form of relations among the nations, and represent the time-tested norms for world dialogue. They are vital in establishing the guidelines for a new world political and economic order. Nowadays, some nations seek to interfere in the internal affairs of others, infringing on the sovereignty of other nations under the guise of "human rights" and "democracy." They seek to bully the weaker, smaller, and poorer nations in a bid to force the latter to accept their values and dance to their tune. But history has shown that any arrogant bahaviour on the part of the big powers which goes against the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence will never get anywhere. After all, times have changed. And the sooner these countries change their outdated practices, the better it is for them and for the world community. The global community is characterized by its diversity. The differences between the nations should be recognized and respected. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence must be firmly upheld in handling the relations between the nations so that peace and development can be enhanced.
