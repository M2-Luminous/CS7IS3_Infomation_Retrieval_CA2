In an address to the nation, Prime Minister Bhutto said the day is not far off when Kashmir will be a part of Pakistan. She said her government would ask the Geneva-based Human Rights Commission to expose Indian repression in Kashmir. Whatever gestures one makes, Pakistan does not want to cool off the anti-Indian tirade. With the same objective in mind, a call has been made to observe a general strike in Pakistan on 5 February on the Kashmir issue. The Pakistani Government last week sent two nonofficial proposals on holding a plebiscite in Kashmir that were rejected by India because it said only the Shimla Agreement could be the basis for talks. On the other hand, Pakistan believes that unless the so-called repression in Kashmir is not stopped, jailed Kashmiris are not freed, and the siege of Hazratbal Shrine in Srinagar not ended, there could be no meaningful dialogue with India. Obviously, Pakistan does not desire negotiations at all. It is only putting forth excuses. Pakistan should realize that eventually all issues are settled through talks and not by guns. If Pakistan still does not desire to enter into a dialogue, it will mean that it is not serious and wants to vitiate the atmosphere before the start of any negotiations. The six proposals sent by India are definitely significant in the context of the normalization of relations. India has proposed to maintain peace at the Line of Control in Kashmir -- like the one agreed upon with China, although both sides will not give up their claims. This means that as an interim measure it will be accepted that for the time being that the Pakistan-ruled part of Kashmir will remain with it and the Indian-ruled Kashmir with us, while mutual talks will continue on the border claims. If Pakistan does not accept such a revolutionary proposal, it will be clear that its intentions are not honest. After all, how would Pakistan be threatened if it agrees to the proposal that no country make the first use of its nuclear capability against one another? The above two proposals are aimed at creating mutual trust. The demilitarization of Siachen Glacier, the delineation of Sir Creek maritime boundary near Kutch, and the settlement of the Tulbul barrage issue are all proposals made by India in good faith. Revitalizing the Joint Working Commission is also a need of the hour. If Pakistan agrees to hold talks on all these proposals, a favorable atmosphere will be created for a dialogue on Kashmir as well. Pakistan will achieve nothing by putting the Kashmir gun on India's temple. India is fully capable of defending its borders. Pakistan is intimidating the world by shouting Kashmir, Kashmir, and by doing so it is also gaining sympathy. We should strive to counter Pakistan's Kashmir diplomacy. Dialogue should go on, Pakistan should be brought to its senses and war readiness should be ensured, that is the only alternative left for India. However, the best scenario will be if good sense prevails upon Pakistan and it comes to the talks with a realistic approach. *
