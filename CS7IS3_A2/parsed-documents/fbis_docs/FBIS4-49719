Chen Pixiong, Zhou Nucai, Liu Jiujin and others in the village assembled a dozen of so young people who loved pleasures and loathed work and formed themselves into a gang. So far this year they have regularly used guns and other lethal weapons to stop vehicles travelling on the expressway by the village and rob the passengers of their money and belongings; and they also entered people's houses to steal and rob them. The money and belongings they have stolen exceeded 200,000 yuan. Determined to annihilate the gang, the Qiongshan Municipal Public Security Bureau had on many occasions sent police to the town to detect the gang's whereabouts. On the night of 27 April, public security police, with the masses' assistance, learned that the gang's ringleaders and other members had returned to the village to rest, and immediately informed the Hainan Public Security Department, which in turn informed the Hainan Armed Police Corps, demanding that personnel be sent to the village to destroy the gang. The Hainan Armed Police Corps immediately selected 50 officers and men to encircle and capture the gang. Early in the morning the next day, the armed police, without firing a single bullet, captured all the ringleaders and members of the gang.
