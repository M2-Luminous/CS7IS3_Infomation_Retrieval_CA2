David Kyd, IAEA information director, said: On 14 March, the inspection team completed its activities in Yongbyon, which started on 3 March in response to an emergency order from the IAEA Secretariat. The team will depart Pyongyang on 15 March and return to Vienna via Beijing on 16 March. The IAEA is now considering convening a special Board of Governors meeting next week after notifying major board members that the recent inspection activities were unsatisfactory [manjoksuropchi motaessumul]. Major board members decided that the recent inspection of North Korea was not sufficient [mihup] to determine if nuclear materials are being used for other purposes because it was difficult to collect sample materials due to North Korea's uncooperative attitude [pukhanui pihyopchoro]. Accordingly, it seems to be inevitable that a special Board of Governors meeting will be convened next week.
