Koreans Protest Agricultural Market Opening" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, February 2 (KCNA) -- More than 20,000 farmers and students of South Korea held a peasants' rally against the anti-national agricultural market opening by the Kim Yong-sam traitorous group at university quarters in Seoul on February 1, according to radio reports from Seoul. Sponsored by nine peasants' organisations including the National Federation of Peasants Associations (Chonnong), the ralliers denounced with bitter indignation the treacherous crime of the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime in selling off the markets of rice and other agricultural products to the United States. In the resolution adopted at the rally, they said if the agricultural market is opened, the South Korean agriculture will go totally bankrupt and urged the authorities to put the market opening issue to a referendum. And they demanded that the "National Assembly" refuse to "ratify" the treacherous agricultural market opening. At the end of the rally, they went over to a demonstration, loudly shouting "oppose agricultural market opening " and marched toward the U.S. Embassy, clashing with a large police force. While the demonstrators and police were engaged in a seasaw battle, some 500 students of the demonstrators marched toward "Chongwadae" [presidential offices]. Synchronising with this protest in Seoul, as many as 200 peasants of the North Cholla provincial branch of Chonnong headed for Seoul to join in it, while staging a demonstration on the Seoul-Pusan express highway. Yi Ki-taek, chairman of the opposition Democratic Party, called upon politicians and people to join hands in the struggle against agricultural market opening.
