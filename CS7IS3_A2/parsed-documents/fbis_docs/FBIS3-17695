Speaking in parliament Tuesday, he said that women and children have been evacuated from the canyon. However, the majority of the population do not want to leave their homes. This is another indication that the population in the Kodori canyon needs help. Shevardnadze also said that on Monday on the line of confrontation between the Georgian and Abkhazian forces near the Inguri River there were local clashes, but on Tuesday morning the situation was calm. Shevardnadze noted the intensification of Russia's mediatory efforts and also talked about Georgia's preparedness for talks for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Georgian Defense Ministry said Tuesday that fierce fighting continues in the Kodori canyon near the village of Zemo Lata. Abkhazian units are shelling Georgian positions. About a dozen Abkhazian helicopters airlifted additional manpower and armaments from Sukhumi. The spokesman said that in the early hours of March 29 there were no positional changes in the zone of fighting. As many as five Georgian were killed and four wounded. According to the spokesman, Abkhazian casualties totalled sixty. Deputy chairman of the Tbilisi-based pro-Georgian Council of Ministers of Abkhazia, Akaky Gasviani, confirmed to Interfax that the advancement of the Abkhazian formations and maercenaries towards the Kodori canyon had been stopped by the morning of March 28. Now the line of confrontation passes near the village of Verkhnyaya Lata, he said. Gasviani said that the chairman of the temporary committee for the state of emergency Djaba Ioseliani visited the Georgian positions Monday. So far Interfax does not have an Abkhazian version of what happened in the Kodori canyon.
