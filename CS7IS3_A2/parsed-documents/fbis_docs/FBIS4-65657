They provide for the European Community to make available 10 MECU [million ECU's] for the establishment of the Palestinian police force and 1.8 MECU for the election process. Chairman 'Arafat and Vice President Marin signed a document providing 10 MECU on aid to the police force. The grant will be split equally into finance for recurrent expenditure on the force (operational expenses, fuel and maintenance, salaries etc.) and the provision of equipment for the force, mostly vehicles. It will not be used for the provision of lethal equipment. The 10 MECU will contribute towards expenditure for the priority period covering the first 5 1/2 months of the deployment of the force. In view of the urgency of the rapid and effective establishment of the force, the Community is using accelerated procedures to ensure rapid availability of the finance. Chairman 'Arafat and Vice President Marin signed a second document providing 1.8 MECU aid for the electoral process in the Occupied Territories. Under this document the European Community will assist the Palestine Commission for Local Government and Elections (PCLGE) to enable the preparation and execution of democratic Palestinian elections and the building of new local government institutions. This will cover such activities as the preparation of the electoral law, training of officials, preparation of manuals, definition of boundaries, as well as the registration of voters and the physical arrangements for the elections themselves. The EC contribution will cover the major part of the costs involved in the electoral process. The EC has also agreed to assist the Palestinians in the organisation of a donors' conference to ensure the funding of the final elements of the election preparations.
