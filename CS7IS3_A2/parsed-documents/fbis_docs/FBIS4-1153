However, that does not appear to be the sole military development in the Angolan conflict. Reginaldo Silva, our correspondent in Luanda, reports on a war that appears to be entering a new stage: [Begin Silva recording] In Angola, the more there is talk about an urgent need for peace, the more one hears war-related news. According to a statement yesterday by Prime Minister Marcolino Jose Carlos Moco on his return from a visit to Benguela Province, this happens at a time when the UNITA forces have just reoccupied the capital of Benguela Province's Chongoroi District. It is difficult at this stage to assess the importance of UNITA's advances in Benguela. Its occupation of Chongoroi appears to be part of a response to the attacks UNITA forces have been coming under in northern Angola. To all intents and purposes, the UNITA troops appear to have considerably eased government pressure in Benguela Province and to have the military initiative in their hands, after government forces had made progress along the Bocoio-Balombo and Cubal-Ganda lines in the direction of Huambo. Observers in Luanda believe that the war in Angola is entering a new stage after the government forces showed an apparent inability to make major progress in their northern offensive, where the taking of the city of N'dalatando, the capital of Cuanza Norte Province, was one of the main goals. Contradictory reports may have been going the rounds over the last few days, but it appears to be certain that N'dalatando is still in UNITA's hands and its forces now enjoy more breathing space. Luanda's independent IMPARTIAL FAX publication has reported that, after receiving large quantities of war materiel it bought from Arab countries, UNITA is determined to change the situation in northern Angola so that it will be completely in its favor. That war materiel is being assembled in Uige. IMPARTIAL FAX also says that UNITA may soon have PC-7 and PC-9 aircraft. Should such reports prove to be true, the military situation in Angola may soon suffer major changes. [end recording]
