According to one Executive Committee member, those who have so far refused are Faruq Qaddumi, Mahmud 'Abbas, Jawid al-Ghusayn, Jamal al-Surani, and Sulayman al-Najjab. Yasir 'Amr has agreed to participate but some others have not made up their minds yet. According to the same member, those who have refused object basically to the substance of the agreement recently signed in Cairo and the way in which the negotiations with Israel were conducted. The Palestinian official said that PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat offered participation in the authority to all Executive Committee members without exception. All those contacted by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT were willing to give their views as to why they refused to participate but they asked to remain anonymous, with the exception of PLO Executive Committee Member Sulayman al-Najjab who said: "Yes, as a PLO Executive Committee member, they offered me participation in the authority and they also made the same offer to the People's Party to which I belong. My position is the same as the party's position. It is neither new nor a surprise to anyone. We told 'Arafat as far back as Oslo that our participation in the authority should not be taken for granted because that would depend on the powers of the authority, which was the subject of negotiation at the time, and also on the authority's program for tackling the issues that would be referred to it such as education, health, and so on. We said at the time that if no agreement was reached on these powers and on such a program then we would not participate in the authority, and that is what happened." Al-Najjab added: "This authority has no powers except in name. It is more like an executive body linked to the Israeli military government through coordination and liaison committees named in the Cairo agreement which covers all aspects of the activities and powers of that authority and gives the Israelis an absolute veto. That agreement cannot be developed from within as some people imagine. The agreement does not recognize any of the Palestinian people's rights, not even their minimum rights of controlling their occupied territory and their entitlement to that territory, as the Israelis object to it being described as occupied territory." He also said: "Our main concern is how to defend the objective of national independence for the Palestinian people and the cause of the refugees in accordance with the UN resolutions. Without securing these two objectives, the Palestinian people will not stop their struggle and there will be no real stability in the region." Another Executive Committee member, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "I support a political settlement based on Resolutions 242, 338 and the other UN resolutions on the refugee question. Despite my reservations regarding many flaws in the Oslo agreement, I accepted it as a mere agreement on principles that would be translated into detailed agreements open to modification through negotiations." He added: "Regrettably, the Cairo agreement and all its supplements precipitated Palestinian acceptance of the Israeli security plan and concept and made it possible for the Israeli side to avoid any reference to Security Council Resolution 242 or commitment to it. That is why I have refused to be a part of the authority that will implement that agreement." He added: "Those who like to compare the Cairo agreement with the Balfour Declaration are actually insulting Palestinian intelligence. The Balfour Declaration gave the Jews a national homeland in Palestine. I ask: Where in the Cairo agreement is there any mention or mere reference to such a promise?" He pointed out that he did not see in that agreement and its clear ceiling any room for independent action, and that is why it would not improve the current tragic situation our people in the occupied territory are suffering. A third member told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: "It is most regrettable that what was signed in Cairo was the Israeli draft submitted during the Taba talks as a way of sounding out the Palestinian side, with some superficial changes which some saw as achievements." Wondering about these achievements, he asked: Is changing the number of the national authority members from 12, as in the Israeli draft, to 24, as requested by the Palestinian side, considered an achievement? Is changing Palestinian territorial waters opposite Gaza from 3 nautical miles, as in the Israeli draft, to 6 miles, as stipulated in the Cairo agreement, an achievement? He added: The Israeli draft, which we had the right to reject or add substantial amendments to if we could not submit our own plan, was the draft that was signed as the Cairo agreement, with some superficial amendments.
