FBIS4-28392 "dreas112_m_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 Thailand Protesters Warned Protesters Warned BK1006042894 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 10 Jun 94 p 3 BK1006042894 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] Army Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit warned yesterday that criticism made against the military at a protest rally in front of Parliament would benefit no one but could lead to disharmony and violence. "I don't see how criticism against the military would benefit the country or help strengthen national unity. Instead I think it could instigate violence," said Gen Wimon, apparently referring to social critic Sulak Siwarak who took a snipe at the military while addressing a rally in support of hunger striker Chalat Worachat last Sunday. "Some groups might want to see that (violence) happen. But we in the Army do not want to see it happen to Thai people," said the Army chief. Asked if he would take legal action against Mr Sulak, Gen Wimon said he believed the Thai public understood what was going on. "Some people tend to attack everyone around them, believing no one is good except them themselves. However, there are not many of this kind of people," he said. Gen Wimon then asked one reporter whether she had voted in the last general election. When the reporter answered with a nod, he said: "We have already exercised our political rights. Now it's time for us to let our representatives solve the country's problems through the parliamentary system." The Army chief said he has never interfered with the country's administration. In a democratic society, he said, one should learn to respect rules and regulations and try not to be too stubborn since "no one can do or get everything he wants". "Like in a sport, we players have to observe its rule," said Gen Wimon who had earlier pledged full support for Prime Minister Chuan Likphai against any move to force the Government to give in to Mr Chalat's demands. Meanwhile, Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm Prachet Siridet said he was optimistic the current political situation would not become explosive if all sides tried to tackle problems with reason. But he warned that a political confrontation might be inevitable if there was interference by outsiders who wanted to see the situation worsen. "We want to see the problem (concerning Mr Chalat) resolved with understanding," said the admiral. He added that Thai people should not repeat their past mistakes. "We have gained much experience and should find a good solution to the problem without repeating the same mistakes. " Another top military officer, First Army Commander Lt-Gen Chettha Thanacharo, dismissed suggestions that Mr Chalat's demands had gained support from the public. Lt-Gen Chettha said he was confident the majority of people still adhered to righteousness and democratic principles. He warned that one should be cautious in dealing with the Constitution which was "most important to the lives of 59 million Thais." Lt-Gen Chettha, who is also a senator, said the Government had made the right decision not to set up a House committee to redraft the Constitution as demanded by Mr Chalat's supporters. In an apparent show of sympathy for the Government, Lt-Gen Chettha asked: "What should we do if we are doing the right thing but other people see it as wrong?"
