Although it had experienced steady growth for over 10 years, the industry is now in a condition of unprecedentedly serious proportions, hard hit by the fall in demand caused by the prolonged economic slump, cost differentials with established materials as well as cutbacks in its R&D expenses and personnel as a result of the industry's poor performance. Withdrawal from the industry by raw-material and other makers, and suspension of R&D have become a grisly reality. Fine ceramics now stand at the crossroads. Will they end up as merely the lead-off batter in the fierce new-materials game or will they overcome their many difficulties and become the real star of the new-materials troupe? Dow Plans Full-Scale Production of Al Nitride Via Cost Reduction The announcement by America's Dow Chemical Co. of an industrialization plan for aluminum nitride has been one of the hottest news topics for the fine-ceramics industry this year. It had been anticipated that Dow Chemical, who had been eagerly engaged in the study of nitride fine ceramics, would launch industrialization of the business sooner or later, but industry circles were surprised when the announcement came during this worst-ever slump. Moreover, the said plan overwhelmed those in the fine-ceramics industry, and other observers as well, with its ambitious scale and the strategy taken by the company: it plans to industrialize and sell, mainly in the Japanese market, aluminum-nitride powder in an amount of approximately 1,200 t/y, while current world demand for the material stands at only several hundred t/y. In the history of the Japanese fine-ceramics industry, there have been business judgments similar to that of Dow Chemical, although on a smaller scale. Japan's Ube Industries took such a course when it began industrialization of silicon-nitride powders, as did Tosoh Corp. with zirconia powder. Although both companies constructed their large-scale plans to meet existing domestic consumption plus prospective world-market demand, the facilities are now compelled to operate at a low level due to sluggish demand. Dow's industrialization project may not proceed as smoothly as planned, although the company has presented a definite target for cost-cutting by means of mass production, unlike its Japanese counterparts. "Aluminum nitride has great potential demand. Though there are users who cannot afford to use it now as much as they'd like because of its high price, we will be able to supply them with the product at half the current market price." (Dow) This is just what these potential users have been waiting to hear. Sales Likely To Mark Negative Growth for Second Consecutive Year Volumewise fine-ceramics sales for 1992 plunged 8.4 percent from the level of the previous year, according to statistics of the fine-ceramics industry released by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. The negative growth was the second since 1986, when the ministry started recording statistics, but the rate of decrease was the largest. As the low operating rate is continuing this year, the figure for this year will most likely register for the first time negative growth for a second consecutive year. Recovery will not be seen until 1994. What has brought about this situation? The main cause is the prolonged recession. Since it is a material still under development, fine ceramics may not recover like established industrial materials when the economy recovers; fine ceramics together with other new materials may have to start from scratch because their reliability has not yet been established. If the relationship with present users is discontinued, development on the users' side may also be discontinued. In the electronics industry, a major user of fine ceramics, and the automobile industry, a prospective user, the switch to materials cheaper than fine ceramics is under way for some parts, although these industries are requesting cost reductions. Material makers as well as parts makers are faced with a crucial decision: whether to invest more money and manpower to further develop new products and realize cost reduction or to discontinue industrialization of the business. Another problem is that fine ceramics is used by many enterprises in their new business sectors, where part of the profits obtained from their main businesses has been invested. Many enterprises are suffering from the poor performances of their main businesses, and one material maker has withdrawn from the business. Effects on other makers are now under close observation.

In the field of R&D, a project called "High-Order Structural Control Fused Inorganic Materials (synergy ceramics)," which had been promoted as a leading research activity, will start afresh from the next fiscal year based on the research and development system of industrial science and technology. The aim of the project is to improve, to a great degree, the properties of fine ceramics by concurrent control at each level of atomic, molecular and macro structure and to create new fine ceramics capable of performing, synergistically and concurrently, plural functions which are not normally feasible. Development is expected for such industrial uses as follows: heat exchanger for gas-turbine generators and solid electrolyte fuel cells in the field of energy; functional material for purification system for diesel engine exhaust gas and NO[.sub]x[/] purification catalyser in the environmental protection field; materials for supersonic aircraft and the space shuttle in the space and aviation field; and the general industrial material field. Another project "High-Temperature CO[.sub]2[/] Separation and Recovery/Recycling Technologies" will begin next year. It aims at developing a system which uses ceramics separation membrane to separate CO[.sub]2[/] at high temperatures above 300�C from high-temperature exhaust gas generated from power plants and cement factories, as well as the application of segregated carbon dioxide. Zeolite-applied porous membrane, porous glass-based segregation membrane, and fused carbonate-carried membrane are being considered. This is the first project for environmental protection to take advantage of the properties of fine ceramics, such as that of its heat-resistance. Standardization Meet Due Next Spring in Tokyo International standardization of fine ceramics, a long-standing problem for the Japanese fine-ceramics industry, began recently. The ISO (International Standardization Organization) set up a special committee for fine ceramics (TC206) in December of last year. Since Japan has been entrusted with the management of the committee, a parent body for management promotion, "Promotion Council for International Standardization of Fine Ceramics," was established in July this year. The council will tackle "standardization anticipation": How to standardize experiment and assessment methods in anticipation of the direction of technological developments in high-tech fields and make the standardization concepts common language among technical circles. Already the council is actively engaged in coordination of standards with the U.S. and the EC as well as discussions with nations whose representatives will be on the committee. The first general meeting of ISO/TC206 will be held in Tokyo next spring. Along with the international activity, a domestic committee, made up of specialists in industrial, official, and academic circles, was formed within the Fine Ceramics Society of Japan. The committee has started research for the purpose of constructing a database for fine ceramics. To secure users' trust, it is necessary to provide them with information on the properties of the material in a readily available way, the database should be reinforced with guaranteed values of physical properties, in order to expand demand for fine ceramics. The plan calls for research on the existing database and the industrial needs for the database, its structure, selection of data, development of network and selection of access system for the current fiscal year. Establishment of a database, based on the results of the research, is planned for the next fiscal year and thereafter. In the past, a great market in the future for fine ceramics was foreseen, providing the basis of corporate judgments for industrialization. However, now that the world and the environment surrounding fine ceramics have markedly changed, corporate awareness may also have to be modified. Apart from judging the continuation of the business from the viewpoint of an individual company, this may be the chance for making the best use of its past development results in cooperation or tie-up with other companies. After all, fine ceramics is the key material to support the advanced information-oriented society of the 21st century. [Box, p 6] "Competition and Cooperation Hold Key to Industry's Future" A mood of pessimism is engulfing the fine-ceramics industry caused by slackening demand for the materials under Japan's economic recession. But this does not necessarily portend a dark future for the industry. For fine-ceramics makers, the important thing is "attitude" reform. Specifically, they should either present users with easier-to-use products or consider how to better provide consistent, general-purpose information. This is necessary from the standpoint of encouraging crossovers from rival materials to fine ceramics and in cultivating new demand sources. The ability to do this may hold the key to the industry's future. A period of more than 10 years has elapsed since fine ceramics caught the world's attention as promising new materials. Looking back over this period, it is clear that the industry's approach -- namely emphasizing R&D for technologies to support next-generation industries -- has played a significant role in this regard. Remarkable achievements were made in improving the properties of fine ceramics and in appraising related technologies as well. In particular, the improved characteristics rekindled anticipation of unlimited possibilities for fine ceramics. Viewed from a market perspective, the physical improvements coupled with Japan's period of high economic growth kept fine-ceramics demand expanding smoothly during this time. But the economy's lapse into recession put a damper on fine-ceramics demand growth. Although applications themselves have been expanding, most of this growth has been observed within specific areas of use. In other words, manufacturers as yet have been unable to establish a base for fine ceramics as general-purpose materials and components. In this sense, the industry is approaching a turning point. Spurring crossovers from existing materials to fine ceramics will require both competition and cooperation. Up to now fine-ceramics makers for the most part have provided users with technological information and services, and standardized their products, on an individual basis. They must pay closer attention to users' needs in the future. With these considerations in mind, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has taken up medium-to-long-term challenges facing the industry and proposed several R&D themes, including High-Order Structural Control Fused Inorganic Materials (synergy ceramics) and High Temperature CO[.sub]2[/] Separation and Recovery/Recycling Technologies. The ministry is also pursuing international standardization and database building for fine ceramics. Although such efforts are being undertaken in a tripartite government, industry and academia arrangement, the enthusiasm shown by industry is especially encouraging. Japan must build up its technological development capacity to remain competitive in the 21st century. Since technological innovation energizes industry, and materials play a key role in this process, fine ceramics would seem to offer much promise. We hope industry will recognize this and pursue fine-ceramics development with confidence.
