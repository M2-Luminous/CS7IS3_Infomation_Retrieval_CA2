V. Avrorova, V. V. Gvozdev, and B. Sh. Dadasheva; UDC[677.494.675:536.495].004.14] [Abstract] Under the leadership of Academician G. I. Kudryavtsev, the Scientific Production Association ``Khimvolokno'' developed the high strength aramide fibers SVM and Armos. Changes in industry made it possible to distribute these products and thereby resolve ecological problems. Aramide fibers have a unique complex of properties making them ecologically attractive. In addition to being strong and resilient, they are heat resistant at temperature intervals to 250-270ï¿½ C, resist bending, and have good textile properties. These properties make them very promising for use as filtration materials, especially for hot gases. The cyclones used for this purpose until recently, are suitable only for pre-filtering. In the present work the use of aramide fabric filters to treat hot gases to remove coal ash is discussed. Test results indicate that the new aramide materials are promising.
