FR940125-2-00014 FR940125-2-00005 Analysis of the Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed Consent Order from Nu Skin International, Inc., CJM, Inc., CST Management, Inc., and CK&C, Inc., corporations; Clara McDermott, individually and as an officer and director of CJM, Inc.; Craig Tillotson, individually and as an officer and director of CST Management, Inc.; and Craig Bryson, individually and as an officer and director of CK&C, Inc. The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for receipt of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed Order contained in the agreement. This matter concerns advertisements and promotional practices for three Nu Skin International, Inc. products: Nutriol Hair Fitness Preparation (``Nutriol''), Face Lift with Activator (``Face Lift''), and Celltrex. This matter also concerns the advertisements and promotional practices for the recruitment of persons to be Nu Skin International, Inc. distributors. The Commission's proposed Complaint alleges that the advertisements expressly or impliedly claim that Nutriol will stop hair loss, stimulate hair growth, and is as effective as, or more effective than, the prescription drug Minoxidil in the treatment of hair loss. These claims are alleged to violate section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45, because they are false and the proposed respondents did not possess adequate substantiation for the claims at the time they were made. The proposed Complaint also alleges that the advertisements expressly or impliedly claim that Face Lift will permanently remove facial wrinkles and is as effective as, or more effective than, the prescription drug trentinoin (currently known as Retin-A) in the removal of facial wrinkles. These claims are alleged to violate section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45, because they are false and the proposed respondents did not possess adequate substantiation for the claims at the time they were made. The proposed Complaint also alleges that the advertisements expressly or impliedly claim that Celltrex will promote the healing of third degree burns. This claim is alleged to violate section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45, because it is false and the proposed respondents did not possess adequate substantiation for the claim at the time it was made. The proposed Complaint also alleges that the advertisements expressly or impliedly claim that the amount of money represented in the advertisements is representative, or typical, of what individuals who become Nu Skin distributors will generally achieve on a monthly or annual basis. This claim is alleged to violate section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45, because it is false and the proposed respondents did not possess adequate substantiation for the claim at the time it was made. Finally, the proposed Complaint alleges that the advertisements expressly or impliedly claim that using Nutriol, Face Lift, and Celltrex will result in physiological changes in the body, as well as cosmetic changes in appearance. These claims are alleged to violate sections 5 and 12, 15 U.S.C. 45 and 52, because they are false advertisements which induced, or will likely induce, the purchase of drugs or cosmetics. The proposed Consent Order prohibits the proposed respondents from representing, directly or by implication, that: (1) Nutriol, or any substantially similar product or service, (a) can or will stop, prevent, cure, relieve, reverse or reduce hair loss; (b) can or will promote the growth of hair where hair has already been lost; or (c) is as effective as, or more effective than, the prescription drug Minoxidil in the treatment of hair loss; and (2) competent and reliable data show that Nutriol, or any substantially similar product or service, is effective in stopping hair loss and promoting hair growth. In addition, the proposed Consent Order prohibits the proposed respondents from making these representations, directly or by implication, for any other product or service, unless such representations are true and at the time of making such representations, respondents possess and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates the representations. The proposed Consent Agreement also prohibits the proposed respondents from advertising, packaging, labeling, promoting, offering for sale, selling, or distributing any product that is represented as promoting hair growth or preventing hair loss, unless the product is the subject of an approved new drug application for such purpose under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq .
