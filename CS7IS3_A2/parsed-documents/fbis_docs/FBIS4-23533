[Museveni] The only possible role Uganda played was one of example, because we also had our own problems here. We managed to fight the dictatorship and overthrow it, and those young people who were living here, they saw what we were doing, and as people with problems they said OK, maybe we can do the same in our own country -- you know the infectiousness, the contagion of ideas, how ideas spread. [Aslett] Yesterday a senior Rwandan Government official accused you of supplying arms to the RPF, are you? [Museveni] We are not supplying the RPF, that used to be the old accusation. We invited the United Nations to come and station themselves on the border -- right now they are there so this is all rubbish. [Aslett] What has been your advice to the RPF, do you think this war is winnable? [Museveni] It is possible they can take power, it is possible but they will have to do it slowly because they don't have the equipment. This is also another contradiction because if we were backing them as some people say, they would have very modern equipment -- more modern, they would fight a fast war, but the equipment they have from my intelligence is that it is a type that cannot fight a quick war. They may be good fighters, they may win in the end, but it will have to be slow, and the slower it is the bigger the humanitarian problems will become, displacement and so on and so forth. Since the (Arusha) agreement provided for power sharing, and since the recent resolution about the genocide provided for a international commission of inquiry, and also for an international tribunal to try the criminals, I think this would be a good moment to accept a cease-fire, and then utilize those two documents. [Aslett] Do you think the United Nations has been slow to react to the war in Rwanda? [Museveni] My answer is yes it has been too slow; that is A. But B: I don't know whether it could act faster, I am not so very sure that it could. [Aslett] What do you see as the solution, how will the war be resolved? [Museveni] Collective influence by all of us to keep on advising, talking. [Aslett] Do you think it is possible in Rwanda? [Museveni] I think so, because they have to either continue fighting or to have peace, that is the only alternative they have.
