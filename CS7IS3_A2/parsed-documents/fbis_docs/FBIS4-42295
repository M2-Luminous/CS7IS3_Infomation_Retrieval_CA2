There are too many people beyond the Alps who do not like our tricolor flag. However, we must let the French know that it is not up to them to decide on our foreign policy. As far as President Mitterrand is concerned, he would be better advised to be concerned about the agreements he has reached with the communist party, whose totalitarian ideology has been ruinous for the world." These words were uttered by [Justice Minister] Alfredo Biondi, who yesterday briefly relinquished his role as justice minister in order to speak from the platform at the Center Union Congress held in Turin. Biondi made it clear that he did not welcome the position adopted by the president of the French Republic. Furthermore, he suggested that some sort of international "conspiracy" against Italy's interests lurked behind the concern expressed by many European leaders over the presence of AN [National Alliance] members in Berlusconi's government. After sounding the alarm, the minister nevertheless praised the "firmness" displayed by his colleague [Foreign Minister] Antonio Martino, who in the last few days made a sharp retort against the head of the Elysee [French president's palace]. The liberal leader also shared the foreign minister's position in favor of "reviewing historical conditions with bordering countries in the former Yugoslavia." [passage omitted]
