Ukraine's gas piping agencies are reported to have made more orderly Russian natural gas exports to Europe, while Russia's gas suppliers were similarly punctual in supplying natural gas to Ukraine both for themselves and for Turkmenistan to compensate for the latter's discontinued supplies. For some objective reasons, the issue of suspended natural gas supplies by Russia to Ukraine has been deleted from the agenda. Or, more specifically, no emphasis is placed on the major underlying reason, which is Ukraine's fuel indebtedness. At least, now it has become obvious that the Russo-Ukrainian controversy, which the media used to interpret as the fuel indebtedness problem, lies in the status of major gas and petroleum pipe-lines, which have largely fallen within Ukraine's jurisdiction after the former Soviet Union's disintegration, though this fact is not at all tantamount to division of the formerly integral pipe-line system and Russia's tacit agreement with this. So, while persistently and actively overstating its warnings about natural gas supply suspension the Russian side is well aware of its virtual inability to make the threats materialize, Ukraine's unpaid fuel debt to Russia notwithstanding. Since the latest Moscow agreement, under which Ukraine had to start repaying its debt and at least pay for the 1994 first quarter's supplies with hard currency, Ukraine has factually repaid about 46 million dollars, which is less than a half of the sum subject to payment, according to Russia's Gazprom sources. The Ukrainian government's subsequent March decision on lists of enterprises and amounts of commodities they should supply to Russia by way of repaying Ukraine's fuel debt, as well as the endorsed scheme for settling, may be viewed as just another palliative resolution among a series of five, which the Ukrainian Cabinet approved over the past six months. As analysts believe, it will be as inefficient, as its predecessors were. Ukraine's, or more specifically, the Ukrainian State Committee's for oil and gas, major headache is the problem of internal non- payment. The above decisions, as well as the imposed rule of pre- payment starting with April 1, have all invariably threatened to discontinue natural gas supplies to debtor consumer-enterprises. To a certain extent, such threats can be carried out by Ukrgazprom and Ukrgaz against Ukrainian consumer enterprises. At least, Ukrzarubezhneftegaz spokespersons (this agency is in charge of control over mutual settling in line with the latest governmental resolution) hope that the threats, coupled with other administrative moves, which are provided for by the resolution, will succeed in repayment of the debt's major portion. All the administrative pressure notwithstanding, Ukraine's metallurgical and chemical enterprises are reported as highly reluctant to comply with the government's strict order to remit their currency accounts to only the state-owned Export-Import Bank. The government's stratagem is too transparent and provides for imposing the state's total and rigid control over export enterprises' hard currency incomings with a view of channeling them to repayment of Ukraine's fuel debt. The Ukrainian State Committee for oil and gas is said to pin its hopes on imposition of a rigid mechanism of payments for imported fuels to extinguish the internal debt, which may be implemented by the newly established Ukrneftegaz (Ukraine's Oil and Gas) National Joint-Stock Company of the holding type. Assuming the status of though state-run, yet monopolist in the field of fuel supplies, the National Joint-Stock Company is largely expected to realize its claims. However as the Russian Gazprom association's experience may suggest, the hope is hard to materialize, since Russia's Gazprom has been acting in a similar manner toward intra-Russian gas consumers and under conditions, very much similar to those of Ukrgazprom. The Russo-Ukrainian "debts should be repaid" dispute (as Ukraine's acting prime-minister Zvyagilski once put it) has ripened enough to assume the form of mutual proposals and compromises. For objective reasons, Russia cannot drastically curtail its natural gas supplies to Ukraine. Gas exports to West Europe have shrunk with spring's onset, firstly. The supply schedule for Ukraine, though it virtually exceeds the domestic requirements, will not be a weighty argument, since these gas supplies are basically intended for piping them to underground storages. Russia's natural gas extractors cannot significantly curtail their extraction, either, purely for technical reasons, which makes them look for ways to dispose of the extracted natural gas somehow. Besides, reduced natural gas piping may further compromise the already deteriorated major gas pipe-lines, which the Russian side has to admit. Ukraine's formal ownership of the pipe-lines does not relieve Russia of troubles involved in maintaining them technically operational. Ukraine is similarly interested in their good operational condition. Thus, Russia has to share the burden of operational costs involved in maintaining Ukraine's segment of the gas pipe-line system, which links Russian gas exporters with their West European customers. In view of this one cannot but admit as quite rational Russia's bid to own a part of the vital gas export infrastructure, which is located in Ukraine. The latter, while not rejecting Russia's claim outright, appears in no hurry to meet it. Probably, this fact could be attributed to Ukraine's domestic economic troubles and its petroleum and gas industry's restructuring. The Ukrainian side has apparently been doing its best to postpone the final decision on Russia's co-ownership having repeatedly promised Russia to sell stocks to be issued by Ukrainian gas and oil industry enterprises, which are supposed to undergo conversion into joint-stock societies, to Russian related enterprises. However, these promises may be rendered void by the privatization process, if it follows the pattern, which is supposed to be approved for the Ukrainian oil and gas industry. Meanwhile, the CIS integral gas distribution system remains operational with the bulk of it in Russia's possession. So, it is Russia, who bears the burden of its operational costs. In late March Moscow was the venue of a sitting convened by Gazprom's Council for R&D and technologies, which discussed progress made in implementing the Highly Reliable Piping Transport Program. Academician Boris Paton, director of the Ye. Paton Arc Welding Research Institute, made a major speech. This fact and Ukraine's great contribution to this and other projects involving gas piping, may unambiguously and eloquently testify to both commonly shared by Ukraine and Russia problems and the integral quality of the major gas pipe-line infrastructure. The above Program was adopted in 1991 by the then Union government. Its practical implementation started a year later. The now independent governments of Russia and Ukraine articulated their support for it as an intergovernmental project. However, Ukraine had to drastically reduce its financing, though R&D efforts continued. The Program is said to contain nine major R&D directions. However, their implementation is now jeopardized. The Ukrainian party is reported as intending to complete and implement on its own the Program's Ukrainian section, which is but too logical considering some most recent international projects in this field. Under the former USSR since the late 1960s about 22,000 to 26,000 km. of gas pipe-lines were annually commissioned including some 15,000 km. of major gas pipe-lines. According to the Gazprom Council, in the late 1970s-early 1980s annual gas extraction increments of 40 billion cu. m. and more dictated construction of a high-capacity and superlong major pipe-line. Thus, high-pressure 1,420 mm. diameter gas pipe-lines were constructed. Over 50,000 km. of these were constructed in the Russian Federation alone. The CIS major gas pipe-line system is 220,000 km. long with compressor stations' aggregate power of 50 million kW. According to Russia's Gazprom, Russia operates 138,500 km. of major gas pipe-lines, 48,000 km. of major oil pipe-lines under the Transneft Company, and 13,000 km. of major petroleum product pipe- lines under the Transnefteprodukt company. Many of these are used to pipe up to 250 billion cu. m. of natural gas a year from West Siberian fields to Europe. Some of these pipe as much as over 340 billion cu. m. of gas. Major pipe-lines cross railroads and highways in 15,000 cases, and water arteries in 2,000 cases, which makes their reliability and safety problem a vital and obvious one. Their wear and tear poses great environmental pollution risks, since 25 per cent of gas pipe-lines have been operational for over 20 years, 38 per cent for between 10 and 20 years and 5 per cent have surpassed the limit of 33 years. According to Gazprom, in 1993 there were 30 cases of pipe-line destruction. Compared to most developed nations, the number is not great. However, the pipe-lines' aging and failure to meet the European standards coupled with inadequate control over their technical safety may adversely affect the unified CIS - West European gas supply system.
