Profound economic and political reforms are under way in the country. People's way of life is being turned upside down. Global changes are occurring in the international situation. Russia must take its proper place in the world community and ensure effective protection of its independence, integrity, and historical identity. This is precisely why the country needs strong and combatable special services both today and in the future, and this includes the counterintelligence organs. We need new approaches to the system of ensuring the security of the Russian Federation. First and foremost we need an accurate, professional, and prompt analysis of many factors and circumstances in order to identify the real threats to the security of the Russian Federation. The country's leadership expects from you accurate assessments of the possible consequences of these threats and the best ways to neutralize or eliminate them. It is important that we possess reliable, systematic, and unabridged knowledge of the situation inside the Russian Federation and around it. We need advance information with variant forecasts and appropriate draft proposals on possible management or political solutions. I categorically disagree with the view that the information and analysis work of the counterintelligence service should be performed only on instructions from above. This is a profoundly erroneous stance! On the contrary, we need as much initiative as possible. Waiting around for instructions is just a nonstate approach. If you like, it is a question that touches on the professional honor of the counterintelligence service. I would also like to clarify the line of argument that the counterintelligence organs stand outside politics. As far as individual staffers are concerned, they are certainly not allowed to combine their work with political activity, that is to say to serve the interests of a particular party or social organization. But the Federal Service is a state organ. Its main purpose is to execute state policy. This must be clearly understood by all staffers and by their leaders in particular. Personnel in state service, wherever they may work, have just one policy -- that of the state. To be outside this policy is a sure sign of professional unsuitability. We want Russia to become a truly strong and effective state. We want democratic institutions to develop not just in word but in deed. We want guarantees of human rights to be strengthened. This is precisely why we will demand that all organs and structures of the executive branch accurately follow the priorities of state policy. This is our principled line. Your service is called upon to perform primarily counterintelligence functions. Whatever changes may occurr in Russia and the world, we are still a long way from the day when the counterintelligence services will have nothing to do. Unfortunately, there are forces in the world which have set themselves the aim to weaken Russia and turn it into a feeble competitor with a cheap labor force and low intellectual potential. There are those who want to appropriate Russia's natural wealth and take possession of our advanced technologies in space, military, and other spheres. The main rule is that any action capable of damaging national interests should be prevented or neutralized. From whatever direction it might come. There can be no question of any exceptions. But I would like to emphasize that the efficacy of your work is not judged by the number of spies you apprehend. Your task is not just to expose but primarily to prevent intelligence activities in Russia. Let us not fool ourselves: There is as yet no reliable protection in Russia against the gathering of information and the establishment of agents networks. The reasons for this are loopholes in the laws, our open borders, falling standards in discipline, the cost of comercialization, and other factors. The counterintelligence service is aware of all this more clearly than anyone else. It is precisely you who are obliged to inform the organs of power about this and to persistently propose specific solutions from an organizational and legal point of view. The collapse of the system of state secrets is causing serious alarm. The Law "On State Secrets" came into force in Russia in 1993. But a new system for the protection of secrets based on it has not as yet been created. It is essential to make full use of the powers granted you. First and foremost the right to monitor that the demands regarding the protection of state secrets are carried out precisely. Your assistance in elaborating and implementing procedural [rezhimnyy] measures is especially needed by nonstate structures. An exceptionally important area of your activities is the struggle against illegal infringement of the constitutional system. It is no secret to anyone that there are in Russia certain parties and movements, as well as public figures and citizens, who are banking on this. Illegal methods do not always receive the proper rebuff. Part of this problem is down to your shortcomings. There is absolutely no justification for blaming this on an alleged lack of the necessary legal base for exposing and putting a stop to unconstitutional activity. Yes, our legislation is not perfect. But we have enough existing legal norms for counterintelligence work to neutralize extremist plans. I will make only one amplification on a matter of principle. This work should be based not on the monitoring of citizens' political conduct and views, but on the exposure, prevention, and thwarting of unconstitutional and other illegal activities. This is a most important factor which will make it possible to avoid the counterintelligence organs becoming organs of political investigation. Interethnic contradictions are one of the basic factors causing tension in Russia. The conflicts in Chechnya, North Ossetia, and Ingushetia are assuming a protracted nature, and are throwing the country into a ferment. Enormous resources are being diverted in order to settle them and to eliminate the consequences. The intervention of the Armed Forces, law enforcement bodies and other departments is needed. Innocent people are perishing as the contradictions are being resolved. Tens of thousands of people are becoming refugees. In these conditions the forecasts for the development of events and suggestions of essential measures are extremely important. There is patently a lack of efficiency at the present time. I am drawing this to the most serious attention not only of the leadership of the FCS but also the leaders of the territorial organs. The whole arsenal of forces and resources of the FCS must be brought into play and new, nonstereotyped methods of work must be actively sought. Inaction and irresolution are fraught with the most serious consequences. These include a decline in the prestige of the authorities both in the center and at local level, and a critical reduction of the level of personal security, extremism, and chaos for years to come in whole regions. In the face of these dangers sluggishness and unconcern are not only impermissible but criminal. The paramount task for Russia today is to surmount the economic crisis. Therefore I ask you to pay special attention to questions of counterintelligence backup for the protection of the Russian economy. At present we are protecting Russian economic interests poorly. There is no system or assertiveness in the FCS's actions in this area. We must not go on trailing in the wake of events and only reacting to them (even then belatedly at times). Of course, ensuring economic security is a statewide task. I address this criticism to everyone -- to economic departments, above all. The time has come for the government to work out a strategy of Russia's economic security. Counterintelligence must act selectively in the economic sphere. I am talking, first, of questions to which the answers can only be given by the special service and no other state organ. Second, of the most vital state requirements or "sore points." Third, everything must be done to ensure that Russia does not end up "on the sidelines" of the world economy. It is necessary to preserve progressive economic, scientific, and technical potential and to ensure our export potential. This is a task not only for science, industry, and foreign economic departments. For this the special services must also make an effort. In addition, we must have a detailed picture of the preconditions for possible extraordinary occurrences (explosions, fires, accidents, disasters, and so on). I can state without exaggeration that every major extraordinary occurrence now deals a painful blow to Russia's entire economy and to the social well-being of citizens. We must have exhaustive knowledge of the threats associated with flawed technologies for storing, neutralizing, and destroying the waste material from dangerous production processes and nuclear and chemical materials and weapons. The use of Russia's territory to bury ecologically dangerous materials illegally imported from abroad constitutes a special question. Active counterintelligence work in this area will not only help the state to save considerable funds but will also save people's lives. Counterintelligence backup for conversion is one of the most important problems. Conversion is a commandment of the times. But we do not travel the same road as those to whom conversion and scientific and technical regression mean one and the same thing. For us these concepts are incompatible. Our task today is to hold on to Russia's advanced positions in scientific and technical development, and tomorrow to expand them. Russia's defense capability can on no account be allowed to be weakened. Secrets of state importance concentrated in this sphere cannot be allowed to go abroad. This task cannot be resolved without selfless activity by the FCS. At the same time counterintelligence must not hamper the expansion of international cooperation within the framework of interstate agreements and existing legislation. The iron curtain has collapsed! Not just between states but also between people. International contacts will develop in the ascendant. You must accumulate experience of work in conditions of an open society and a market economy. The further we get from total bans, the more professionally and delicately counterintelligence must operate. I cannot ignore the question of crime. Smuggling has become widespread in recent years. We are incurring tremendous losses as a result of the uncontrolled export from the country of raw materials, semimanufactures, and objects of art, culture, and our spiritual heritage. Financial assets are being taken out of circulation and are settling in foreign banks. Frequently the damage is irreparable! Therefore the struggle against these phenomena is one of the priorities of the FCS and its organs. Smuggling is associated with other grave crimes -- embezzlement, bribery, currency swindles, illegal crossings of the state border, and so on. Therefore your efforts here must be stepped up constantly. I am talking of exposing all the links of criminal chains, of tracking down international groups of smugglers and rendering them harmless. Close businesslike cooperation will be required between the FCS and customs organs, the Federal Border Service, and internal affairs organs. Unfortunately, the criminalization of society is continuing. Violent crimes by organized groups are acquiring forms of criminal terrorism. The growing corruptness of power structures and of law enforcement and other state organs is extremely dangerous to the state. Particularly in the sphere of the redistribution of property. Certain successes have been scored recently in the fight against crime. But the results, on the whole, are unsatisfactory. Just like the efforts of counterintelligence in this sphere. Organized crime is no longer limited to the sphere of ordinary criminal activity. It persistently seeks admission to big-time politics and access to the administration of the state and its regions. This is your problem. The FCS must counter such attempts with all its operational and operational-technical potential. In collaboration with the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and the Tax Police, it must expose criminal sources of funding for political campaigns, the links between statesmen and politicians and the organizers of criminal fraternities which seek to get their people into the organs of power, and, indeed, which are primed with funds from abroad. All the above applies in full measure also to the problems of the uncontrolled proliferation of firearms and narcotics. The task of the FCS' operational subdivisions is to take original, decisive, and at times even bold measures to eradicate these phenomena, which are extremely dangerous to society. Only thus can the ongoing situation be influenced for the better. I know that counterintelligence officers have always been distinguished by a creative, original, and unexpected approach to their work. This was and remains the supreme sign of professionalism, the object of your legitimate pride. To achieve a breakthrough in the struggle against the most dangerous manifestations of crime is a task that is worthy of you. But there is also another side to the fulfillment of this task. You and you colleagues to this day have to bear a heavy load of responsibility for the crimes of past security organs, which you did not commit. Above all for the mass repressions of Stalinism. Life changes, the state and people change, but the old alienation is evaporating too slowly. I think that it is precisely the active participation of the FCS in the struggle against crime -- this paramount danger to the ordinary citizen -- that will finally close this subject. Achieve a breakthrough in this field, protect Russians against crime, and, I am sure, they will thank you. The icy wall of fear and mistrust will crumble once and for all. I am confident that this is necessary not only to the counterintelligence service, but to Russian society as a whole. The FCS contains military counterintelligence subivisions. They have special tasks -- to know the situation in the Army, to protect it from those who want to get their hands on military secrets and facilities. The merits of military counterintelligence officers are considerable, but the results of their activity must be significantly more substantial. A special word on the proliferation of arms from Army dumps throughout the country. Now in Maritime Kray, now in Irkutsk, now in other regions, fires are breaking out in munition stores. Where are the advance warnings about violation of the conditions of the storage of munitions?! But perhaps the fires in the stores are no accident? And another question: From what stores are weapons being delivered to "hot" spots? Military counterintelligence must provide the answers. Russia's nuclear security is an extremely important, cardinal problem. The proliferation of nuclear and other categories of weapons of mass destruction within the country and beyond cannot be allowed. This is also our international obligation. I expect regular briefings from the counterintelligence service on all aspects of this problem. Special attention must be paid to anticipating and resolutely thwarting attempts to gain unauthorized access to nuclear components. There have been no cases of "nuclear terrorism" in Russia, and there must be none. The active formation of a state border is now under way in Russia. Counterintelligence is a component of the forces and resources needed to protect it. It is important that we maintain good-neighhborly relations with neighboring states. At the same time we are doing everything necessary to increase the security level of the borders and Russia's exclusive economic zone. We know that the situation on the Russian border is not peaceful at the moment. And there is vast scope for activity for you here. In the near future we will discuss questions of guarding our country's borders in the Security Council. I have no doubt that S.V. Stepashin, who is a permanent member of the council, will report what the FCS sees as the solution to border problems. I am well aware that tackling the complex tasks facing your service will make special demands on the people working here. A counterintelligence officer's work requires great resilience, the ability to think in an innovative way and to operate using initiative within tight time constraints, and under a great mental and physical load. This is why, in setting up the FCS and carrying out the professional certification [of personnel], I demanded a careful and attentive approach toward every staffer. A professional counterintelligence officer, especially a leader, is formed over many years. We cannot allow ourselves to take an irresponsible attitude toward any of you. All cases of superficial certification must be investigated very carefully. Worthy, committed, and energetic staffers must be brought into play in the work. Will the FCS be further reformed? This question is constantly asked by your colleagues. This is the answer: Yes, it will. But it is not a question of any new, radical shakeup but of changes which will take time. There is no country in the world in which a constant improvement of special services is not takiong place. Your department is no exception. There is one aim -- to increase the effectiveness of counterintelligence. When we embarked on breaking up the KGB, for political motives among other things, we by no means denied -- and do not deny -- the need for fairly reliable and close coordination of the work of the various former parts of it which have been divided into autonomous structures, as well as of the Armed Forces General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate [GRU]. We are thinking about what kind of collaboration mechanism there should be. Mainly it must obviously rely on bilateral relations and on forming operational groups to tackle certain tasks of one kind or another which include representatives of various special services. I have carefully considered the results of the meeting of your collegium together with the FIS directorate [direktorat] and have concluded that in this respect you are on the right road. In this auditorium I cannot fail to talk about the specific characteristics of local FCS organs. We take as our basis the principle that there cannot be a "Nizhniy Novgorod" or a "Maritime Kray" counterintelligence service. We have one counterintelligence service -- Russian counterintelligence, organized in a strict hierarchy, independent of local authorities. Under the constitution it is subordinate to the Russian president. This status does not preclude but presupposes close cooperation and mutual assistance between FCS subdivisions and the executive organs of republics, krays, and oblasts. Let me stress that priorities have been set. No distortions in ensuring regional security to the detriment of federal security are permissible. Otherwise both people unaware of what state security is and the FCS director will be held responsible. Very serious attention must be devoted to questions regarding the training of a new generation of counterintelligence officers. Today a counterintelligence potential is being developed which will give a return in five to 10 years. Programs for training and retraining personnel must be carefully reviewed. Prompt changes must be made in them in the light of the development of the legal and normative base and the clarification of priorities for the FCS' activity. You have everything necessary for this. I will also say a few words about the role of leaders. The indispensable requirements with regard to them are a high degree of professionalism, competency, responsibility, loyalty to the motherland, honesty and integrity, and the ability to make the collective follow their lead. Putting it in military terms, a leader must be prepared to give the command "Do as I do," and carry it out better than his subordinates. These are the kind of leaders and operatives we will support and create the necessary conditions for. But above all we will demand fruitful work. In talking about FCS personnel I cannot bypass the problem of their probity and incorruptibility. Everything must be done to ensure that the best traditions here are not only maintained but also strengthened. As regards this question the position of all leaders and personnel apparatuses must be a principled one. It has been reported to me that there are differences in the level of social protection for staffers of various special services and law-enforcement organs. And not in favor of FCS staffers. I will say frankly that I am against "leveling." But if it is a question of substantial distortions in the wages of different departments, we will rectify it. Your calling and your professional duty is to ensure the security of the individual, society, and the state. The main conditions for this are well known to all: Civil peace in Russia must be maintained and strengthened, revolutionary upheavals must be prevented, and the profound economic crisis must be overcome. We will be able to achieve this by consolidating our Russian state in action. The Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service is one of its important, inalienable institutions. Your service must be strong and have a flexible structure. Its extensive possibilities must be effectively used in the defense of Russians both in the country and abroad, in the defense of Russian interests against the aspirations of foreign intelligence services and other criminal encroachments. Therefore I firmly recommend -- get rid of achronisms. Therefore I demand: Act energetically, boldly, and decisively. I sincerely wish you success in your work, which is difficult and dangerous, but vitally necessary to Russia.
