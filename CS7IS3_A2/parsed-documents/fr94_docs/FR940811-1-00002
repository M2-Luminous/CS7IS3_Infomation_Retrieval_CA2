FR940811-1-00002 FR940811-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 90&hyph;ANE&hyph;22] Airworthiness Directives; Teledyne Continental Motors GTSIO&hyph;520 Series Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Proposed rule; withdrawal. SUMMARY: This action withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) GTSIO&hyph;520 series engines. That action would have required replacement of the crankshaft counterweights, including attaching hardware and the engine viscous damper. Since the issuance of the NPRM, TCM has issued a revision to the applicable Overhaul Manual, which specifies replacement of counterweights at overhaul. Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jerry Robinette, Aerospace Engineer, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, 1669 Phoenix Parkway, Suite 210C, Atlanta, GA 30349; telephone (404) 991&hyph;3810; fax (404) 991&hyph;3606. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to add a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) GTSIO&hyph;520 series engines, was published in the Federal Register on January 8, 1991 (56 FR 662). The proposed rule would have required the replacement of the crankshaft counterweights, including attaching hardware and the engine viscous damper in accordance with TCM Service Bulletin (SB) M90&hyph;12, dated August 21, 1990. That action was prompted by reports of engine failure due to distress of the crankshaft counterweight bushing and engine viscous damper. The proposed actions were intended to prevent an engine failure due to crankshaft failure. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received only 3 inflight service difficulty reports since 1989, indicative that distress of the crankshaft counterweight bushing and engine viscous damper is not a wide-spread problem that requires an AD. Also, TCM has issued a revision to the applicable overhaul manual, which specifies replacement of the crankshaft counterweights, including attaching hardware and the engine viscous damper at each overhaul, which was the interval specified in the proposed rule. The FAA has determined, based on TCM issuing the revision to the overhaul manual, and reviewing the service history, that the safety concerns are adequately addressed, and accordingly, the proposed rule is hereby withdrawn. Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future. Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and therefore, is not covered under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Withdrawal Accordingly, the notice of proposed rulemaking, Docket No. 90&hyph;ANE&hyph;22, published in the Federal Register on January 8, 1991, (56 FR 662), is withdrawn. Issued in Burlington, Massachusetts, on August 3, 1994. Jay J. Pardee, Manager, Engine and Propeller Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
