In the statement issued on their behalf, former Police Commissioner Gen Mike Geldenhuys said certain principles needed to be followed if Justice Minister Dullah Omar was serious in his intention to expose the truth in the interests of reconciliation. The first was that members of the ANC National Executive Committee, especially those serving in the government, set an example by disclosing their roles in the "planning, decision-making, policy, approval, instructions and acts which led to deeds of terror and death and mutilation of defenceless persons, including women and children". Gen Geldenhuys said a second principle was that all parties and persons who were guilty of unlawful acts during the political struggle be dealt with "in all respects in the same way". "The ANC and organisations which supported it cannot be excused on the grounds that they were conducting a so-called freedom struggle," the generals said. Other principles included that basic justice should prevail and that the charter of fundamental human rights be upheld properly; that the activities of all organisations that played a role in undermining law and order and in promoting terrorism, as well as the misuse of funds collected for welfare purposes, be investigated; and that the police, defence force and national intelligence service disclose all available information and documentation they have in that regard. Gen Geldenhuys said it was of vital importance that the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed truth commission and its contribution to the reconciliation process be considered carefully. It needed to be questioned whether the consequences of the commission's investigations would bring about division, distrust, bitterness and the rejection of political leaders and the security forces. The statement was issued by Gen Geldenhuys on behalf of Freedom Front Leader Gen Constand Viljoen and Generals J P Gous, Gideon Joubert, Gertjie Prinsloo, Johan Coetzee, Hennie de Witt, Jannie Geldenhuys and Kat Liebenberg.
