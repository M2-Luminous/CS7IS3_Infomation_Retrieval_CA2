FBIS4-52282 "dreas089_d_94039" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 9 May 1994 South Korea Samsung Group `Tense' About Car Industry Plans Samsung Group `Tense' About Car Industry Plans SK0905062594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0535 GMT 9 May 94 SK0905062594 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- The Samsung business group is reportedly tense about potential government disapproval of the group's advancement into the car industry. The country's biggest business group is poised to submit its contract on technology cooperation with Nissan of Japan to the government. If Samsung wins state approval, it can jump into the automaking industry. Samsung group chairman Yi Kon-hui suddenly postponed his Southeast Asian tour on Sunday and Samsung heavy industries officials held an emergency meeting during the weekend to study the government's possible moves. "The government had hinted that it wanted us to give up our automaking project several times and Chairman Yi's postponement of his overseas tour must have something to do with that," a Samsung executive said. Senior government officials, offering their own opinions, have often told company managers in private that Samsung's entry into the auto industry was inappropriate, he said. But Samsung officials say they cannot understand why the government is making a series of remarks against its car project when the group has not even submitted the technology import application yet. Samsung is trying its best to read the government's mind and to find out whether the recent remarks reflect its true feelings. If the government's disapproval turns out to be true, the group may nevertheless submit its technology import application to show it has not given up and will try again. But group moderates say they should get the government's message considering it is the country's biggest business group and therefore must maintain good relations with the government. Another dilemma for Samsung is whether to announce it is giving up the car project before the government officially registers its disapproval. Both are painful steps for the group. If it challenges the government by pressing ahead with its plans, there is room for the group to fight back if the government says no. If it gives up voluntarily, the pride of the business giant will be hurt but in the long run, it can expect better relations with the government. Samsung is said to be most worried about its status at home and abroad. The group has so far put up the invincible image that Samsung can do anything if it only puts its mind to it. Surrendering its automaking ambitions could also dampen Chairman Yi's reform project as well as hurt the company's pride, which is exactly why Samsung executives are strongly protesting the government's implicit disapproval. One executive questions the government's stress on raising the country's competitiveness when at the same time it interferes with company activities. He says the government has no legal grounds to disapprove of Samsung's automaking project.
