FR941219-2-00175 FR941219-2-00095 With respect to the remaining noncompliances, those that might not be discernible to the naked eye, GM cites NHTSA's previous grants of inconsequentiality petitions based upon the agency's conclusion that a change in luminous intensity of approximately 25 percent must occur before the human eye can discern a difference. Three-quarters of GM's noncompliant lamps probably are said to have a noncompliance in luminous intensity that does not exceed 20 percent of Figure 10's specifications. GM has correctly noted NHTSA's position on the effect of deviations in luminous intensity. Additional support for that position has been provided in a recent report ``Driver Perception of Just-Noticeable Differences of Automotive Signal Lamp Intensities'' (DTNH22&hyph;92&hyph;D&hyph;07002) which found that 25 percent is a reasonable criterion for use in inconsequentiality decisions. Accordingly, the applicant has met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliance herein described is inconsequential to safety, and General Motors Corporation is hereby exempted from the notification requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30118 and the remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30120.
