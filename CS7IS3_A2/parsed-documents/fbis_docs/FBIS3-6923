The will of heaven and punishment by heaven mean the intention of heaven and divine retribution. This proverb contains a historic lesson that the people's will is just and if one objects to the people's demand, one cannot avoid punishment by heaven. The disgraceful destiny of successive South Korean ruling groups clearly illustrates the consequences that were brought to one who objected to the will of the popular masses. The successive South Korean ruling groups frantically ran amok with maneuvers of a northward war of aggression by carrying outside forces on its back and implemented a cruel fascist rule. The act of the South Korean ruling groups went against the demand of the people who were aspiring to independence, democracy and reunification. The South Korean ruling groups reigned over the popular masses and ran wild with oppression. What was their destiny? We think that you, the soldiers of the South Korean Army, are well aware of it. The successive South Korean ruling groups were overthrown because they only committed traitorous acts, going against the people's will and the nation's aspirations. The civilian-veiled traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique is objecting to the will of the popular masses and the nation's demand more viciously than successive South Korean ruling bunches. The most urgent demand of our people and nation at present is achievement of the peaceful reunification of the country. Our people, who suffered pains of division for nearly half a century, cannot live being separated from each other any longer and are looking forward to national reunification even in dreams. To achieve the nation's peaceful reunification -- our people's long-cherished desire -- war exercises must be suspended on the Korean peninsula. However, the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique is waging exercises of a northward war of aggression every day by carrying outside forces on its back by challenging the people's desire for reunification, and is driving you, the soldiers of the South Korean Army, into these exercises. You, the soldiers of the South Korean Army, should not traverse the road of objecting the people's will by following the order of the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique. History is the course of achieving the demand of the popular masses. No strength can block our people's desire for national reunification. The traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique, which challenged our people's desire for national reunification, will be judged by history and will not be able to avoid the collapse. You, the soldiers of the South Korean Army, who are the young men of Korea, should not spoil your destiny by traversing the road of objecting the people's intention on the side of traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique. You, the soldiers in the 3d Battalion, 51st Regiment, 12th Division of the puppet Army, who are barely keeping up your bodies being driven into various exercises and hard work, and you, the soldiers in the 1st Battalion, 63d Regiment, 11th Division of the puppet Army, who witnessed the death of colleagues caused by accidents during training some time ago, should deeply examine yourselves who have fallen into disaster and misfortune. If you want to get rid of the miserable situation, you should travel the road of patriotism on which you can share the intention of the people. This is the very hope of your parents and brothers, and is the nation's demand. You, the soldiers of the South Korean Army, should rise on the road of patriotism to share the intention of the people and should seek a genuine life.
