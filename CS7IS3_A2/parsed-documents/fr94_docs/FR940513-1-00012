FR940513-1-00012 FR940513-1-00003 The Order requires importers of porcine animals to pay USCS, upon importation, the assessment of 0.35 percent of the animal's declared value and importers of pork and pork products to pay USCS, upon importation, the assessment of 0.35 percent of the market value of the live porcine animals from which such pork and pork products were produced. This proposed rule would increase the assessments on all of the imported pork and pork products subject to assessment listed in 7 CFR 1230.110 (September 8, 1993; 58 FR 47205). This increase is consistent with the increase in the annual average price of domestic barrows and gilts for calendar year 1993 as reported by USDA, AMS, Livestock and Grain Market News (LGMN) Branch. This increase in assessments would make the equivalent market value of the live porcine animal from which the imported pork and pork products were derived reflect the recent increase in the market value of domestic porcine animals, thereby promoting comparability between importer and domestic assessments. This proposed rule would not change the current assessment rate of 0.35 percent of the market value. The methodology for determining the per-pound amounts for imported pork and pork products was described in the Supplementary Information accompanying the Order and published in the September 5, 1986, Federal Register at 51 FR 31901. The weight of imported pork and pork products is converted to a carcass weight equivalent by utilizing conversion factors which are published in the USDA Statistical Bulletin No. 616 ``Conversion Factors and Weights and Measures.'' These conversion factors take into account the removal of bone, weight lost in cooking or other processing, and the nonpork components of pork products. Secondly, the carcass weight equivalent is converted to a live animal equivalent weight by dividing the carcass weight equivalent by 70 percent, which is the average dressing percentage of porcine animals in the United States. Thirdly, the equivalent value of the live porcine animal is determined by multiplying the live animal equivalent weight by an annual average market price for barrows and gilts as reported by USDA, AMS, LGMN Branch. The annual average price, which was based on price data from seven major markets, is now based on only six markets. One of the seven markets_Kansas City_closed in 1991; and thus the 1992 and 1993 annual average prices are based on price data from only six markets. This average price is published on a yearly basis during the month of January in LGMN Branch's publication ``Livestock, Meat, and Wool Weekly Summary and Statistics.'' Finally, the equivalent value is multiplied by the applicable assessment rate of 0.35 percent due on imported pork and pork products. The end result is expressed in an amount per pound for each type of pork or pork product. To determine the amount per kilogram for pork and pork products subject to assessment under the Act and Order, the cent-per-pound assessments are multiplied by a metric conversion factor 2.2046 and carried to the sixth decimal. The formula in the preamble for the Order at 51 FR 31901 contemplated that it would be necessary to recalculate the equivalent live animal value of imported pork and pork products to reflect changes in the annual average price of domestic barrows and gilts to maintain equity of assessments between domestic porcine animals and imported pork and pork products. The average annual market price increased from $42.11 in 1992 to $45.32 in 1993, an increase of about 7 percent. This increase would result in a corresponding increase in assessments for all HTS numbers listed in the table in ยง1230.110 of an amount equal to two-hundredths of a cent per pound, or as expressed in cents per kilogram, four-hundredths of a cent per kilogram. Based on the most recent available Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census, data on the total dollar value of imported pork and pork products subject to the assessment in 1993 the proposed increase in assessment amounts would result in an estimated $143,000 increase in assessments over a 12-month period. USCS recently revised HTS numbers to conform with changes in importation procedures. The change is only a minor technical change which revises all HTS numbers for live porcine animals, pork, and pork products listed in the table found at ยง1230.110 (58 FR 47205) by changing them from 11 digit numbers to 10 digit numbers by dropping the last digit. The live porcine animals, pork, and pork products subject to assessment and HTS article descriptions listed in a chart contained in the Supplementary Information section on page 15914 of the final rule (54 FR 15914) would not change. A comparison of the 11 digit numbers and the proposed 10 digit numbers are listed in the following chart.
