FBIS4-43 "cr00000023494001" 22 April 1994 FBIS FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-053-ALGERIA ALGERIAN ABSTRACTS # 6 ALGERIAN ABSTRACTS # 6 The following summaries highlight information on the security situation from articles that appeared in the Algiers and Paris French-language press. 'Afghan' Smugglers from Maghnia Group on Trial According to EL WATAN of 13 February and LE SOIR D'ALGERIE of 14 February, the July 1993 arrest of Oumansour Lakhdar has now led to the arrest of Bouzi Boumediene and to the dismanteling of the Maghnia Group, which operated along the Moroccan- Algerian border, in the Sidi Bel-Abbes Wilaya. In addition to smuggling weapons, the group helped 'Afghan' Algerians re-enter the country clandestinely and then trained them in subversion and urban guerilla warfare. The newspapers reported that 55 members of the group were charged with the formation of an armed terrorist group, possession and sale of military weapons and explosives, and attacks on state security. Of those charged, 21 are in custody, 22 are still at large, and 12 are out on bail. According to ALGER REPUBLICAIN of 15 February, Maghnia Group member Boumediene Bouzi has been sentenced to eight years in prison and the forfeiture of his civil rights for five years. Bouzi was charged with assisting the clandestine return of 'Afghan' Algerians and using his motorcycle to smuggle weapons, some of which were discovered in the Boukanoun mosque along the Algerian-Moroccan border near the Moroccan village of Ahfir. According to LE SOIR, investigators found 45 kg of potassium chlorate, 20 sticks of gelignite (explosives), and 180 meters of detonator wire in the mosque and in a cache near Oued-Kiss. Lakhdar's arrest also reportedly led police to another arms cache near Oued-Kiss consisting of two Uzi submachine guns, a Scorpio submachine gun (made in Israel) equipped with a silencer, a 6-mm pistol, a transmitter, and binoculars. The ALGER REPUBLICAIN article further stated that Mustapha Lahsani, Bachir Laalaj, and Mohamed Lakbir Dadi were sentenced to three years in prison, Salah Kheireddine to 18 months' imprisonment, and Abdelkader Fadal to one year in jail. (Fadal had been sentenced to death in an earlier trial in absentia.) Ten others were condemned to three years prison without possibility of parole, while 18 individuals were acquitted. Security Situation in Blida EL WATAN and LIBERTE of 21 March reported that the "tense" situation in Blida was beginning to subside following an "energetic" operation by security forces in the region. According to the LIBERTE article, armed Islamists had fostered a climate of fear among the town's residents, imposing their own rules of conduct, such as mandatory wearing of the hijab and a ban on smoking. Some citizens downplayed these reports, stating that "rumors have been blown out of proportion. Initially people panicked, but today women are becoming more confident. My women colleagues continue to dress normally." Both LIBERTE and EL WATAN reported that on 19 March the People's National Army moved into Blida. According to the LIBERTE article, "it seemed as though security services in the absence of the government had taken things into their own hands." EL WATAN described Blida as completely controlled by police and army: all intersections were monitored by the army and all stores were officially ordered to close. According to the EL WATAN article, the fact that newspapers have reappeared is an indication that the situation has normalized. On 6 April, Paris daily LE MONDE reported the comments of several eyewitnesses to events in Blida around 20 March. According to the LE MONDE report, Islamists began imposing orders in December, for example, ordering transport companies to separate men and women or have their vehicles burned. One witness recounted that the military threatened people over loudspeakers to "denounce Islamists who had painted slogans on the walls." A few nights later, military units, nicknamed "the parachutists" arrived in force from bases in Laghouat and Biskra. Another witness added that these soldiers broke down doors of those "too afraid to open them." She added that six young people taken from her building by force were found dead the following day, some "riddled with bullets," others tortured. According to the LE MONDE article, this "major military blow" could have been to revenge the death of six officers killed 18 March, or to "prepare" for the visit of Interior Minister Selim Saadi to Blida on 22 March. According to a doctor quoted in LE MONDE, "if you call people living in Blida they will say nothing. Citizens think their phone lines are tapped. Officially nothing happened." (For additional reporting, see 94AFO145D "Life in Blida; Citizens Held Hostage," in the JPRS Near East/South Asia Report.) New Type of Street Killers EL WATAN of 9 March reported that a new type of "young killer" has emerged. Security services recently arrested high school students who are reportedly implicated in "terrorist" acts and who belong to armed groups operating in the outskirts of Algiers. The "new breed" of killers are described as "inconspicuous," approximately 16 to 22 years old, and generally fashionably dressed. In several cases under investigation, the age of the killers is rather young. Asselah Ahmed, head of the fine arts school, and his son were killed by two "terrorists' between 15 and 18, according to witnesses. After the killing, the 'terrorists' could not be distinguished from other students and were able to enter the school and disappear. In another case, security services arrested high school students in Kharchela who had planted a bomb in their own schoolyard. An assassination victim, Vincent Grau, was also reportedly killed by a 15 to 18 year old boy.
