FBIS4-28906 "dreas114_d_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 South Korea Reaction to DPRK's Reported IAEA Withdrawal Reaction to DPRK's Reported IAEA Withdrawal No `Written Notification' SK1406011494 Seoul YONHAP in English 0107 GMT 14 Jun 94 SK1406011494 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Berlin, June 14 (YONHAP) -- North Korea, which announced it would quit the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Monday, has yet to officially notify the agency of the decision, IAEA officials said. In addition, Pyongyang has not sent written notification to the United States, the depository country for the IAEA statitutes. North Korea's withdrawal does not take effect according to international law unless the country sends written notification to the United States and then the IAEA Secretariat gives an authoritative interpretation to effect this notification. But since North Korea's nuclear safeguards agreement holds unless it leaves the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), its announced withdrawal from the IAEA carries symbolic meaning of defying the IAEA sanctions resolution rather than any practical significance. The IAEA Board of Governors passed a sanctions resolution against North Korea on Friday with overwhelming support. The resolution provides for an immediate halt to IAEA technical assistance totaling 500,000-600,000 dollars a year to Pyongyang. The agency is studying North Korea's reason for announcing its withdrawal and will monitor the stalinist state's follow-up steps. The North has apparently not restricted the activities of the IAEA inspection team currently in Yongbyon, but is likely to act soon after announcing it can no longer guarantee the continuity of nuclear safeguards, according to IAEA officials.
