There is also evidence of concrete steps being taken to make this so. Thus, Russian Army insignia have been issued to the members of some units of the Black Sea Fleet, such as, for example, the naval infantry brigade. This process is continuing: Military personnel serving in the Black Sea Fleet are being made to change into Russian uniforms. Not too long ago, Russia's St. Andrew's flag was raised on auxiliary vessels and some warships in Sevastopol. As a matter of fact, these flags have still not been lowered. This is a violation of Article 7 of the Yalta agreements, which stipulates that the naval insignia of the Black Sea Fleet is defined and approved jointly by the presidents of Ukraine and Russia. These and many other facts attest that the various conflicts and misunderstandings that emerge result primarily from violations of the Yalta agreements and an unwillingness to abide by these agreements. Many officials of the Russian Federation and Crimea, as well as the Ministry of Defense and the Naval Forces, tend to view the protocol of intent, signed by President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine and President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation in Massandra, as an agreement that is now void, and they insist that all problems be settled solely on the basis of the Massandra documents. As we know, these documents stated that the Ukrainian side was prepared to consider the Russian Federation's proposals that Ukraine hand over her portion of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia as payment of Ukraine's debt for energy supplies. To consider the possibility, but not to hand over her portion of the Fleet. As to the handing over of the infrastructure, this was out of the question from the beginning -- this territory belongs to Ukraine and it will not be handed over. The specific mechanisms of compensation for that part of the Fleet that was to be handed over and the question of Russia's use of naval bases on the territory of Ukraine were to be decided in the course of future negotiations on the basis of recommendations submitted by commissions of experts from both sides. But this question remained unresolved because no mutually acceptable solution was found. We, therefore, return to our earlier positions. Referring to this problem, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko in a recent interview with Interfax-Ukraine stated that future talks on the Black Sea Fleet should be based primarily on the Yalta agreements of 3 August 1992. According to these agreements, the Black Sea Fleet is to serve as a basis for the creation of the Russian Navy and the Naval Forces of Ukraine. While these are being created, the Fleet remains under the joint command of the presidents of both countries. Thus, during this transitional period, that is until its status is finally decided at the highest state level, this Fleet belongs to both states. Ukraine and Russia have equal rights to the Fleet. The Fleet is bound to defend the interests of both states to an equal degree. One might have thought that the Black Sea Fleet would serve as the basis on which the two sides would achieve mutual understanding and draw closer together. It is the duty of the command of the Black Sea Fleet and all its command structures to educate its military personnel and its blue- and white-collar workers in a spirit of love and respect for Russia and Ukraine in equal measure and to foster the same attitude towards both. It needs to do everything in its power to ensure that every sailor, sergeant, petty officer [starshyna] warrant officer [michman i praporshchyk], officer, and admiral, every blue- and white-collar worker, is deeply aware that he may not and has neither the legal nor the moral right to disregard the interests of either side by his actions and his conduct, because for the time being he serves both sides. That is why it is sad, to say the least, to hear a high-ranking commander, who should set an example of this attitude, making statements that "the fleet of Ukraine is the fleet of a foreign state." It should have long since been clear that, whatever the ultimate future of the Black Sea Fleet might be, under no circumstances should attitudes that are negative towards Ukraine in even the slightest degree be encouraged in this Fleet. This is the country where this Fleet is based, and the Fleet should comply unconditionally with this country's laws, both during this transitional period and in the future. That is how it should be. This is in the spirit of the Yalta agreements. And if everyone in the Black Sea Fleet understood this problem thus, there would be no situations that lead to conflicts. In practice, things are quite different. We know that all agreements reached with respect to the Black Sea Fleet, beginning with the agreement in Dagomys on 23 June 1992, do not nullify but rather supplement one another in defining the legal mechanism for dividing up the Black Sea Fleet. From the beginning, taking into account Russia's interests on the Black Sea, Ukraine has been meticulously fulfilling the obligations she assumed. However, immediately following the meeting of the two presidents in Dagomys, there began an attempt to artifically exacerbate the problems of the Fleet. First, they declared the Black Sea Fleet to be the fleet of all the CIS members, charged with the "defense of the southern borders of the Slavic states." Then, rejecting all military theoretical concepts, they declared it to be a strategic fleet, yet forgetting to identify what and whose strategy they had in mind. When it proved impossible to sustain this myth, they began to plant the notion in people's minds through the mass media that the Fleet belonged exclusively to Russia. Moreover, this unwholesome propaganda uproar is supported by raising the Russian flag, adopting Russian insignia, etc. As a member of the military, it is difficult for me to believe that the Black Sea Fleet command cannot put an end to these excesses. This looks more like an unwillingness to bring order to the situation or a deliberately planned action. The position of the Black Sea Fleet command is further attested by the fact that it does not regard the laws of Ukraine and the orders and directives of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine as documents that must be obeyed, while the orders of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and of the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy of the Russian Federation are carried out unconditionally and fully. The fact that it is subordinated solely to the presidents of Ukraine and Russia and not to the ministries of defense of the two countries is cited by the command of the Black Sea Fleet only when it is refusing to carry out some request made by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. Recently, the level of combat readiness of the units and formations of the Black Sea Fleet has been unilaterally raised without informing the Ukrainian side. The Fleet is perfecting amphibious assault operations [vidpratsyovuyutsya desantni operatsiyi], dozens of ships are being put out to sea, and some are even being sent to the shores of other states. These large-scale operations are being conducted on Ukrainian territory and on Ukrainian bases without any kind of coordination with Ukraine. The level of these activities increased markedly during the presidential election in Crimea. This was anything but "innocent military training," as the Black Sea Fleet tried to represent; this was a purposeful and planned action. Especially, inasmuch as it was accompanied by a build-up of social tensions with the help of the mass media. Strange as it may seem, the Black Sea Fleet conducted itself in this situation as if these events were not developing and taking place on the erritory, bases, and in the waters of sovereign Ukraine. It is difficult to imagine the naval forces of any country, based on the territory of another state, behaving in such fashion with complete disregard for the laws and interests of the host country. There is no precedent for such conduct anywhere else in the world. If the Black Sea Fleet acknowledges that it is an operational formation [operatyvne formuvannya] of both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, it is completely incomprehensible why such measures are conducted without the knowledge and approval of the Ukrainian side. And it is even more incomprehensible why the Black Sea Fleet's operations plan is approved in Moscow rather than in both capitals. Nor can I ignore the following problem. Various mass media are spreading false information that Ukraine is violating the agreements on financing the Black Sea Fleet. Publishing data from the last few months, when Russia's share has indeed been larger than Ukraine's, the authors of these reports and broadcasts deliberately keep silent about the fact that Ukraine financed the Black Sea Fleet one hundred percent through all of 1992 and up to May 1993, and that Russia has not settled its accounts with Ukraine to this day. Ukraine also pays the pensions and provides various social benefits to the military personnel of the Black Sea Fleet. Another fact that has received no publicity is that the Russian side is violating the agreements by financing the Black Sea Fleet through its own commercial structures rather than through the National Bank of Ukraine. That is the reason for the irregularities and delays in issuing payments. This attitude towards people is totally unjustified. As before, the legitimate desire of many servicemen in the Black Sea Fleet to take the loyalty oath to the people of Ukraine, in other words, one of the states to whom the Black Sea Fleet belongs and on whose territory it is based, the home of its sailors and their families, is perceived as a hostile act. There ave been instances, by no means isolated, in which such officers and warrant officers [michmany i praporshchyky] were dismissed from their posts by order, kicked out by the naval infantry [vykydaly za porih sylamy morskoyi pikhoty], and even discharged into the reserves, declared oath breakers, and so on. Such actions are confirmed by the most recent instance, in which the military personnel at the hospital base in Mykolayiv, who had taken a loyalty oath to the people of Ukraine, were dismissed on the spot from their jobs. Justice was done, however, and these servicemen received protection and were declared to be part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Yet Article 7 of the signed protocol, which regulates the procedure for transferring (assigning) military personnel from one country's armed forces to the forces of another state, stipulates that the parties to the agreement will not hinder the transfer of officers and warrant officers. The Yalta and other agreements provide for mutual obligations on the part of Russia and Ukraine to protect all the rights of servicemen in this respect and allow them complete freedom of choice. We witnessed a series of other serious situations that disturbed not only members of the military but also the residents of the city. These occurred when housing was being divided between the Black Sea Fleet and the Naval Forces of Ukraine, when the question of supplying heat to the village of Holandiya was being decided, when there were unsanctioned flights by airplanes of the Black Sea Fleet in violation of existing regulations, and when our fuel was seized from the fuel storage base in Sevastopol. It is no secret that the personnel of the Black Sea Fleet take part in various political actions, thereby violating the laws of both Ukraine and Russia. Currently, this type of activity is very much on the rise. Lately, the Black Sea Fleet command has taken discriminatory steps in providing medical care for the personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, including Ukraine's Naval Forces. How do we propose to solve this situation, first and foremost with respect to Sevastopol? We believe that the structure of the military command in Sevastopol should be changed immediately so that the garrison chief is appointed directly by the president of Ukraine. This should be an admiral or a general, who would take his orders solely from the president of Ukraine and who would be a member of the city's military commission and collegium. The commandants' offices [komendatury], hospital, polyclinics, all building and maintenance services, the military trade facility [voyentorh], and the sports and cultural institutions of the Black Sea Fleet and the Naval Forces of Ukraine should be placed under his command. The services under his command should serve all the military units in Sevastopol but be independent of both the Black Sea Fleet and the Naval Forces of Ukraine. The garrison chief should be in charge of the subunit, the regime service [sluzhba rezhymu], and other garrison facilities. Working closely with the administration of internal affairs and the Security Service of Ukraine, he and the structures placed under his command would then be able to safeguard genuine order in the city and prevent any conflicts. The problems associated with basing ships in Sevastopol are also extremely important. In order to solve all the problems presented by relations between the two military entities, a structure needs to be created that would be independent of both the Black Sea Fleet and the Naval Forces of Ukraine -- the Sevastopol Naval Base [SVMB]. On the basis of an agreement, the SVMB could provide basing in Sevastopol for both the Russian and Ukrainian fleets, and, if necessary, also the fleets of other CIS members. It would be the task of the SVMB to provide all the necessary facilities for basing. In our view, this solution would remove the tension between Russia and Ukraine regarding Sevastopol and the basing of their fleets. The Black Sea Fleet is a structure of the former USSR. Article 1 of the Yalta agreement states that it is to be divided between Russia and Ukraine so that it can serve as a basis on which the Naval Forces of Ukraine and the Navy of the Russian Federation will be created on the Black Sea. In order to establish the Naval Forces of Ukraine, we need bases and funds for both general and specific -- i.e. fleet -- purposes. This is why it is very important to abide unconditionally by the joint agreement between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on acknowledging and regulating property relations by both sides. The agreement stipulates that all property of the Black Sea Fleet and its bases, both real and movable, is to be used in equal parts (50-50) by both states, Ukraine and Russia. There is currently a process under way to downsize the Black Sea Fleet, and as part of this process, various materal assets are being leased to commercial structures and private individuals. The sale of the transport ship Donbass serves as an excellent example of what is happening. The vessel was sold at one-tenth of its real value. The agreement does not permit such actions without the approval of Ukraine's state structures and her Naval Forces. But this approval is not sought, which results in serious losses to Ukraine and her Naval Forces. This unsupervised process of squandering the material assets of the Black Sea Fleet has been going on for more than two years. This is confirmed by the large number of criminal cases that have been brought. That is why today the question of dividing up the Black Sea Fleet cannot be dealt with without a special preliminary investigation and the necessary preparations. A commission must be formed to determine what assets the Black Sea Fleet had on 6 December 1991, that is, up to the date of the proclamation of sovereignty by Ukraine, and what has happened to these assets since then. The Russian and Ukrainian people should be told the whole truth about the losses they have suffered. The second stage in the implementation of the Yalta agreements on dividing up the Black Sea Fleet should consist of removing those ships and armaments from combatant service that have completed their service life and putting them up for sale. Only those armaments should be retained that are needed in the new circumstances and that are capable of ensuring that the two fleets are able to carry out their assigned missions. As part of the third and final stage, it is necessary to divide up what remains, but taking into account the portion that was sold or removed from Ukraine. Throughout the entire transitional period, that is, until the end of 1995, Sevastopol must remain the main base of both the Naval Forces of Ukraine and the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation until Russia solves the problem of creating a base on its own territory. In conclusion, I would like to encourage those who persist in driving a wedge between Ukraine and the Russian Federation to reread again and again the Yalta and other agreements on the Black Sea Fleet that were reached at the highest interstate level. All these agreements are imbued with a spirit of friendship and mutual respect between the two states and a desire to maintain equal relations between them, founded on the norms and principles of international law. This example is worthy of emulation. Common sense tells us that this is the only viable approach. This approach also reflects the fraternal spirit and good-neighbor relations which the two people have always maintained. Unquestionably, the implementation of the Yalta agreements will continue to promote this relationship. The future lies in just such relations, no matter what kind of misunderstandings we are currently experiencing. Those who stand in the way of the development and firm establishment of such relations are doing serious harm to both Russia and Ukraine. And it is difficult to say whom they are harming more. Those who sow the seeds of enmity and distrust between people will never grow and reap a good harvest. For there to be understanding between people, there must be a desire for such understanding.
