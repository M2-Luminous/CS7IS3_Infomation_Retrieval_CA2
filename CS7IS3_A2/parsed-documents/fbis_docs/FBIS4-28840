The ostensible reason for North Korea's withdrawal is to repulse the IAEA resolution against North Korea. It can be further interpreted that North Korea will not respond to the international community's demand for the assurance of nuclear transparency for the time being even if the UN Security Council imposes sanctions. However, it is early to determine whether the measure would extend to North Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. According to international law, a country which has withdrawn from the IAEA could be free from obligations as a NPT member state within 24 hours. It is highly probable that North Korea would withdraw from the NPT judging from North Korea's announcement that it refuses all IAEA inspections and would regard the IAEA's demand for inspections as a declaration of war. The government authorities provide two different interpretations on North Korea's strong measure. Since sanctions by the international community are inevitable anyway, North Korea intends to be free from the restrictions of international organizations and proceed with the development of nuclear weapons with its existing plutonium. The withdrawal from the IAEA means that North Korea would not accept any ad hoc, routine, or special inspections on its past nuclear activities and would not be restricted by any international organizations regarding its future nuclear programs. On the other hand, some people believe that it is one of North Korea's brinkmanship strategies to maximize the effect of the nuclear card. North Korea estimates that even though it becomes a nonmember of the IAEA, it could continue behind-the-scene negotiations with the United States to accomplish its goals and then return to the IAEA again. North Korea believes only a strong measure could bring about a rapid development of its relations with the United States. North Korea may be gambling on reversing the situation, in which it has brought on international sanctions by continuing the refueling, with a single blow. The withdrawal may reflect North Korea's intention to gain the third round of talks with the United States or at least proceed with the development of nuclear weapons taking hostage the ROK which wants "to avoid war by all means." North Korea's reaction has such a complex background that its focus will be revealed only after the follow-up measures, possibly the withdrawal from the NPT or deporting of IAEA inspectors, are taken. There is a strong prospect that North Korea's intention may be revealed through former U.S. President Carter, who is scheduled to pay a personal visit to the North on 15 June.
