The healthy nature of the growth led by the manufacturing industry and facility investment, compared with the overheating in the construction sector and consumption in the 1980s and early 1990s, brightens economic prospects even more, BOK officials said after studying the tentative estimate. Accordingly, the central bank raised its forecast for this year's economic growth to above 7 percent from last December's 6.3 percent, but voiced fears of economic overheating due to shaky prices and increasing consumption. GNP was 51.48 trillion won in terms of 1990 constant prices (63. 8 billion U.S. dollars in current exchange rate) in the first quarter of the year, up 8.8 percent from 47.43 trillion won a year earlier. The growth is the highest since 10.7 percent in April-June 1991 while the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) also soared 9.1 percent during this period, again the most since the second quarter of 1991. Facility investment and a recovery in the manufacturing sector were major contributors to the better-than-expected economic growth in the first months of the year. Due to high hopes of an economic rebound, facility investment surged 20.2 percent, the highest since 23.7 percent in January-March 1988, thanks to 21.3-percent growth solely in machinery. Manufacturing grew 9.8 percent, the most since 11.5 percent in the winter of 1991, with the light industry increasing 1.2 percent for the first time since spring 1992 and the heavy and chemical industry rising 13.2 percent. Electric, gas, and water works rose 16.1 percent: service, 10.3 percent, and construction, 8.2 percent. Agriculture and forestry, which decreased 6.8 percent last winter, rebounded with 4.8-percent growth. Commodity and service exports increased 8.9 percent. External conditions look good, with an improved world economy and a strong yen, and facility investment at home should be active, BOK Governor Kim Myong-ho said. Should this trend continue, the domestic economy may well rise above 7 percent this year, he said. But there are signs of economic overheating. Consumption in January-March hit 3.3 percent and the current- account deficit surged four times to 2.52 billion U.S. dollars from a year earlier with imports on the rise. Household consumption also hit 6.9 percent, the highest since 7. 1 percent in April-June 1992.
