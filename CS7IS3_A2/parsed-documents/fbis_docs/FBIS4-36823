The sources said that U.S. Ambassador in Beirut Mark Hambley conveyed that ultimatum to the senior Lebanese officials he met with in the past few days, pointing out that Israel's ultimatum was in reply to Hizballah leaders' declarations that they would retaliate to the Israeli raid on 'Ayn Kawkab camp near Ba'labakk last week with suicide operations inside [Israel] and abroad. The raid left 35-40 Hizballah members dead, of whom 27 have been named, and 70 others injured. The ultimatum, as conveyed by the American side, was that no Hizballah position in Lebanon would be safe, and it held the Lebanese Government responsible. The sources told AL-HAYAH that the ultimatum was repeated by Uri Lubrani, head of the Israeli delegation to the negotiations with Lebanon, in statements he made the day before yesterday threatening a relentless war if Lebanon continued to embrace Hizballah. Senior Lebanese officials said they feared a major Israeli operation in the coming days as a consequence of that ultimatum and Lubrani's warnings. They have been concerned, particularly as the Western states and the United States clearly opposed their desire to have the Security Council issue a statement condemning Israel's violation of Lebanese sovereignty when it launched these raids last week.
