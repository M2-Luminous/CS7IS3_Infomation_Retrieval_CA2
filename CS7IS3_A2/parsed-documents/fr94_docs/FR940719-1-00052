FR940719-1-00052 FR940719-1-00015 During the informational meetings and later discussions, the Agency was also requested to clarify the application of paragraph (c) of this standard. Some of the comments concerned whether underground electrical circuits must be deenergized while tests of fan signal devices and automatic closing doors are performed. Questions also arose as to whether anyone could be in the mine during the tests and whether a complete §75.360 preshift examination is required following the tests before anyone could enter the mine. The proposal clarifies the Agency's intent in paragraphs (c) and (d) of the existing §75.312. The 31-day tests are to determine if the alarm activates properly and, in multiple-fan systems, whether the automatic doors, if required, close. Although fan stoppages for these tests are normally of short duration, it must be recognized that on rare occasions difficulty may be encountered in restarting the fans. Therefore, the Agency has determined that it is not advisable to allow miners underground during tests when the fan is stopped unless concurrent activities are scheduled that are necessary to evaluate the effect of the fan stoppage or restart, or to perform maintenance or repair work that cannot otherwise be done while the fan is operating. Another commenter continued to express concern that monthly stoppage of fans for testing can cause undue stress on the fans. MSHA has received assurances from fan manufacturers that stopping the fans monthly to test the signal device will not cause undue stress on fans. The Agency has also recently received assurances from motor manufacturers that monthly stoppage of fans will not harm fan motors. The Agency solicits comments on this issue as well as on any other aspect of paragraphs (c) and (d). The Agency has received requests for clarification as to whether fans stopped for testing must be completely stopped during the 31-day tests. The purpose of the standard is to assure proper operation of the alarm and doors when a fan fails. Under certain conditions, such as with a substantial natural ventilating pressure, the fan blades may continue to rotate indefinitely. However, after power has been removed and the fan is in the process of stopping, once the alarm sounds and the doors close, the test has been successfully completed and the fan may be restarted even though the fan blades may not have become motionless. Recognizing that the duration of these tests is normally short, the proposal does not require underground electrical circuits to be deenergized unless the fan cannot be restarted within 15 minutes or unless persons are permitted underground in accordance with §75.311(b)(1). In accordance with longstanding practice, as indicated by a review of fan stoppage plans and consistent with existing §75.313, an examination as described in §75.360 (b) through (e) would be required if the fan is not restarted within 15 minutes. The Agency believes that after 15 minutes, additional action is needed to protect miners from the hazards that may develop following a fan stoppage. Following publication of the existing standard, commenters suggested that it may be possible to test the fan signals and the automatic closing doors without shutting off the fans. If it is possible to properly test the fan signal and automatic closing doors without stopping the fan, then the Agency would permit such an alternative. The Agency has become aware that such an approach is being actively explored by at least one mining company. Therefore, in the interest of allowing for advances in technology in this area, the proposal would permit an alternative test that does not require stopping the fan when the operator demonstrates that it provides the same level of assurance that the automatic closing doors and fan signals will function as intended during fan stoppages. Alternative approaches to stopping the fan would be required to be approved in the ventilation plan. The Agency would anticipate that any alternative approach approved would retain the 31 day interval for demonstrating that the automatic closing doors or fan signal will operate as intended. The Agency solicits comments on this approach to fan tests. Specifically, comments should address the method that should be used to assure that the alternate test provides the same level of assurance that the automatic closing doors and fan signals will function as intended during fan stoppages. Paragraph (f)(1) retains the requirement in the existing rule that persons making main mine fan examinations certify by initials and date at the fan or another location specified by the operator, that the examinations were made, and that each certification identify the main mine fan examined. Consistent with the practice of certifying that fan examinations have been completed, the Agency is proposing a certification requirement in paragraph (f)(2). The person completing the review of the data from a fan monitoring system used in lieu of daily fan examinations would certify that the review has been completed. The manner of certification would be by initials and date on the printout of the data from the system. To facilitate this certification, proposed §75.310(c)(3), as discussed previously, would require that the fan monitoring system be capable of providing, on demand, a printout of the data.
