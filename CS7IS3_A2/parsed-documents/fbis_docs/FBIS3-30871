The Agrarian Democratic Party, its leader Victor Surdu said, "considers that through such statements that contradict the historical truths and the course of so far of the relations between Romania and the Republic of Moldova, whose independence our country was the first to recognize -- their authors oppose the natural course of history, commit themselves with fishy haste to a direction with unforeseeable ends. Their positions cannot be legitimated by any argument. Moreover, they advance dangerous ideas, disregard an independent, sovereign and unitary state like Romania. "Through such statements, which the PDAR definitely rejects, their authors assume a serious responsibility before history and their own citizens so tragically tried by insane decisions made in the past. They claim rights they really do not have towards their destiny. And the territorial claims that result from the strange outlook on the union of the Republic of Moldova with a part of a neighbour and sovereign state disclose a grave departure even from the rational and realistic spirit, a worrying betrayal of history and of the real and essential interests of the Romanians across the Prut. Hearing with surprise, sorrow and worry such statements, firmly rejecting them, the PDAR is sure that the truth will triumph, that future history will do justice to people so hard tried by fate, by foreign oppression, that the Romanians everywhere, just like their brave forefathers, will know how to defend their rights, faith, language and national being.
