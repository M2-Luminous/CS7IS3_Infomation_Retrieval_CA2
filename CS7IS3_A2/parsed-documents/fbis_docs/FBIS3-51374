[Begin recording] Our position has been quite clear. It is a fact that Mr. Carles chose to pay off the IFIS, even to the point of breaking the law. I have the letter he signed whereby he surreptitiously paid off the IFIS behind the back of the National Assembly Budget Commission. In doing this, he denied equipment to schools, the 13th month bonus to public workers, and medication to hospitals. He did all this while at the same time he paid off the IFIS. In this respect, we believe this is not the type of policy which will be healthy for Panama. We believe Panama must honor its commitments to the IFIS. At the same time, however, we must honor the country's social debt, create more employment, provide more equipment for schools, more education for the people, medication to hospitals, and raise the retirement age. Carles does not intend to do any of this. He represents the denial of all of this.
