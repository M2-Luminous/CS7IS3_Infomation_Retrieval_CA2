The conference's central agenda was: Guided by the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress and Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee and outlined by the national economic work conference, study and arrange for next year's various tasks concerning speeding up reforms and development and promoting the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of China's foreign trade. The conference was chaired by MOFTEC Vice Minister Zheng Silin, who is also party group deputy secretary. Wu Yi, MOFTEC minister and party group secretary, delivered a report, entitled "Conscientiously Implement the Spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee and Speed Up the Development of China's Foreign Economic Relations and Trade." Having reviewed the heartening progress in China's foreign economic relations and trade, Wu Yi pointed out: The guiding thought for next year's foreign economic relations and trade is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the deepening of the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee. Efforts will be powered by a deepening of reforms in the foreign economic and trade sector and will center on expanding exports. We will actively earn foreign exchanges, raise economic efficiency, seize opportunities, meet challenges, explore actively, struggle arduously, work hard to complete next year's foreign economic tasks in excess of planned quotas, and contribute our share of effort toward reforms, opening up, and modernization. -- Further deepen reform in the foreign economic and trade sector. Beginning next year, state foreign trade and export enterprises will pursue a unified foreign currency settlement system and install a unified and managed renminbi floating exchange rate system based on market demand and supply. These enterprises will not be required to submit noncompensatory and compensatory foreign-exchange earnings. In deepening reforms in the foreign economic and trade sector, we must, one, perfect the macroregulatory and control mechanism for exports; two, further deregulate in an orderly fashion import and export operations; three, deepen reforms in foreign economic and trade enterprises and reorganize state-owned foreign economic and trade enterprises modelling on modern corporate systems; four, maintain the unity of foreign economic and trade policies throughout the country and increase transparency; and five, strengthen coordinated macromanagement, maintain good order in foreign trade, and strengthen the functions of commercial chambers. -- Peruse our jobs vigorously to ensure the completion of next year's foreign trading and export and import tasks. On the basis of a conscientious summing up of this year's experience, beginning early next year, we will take expanding exports as the central task. All types of foreign trade enterprises have a responsibility to earn foreign exchange for the country. They must increase their contributions toward increasing the state's exports and foreign exchange earnings, correctly handle the relations between specializing in one trade and diversified operations and between exporting to earn foreign exchange and economic efficiency, and give top priority to export expansion. Meanwhile, they must also guarantee the export of key materials to meet the needs of national economic development. Leading foreign trade departments at all levels should make it their job to provide detailed and sophisticated guidance for various types of foreign economic and trade enterprises and offer quality services and wholeheartedly solve problems for enterprises in expanding their exports. -- Sum up experience, perfect policies, and actively and effectively utilize foreign capital. -- Further promote foreign aid and the development of foreign economic cooperation; continue to implement new foreign aid policies, adjust the foreign-aid structure, and reform its methods; continue to probe for a variety of aid methods in which aid, mutual benefits, and cooperation are combined; vigorously pursue direct cooperation between our country's enterprises and their counterparts in aided countries, open overseas solely invested or joint-venture enterprises through foreign aid; further perfect foreign-aid management; and standardize and manage foreign aid work scientifically. Further convert the internal mechanisms of firms engaged in international economic and technological cooperation, perfect the macromanagement mechanism for contract projects and labor cooperation, work hard to raise levels of design and consultancy for overseas contracted construction projects and labor cooperation, diversify contract labor markets, and integrate foreign economic cooperation with investment, trade, and other related areas in moving toward a "great economic and trade pattern." -- Uphold principles and handle properly multilateral and bilateral trade ties. -- Develop economic and trade cooperation with Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. Under the general policy of "peaceful unification and one country, two systems," we will vigorously promote economic exchanges and trade between the mainland and the Taiwan region, focusing on attracting large and medium-scale Taiwan-funded projects and increasing exports to Taiwan in order to further expand cross- Strait economic cooperation and trade. While maintaining Hong Kong's and Macao's prosperity and stability and achieving a smooth transition as the goal, we will work hard to consolidate and develop economic and trade ties with the Hong Kong and Macao region, continue to maintain supplies to Hong Kong and Macao, fully exploit Hong Kong's unique status and advantages as a financial, trade, transport, and information center and put these advantages at the service of expanding the mainland's opening up and modernization. -- Continue to unwaveringly implement market diversification and the strategy of achieving good quality. Regions and foreign-trade enterprises must heighten their understanding, draw up plans, and adopt effective measures. While consolidating and developing existing markets, they must vigorously open new ones and improve the setup of foreign economic and trade markets. Strong and big enterprises with goodwill must make stronger effort at opening new markets. Pursuing the strategy of achieving good quality next year will focus on cracking down on fake and inferior products. The problem of quality will be understood as one that reflects national character and affects our country's image of reform and opening up. To achieve good quality, ultimately we rely on: One, science and technology; two, policies; and three, management. We must cooperate fully with scientific and technological, production, commercial inspection, and customs departments and genuinely strengthen quality control and supervision in a vigorous attempt to achieve a notable improvement in the quality of our country's exports. -- Continue to push hard for setting up a foreign economic and trade legal system. The "foreign trade law" has been adopted in principle by a routine State Council executive meeting and is going to be reviewed by the National people's Congress Standing Committee. The "anti-dumping ordinance," "anti-subsidy ordinance," and "protective measures ordinances" will be submitted to the State Council for review and approval. Next year, efforts will focus on formulating ancillary rules and regulations for the "foreign trade law" and specific details for implementing the three above ordinances, revising or drafting laws and rules and regulations on the use of foreign capital in line with the adjustment and perfection of foreign capital policies, genuinely tightening inspection and supervision of the unified implementation of foreign economic and trade policies, and further increasing transparency. Meanwhile, we must firmly stop and correct such wrong tendencies as not observing the law, lax enforcement of the law, and levying fines instead of lawfully required punishments and must conscientiously review the complaint-response method concerning antidumping work by boosting investigations and studies, formulating relevant rules and regulations as quickly as possible, and setting up standardized procedures for investigations and complaint response. -- On the Central Committee's and State Council's unified planning and revolving around the central tasks in the foreign economic and trade sector, we will vigorously strengthen the clean government effort and party style. -- Do a good job in government organ reforms and strengthen the construction of foreign economic and trade cadre contingents. Lastly, Wu Yi said: The most important of all the important tasks for next year is to deepen reforms in the foreign economic and trade sector, make good use of state policies, increase exports and foreign exchange earnings to new levels, and pay particular attention to ensuring a rise in the growth of exports and foreign exchange earnings in general trade.
