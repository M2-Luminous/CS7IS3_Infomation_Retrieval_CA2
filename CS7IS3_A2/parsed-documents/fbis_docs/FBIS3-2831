Any act or attempted act of secession, no matter in what form, will be in vain, Qian said. Qian made the remarks when he joined deputies from Taiwan to the National People's Congress in a group discussion on Premier Li Peng's government work report this afternoon. He expressed the hope that Taiwan authorities will go along with the trend and make joint efforts with the mainland to develop relations across the Taiwan Strait and push ahead with the reunification of China. In the past couple of years, Qian said, thanks to joint endeavors of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, economic and trade cooperation between the two sides has developed rapidly and people-to-people contacts and exchanges increased steadily. However, Qian said, there exist some problems in the relations between the two sides, of which the outstanding one is act or attempted act of secession "in varied forms." It is the common aspiration of all the Chinese people to achieve peaceful reunification of the motherland. Any act or attempted act of secession, no matter in what form, will be in vain, since it runs counter to the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, Qian reiterated. As long as people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait join hands to develop relations, the peaceful reunification of China will surely be realized at an early date, Qian added.
