Military papers found in the possession of a dead Iraqi officer authorised the use of chemical weapons "as a last resort." Pressure for the United Nations to investigate alleged gas attacks in the marshes of southern Iraq grew yesterday as Dr Hussein Sharistani, once Iraq's leading nuclear scientist, arrived in Britain with details of a month-long inquiry into allegations that Saddam Hussein had again used chemical weapons against his own people. The allegations of the attack on the Hammar marshes coincide with reports that President Saddam has begun draining the most populous part of the marshlands, the north-eastern region. The memory of massacres is so vivid there that the Iraqi opposition has for the first time instructed local people not to offer resistance. Since the attack on the Hammar marshes at the end of September, Gulf War Victims, an independent research group founded by Dr Sharistani and his Canadian wife, Bernice, has interviewed "practically every man who witnessed the battle." This evidence, and other information collected from the marsh region, will be presented to the Foreign Office this week in the hope that Britain will press for a full investigation. Although Gulf War Victims has been unable to confirm the exact nature of the gas used, it has pieced together a detailed picture of the attack and the events that followed it. Dr Sharistani, held in solitary confinement for 10 years before being released from jail in 1991, is confident that UN investigators can be led to the spot where hundreds of people were reported to have died from shells that killed without wounding. "Everyone we have spoken to agreed these projectiles were unlike any others they had seen," Dr Sharistani said yesterday. "They were liquid and made little noise when they exploded. The smell was different from other shells; there wasn't the usual burning smell." Witnesses said the attack on the Hor Alawi area on the eastern edge of the Hammar marshes began early on September 26, when dozens of armoured vehicles advanced with artillery. The attack was beaten off by resistance fighters, who had occupied Hor Alawi after the drainage of the Amara marshes flooded the area north of the Euphrates. "The resistance captured six armoured vehicles," Dr Sharistani said. "In one of them they discovered a briefcase with a notebook containing the minutes of a meeting. The third point in these minutes said that if they could not dislodge the rebels from the area, they should use chemical weapons as a last resort." Survivors said shells fired by the Iraqis emitted a thick, white, ball-shaped gas cloud that hung a few yards above the ground for about an hour, causing breathing difficulties. Some said there was a smell of rotten apples -- a smell Iraqis associate with chemical weapons used during the war with Iran. All said the Iraqi soldiers carried gas masks and filters attached to chest straps. The resistance abandoned Hor Alawi at nightfall after running out of ammunition. As they retreated, Dr Sharistani said, they fired shells captured during the battle. Two or three days later, informers in the marshes said hundreds of Iraqi troops had been killed. The bodies had no visible wounds, but were blistered and discoloured. The informers said army casualties had filled military hospitals in Basra, Qurna and Medainah. Local people reported numerous mourning ceremonies in the days after the attack, and said Iraqi troops took the unusual step of burning the bodies of dead civilians. Iraqi diplomats in New York have denied the use of chemical weapons. UN officials are seeking access to the marshes to ascertain whether chemicals or a combination of other lethal agents were used.
