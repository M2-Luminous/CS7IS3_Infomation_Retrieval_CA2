The PLO representative in Finland is appealing to the Finnish Government to raise the matter at a Nordic foreign ministers's meeting which starts in Reykjavik tomorrow. The PLO says that if Finland, as the first Nordic country, were to set an example in this matter, the Palestinians would value this as much as they value the contributions of Norway and Sweden in the Middle East peace process.
