FR941221-2-00038 FR941221-2-00030 [Project No. 1494&hyph;064 Oklahoma] Grand River Dam Authority; Availability of Environmental Assessment December 15, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's regulations 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47910), the Office of Hydropower Licensing (OHL) reviewed the application for non-project use of project lands for the Pensacola Hydroelectric Project. The application proposes to excavate an area 22 feet wide and 4 feet deep along 250 feet shoreline, containing 1,800 cubic yards of dredged material, on Grand Lake O' The Cherokees, in Delaware County, Oklahoma. The staff prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the action. In the EA, staff concludes that approval of the non-project use of project lands would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Copies of the EA are available for review in the Reference and Information Center, room 3308, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31270 Filed 12&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
