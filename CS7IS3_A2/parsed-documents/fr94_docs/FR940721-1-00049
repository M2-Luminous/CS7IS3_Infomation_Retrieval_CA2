FR940721-1-00049 FR940721-1-00012 6. Clarification of Appendix Statement on Vehicle Lift Dimensions Part 38, the Department s standards for accessible vehicles, contains dimensions for wheelchair lifts on vehicles. The reference to these dimensions in the Part 37, Appendix A, discussion of §37.13 speaks of the ``new 30 ’ ’ x 48 ’ ’ lift platform specifications.'' While the dimensions are 30 x 48 inches at a distance of two inches above the platform, the width of the platform need only be 28.5 inches at the platform itself. This seeming discrepancy has confused some readers. To resolve it, we propose to remove the words ``30'' by ``48'' from the Appendix, so that the reference is simply to the lift standards of Part 38. 7. Typographical Errors In §37.3, in the definition of ``designated public transportation,'' the word ``containing'' in the final line should be ``continuing.'' In §37.11(a), the reference in the last line to ``Subpart F'' of 49 CFR Part 27 should be ``Subpart C'' (Part 27 no longer contains any Subpart F). Commenters are encouraged to note other such errors, so that they can also be corrected. Regulatory Analyses and Notices This NPRM does not propose a significant rule under Executive Order 12866. It is a significant NPRM under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures, since it would amend the Department's Americans with Disabilities Act rule, which is a significant rule. We expect economic impacts to be minimal, so we have not prepared a regulatory evaluation. There are no Federalism impacts sufficient to warrant the preparation of a Federalism assessment. The Department certifies that the proposals, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Issued this 12th day of July, 1994, at Washington, DC. Federico Peña, Secretary of Transportation. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Department proposes to amend 49 CFR Part 37 and 49 CFR Part 38 as follows: PART 37_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for 49 CFR Part 37 is proposed to continue to read as follows: Authority: Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101&hyph;12213); 49 U.S.C. 322. 2. The authority citation for 49 CFR Part 38 is proposed to be revised to read as follows: Authority: Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101&hyph;12213); 49 U.S.C. 322. 3. In part 37, §37.27(b) is proposed to be revised to read as follows: §37. 27 Transportation for elementary and secondary education systems. * * * * * (b) The requirements of this part do not apply to the transportation of school children to and from a private elementary or secondary school, and its school-related activities, if the school is providing transportation service to students with disabilities equivalent to that provided to students without disabilities. The test of equivalence is the same as that provided in §37.105. If the school does not meet the requirement of this paragraph for exemption from the requirements of this part, it is subject to the requirements of this part for private entities not primarily engaged in transporting people. 4. In part 37, §37.135 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraph (c) to read as follows: §37.135 Submission of paratransit plan. * * * * * (c) Annual updates. Except as provided in this paragraph, each entity shall submit an annual update to its plan on January 26 of each succeeding year. (1) If an entity has met and is continuing to meet fully all requirements for complementary paratransit in §§37.121 through 37.133 of this part, the entity may submit to FTA on January 26 of each succeeding year a certification of compliance in lieu of a plan update. Entities that have submitted a joint plan under §37.141 may submit a joint certification under this paragraph. The requirements of §§37.137 through 37.139 do not apply when a certification is submitted under this paragraph. (2) In the event of any change in circumstances that results in an entity which has submitted a certification of compliance falling short of full compliance with §§37.121 through 37.133 in any respect, the entity shall immediately notify FTA of the problem. In this case, the entity shall file a plan update meeting the requirements of §§37.137 through 37.139 of this part on the next following January 26 and in each succeeding year until the entity returns to full compliance. (3) An entity which has been granted a waiver from any provision of this part on the basis of undue financial burden shall file a plan update meeting the requirements of §§37.137 through 37.139 of this part on each January 26 during which the waiver is in effect.
