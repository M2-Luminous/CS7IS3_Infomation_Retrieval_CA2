As is known, on 10 March the president met in the Kremlin with representatives of Russian state, public, and business circles, and the meeting participants said they agreed to the idea of preparing and signing an Agreement on Civil Peace in Russia. They invited political leaders, public figures, and citizens of Russia wanting to contribute to the preparation of the Agreement on Civil Peace to join in the work. On 18 March, a number of newspapers published an appeal by a group of figures announcing the creation of an association that would be called "Accord for Russia." The appeal was signed by several people who are known for their implacable stance vis-a-vis the president and his policy of late. They include several leaders of communist and "national patriotic" organizations, as well as a Constitutional Court judge, whose functions basically preclude participation in political organizations. The President's Administration expects the new association to make a specific contribution to the preparation of the Agreement on Civil Peace in Russia and then to its practical implementation. It is by these actions that society will judge the sincerity of the intentions of the appeal's authors. This was announced by the Russian Federation president's press service.
