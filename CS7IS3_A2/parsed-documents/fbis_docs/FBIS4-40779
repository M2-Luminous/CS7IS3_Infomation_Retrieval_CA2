Col.-Gen. Mironov said that every third officer released from the ranks last year was under 30 years of age. More experienced officers under 40 were resigning for want of perspective - 43 per cent of the total. One trend is to discharge cadets right before the contract- signing: a half of all cadets discharged from military academies. Gen. Mironov cited several reasons for the situation: low social security, low pay, and subsequent disillusionment in the chosen vocation.
