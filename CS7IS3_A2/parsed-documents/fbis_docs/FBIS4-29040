FBIS4-29040 "dreas115_a_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-115 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Korean Group Demands Apology for Police Raid Korean Group Demands Apology for Police Raid OW1406092894 Tokyo KYODO in English 0849 GMT 14 Jun 94 OW1406092894 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Sapporo, June 14 KYODO -- A pro-Pyongyang group of Korean residents demanded Tuesday [12 June] that police apologize for investigating a 24-year-old member of the group on unsubstantiated suspicion of violating a stimulant drug control law. The Committee for the Protection of the Rights of Koreans in Hokkaido, part of the Hokkaido Chapter of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyun), made the demand at a press conference, claiming the investigation was illegal. The accusation followed a recent mistaken raid on the office of another Chongnyun chapter and related facilities in Kyoto, where local police said earlier Tuesday it will issue a statement expressing regret over the incident. The committee said officers from the Chuo police station in Sapporo raided the home of the unidentified Korean man, a company executive in the city, on May 31 and forced him to give a urine sample for testing, but could find no evidence he had violated the law. The committee discovered the result of the test when it asked the police about the investigation June 2. The man, whose nationality is South Korean but who belongs to the pro-Pyongyang group, told the committee he suffered mental stress as a result of the investigation and his business had also suffered, the committee said. The police gave the man no explanation either before or after the investigation, it said. Chae Hong-chol, head of the International Division of Chongnyun's Hokkaido Chapter, told the press conference he feels the police are hostile to Koreans and should have been more cautious considering the recent controversial raids on Chongnyun offices in Osaka and Kyoto. Toshiaki Igarashi, deputy head of the police station, said the raid was legal because it was done with the authorization of the court.
