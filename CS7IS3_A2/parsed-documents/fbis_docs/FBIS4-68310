Graduated from the USSR KGB Higher School. From 1977 to 1988, and 1992 to the present--chief of the special group "A" [Alpha]. For courage and bravery in neutralizing especially dangerous criminals, awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. Major general. Married. Son is a captain in the Federal Counterintelligence Service. [Berezko] Gennadiy Nikolayevich, this is a special year for Alpha--it will celebrate its first "adult" jubilee. How did it all start back then, 20 years ago? [Zaytsev] In the early 1970's terrorism in its most dangerous forms--hostage-taking, aircraft hijacking--began to occur in our country, too. For instance, in 1973 at Vnukovo Airport four armed criminals seized a Yak-40 aircraft with passengers on board. KGB and MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] personnel in a combined effort freed the hostages and neutralized the criminals. Despite a successful final outcome, the operation was tense because nobody had any special training in localizing such situations. Taking this and other circumstances into account, a decision was made to set up within the KGB system a special antiterrorist unit. By the way, a little later an analogous unit was also set up in the GDR, also called "A." ...At the time the unit had no more than 30 members. Within two months the unit was completely manned and training began. The first chief of the special unit was Hero of the Soviet Union Major Vitaliy Bubenin, who was the commander of this group until April 1977. [Berezko] How many years did it take before the first operation? And how many of them has the unit conducted altogether? [Zaytsev] It is my deep conviction, based on practical experience, that at least five years of intensive training is needed for the unit to exist not merely on paper but to get its personnel to the point of being able to act professionally and competently in any situation. Over this period people must become not just professionals in antiterrorism but also "adjust" psychologically. The group conducted its first combat operation on 28 March 1979 at the U.S. Embassy. What happened is that the embassy's second secretary Pringle met and brought into the embassy's consular section a stranger, who then threatened to activate an explosive device if the Americans did not take him in a diplomatic car to Sheremetyevo airport and arrange for him to fly abroad. And although overall the operation was successful--the terrorist, Yuriy Vlasenko, was neutralized and there were no casualties--I must say that even then not everything went smoothly... Altogether, the group has conducted several dozen operations. [Berezko] Which one is the most memorable for you? [Zaytsev] The one I remember most was the operation in Mineralnyye Vody in 1988, since the lives and well-being of children were at stake. As you may recall, Yakshiyants' gang took 31 schoolchildren and a teacher hostage. This was already the second such instance in our practice. The first time, children were taken hostage in December 1981 in the city of Sarapula in the Udmurt ASSR [Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]. In that case, however, the hostages were tenth-graders, while in Mineralnyye Vody the children were 10-12 years old. All through the night and the first half of the day I had to conduct intensive negotiations with the bandits over the radio, trying to reduce their aggressiveness and in the end get them to release the hostages. After the negotiations, only the Il-76 crew remained in the hands of the bandits... I want to take this opportunity to mention the exceptional bravery and courage of military helicopter pilots Colonel Valentin Padalkin and Major Vladimir Stepanov, and the Air Force commander in chief, Lieutenant General (Aviation) Vladimir Mikhaylov, who just recently helped to free children taken hostage in Rostov. [Berezko] Gennadiy Nikolayevich, as I gather, a certain "diplomacy" in bulletproof vests is practically inevitable in combat operation, is it not so? [Zaytsev] The main purpose of such "diplomacy" is to reduce terrorists' aggressiveness, to avert violence against hostages. There are special tactics for conducting such negotiations, and the operative who "converses" with the criminals must possess extensive operational and life experience, "feel" the criminal, and be a psychologist to a certain extent, in order to "massage" the situation into the overall design. [Berezko] But the special unit does not always limit itself to persuasion... [Zaytsev] We have a very broad and quite effective range of means that allow us to take control of the situation. For instance, special grenades. There are also special weapons that have been designed to our specifications and are used only by the special unit. Frankly, however, I would prefer not to be too open in these matters. The point is that when we talk about this, we unwittingly arm potential terrorists with information that can be used against us. By the way, at the time Yakshiyants said straight out that before taking the hostages they had studied attentively all the literature on special unit operations in our country and abroad and even reviewed all available documentary footage. [Berezko] Is there division by combat specialization within the group? [Zaytsev] Each member of the special unit must be completely proficient in using standard-issue weapons: the Makarov handgun and submachine gun... There also is specialization: snipers, combat swimmers, explosives experts who can remove any obstacle with a jeweler's precision, radio specialists, and many others. For instance, combat swimmers were utilized in 1978 in Cuba during the World Youth and Students festival. The Cubans officially requested help in protecting the ships Gruziya and Leonid Sobinov, where the Soviet delegation lived. Our personnel went on "underwater duty" together with members of the Navy's special team. Combat swimmers also are used in the protection of highest officials. [Berezko] How do you "forge" the operatives' skills? [Zaytsev] Through training, which is conducted daily. All the methodology we use is our own, but we also take into account the useful experience of others. "Our" hand-to-hand combat includes the most effective elements of all known one-on-one combat and pursues one single goal--to enable the operative to fight an armed criminal in a situation of limited space. The methodology of marksmanship training also has been made to "fit" the unit's tasks. Our operatives go through mandatory training in tanks and paratroop training. In the final analysis, the entire program of professional training is aimed at developing in the operative the preparedness to take mortal risks for the sake of saving other people's lives. Once every quarter the group undergoes testing by a specially developed system, which provides an objective picture of the operative's abilities. [Berezko] Have there been instances of people failing the tests? [Zaytsev] If a group member demonstrates a substantially lower performance level, especially in tactical and special disciplines, and does not draw the appropriate conclusion, dismissal is inevitable. But I want to emphasize that this is an extremely rare case. The main principle of combat training in the unit is "self-education," in which the operative on his own keeps himself in the shape needed to carry out the tasks. [Berezko] Gennadiy Nikolayevich, it is impossible to foresee where and when the next hostage situation may occur. Is this circumstance taken into account in training? [Zaytsev] We try to "play out" during training all possible hostage scenarios: in an aircraft, building, bus, open space, and so on. As to unexpectedness, we are in constant readiness for it. Each of our operatives has a personal call receiver--multitone--through which he can be reached. The time frame between receiving the call and the point where the operatives are fully equipped and on the way to the airport is no more than 1.5-two hours. One unit in the group is constantly on combat-ready duty, which in almost 20 years has never been suspended even for a minute. [Berezko] The selection criteria for Alpha must be very tough. [Zaytsev] Yes, the selection process is indeed strict. Only a military serviceman fit to serve in the Airborne Troops, between 25 and 28 years old--an adult mind with the strength of youth--may be accepted into the antiterrorist unit. Our main "suppliers" are the Ryazan Higher Paratroop Command School, the Moscow Higher General Troops Command School, and two Border Troops military institutes. First a candidate is checked with respect to physical fitness. Handgun marksmanship is a mandatory test. In some aspects, the requirements for the candidate exceed the norms of category III in sports, and in marksmanship--category II. At the same time, I want to say that it is much more preferable for the unit to have a candidate with a range of category II achievements in different sports than a distinguished master of sports in, for instance, classic wrestling. And the most important part. More than 70 percent of our people have a higher education. A special unit operative should be not a mere fighting machine, but an intellectual capable of independent thinking, forecasting, and making decisions on the basis of analysis. The candidate's intellectual abilities are tested through in-depth study of his personality, tests, meetings, and conversations with the mandatory participation of a psychologist. If a candidate has a quarrelsome personality, there is no place for him in the unit. Each operative must be 100-percent confident in his colleagues. More than his own life will depend on it. [Berezko] You said that the maximum age for serving in the special unit is 40. By civilian standards, these are young people... [Zaytsev] Our former members get offers to work for various state and commercial structures. In addition, the Association of Antiterrorist Unit Veterans has been set up and is functioning; it is headed by Sergey Goncharov, who is a now a member of the Moscow City Duma. The association's main task is to help the operative find his place in society after discharge. [Berezko] Gennadiy Nikolayevich, unlike our economy, terrorism is currently on the rise. How do you see the prospects of combating this "plague of the twentieth century"? [Zaytsev] These days we can only fight runaway terrorism if the state sets up a well-designed system for combating this evil, with the command of antiterrorist activities being concentrated in a single National Center. Also, we have to remember that terrorism does not recognize borders and we need to set up coordination and interaction with foreign special services, including those in the near abroad.
