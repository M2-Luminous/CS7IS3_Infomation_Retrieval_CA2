Yesterday, still in Brussels, Jacques Delors was to have inaugurated the first truly trans-European telecommunications network: Euro-ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network). Prevented at the last minute from attending the ceremony, the Commission president charged the director general of DGXIII (EC Commission directorate general responsible for telecommunications) to represent him and to welcome the event on his behalf: "We are moving from the industrial era to the age of information." [passage omitted explaining ISDN technology, applications] ISDN has remained relatively confidential until now for two reasons. The first reason was the national and incompatible nature of the early networks, leading to a lack of crossborder services. The second reason, an immediate consequence of this, was the scant enthusiasm shown by terminal manufacturers and service suppliers to invest in a market that was certainly promising but which was too limited because of the adaptations needed for each country. It was to remedy this problem that, in 1986, the EC launched the idea of a jointly operated and standardized ISDN. Three years later, in 1989, 26 European telecommunications operators (including Belgacom) undertook to provide a basic set of pan-European services by the end of 1993. They rose to the challenge, and Euro-ISDN was born. The network already connects 17 countries. Including the vast investments needed to develop the applications, the global cost is estimated to have already reached ECU 50 billion or 2,000 billion Belgian francs. [passage omitted] Some people, however, are wondering if Euro-ISDN is not arriving just a little late. It is merely foreshadowing the future network known as broadband ISDN, which is expected to be introduced on a large scale as of 1995. This network, also backed by the European Commission, will offer much greater data transmission capacities and a better integration of services. Bringing high-resolution color faxes, high-definition interactive television, the transfer of medical images, etc., it will pull Europe headlong into the era of multimedia communications. Pilot projects already exist, developed by the major manufacturers with the backing of various European programs. The ambition stated in Brussels last weekend is to free up the resources needed to put these services within everyone's reach by building trans-European networks. In its White Paper, the Commission reckons that the development of telecommunications in Europe will cost some ECU 150 billion over the next five years. To be sure, such expenditure will not be in vain -- by the year 2000, telecommunications should represent six percent of GNP of the Twelve and boost growth by six percent over the next 10 to 15 years. Its depths have yet to be plumbed.
