Commenting on the request, a Foreign Ministry source made it clear on 14 April that the Japanese Government has no intention of suspending yen-based loans and official development assistance (ODA) to Iran, at least for the time being, adding that the "Japanese Government has no hard evidence showing Iran as terrorist-supporting nation." The same Foreign Ministry source also disclosed that the Japanese Government sent Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda to Washington on 10 April to explain its position regarding yen-based loans to Iran. The Japanese Government decided last May to extend a total of 150 billion yen in loans to finance Iran's construction of the Godal Raldal [name as published] hydroelectric power plant; the loans will be extended to Iran in three installments. A contract has already been concluded between the two countries on the first installment, totaling 38.6 billion yen. According to a senior Foreign Ministry official: "A contract for the first installment has already been concluded between Japan and Iran. Japan cannot suspend yen-based loans to Iran halfway through a contract. The second contract on turbine procurement is to be concluded within this year." The government decided to resume yen-based loans to Iran for the first time in 17 years after concluding it is indispensable to assist the Iranian Government's efforts to promote economic reforms in order to bring peace and stability to the Gulf region and stabilize relations between Iran and its neighboring nations. However, the U.S. Department of State and the National Security Council (NSC) have continued to put Iran under close surveillance, claiming Iran has supported terrorist activities on the basis of Islamic fundamentalism. Hence, the U.S. Government will certainly continue to ask Japan to halt yen-based loans to Iran.
