On the other hand, she adds, irrational allocation of resources has a much more adverse effect on the economy. This article will give a summary of her view. [passage omitted] Corruption means that someone gains by taking advantage of his or her power or position to control the supply of materials, information, or other things. From the viewpoint of economics, what he or she gains is an "economic rent," and the act is "rent seeking." However, no value is created in this process. In some cases, it is legal to receive this kind of "rent." For example, a charge can be collected for the supply of information. In other cases, to do so is illegal, or in other words, it is not permitted by law. Generally speaking, the latter is called corruption. Some acts, though illegal, are "good acts" if viewed from the perspective of economics. For instance, a nascent developing country may have too much control over its economic activities. Under such circumstances, some corrupt acts can help break through man-made control and serve as a "lubricant" for economic activities. In nascent developing countries, though corruption is linked with the relative shortage of materials, its occurrence is also attributable in part to the system that gives officials power to manage materials, information, and so forth. For example, some officials have the authority to approve the supply of materials and control the allocation of resources. This often provides opportunities for corruption, such as abusing power for private gains and granting business people's requests in exchange for money. In developed countries, certain political operations such as lobbying are also "rent seeking" activities. However, since these countries allow open economic competition, their society and politics are relatively institutionalized, and rule by men exists only to a small extent, the chances for corruption are reduced. As for the situation on the Chinese mainland, everyone knows that, more often than not, there are many barriers to pass before a task can be accomplished. It is necessary to form good relations with various parties, including officials and organizations. As a result, instances of bribery, embezzlement, and corruption have come into being. Since some corrupt activities can serve as an economic "lubricant," many business people do not mind them. As long as you have a "clearly marked price," I will include that in my operating cost and go on with my business. And, matter-of-factly, most of such "transactions" are fulfilled as promised; only a few have been aborted. For this reason, a lot of business people from Hong Kong and the branch offices of many foreign companies in China employ special personnel to do diplomatic work. Their job is to promote good "public relations," using such methods as holding dinner parties, so as to remove barriers and "lubricate" business activities. [passage omitted] Through more than a decade of reform and opening-up and with the development of the economy, corruption on the Chinese mainland has changed its style. In the past, corrupt officials often asked for cigarettes, liquors, dinner parties, and electrical appliances from business people. As time has passed by, few of them are now asking for cigarettes, liquors, or electrical appliances, and dinner parties are not so welcome as before. On the one hand, this is because they earn a higher income and no longer have a strong demand for such things. On the other hand, they have shifted their demand to other areas, like traveling overseas in the name of making observations and sending their children to study in foreign countries. As can be seen from numerous reports and instances, corruption on the Chinese mainland occurs mostly in government departments and state-owned enterprises and institutions. Corrupt departments and personnel can be roughly divided into four categories: 1) cadres in charge of economic work, such as managers and factory directors of state-owned enterprises, and certain government departments, such as the State Land Administration Bureau, urban construction departments, and other units that control the use of land--these government departments have relatively more corruption problems; 2) judicial and law-enforcing departments, such as public security police and courts; 3) departments of public utilities that have long experienced shortage of supply or inadequate capacities, such as transportation, water, electricity, and telephone departments; and 4) bank personnel responsible for loan business. The above government departments and state-owned enterprises and institutions either enjoy privileges or hold a monopoly in their respective fields of operations. Privileges and monopoly have not only created corruption, but also resulted in seriously inappropriate allocation of resources. For instance, most state-owned enterprises are suffering losses either overtly or covertly and have to rely on state support to survive. Another example is that the government's manner in approving appropriations cannot achieve effective use of funds. In fact, there are not so many instances of embezzlement in fund-approving departments and units, and the amounts of embezzlement are limited. However, the economic losses caused by them due to inappropriate allocation of resources are enormous. The harm done to the economy is more serious than corruption. The primary reason for this state of affairs is that for a long time economic questions have been dealt with by non-economic methods. Another reason is that property rights are not clearly defined. Under the public ownership system, what is dealt with by economic policymakers are not their own property, and they are not held responsible for any economic consequence if their policies are wrong. If a deficit has occurred, they can ask for subsidies from the higher authorities. A similar logic applies to extravagant wining and dining at public expense. Anyway, the money spent is from the public coffer. [passage omitted] Has corruption become an established practice on the Chinese mainland? The answer is that it has not reached such a terrible extent. In the first place, the regulations stipulate that those in charge of economic work are not allowed to do government work. This "distinction between government and economic work" has greatly cut the political power of those running state-owned enterprises and managing state assets, thus reducing the possibility of simultaneous monopoly of political and economic powers. Second, at present the economic power is not so centralized as in the past, but is being gradually delegated to departments in various localities. Although local party and government cadres have a lot of substantive power in political and economic affairs, there is a local election system, and officials are accountable to the collective. So it is impossible that they can act without scruple. Third, most people grumbled seriously when they saw children of high-level cadres do business or conduct other activities by taking advantage of their privileges. These activities are, of course, unhealthy, but they have not become an established practice and created a corrupt regime with monopolized political power as former Filipino autocrat Marcos did. Fourthly, the Chinese Communist Party's discipline still has a binding force on cadres, though its effect is diminishing. Generally speaking, high-level cadres are well-disciplined, while most problems occur in local governments. Since they are far away from the central authorities, "local emperors" have come into being. As for launching movements to strike at corruption, the reason is that a discipline-inspection movement is more effective than law. When law must be used, because of the high cost involved, the method adopted is to "deal with typical cases" so as to "punish one as a warning to a hundred." [passage omitted] After the Chinese mainland has opened itself to the outside world, foreign capital has flowed in. Has this induced more corrupt activities? This is not necessarily the case. On the contrary, market competition has been introduced along with the in-flow of foreign capital, smashing the disastrous monopoly. Now, all localities on the mainland are rushing to solicit capital from outside, aren't they? Before competition is introduced, you had to give someone benefits if you wanted to do something. Now, there is competition. In one locality, you are required to give out benefits; in another locality, you may find this is not necessary. In one locality, you must go through a number of departments; in another locality, you may find that all departments related to foreign investment are located in one place, and they serve your needs from beginning to end. This has reduced the instances of corruption. By studying the problem of corruption as an economic issue, we have arrived at this conclusion: Building a market system to promote open competition will not only raise efficiency in utilizing resources, but also reduce the possibility of corruption.
