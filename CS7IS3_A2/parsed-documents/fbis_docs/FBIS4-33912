Money lacks value when it does not have the backing of goods and services because real income does not depend on the amount of circulating currency but on its purchasing power. TRABAJADORES adds that the black market is a parasitic and unproductive economy since it does not help to produce more goods, which is what is needed to increase supply. Our country is developing an economic outline of its own, and every measure must be seen as linked to others. The goal is to boost work, but for the moment this is not possible because production is limited due to lack of resources and raw materials. Steps are being taken on performance incentives on tourism, agriculture, mining, transportation, energy, and the sugar industry, among other sectors. TRABAJADORES also points out that formulas to stimulate production can be found in each workplace, without forgetting that the goal is to revalue the currency.
