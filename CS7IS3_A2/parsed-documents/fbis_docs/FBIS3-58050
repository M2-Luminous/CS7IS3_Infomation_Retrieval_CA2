A corresponding rescheduling agreement has now been signed, the Federal Finance Ministry said today. The agreement gives Peru breathing space for repaying to Germany the majority of the debts, which would otherwise have been due by 31 March 1996. The repayment has now been extended over 15 to 20 years. The debts are based on credits as part of German development aid, Hermes-guaranteed export credits, as well as trade deals with the former GDR. Peru is to be excused repayment of DM30 million of the development aid credit if it uses one-third of that sum to protect and maintain the environment. The new debt regulation serves as further support for the reform process in Peru, the Finance Ministry said. Peru has already brought inflation under control, through its efforts since 1990 to stabilize the economy: Inflation dropped from 7,600 percent in 1990 to 57 percent in 1992, and it is to be reduced further to 27 percent. In 1991, real economic growth, of 2.5 percent, was achieved again.
