FR940706-0-00071 FR940706-0-00015 Metric Usage: Commits the Department to follow the provisions of E.O. 12770_Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs. Audit Requirements: Adopts the audit requirements of OMB Circulars A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133. OMB Circular A&hyph;128 applies to non-federal audits that States and local governments are required to obtain. OMB Circular A&hyph;133 applies to non-federal audits that institutions of higher education and other nonprofit organizations are required to obtain. The Secretary adopts these audit circulars as published in the Federal Register on the following dates: •A&hyph;128_Audits of State and Local Governments_(May 6, 1985 [50 FR 19114]; and December 6, 1985 [50 FR 50027]; and December 23, 1985 [50 FR 52406]; and November 13, 1987 [52 FR 43712]); and •A&hyph;133_Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Organizations_(March 16, 1990 [55 FR 10019]). In some cases, the regulatory language in these sections represent changes in policy or procedure in the administration of the affected grants. In others, the language_even if changed from the current 34 CFR Part 74_reaffirms the existing administrative policy or procedures of the Department. If OMB publishes at a future date revisions to any of these audit requirements, the Secretary will publish regulatory amendments adopting the revised circulars. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, the Secretary waives rulemaking on these regulations under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (20 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)). This section provides that rulemaking is not required when the agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. The Secretary believes further public comment on the technical changes made to the Circular is unnecessary because the substance of these provisions has already been subjected to public comment during OMB's solicitation of public comment. The Secretary also believes that further public comment on the substantive changes to the Circular is unnecessary because these changes incorporate statutory requirements that the Secretary is not authorized to change. Executive Order 12866 These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. The potential costs associated with the final regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the Department's programs effectively and efficiently. Burdens, specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 . In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The Secretary certifies that these regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities that would be affected by these regulations are institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations. However, the regulations would not have a significant economic impact on these small institutions because the regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of program funds.
