Estonia shares the Latvian Government's concerns that the above order constitutes an immediate danger to the independence and security of a sovereign state. The Estonian Foreign Ministry finds that setting up military bases on the territory of one or another country is determined by the will of the people in that country, and not by any orders from the Russian leadership. This particular case is a dangerous example of the Russian foreign policy's great-power ambitions [words indistinct]. The Estonia Foreign Ministry holds the position that the relations between Russia and the Baltic states can develop only in the spirit of mutual respect, on the basis of international standards.
