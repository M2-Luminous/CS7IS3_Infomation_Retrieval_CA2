Although the trip is announced as private, the PRC is certain to react unfavorably because Beijing will try to impose its "One China" policy on the countries with which it maintains relations. Indonesia does not appear to pay much attention to China, as evidenced by the reception accorded by President Suharto to the Taiwanese president. By contrast, the Thai Government will not have any official part in the Taiwanese president's visit. On behalf of the Thai Government, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri stated that Thailand firmly maintained the "One China" policy and that the government had nothing to do with the Taiwanese president's visit. He said Li's visit concerned trade and investment matters and did not involve international political activities. [passage omitted] Thailand has been a good friend of China. It has graciously implemented correct policies regarding China and Taiwan. However, taking into account the national interests, there is no reason for Thailand to neglect economic relations which could grow as result of the Taiwanese president's private visit. This is the way every country in the world operates. We are confident that the Thai foreign ministry will be able to explain and gain China's understanding. We also are confident that China will be broadminded enough to accept the undeniable reality.
