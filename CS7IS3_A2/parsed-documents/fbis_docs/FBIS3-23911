This is good, of course. But this also leads one to assume that Channel 5 management has some special ways of getting money. And having made this assumption, one simply has to go one step further in this reasoning. The impression came through as early as 1990 (and intensified as years went by) that it was thanks to Kurkova and Channel 5 that Boris Nikolayevich became chairman of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet; that it was specifically for Kurkova's live broadcasts that Yeltsin was coming to Leningrad to speak to the people. Since it is hard to suspect Yeltsin of ingratitude, one has to advance the hypothesis that his kindness toward Kurkova continues to this day--when the decline in the quality of Channel 5 broadcasting has reached catastrophic proportions, and the question of removing the chairman could not fail to come up, among other reasons because of the precarious decline in Petersburg TV ratings. But since B. Kurkova continues on her job, even under these circumstances, and does not let go of the microphone, one is left with an assumption that the Boss, not knowing how events will be developing, whether he will run in presidential elections in 1996, and in whose favor the odds will be tilting, may be using the same logic as Emperor Paul I in the short story "Second Lieutenant Kizhe": "We should hold off burdening him with a division. He is needed for more important things." That is: do not promote, do not transfer to Moscow; she will still be needed in Petersburg, right there at Channel 5. Apparently for the same reason the "maker of politicians" and "charisma-builder" is permitted to sit in two "cushy chairs" simultaneously: She is also the chairman of the St. Petersburg board of directors within the All-Russia State Television and Radio Company, a de facto first deputy to Oleg Poptsov. Only old comrades-in-battle are rewarded this generously. By the way, I am curious: Can one state employee be the head of two state organizations at the same time? We also have to take into account one more important person in this story--Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak. Judging by all the signs, what we now have in St. Petersburg is a mutually beneficial alliance of the executive and the monopolized TV power, as a result of which any criticism of Sobchak's actions is completely absent from television. Judging by what we see one may assume that Kurkova's power is practically absolute, and therefore Channel 5 has become a precise reflection of political, professional, and esthetic views of the director and the chairman of the board. It is obvious that in both her own broadcasts and those of her subordinates Kurkova cares only about political content, interpreted as tendentious support of specific persons (not economic or political ideas but exactly that--persons!). The emphasis on propaganda has displaced even hints at analysis: The style of the "Fifth Wheel" in the late 1980's, when the "talking heads" anticommunist monologue made a sensation in both capitals, now has become a model for all of Channel 5. The only difference being that no sensations are possible now, since the trick outlived itself "one lifetime ago." As to analytical coverage, this issue has been resolved in a cardinal manner. To interpret "something political," they invite politicians (A. Sobchak, A. Belyayev); when all else fails, the job is entrusted to B. Kurkova and her deputy V. Pravdyuk. From the above follows the esthetic side: A strong provincial flavor, most noticeable in the absence of modern computer graphics; programs existing outside of time and rhythm; the absence of necessary components of artistic form--from an inventive script to a decent studio interior. Petersburg TV is the least attractive of all Russian television facilities. It appears that this is of no concern to the leadership, while in the absence of excitement everything deteriorates--moving toward the absence of style, form, and expression. Moreover, everything is done to make the ugliness prominent, for which purpose Channel 5 continues to broadcast NTV programs ("Itogi," "Segodnya," "Namedni") against whose background its own product looks even more miserable. The absence of editing, rhythm, and direction on the whole had been felt even in "Fifth Wheel." But at the time this was explained by the topicality of struggle against communism, which--in order to prevent interference of oblast party committee censors--carefully observed the three classic postulates of unity: place, time, and action. In order to prevent any sort of cuts, editing was abolished. Now this has become Channel 5's main esthetic principle--the principle of classic amateur performance, which manifests itself especially graphically in live broadcasts: direction is still confused with censorship, and therefore what is valued most is a complete absence of any artistic interference. As a result of the absence of direction, mise en scene is formed "naturally": of the simplest combination of three components--the camera, the anchor, and the speaker. This set of components permits making broadcasts of any length without expending any effort; in addition, the anchor does not so much ask questions as sit as a "battle complement" next to the speaker (Kurkova's favorite state on camera when she "interviews" someone). A typical program is "Itogi XX Veka" ("Summarizing the Twentieth Century"): The "speaking man" is seated; the camera is in front of him (only two angles are used), and a monologue calmly continues for an hour! From time to time the "radio text" is interrupted by a "video clip" that is only remotely related to the topic. There are, actually, wilder programs as well, for instance, the fun "Weather-Show": Two mummers sit by samovar--a boy of about 10 and a middle-aged man. The task of this "creative collective" is to wedge the weather forecast into a "fun" conversation. It is not quite clear why all of this is needed. Nevertheless, the boy asks the man: What would be your last words before execution? To which the man, without blinking an eye, answers: "Good-bye, Central Russia! Where, by the way, minus 15 degrees is expected tomorrow..." Then the same man in Lenin's voice (!) relates the weather forecast for Arkhangelsk and Murmansk Oblasts. To make it really funny, the man calls the boy by name and patronymic... The lack of which technique can explain this flight of creative imagination? Toward the end of the 19th-beginning of the 20th Century the profession of theatrical director emerged in the European theater so that a stage show would not be a mere "sound track" of the script but expressed a certain directorial concept of the man and the world. A director became the show's creator and organizer, and a synthetic image began to express some new contents. Keeping in mind the specificity of directorial profession one may guess why Petersburg TV lacks directors and editors. It is apparently better and safer not to have people around who have fantasy, concepts, and an ability for independent creative activities. It is safer politically, but this also results in most regular programs being shapeless and not put together: from the boring "Sunday Labyrinth" to "Zebra"--a television version of the "Young Pioneer Sunrise." Somehow the phenomenon of editing and the effects produced by it has bypassed Petersburg television producers; for this reason I can recommend Mikhail Yampolskiy's compendium "Editing" as required reading in "all the companies, squadrons, and ships" on Channel 5. Neither would it hurt to read up on Lev Kuleshov and Sergey Eisenstein... I have no right to insist on it, however. The abundance of boring conversation and the shortage of well put-together stories at this point is counterbalanced, in my opinion, only by the "Tele-Store." Following in the footsteps of Russian futurist Ilya Zdanevich, the program contends that an American shoe is more beautiful than the Venus de Milo. The five-minute-long advertising display of expensive consumer goods is the only program where the image on the screen is in harmony with the text, while the short length of the show does not give the viewer enough time to wallow in envy. There is also a pleasant anchor, who combines provincial shyness with the ingenuity of a beginner stockbroker. Nika, the anchor of another program, also is a feast for the eye. Provided one watches her program with the sound turned off.
