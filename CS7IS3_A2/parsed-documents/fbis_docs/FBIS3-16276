Thereby began the process of forming a representative branch of power in Russia, and this process is now moving to the regions. TRUD's correspondent discusses what is happening now as regards elections in the federation components with Sergey Samoylov, deputy chief of the Administration for Work With Territories of the Russian Federation President's Administration. [Dorofeyev] Let us begin our conversation, Sergey Nikolayevich, at the end. Where, in your view, do the greatest difficulties now lie as regards the elections to the new representative organs of the Russian Federation components? [Samoylov] Elections will be held in the majority of regions 20 and 27 March 1994. As far as the significance of the elections is concerned, the problem is the public's poor understanding of the new quality of the representative organs. Very little purposeful explanatory work is being carried out in this area, and far from everyone understands that they will not be a reproduction of the system of soviets, but fundamentally different representative organs. There are also difficulties of a purely political character. After all, these organs are to be formed in the absence of currently existing representative power in the localities, with virtually all organizational questions being "farmed out" to executive structures. Now the executive organs, tired of fighting after several years of confrontation with the soviets, want to obtain ineffectual representative organs. The Russian president, however, is committed to seeing that the principle of the separation of powers and the principle of people's power which are enshrined in the mechanism of these elections finally begin to operate. A cause of unease is the high activity of opposition political forces seeking at any cost to seize a dominant position in the organs of power by exploiting the election campaign for the purposes of discrediting the president's reform policy. In the majority of regions the sociopolitical situation is pretty tense, which will undoubtedly have an impact on voter turnout, putting in doubt the possibility of holding elections in a number of regions on the dates established by edicts, or affect the quality of these elections. This applies to regions of the Far North and to Magadan Oblast. There is no experience of legislative activity in the regions. [Dorofeyev] If I understand you correctly, the creation of norms governing the formation of the representative organs of power in the regions has been entirely transferred to the local executive power. But does it have some kind of coherent legal basis for this activity? [Samoylov] Yes, undoubtedly. A series of edicts of the Russian Federation president on stage-by-stage constitutional reform were elaborated. These edicts concerned the general principles of the organization of state power in the federation components and of the reform of the organs of local self-government, the timetable for holding elections, the role of administrations in holding them, and the powers of the representative organs. In addition there are individual articles in the Russian Constitution which define the level of the organs of self-government and the character of their activity, although the details are certainly not spelled out in the Fundamental Law. At the moment a legal basis incorporating national, local, and historical features is being created in the regions on the basis of the president's edicts. But, insofar as the president's edicts are the basis of the election campaign, we do not want them to be discredited. Therefore, normative documents elaborated in the regions undergo mandatory expert analysis here, in the president's administration, and are invariably coordinated with the Central Electoral Commission. True, the federation components approach the creation of this legal basis in different ways. In Yaroslavl and Penza Oblasts and Stavropol Kray the matter has even gone before the courts. The documents that have been adopted contain gaps, errors, and even deviations from juridical norms. These flaws from both the legal and organizational points of view are, incidentally, common to the majority of regions. [Dorofeyev] Could you name the basic ones? [Samoylov] There are several. First, as before, there is a noticeable gravitation toward the principle of nominating candidates according to the territorial administration principle. Thus there can be a five to sixfold difference in the size of the population of the various rayons of an oblast or kray, but there were proposals to elect an equal number of deputies from each. But this is a violation of the constitutional principle of citizens' equal suffrage. Second, there is the mandatory allocation of guaranteed seats for various national groups. Nowadays this is an unconstitutional norm. There is so far no uniform position on the participation of representatives of the executive organs of power in the elections either. The range of opinions runs from a total ban, as in St. Petersburg and Nizhniy Novgorod, for example, to, in effect, total authorization of such participation. Thus following the 30 January elections in Penza Oblast, 20 of the 45 deputies are heads of administrations or their deputies. Article 66 of the the Russian Federation Constitution assigns the right to adopt the charter of a kray or oblast to the region's representative organ of power; however, the administrations of Vladimir, Vologda, and a number of other oblasts are trying to submit charters to local referenda. But the documents are crude from the legal point of view, and moreover, there is no law on local referenda. Thus the basis is laid for future conflict. [Dorofeyev] However, elections have already been held in 15 regions of Russia. Can the executive branch of power be considered satisfied with the outcome of these elections? [Samoylov] It is mainly people of the old so-called party and economic aktiv who have been voted on to all the newly elected organs. And now, when a significant part of the budget will be formed at local level, the expenditure part could be based, not on the interest of the region, but on the collective or private interests of the local political or economic elite. This is alarming. Given such a makeup the representative organs of power will continue to direct their activity toward resolving day-to-day economic questions, although these have now been withdrawn from their jurisdiction. A worrying trend is the virtual absence of lawyers in the new representative organs. After all, the legislative function is to become the basic activity of these organs. Nor are there any economists in the classical sense of the word. Though it is possible to look at these problems from another point of view. Voters have entrusted mandates to the people who control the real levers of power, and who therefore will be able to do something for them. [Dorofeyev] Does this apply to all the federation components? [Samoylov] In principle -- yes. There is no serious reform of the new organs of power even in the republics. As a result of elections here even the leaders have on the whole stayed the same, as, for example, in Aldygey, Altay, Tuva... True, reform has been carried out thoughtfully and effectively in Kabardino-Balkaria, Mariy El, and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). [Dorofeyev] And are there regions where elections have taken place without coordination with the Central Electoral Commission? [Samoylov] No, there are no such cases, but a number of territories have put well-argued requests to the Central Electoral Commission and the President's Administration to postpone elections to later dates. The requests of Sverdlovsk, Chelyabinsk, Saratov, and Krasnodar Administrations have been granted. Nor are objections being made to the decisions of a number of republics where elections will be held in summer or fall 1994. [Dorofeyev] What forecasts can be made on the basis of the results of the elections which have been held in 15 regions? [Samoylov] Some conclusions can be drawn already. Evidently, the voter turnout will be considerably lower than for the elections to the Federal Assembly. On the other hand, the competition for deputies' seats is high: between five and 15 candidates. All parties and movements are displaying the most energetic and committed attention to the election campaign, but their leaders will not, as a rule, be elected to the local dumas. Therefore candidates are mainly trying to distance themselves from political parties (although they have a definite political "complexion") and prefer to stand as independent candidates or as representatives of groups of voters. I suggest that between 40 and 50 percent of deputies will turn out to be heads of administrations at all levels. Speaking of the results as a whole, in my view it will be mainly people who want to be involved in practical business, and not in politics, who will succeed. And this will probably enable political disputes to be somehow avoided. God grant, as the saying goes, that this mood continues among deputies and voters alike.... [Dorofeyev] And finally, Sergey Nikolayevich, a question which nowadays concerns many people -- the timetable for holding the elections. There is a very wide range of opinions here, and only quite recently the Russian Federation president's Public Chamber actually recommended that the process of holding elections to the representative organs of power be extended until June 1994. What is your opinion on this subject? [Samoylov] This concerns the organs of local self-government. Indeed, elections were planned in 48 regions of Russia from January through March, but the quality of the legal basis raises doubts in many political forces. The executive at the local level proceeds on the premise that simultaneous elections will help to increase voter turnout and save money. The president's administration shares the concern of the Public Chamber. From our point of view, it more correct to hold elections to the regional representative organ of power first. It elaborates and ratifies the normative basis for the organs of local self-government, using the existing administration documents and the edicts of the Russian Federation president. Though I have already said that there is no strict regulation as to the timeframes...
