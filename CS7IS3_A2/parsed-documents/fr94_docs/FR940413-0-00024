FR940413-0-00024 FR940413-0-00005 The guiding principles of the new appendix to part 190 are to assure that there is generally pro rata distribution to customers of the customer funds in the bankrupt FCM's commodity interest estate and that non-XM customers of such an FCM are not adversely affected by a shortfall in the pool of XM funds. The new appendix preserves the principle that non-XM customers will never receive less than they would have received in the absence of an XM program, but the distributional rule will not require market professionals participating in XM programs to subordinate claims they may make for customer property in all instances. Under the new appendix, a bankruptcy trustee handling the commodity interest estate of a bankrupt FCM with XM customer funds must first determine the respective shortfalls, if any, in the pools of XM customer and non-XM customer segregated funds. The trustee then would calculate the shortfall in each pool as a percentage of the segregation requirement for the pool. If there were no shortfall in either of the two pools; if there were an equal percentage shortfall in the two pools; if there were a shortfall in the non-XM pool only; or if the percentage of shortfall were greater in the non-XM pool than in the XM pool, the two pools of segregated funds would be combined and XM customers and non-XM customers would share pro rata in the combined pool. 12 However, if there were a shortfall in the XM pool only, or if the percentage of shortfall were greater in the XM pool than in the non-XM pool, the two pools of segregated funds would not be combined. 13 Rather, XM customers would share pro rata in the pool of XM segregated funds, while non-XM customers would share pro rata in the pool of non-XM segregated funds. To facilitate this distributional framework, subclasses of customer accounts, an XM account and a non-XM account, would be recognized. 14 12 See Examples 1, 6, 2 and 5 of appendix B to part 190, Framework 1. 13 See Examples 3 and 4 of appendix B to part 190, Framework 1. 14 As noted above, CBOE filed the only written comment on the Commission's proposal, expressing support. However, CBOE also stated its belief that the two pools of segregated funds should be treated separately in all instances, which would result in more favorable treatment of XM customers in Examples 2 and 5. As with the previous distribution system for a bankrupt FCM with XM-related claims, the new appendix ensures that non-XM customers will never receive less than they would have received in the absence of an XM program. Of course, without the specific subordination of XM customer claims to non-XM customer claims in all cases by market professionals participating in XM programs, non-XM customers will, depending upon the circumstances, receive either equivalent or less favorable distributions under the approach of the new appendix than they would have received under the Commission's previous bankruptcy distribution for FCMs participating in an XM program. In those cases where there is no shortfall in the non-XM pool (see Examples 1 and 3), the distribution to non-XM customers will be the same under the new appendix as it has been previously. However, in those cases where there is a shortfall in the non-XM pool, the pro rata distribution across the combined XM and non-XM pools (see Examples 2, 5 and 6) or the separate treatment of the XM and non-XM pools and the XM and non-XM account subclasses (see Example 4) will generally mean a less favorable distribution to the non-XM customers than has been previously required. 15 This is the result because there will no longer be a marshalling of all assets available from segregated funds, including those attributable to XM customers, to satisfy all claims from non-XM customers before any claim of an XM customer can be satisfied. The Commission believes these outcomes are fair to all parties involved and consistent with general bankruptcy principles, and that they eliminate the need for execution of a separate subordination agreement to comply with section 4d(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act once participating market professionals elect ``commodity'' customer treatment for the XM account. 15 Of course, if there were no segregated funds available at all attributable to XM customers, which could be the case in extreme circumstances under Examples 4 or 6, there would also be no difference in the distribution to non-XM customers as a result of the new appendix.
