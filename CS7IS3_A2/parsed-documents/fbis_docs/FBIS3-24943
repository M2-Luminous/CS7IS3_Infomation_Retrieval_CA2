The manifesto was announced earlier at the NP federal congress at Kempton Park. In a statement in Johannesburg the ANC says that instead of presenting concrete proposals, NP leaders have attempted to undermine the ANC. It said the NP remained wedded to policies that would leave 75 percent of the population living in poverty and squalor.
