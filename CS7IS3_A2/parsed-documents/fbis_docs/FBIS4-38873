Responding to an ITAR-TASS question about his main conclusions after Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to his republic, Shaymiyev said that, after the signing of the bilateral treaty between the center and Tatarstan, "peace and accord have settled in the republic. And it is very important that Boris Nikolayevich (Yeltsin) saw the support for that act on peoples' faces". The creation of a bilateral commission headed by the Tatarstan leader and Russia's first vice-premier allows the two sides to monitor the fulfillment of the treaty's 12 articles, Shaymiyev said. He continued on to say that the document makes it possible to "develop a conception for the decentralization of the federal economy, using the example of Tatarstan, and to remove the petty tutelage of the centre". Time has shown that "Tatarstan's economic course, which differs somewhat from the federal one, has justified itself", the republican president noted. The best indicator of that is that "the population has not been impoverished". "The republic's position in the fight against crime has also been recognized", Shaymiyev said, explaining that his republic's law enforcement bodies are "in control of the situation and have overcome their fear of the underworld".
