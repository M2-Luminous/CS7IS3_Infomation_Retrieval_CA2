An active participant in last May's and last October's riots in Moscow, Konstantinov left the Lefortovo prison as a result of the amnesty proclaimed by the State Duma on February 23rd. According to Konstantinov, the amnesty granted to "those who defended the Supreme Soviet and the Constitution is first of all an act of justice", since "the people charged together with him are not to blame for anything". Konstantinov described the attempts to link the amnesty with the start of another spiral of civil war in Russia as "political provocation". According to him, in Russian society there are forces interested in "inciting political hysteria" with a view to using the resulting situation as a means of pressure on the State Duma and on the opposition. When asked about his short-term plans, Konstantinov said that he intends to "have a rest and get his bearings".
