On 14 January Jose de Castro granted an interview to Radio Mozambique in Xai-Xai during which he accused the Gaza Provincial Government in general, and Governor Eugenio Numaio in particular, of not even wanting to hear of Renamo in the province. He also said that the provincial government has not shown any interest in granting premises for the Renamo provincial branch to operate and to accommodate Renamo's three provincial advisers. Gaza Provincial Governor Numaio noted that such accusations are typical of people who only know how to make demands and know little about the difficulties faced by those wanting to satisfy those needs.
