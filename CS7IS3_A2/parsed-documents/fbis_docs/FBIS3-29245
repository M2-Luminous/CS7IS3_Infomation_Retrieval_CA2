His comments came in a fiscal address to a plenary session of the Diet's House of Representatives following Tuesday's submission of the government's plan for the third fiscal 1993 supplementary budget that finances a large chunk of the pump-priming measures. "The economy remains in a tough situation, but the time is ripening toward a recovery with inventory and capital stock adjustments progressing under support from buoyant housing construction and public-works spending," Fujii said. He stressed that the government has unveiled the stimulus program to spread "such recovery buds" in a bid to move the economy toward "a full-fledged recovery phase as early as possible in fiscal 1994 and to ensure stable growth in and after fiscal 1995." Fujii expressed his "confidence" that the pump-primer would combine with the third extra budget and economy-oriented fiscal 1994 budget to "wipe out uncertainties ahead and make a great contribution" to the economy's full-scale recovery. The government on Tuesday adopted a fiscal 1994 budget worth 73,081.7 billion yen which it will submit to the Diet in early March. Explaining the third extra budget, Fujii said it boosts overall fiscal 1993 spending by 2,185.2 billion yen to 77,437.5 billion yen, including 1,500 billion yen in additional spending on public works. The new budget also calls for issuing 2,182.0 billion yen in contruction bonds to finance the additional outlays. Referring to the increased debt, Fujii said the fiscal position has become increasingly tough with the huge outstanding balance of bonds and debt-servicing costs squeezing funds for allocations to policy expenditures. Against this backdrop, Fujii indicated his intention to push forward tax reforms in connection to income tax and other tax cuts worth some 6 trillion yen included in the stimulus package, saying he will "strongly promote fiscal reform." Under the fiscal 1994 budget, the government plans to issue deficit-financing bonds for the first time in five years to cover the tax cuts. The red-ink bonds are to total 3,133.8 billion yen. According to an agreement on the tax issue by the ruling coalition parties, a forum will be set up to decide on ways to finance the tax breaks by the end of the year.
