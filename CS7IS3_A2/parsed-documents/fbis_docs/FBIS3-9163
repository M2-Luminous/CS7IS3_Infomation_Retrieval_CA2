Major Simon MacDowall, spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), said the weapons -- tanks, anti-aircraft guns and mortars -- were discovered Sunday by Canadian troops in the village of Cifluk right at the edge of the 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone set by NATO. He said the weapons were placed under UN control even though the Serbs consider Cifluk outside the exclusion zone. The Serbs have defined the exclusion zone by using Sarajevo's cathedral as the central point from which to calculate the 20 kilometres while the UN defines the centre about a kilometre further west from the cathedral. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and UNPROFOR chief of staff in Bosnia, Dutch General Adrian van Ball, held a meeting in the Serb stronghold of Pale Monday and agreed to negotiate the controversy. "Van Ball came back very satisfied with the positive attitude of the Bosnian Serbs," MacDowell said. He said the exclusion zone could not be entirely monitored by UN peacekeepers because of a lack of manpower. He added, however, that the situation had been relatively calm since NATO issued an ultimatum February 9 threatening air strikes unless the Serbs and Bosnian government troops withdrew their heavy weapons from around the besieged capital. He said UN military observers had noticed that troops on both sides appeared more relaxed on the frontlines and there was "no more sniping in Sarajevo." "That forward momentum is still going on," he said.
