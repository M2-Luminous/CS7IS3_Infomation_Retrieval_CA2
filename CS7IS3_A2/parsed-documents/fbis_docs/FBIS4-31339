FBIS4-31339 "dreeu110__a94020" FBIS-EEU-94-110-A Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Council Rejects Bill on Bilingual Place-Names Council Rejects Bill on Bilingual Place-Names AU0406171094 Prague CTK in English 1744 GMT 3 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0406171094 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, June 3 (CTK) -- The Slovak parliament today rejected the bill on place names which would enable the use of bilingual (Slovak-Hungarian) names for towns and villages in which the ethnic minority populations make up at least one fifth of the population. One of Slovakia's commitments towards the Council of Europe remains thus unfulfilled and the government coalition suffered a serious break. Although the coalition supported by the Hungarian minority parties had a majority in parliament, only 67 deputies voted for the law, 61 deputy voted against it and 6 deputies abstained from voting. Only one vote more was required for the law to be passed. Two of the 14 Hungarian deputies present abstained from the vote and one even voted against. These three deputies from the Egyutteles movement were dissatisfied by the change in the initial government bill banning the use of Hungarian names in the case of villages named after Slovak historical figures, such as for example Sladkovicovo and Hurbanovo. The failure was also due to the absence of a part of coalition deputies and the negative stand by former supporters of the Slovak National Party (SNS) who have come over to the government camp. The SNS was a coalition partner of Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS, until the government was dismissed in mid-March. The parliament rejected proposals for changes in the bill, but approved a compromise proposal by Lubomir Forgas from the government Democratic Left Party (SDL) to ban names from the period of Magyarisation and Hortyite occupation of southern Slovakia in World War Two. The proposal would also make it possible to change the names stated in the minority's language on the basis of local referendum. This was a second attempt to comply with Slovakia's promise to fulfill recommendations from the Council of Europe (CE) last June when Slovakia was admitted as a CE member. In January this year the parliament rejected a bill submitted by Meciar's government, also due to negative votes by Hungarian deputies, because the bill would have allowed bilingual road sign posts only in communities in which the minority constitutes at least 30 per cent of the population. The two-day heated debate has confirmed that the nationality question has been a topic of political struggle before autumn elections (September 30-October 1). The opposition did not hesitate to argue with fears of Magyrisation, irredentism and Hungarian territorial autonomy in the south inhabited by a Hungarian minority of more than half a million. Hungarian deputies did not conceal their disappointment at the government's failure to fulfill its promise made to the Hungarian coalition (Egyutteles and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, MKDH -- 14 out of a total of 150 parliamentary seats). MKDH group's chairman Pal Csaky told CTK that "it would be premature to speak about a coalition crisis, but it (the bill's rejection) will have serious consequences. We will not go over to the opposition in any case, this would be short-sighted." Arpad Duka-Zolyomi from Egyutteles said that "the government coalition has failed to keep its word... The situation can assume the proportions of a crisis." But he added that "union with the opposition is ruled out." He said that the Hungarian groups had supported the bill even in the changed form because it would have allowed 480 communities to use Hungarian names. He added he did not think that the different stands by three Egyutteles deputies could affect the Hungarian coalition's unity. Peter Weiss, chairman of the strongest coalition entity, Democratic Left Party (SDL), said "the (failed) vote on one bill cannot be considered an expression of difficulties in the government coalition. I do not see the ensuing situation as dramatic." He said that HZDS and SNS deputies had not had the will to agree to an acceptable compromise, but added he was convinced that "any government will have to submit such a law sooner or later" because of the commitment made to the CE. "The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak National Party do not have any other but the nationality card for their voters and they want to base their campaign on provoking the feeling of danger," Weiss said. Tibor Cabaj, chairman of the HZDS group, said: "We could not support the bill since our proposals improving it were not accepted. The project solved only the demands of the Hungarian minority and did not take into consideration the others. Moreover, it directly forced (on communities) bilingualism while our proposal left it up to the communities to decide." "The law was not approved because of the absence of deputies from the government coalition," chairman of the Democratic Union (DEUS) group Vladimir Bajan admitted. He added that the expected the negative stand by deputies from the National Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA) of Ludovit Cernak to have "repercussions" in the coalition. "The compromise character of the law was so strong that it was impossible not to approve it. The revivalists (Slovak historical figures) have only caused problems. It will probably be necessary to call an extraordinary coalition meeting," Bajan said.
