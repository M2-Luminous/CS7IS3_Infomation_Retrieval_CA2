FR940426-1-00081 FR940426-1-00008 Section 211(c)(4)(A) provides that, subject to specified exceptions, States may not regulate characteristics of motor vehicle fuels or additives in order to control motor vehicle emissions once EPA has regulated that characteristic or has found that such regulation is not necessary. Congress apparently sought to preempt States from interfering with national uniformity in federal fuel regulations. Subparagraph (C) specifies an exception for States to regulate fuels and additives in their SIPs, which the Administrator may approve ``only if [s]he finds that the State control or prohibition is necessary to achieve the national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard which the plan implements.'' Prior to the 1990 Amendments, the term ``necessary'' was not further defined. At that time, EPA regulated the volatility of gasoline under section 211(c) in order to control evaporative emissions of VOCs. Certain States sought approval from EPA for more stringent volatility controls on the grounds that such more stringent controls were ``necessary'' under section 211(c)(4)(C). EPA approved States' more stringent volatility controls in New York and New Jersey, among others 7 . In addition, EPA earlier approved Arizona's controls on oxygenate content of gasoline in order to control carbon monoxide emissions as necessary under section 211(c)(4)(C). 8 In approving these State controls, EPA articulated a test for determining ``necessity.'' There, EPA explained that if, after accounting for the possible reductions from all other reasonable control measures, the State could demonstrate that further measures are still needed for attainment, then the fuel controls are ``necessary'' within the meaning of section 211(c)(4)(C). EPA first articulated this test in the Arizona case: 7 See EPA's Approvals of Revisions for State Implementation Plans for New York, 54 FR 26030, 26031 (June 21, 1989) and New Jersey, 54 FR 25572, 25573 (June 16, 1989). 8 See EPA's Approval of Revisions for State Implementation Plan for Arizona, 53 FR 17378, 17413 (May 16, 1988) and 53 FR 30224, 20228 (Aug. 10, 1988). EPA believes that a fuel control measure may be ``necessary'' for timely attainment if no other measures that would bring about timely attainment exist, or if such other measures exist and are technically possible to implement but are unreasonable or impracticable.'' 53 FR at 17413. In short, EPA's approach was that the controls were necessary if they would still be needed for attainment after adoption of all other reasonable and practicable measures. Congress subsequently codified this interpretation when it added a definition of ``necessary'' to section 211(c)(4)(C) in the 1990 Amendments. 9 9 Of course, Congress did not codify this or any other definition of ``necessary'' in section 184. This difference might arguably support EPA's discretion to adopt a different approach to the term under section 184. In applying this definition of ``necessary'' in the fuel context, EPA explained that it would not require that a State impose more drastic measures (such as driving prohibitions, gas rationing, or plant shutdowns), as alternatives to State fuel controls. See 54 FR at 26031 and 26035. EPA further explained that it would conclude that measures are ``necessary'' when no other measures that EPA or the State has found reasonable are available 10 to achieve this reduction. Beyond such identified ``reasonable'' measures, EPA need look at other measures before [the fuel] control only if it has clear evidence that [the fuel] control would have greater adverse impacts than those alternatives. Therefore, EPA can defer to [the State's] apparent view that [the fuel] control is the next less costly (or is itself a reasonable) measure. 10 In context, it appears that EPA intended the word ``available'' to mean ``sufficient.'' See 54 FR at 26031. EPA did consider cost-effectiveness of alternative measures as one criterion, but not the only criterion, for evaluating the reasonableness of the alternatives. 54 FR at 26035. EPA also explained: ``Arguably, an alternative measure is `reasonable' only if its effects are less drastic than the effects of the fuel controls.'' Id.
