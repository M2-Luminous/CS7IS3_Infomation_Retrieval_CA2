The response that was conveyed to the Russian Foreign Ministry today states that it is Turkey's most natural right to regulate the maritime traffic in the straits in a way that will ensure maritime safety and protect the environment. According to information released by the Foreign Ministry, the note, whose contents were made public by the Russian Federation's foreign affairs spokesman, states that Russia shares Turkey's concern regarding the maritime safety of the straits but that this issue should be solved at the international level. The Foreign Ministry announcement adds that the reply message conveyed to the Russian Federation expresses the following views: We welcome the fact that the Russian Federation shares our concern regarding traffic safety in the Turkish straits and that it accepts the fact of the existence of an urgent and serious problem that needs to be solved. We, however, do not agree with the views that the statutes and regulations are in contravention of the Montreux Treaty and that they may be implemented arbitrarily. We believe that these views constitute a biased approach to technical regulations which we have not even begun to implement. The reply message further recalls that for the past 58 years, Turkey has been meticulously implementing the Montreux Treaty, adding that concerns regarding this issue are invalid. The message adds that the Turkish Government has no intention of unilaterally changing the Montreux Treaty and that the changes in the statute are nothing more than the reflection of international rules and regulations on domestic law.
