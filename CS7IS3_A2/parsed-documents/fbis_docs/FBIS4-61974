Staff at the Kyrgyz Customs Directorate are facing now the task of recovering this money from commercial structures and enterprises. This has been said by Anatoliy Linishenko, head of the Republican Customs Directorate, during a briefing at government house. Over the last year 32 million soms in customs duty were paid to the state budget, which comprises around 20-30 percent of the possible volume of customs dues. The reasons for this are inefficiency of the Customs Directorate, the open border with Tajikistan, gross violations of customs rules by a great number of commercial organizations, and other reasons.
