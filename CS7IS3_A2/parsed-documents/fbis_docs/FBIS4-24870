The "EL TIEMPO" newspaper revealed today that Colombia's Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda and Air Force Commander Major General Alfonso Abondano Alzamora spoke out publicly and forcefully to that respect. The minister and commander were in response to the U.S. Government's official information on Tuesday [31 May] that the suspension of U.S. radar operations in Colombia and Peru was due to the fact that the U.S. Defense Department is in disagreement with Colombia's decision and practices in Peru. Pardo Rueda affirmed that the Colombian Government is not going to suspend its order to Colombia's Air Force to intercept planes without registration numbers, request their flight plan and force them to land if the pilots of those aircraft do not supply the same or shoot them down if they refuse to comply with orders. He said that the measure is a valuable tool which Colombia is using to prevent drug traffickers and other criminals from violating Colombian air space. Colombia's Air Force commander lodged a protest over the unilateral suspension of radar operations and said that the U.S. decision was taken without consultation. It was reported that the U.S. Government is studying the re-establishment of radar services and information for controlling drug trafficking in Colombia and Peru.
