FR940607-2-00096 FR940607-2-00064 The Commission believes that the rule change to NYSE Rule 79A.30 to permit a Floor Governor to change the two point parameter for transactions in securities trading at $100 or over, is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it will facilitate trading during unusual market conditions. The Commission believes that the rule change may help to minimize the possibility of delays in reporting trades to the Tape during highly volatile trading days by eliminating the need to obtain Floor Official approval for certain trades of higher priced securities. Furthermore, because Floor Official approval is required for each transaction to be executed outside of the price parameters once a Floor Governor approves a change, the Commission believes that the rule change provides appropriate Exchange oversight of trades away from the last sale of a security, which will help to ensure that specialists satisfy their market making responsibilities during unusual market conditions. 8 In addition, all changes in the two point parameter will be reported to the exchange's Market Surveillance Division by the Floor Governor, thereby providing Exchange oversight of the Floor Governor's decision. The Commission further believes requiring that the decision to change the two point price parameter be made by a Floor Governor on a day-by-day basis will emphasize the intent that the two point parameter be changed only in unusual circumstances. 9 8 Under Section 11 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 78k, specialists have the responsibility to act as dealers to the extent necessary to maintain fair and orderly markets, which includes tempering sudden price movements and keeping any general price movements orderly. See Division of Market Regulation, October 1987 Market Break Report, at 4&hyph;3. 9 This rule change is intended to apply only to intra-day trading, and will not affect opening transactions. See Letter from James E. Buck, Senior Vice President and Secretary, NYSE, to Howard Kramer, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, dated June 12, 1990. The Exchange states that it has a ``a long-standing policy of requiring Floor Official approval for the opening trades in any stock transaction that will result in a price change of *␣*␣* two points or more away from a last sale of $20 or more.'' Id. The Commission believes the rule change to NYSE Rule 123A.40 to permit specialists to participate in transactions which result in the election of stop orders without guaranteeing the execution price of the stop orders is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it will benefit investors by facilitating single-price executions of orders. Currently, when a market order arrives at a specialist's post and the depth of the current bid or offer is not sufficient to provide a single-price execution of the order, the specialist cannot participate in the transaction if a stop order would be elected without guaranteeing the price of the stop order and obtaining Floor Official approval. When the specialist does not participate, the market order is partially executed against the best bid or offer, and partially executed against any elected stop orders and limit orders on the specialist's book, usually at different prices. The rule change allows the specialist to participate in such transactions without guaranteeing the price of any elected stop orders or obtaining Floor Official approval, and thereby makes it more likely that specialists will provide investors with single-price execution of their orders. While the Commission views the prohibition on specialist participation in the election of stop orders as helpful in guarding against the potential for abuse, 10 we recognize that certain benefits can accrue from permitting limited specialist participation under the conditions set forth in the rule to facilitate single price executions. Specifically, unlike the situation where the specialist enters his own bid or offer, when a specialist participates in the execution of a customer's market order under the proposed rule, he will not be setting the price of the transaction that elects the stop orders. Rather, the price will be determined by another market participant, independent of any price-setting determination by the specialist. The Commission therefore believes that allowing specialists to facilitate single-price execution of market orders through passive participation will not negatively affect the execution of stop orders elected by the transactions, and does not present the opportunity for abuses that may be present were the specialist is actively setting the price through his own proprietary bids or offers. 11 10 The provision of Rule 123A.40 that requires specialists to guarantee the price of elected stop orders and requires floor official approval when a specialist elects stop orders through his own bid or offer are intended to address, in part, the situation where a specialist has an accumulation of stop orders and desires to ``clean up the book.'' This can be accomplished by the specialist entering a bid, for example, that elects all of the stop sell orders at the lowest stop order price, or by electing stop sell orders in a series of descending prices until the lowest order is reached. The specialist could use these stop order election processes to drive the share price down to an artificially low level in order to obtain cheap stock at the expense of the public customers. The potential for this type of abuse is not present, however, where a customer market order sets the trading price and incidentally elects stop orders of which the customer was unaware. 11 See id. The Commission further believes that the rule change requiring Floor Governor approval for any transactions which will result in the execution of an elected stop order outside the one or two point parameters contained in NYSE Rule 79A.30, or any temporary parameters established by a Floor Governor during unusual market conditions pursuant thereto, will provide increased scrutiny of gap-executions of stop orders and thereby benefit investors consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act. The Commission notes that under Rule 79A.30, Floor Official approval is needed for transactions effected outside the price parameters contained therein, but that under Rule 123A.40, Floor Governor approval is necessary for the execution of stop orders outside the price parameters of Rule, 79A.30 when the stop orders are elected by a transaction in which a specialist participated. The Commission believes this increased Exchange oversight of specialists' proprietary activity will provide investors with additional protection against potential trading abuses related to the execution of stop orders.
