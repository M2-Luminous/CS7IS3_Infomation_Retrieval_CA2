He said that he does not accept as well-founded the attacks that Prime Minister Berov made in his parliamentary statement yesterday against his work as minister of trade and deputy prime minister, accusing him of forgetting about privatization and failing to provide assessment reports on the work of the Trade Ministry. He said that the cabinet changes envisaged by the prime minister did not coincide with his own views. These in short seem to be the motives for Karabashev's resignation, which will take effect if it is accepted by the National Assembly. In this connection, National Assembly Deputy Asen Michkovski announced that he will propose to the New Alliance for Democracy parliamentary group to start collecting signatures for a petition asking for the parliamentary Easter vacation to be curtailed. In Michkovski's view, the fact is that we are in a government crisis and the National Assembly should be reconvened as soon as possible.
