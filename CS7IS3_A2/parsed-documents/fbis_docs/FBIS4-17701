Speaking at a meeting with law enforcers in Minsk on Monday, Kebich said that the fist part of the agreement reducing customs tariffs will enter into force on May 1 and allow enterprises to sell their products and receive orders. "Additionally, the prices of basic goods and communal services will be frozen in May. People's well-being will begin to grow due to increases in wages and salaries and implementation of targeted social programmes," he said. Kebich believes that one of the factors that has allowed the Byelorussian economy to survive is that it has preserved "even relations with Russia. They have remained unchanged even in conditions when our local nationalist reformers celebrated their `victory' over `Muscovites' near Orsha or unwind in their absurd articles a new spiral of Russophobia." Kebich also pointed to the "conscientious rejection of shock therapy" and "populism, adventurism and nationalism" as major factors that helped preserve stability in Byelorussia.
