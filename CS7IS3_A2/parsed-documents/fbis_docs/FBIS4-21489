But we are fooling ourselves if we think this means action. Last week the European countries agreed on a new sulphur pollution protocol. Emissions which come down over Norway in the form of acid rain and kill more and more of Norwegian nature, shall be reduced further over the next 10 years. The agreement will be formally signed in Oslo in June. The great agreement on climate from the environment summit in Rio in 1992 will go into effect in a couple of weeks. Just before Christmas the sister-agreement on biological variety went into effect after having been ratified by 30 national assemblies. Applause and Honor Environment bureaucrats are applauding each other. Never before have agreements gone into effect at such a rapid pace. It is hardly two years ago that the accords were signed. And new protocols and regional agreements concerning various small and large environmental problems are being signed all over the world. However, it would be a fatal mistake in judgement to applaud too loudly. Certainly, paper formalities resulting from environmental efforts are being crowned by victory more often in the 1990's than was common before. But it is a long step from the signing of the agreement to the matter being acted upon. Only a few of the 50 to 60 important environmental agreements in the world have strong built-in mechanisms for follow-up and control. This year's edition of the ``Green Globe Yearbook'' also shows that the follow-up is poor even for those agreements that have the best built-in mechanisms for follow-up. The world's environmental agreements can be roughly divided into two categories. In one there are the large accords and framework agreements. These are most suitable for politicians who want to calm an environmentally preoccupied public opinion. The great accords on climate and biological variety from Rio are good examples of this. Without new supplementary protocols for the most part these are without any value for the global environment. Action The other type of agreement are those targeting specific actions. Unfortunately, these are a small minority, but all the more important. The best known of these is the Montreal protocol from 1987 with a later addendum whose goal was to phase out emission of gases harmful to the ozone layer. This agreement has been clearly spelled out. It stipulates definite deadlines for all the 131 participating countries. Still, by the deadline of September of last year, only 23 percent of these countries had reported on what they were in fact doing and what results they had achieved. Because it is assumed that most countries would report any action taken on what they had promised to do, the low percentage of reporting countries is taken as a sign that many are not following up. Because this is an agreement with important consequences for industry, the lack of action in individual countries will affect their ability to compete. That is why the great industrialized countries have taken the initiative and proposed introducing strict punishment for the shirkers. Having received a warning those countries might be excluded from the agreement. This means a loss of both prestige and money from the ``ozone fund.'' The new sulphur agreement belongs to this latter group. True, the text of the agreement offers no opportunity for the imposing of sanctions, but because reduced sulphur emissions in the future will be very costly the 28 participating countries will monitor each other closely. Shirking means advantages for one's own industry. The sulphur agreement is also very modern. It is a model for future environment agreements in which each country is charged with measures according to how great their emissions are and to the amount of damage they cause. That means saying goodbye to the old-fashioned principle in which all countries must reduce their pollution by the same percentage no matter what the cost and what effect it has. The new sulphur agreement takes as its point of departure the amount of sulpher oxide the various countries are contributing and the amount of damage caused by these emissions according to simulations by computer models. So far our global society has been able to draft a good agreement either for very definite objectives, such as, for example, how to decrease the emission of gases that break down the ozone layer or for controlling problems that are strictly geographically limited, for instance acid rain in Europe. However, our answer to the really large and serious problems that place the world in the middle of a serious environmental crisis, is to come up with loose, totally irrelevant nonbinding agreements. To mention just a few; the population explosion, poverty, cutting down the rain forest in the south and the irreplaceable conifer forest in the north, the loss of several hundred plant and animal species every year, the danger of a changed climate as a result of global warming .... So far the world has not been mature enough to take the environmental crisis completely seriously. The meeting in Rio in 1992 started a trend. But such trends are without value unless they lead to definite action. And to achieve action, obviously some sort of voluntary force is needed. So far many of the environmental agreements and negotiations around them have been a singular form of ritual dance, mostly suited only to sooth a worried public opinion. The most pessimistic people say that we must wait for a total environmental collapse before the world will react. Another alternative is to put some teeth into the agreements. To do that we need a vigilant public opinion which will not settle for weak agreements with weak follow-up.
