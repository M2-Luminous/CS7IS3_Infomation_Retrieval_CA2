On January 10 the spacecraft is planned to be docked with the Mir orbital complex. For three days the crews of two expeditions -- the 14th expedition (Vasili Tsibiliev and Aleksandr Serebrov) and the 15th expedition -- will be working there. On January 14 Tsibiliev and Serebrov will return to the Earth on board the Soyuz TM-17 spacecraft. Afanasyev, Usachev and Polyakov will work at the Mir complex for 179 days. The fact that the crew includes a professional medic is the characteristic feature of the expedition. He is going to set the record of the longest stay of man in outer space and to spend more than a year at the orbital complex (429 days). Polyakov will work as a member of the 15th, 16th and 17th main expeditions. A number of medical experiments will be conducted during the current space mission. Special attention will be devoted to the medical and sanitary-hygienic aspects of super-long space flights, including the future space expeditions to Mars, as well as to methods of offsetting the negative impact of weightlessness on human body during long flights. During the simultaneous work of the two crews a series of biotechnological experiments will be conducted, so that Tsibiliev and Serebrov will be able to bring their results to the Earth. Afanasyev, Usachev and Polyakov will conduct some technological experiments in the sphere of crystallography, the study of the impact of vacuum on various materials, and to continue astrophysical studies and the long-distance sounding of the Earth. The work on geological anomalies will be resumed. The study from outer space of the emergence and development of typhoons in various parts of the world ocean is going to be very interesting. No space walkouts are planned. The crew will receive three cargo spacecraft, one of which will have a ballistic capsule to be returned to the Earth. Planned repair and maintenance work will be continued in order to keep the Mir complex in a proper condition.
