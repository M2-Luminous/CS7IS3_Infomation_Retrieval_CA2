FBIS4-21177 "jptdd017__l94020" JPRS-TDD-94-017-L JPRS Narcotics 13 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA BOLIVIA Reporter's Alleged Phone Conversation With Fernandez Lazcano Reporter's Alleged Phone Conversation With Fernandez Lazcano Detailed PY1404121194 La Paz Television Nacional Network in Spanish 0100 GMT 13 Apr 94 PY1404121194 La Paz Television Nacional Network Spanish BFN [Text] Announcer Carlos Mesa: At approximately 1930 on 11 April, I received a phone call from Edgar Fernandez Lazcano. Katia Rodriguez now will inform us about this phone call. [Begin recording] Katia Rodriguez: Edgar Fernandez said he met DEA agents in Bogota, Colombia, but that he managed to dodge the U.S. agents in Costa Rica. This is the report: Reporter Amalia Pando: [identified by screen caption] Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, who worked for Isaac Chavarria, phoned the PAT [Television Journalists Association] to tell us he is not in the DEA's hands. But when Carlos Mesa asked him where he was, he said he would rather remain underground. When he was asked how he paid for his trips and these costly phone calls, he broke down in tears. Fernandez: I am so desperate that I am begging for justice in my country and the support of my university mates, the media, and all those who believe I am not lying. Pando: We have confirmed that the person who phoned was in fact Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, Chavarria's employee. Let us hear this person's voice in the recording heard by the Constituent Commission: Fernandez: Help me don Oscar; I have no money. You cannot screw me after all I have witnessed, such as when you received 40,000..... Pando: Now let us hear the voice of the person who phoned PAT: Fernandez: My name is Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, identity card and passport No. 3365571, both issued in La Paz. Pando: There is no doubt that the voice belongs to the same person. Moreover, he correctly answered personal questions such as when he obtained his identity card or what address he gave at the immigration office when he applied for a passport. Therefore, we are certain that the person who phoned PAT was, in fact, Edgar Fernandez Lazcano. We told him we wanted to know how he left Bolivia and entered Costa Rica because there is evidence that Fernandez Lazcano was abducted by the DEA. Fernandez: I will tell you how I left Bolivia when I am given guarantees to return to Bolivia. I will tell you what towns I went through, what means of transportation I used, all of it public transportation. I was never in contact with the DEA. The first time I got in contact with the DEA was when I arrived in Bogota. Pando: As you see, all the details of how he left Bolivia are uncertain. He told us later he ended up in Bogota, Colombia, but to enter Colombia you need an entry visa, which can be requested at any consulate. PAT confirmed that Fernandez Lazcano had not acquired that visa. He never appeared at the Colombian consulate in La Paz, Lima, nor in Quito. How then did he enter Colombia without a visa. One thing Fernandez Lazcano does admit is that the DEA took him to Costa Rica. Fernandez: When we arrived in Bogota, I talked to DEA agents. I concretely told them: The only thing I demand is that you help me reach the United States, and once I am there I will disclose everything. I admit having gone to Bogota. Initially they told me we would go to Panama and I said, well, that I would speak in Panama. At first they said: No. Speak now; tell us all you know now; tell us what they say. I answered: No, I am not going to speak here; I am going to do so in another country. At my insistence--because I said the United States or nothing--they first said we would go to Panama because the plane was too small to fly from Bogota to the United States. So, first we will go to Panama. When we were about to land in Panama, because I thought we were heading for Panama--I do not know why because the people who picked me up spoke English and understood, two of them especially, very little Spanish, I wondered whether we were in Panama but it turned out we were in Costa Rica. Pando: Edgar Fernandez Lazcano's version sounds even more incredible when he says that he managed to dodge the DEA in Costa Rica. Fernandez: As you said, in Costa Rica I dodged the DEA, because I was surprised only three people interviewed me given the importance of the U.S. Embassy. I decided to follow my plan. I was arrested in Costa Rica because I decided to wait a few days and not go to Nicaragua as I planned in the belief that the DEA would be after me in Costa Rica. Pando: According to Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, after getting away from the DEA he was detained, by chance, for 27 hours by Costa Rican police. After he was released, a Bolivian prosecutor arrived to interrogate him. Mesa: Didn't you try to get in contact with the DEA or did the DEA seek you after you were released in Costa Rica, and were you able to move freely and leave Costa Rica without any problems? Fernandez: This is what surprised me and made me really happy because when I was arrested the first thing I thought was: The Bolivian DEA [as heard] is quite capable of sending a fax or something and messing up my life because I have dodged them. But I got very happy when I realized they were not aware... Pando: Despite what Isaac Chavarria's employee asserts, the Costa Rican Government has its own version. It said Fernandez Lazcano left Costa Rica in a DEA aircraft to Miami. It is quite likely that Edgar Fernandez Lazcano may have made fun of the DEA but it is quite unlikely he will make fun of all of us. Fernandez: Regarding my job with Isaac Chavarria, I was a close aide of his. I do not know what he considered me, probably his dog's keeper, an employee with no rank; I do not know. But, unfortunately, during the several years I worked for him I learned about a lot of things. Pando: Edgar Fernandez Lazcano's conversation with Carlos Mesa lasted 45 minutes. During it he ratified all he told the Bolivian prosecutor in Costa Rica and a lot more. Among the new things he said was that Jaime Paz Zamora's government had offered Isaac Chavarria the possibility of benefiting from the repentance law. Fernandez: Before the 120-day deadline the government granted the drug traffickers to surrender, Susana Seleme went--I do not have concrete evidence about this but I was told that the captain was upset by the two visits Susana Seleme paid him on weekends to suggest that he surrender, that he benefit from the repentance law. Mesa: Who told you that? Fernandez: The captain's wife told me that. You can ask her. I am sure she will not lie; I know she is aware of my true situation. Pando: So far we have all heard that Chavarria gave Paz Zamora money, but according to this new version Jaime Paz Zamora gave Chavarria $40,000. Fernandez: I maintain that Edith [Paz Zamora's sister] went to Santa Cruz, to Los Troncos town, where she met Chavarria. She asked Chavarria to help her find some good land to buy for Jaime Paz's sons. Taking advantage of this occasion, Edith said: Oso [Chavarria's nickname], Jaime has sent you this $40,000. Mesa: In other words, Jaime Paz gave Chavarria $40,000. Fernandez: That is precisely what happened. Pando: To that end, Fernandez Lazcano said he wants to return to Bolivia to speak, to disclose all he knows, but said he fears he will be arrested. He refused to say where he is now. Anyway, we all know he is in Miami, to be more precise, in the DEA offices. And we say this based on the report issued by the Costa Rican Government to the media. [end recording]
