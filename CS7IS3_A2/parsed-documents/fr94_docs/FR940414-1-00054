FR940414-1-00054 FR940414-1-00010 Since the Office of Pesticide Programs proposed rule would already require these facilities to contain any contaminated wastewater, the Office of Water does not expect there to be a significant additional cost associated with the holding of this water until such time as it can be used as make-up in commercial application. There are no existing direct dischargers in this subcategory that EPA is aware of. The average volume of wastewater discharged indirectly by refilling establishments is estimated to be 78 gallons per year per facility. EPA assumes volumes of this magnitude can be held in a minibulk container until such a time as it can be reused. EPA estimates the cost of a minibulk container to be about $300 capital investment. EPA concludes that the cost of this proposed BPT regulation would not be wholly disproportionate to the projected effluent reduction benefits. As mentioned above, the sources of wastewater from refilling establishments derive primarily from rinsates generated from cleaning minibulk containers and bulk storage tanks. Another source of wastewater that might contribute a significant volume is contaminated stormwater. The current practice for many refilling establishments is to contain and hold contaminated stormwater until it can be used as make-up in a commercial application. However, this source can be virtually eliminated by covering the bulk storage area and loading pad under roof. According to an industry representative, it is becoming a widespread practice for many of the midwestern refilling establishments to do this. In addition to potentially avoiding the generation of a contaminated wastewater that must be controlled, enclosing the bulk storage area also protects it from vandalism and from severe weather such as cold winters. Enclosing containment structures is not a basis for today's proposed regulation, nor is it a requirement of the Office of Pesticide Programs proposed containment rule. However, the Agency would certainly consider roofing a bulk storage area and loading pad a prudent and pollution-preventing action by refilling establishments. EPA does also recognize that there may be barriers in some areas to enclosing bulk storage under roofs, such as fire code restrictions. EPA recognizes that it is not uncommon for refilling establishments to have more than one pesticide product on-site to be used on different crops. For example, a refilling establishment may have bulk Bicep 速 (atrazine and metolachlor) that is applied to corn early in the season, and also have Freedom 速 (alachlor and trifluralin), which is applied to soybeans later in the growing season. Mixtures of rinsates of the two products (Bicep 速 and Freedom 速 ) cannot be used in an application mixture if there is no crop for which the two pesticides are mutually labelled. In estimating costs, the Agency has assumed that the containment system, including separate holding tanks, will segregate pesticide products to avoid spills and stormwater from becoming cross contaminated. EPA has seen this segregation in containment systems at refilling establishments which have been designed to comply with state or local requirements. X. Best Conventional Pollutant Control Technology The Agency is proposing to establish BCT limitations for each of the two subcategories that are equivalent to the BPT limits and based upon the same control technologies. Accordingly, there would be no additional costs associated with the BCT regulations. A. Pesticide Chemicals Formulating, Packaging and Repackaging (Subcategory C) EPA is proposing to establish BCT limitations for this subcategory that are equivalent to the limitations established for BPT. Since BPT requires zero discharge of process wastewater pollutants and there can be no more stringent limitations, EPA believes an equivalent technology basis is appropriate for BCT. B. Repackaging of Agricultural Pesticides Performed by Refilling Establishments (Subcategory E) EPA is proposing to establish BCT limitations for this subcategory that are equivalent to the limitation established for BPT. Since BPT requires zero discharge of process wastewater pollutants and there can be no more stringent limitations, EPA believes an equivalent technology basis is appropriate for BCT. XI. Best Available Technology Economically Achievable The Agency is proposing to establish BAT for each of the two subcategories on the equivalent technology basis as BPT. Accordingly, there would be no additional costs associated with the BAT regulations.
