FR940616-1-00019 FR940616-1-00008 Thursday June 16, 1994 Part VI Department of Labor Office of Labor-Management Standards 29 CFR Part 417 Local Labor Organization Officers; Procedure for Removal; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 115␣/␣Thursday, June 16, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Office of Labor-Management Standards 29 CFR Part 417 RIN 1294&hyph;AA10 Procedure for Removal of Local Labor Organization Officers AGENCY: Office of Labor-Management Standards, Office of the American Workplace, Labor. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Labor is proposing to amend the regulation pertaining to the procedure for removal of local labor organization officers pursuant to section 401(h) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, as amended (LMRDA). Section 417.16 presently gives the Secretary of Labor the authority to bring suit against a union after a member has filed a complaint with the Secretary alleging that the local labor organization has failed to follow the officer removal procedures contained in the organization's constitution and bylaws. This proposed rule deletes that language, which purports to give the Secretary general authority to bring suit against a union for failing to follow its officer removal procedures even if the inadequacy of the procedure has not been established. This change will bring the regulation into conformity with a court of appeals decision that held that the Secretary lacks such authority. DATES: Interested parties may submit written comments on this proposal. All comments must be submitted by August 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be submitted to Edmundo Gonzales, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Labor-Management Standards, Office of the American Workplace, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., room N&hyph;5605, Washington, DC 20210. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kay H. Oshel, Chief, Division of Interpretations and Standards, Office of Labor-Management Standards, Office of the American Workplace, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., room N&hyph;5605, Washington, DC 20210; (202) 219&hyph;7373. This is not a toll-free number. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title IV of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, as amended (LMRDA), governs the election and removal of labor organization officers. Section 401(h) of the LMRDA (29 U.S.C. 481(h)) provides that if the Secretary of Labor, upon application of a member of a local labor organization, finds after a hearing in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, that the constitution and bylaws of the labor organization do not provide an adequate procedure for the removal of an elected officer guilty of serious misconduct, such officer may be removed for cause shown and after notice and hearing, by the members in good standing voting in a secret ballot conducted by the officers of such labor organization in accordance with its constitution and bylaws insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of Title IV of the LMRDA. The Department has interpreted section 401(h); when read in conjunction with section 402(a), as additionally granting the Secretary of Labor the authority to file suit against a union for failure to follow removal procedures whose adequacy has not been challenged. Section 402(a) states in part that ``(a) a member of a labor organization: (1) Who has exhausted the remedies available under the constitution and bylaws of such organization and of any parent body, or (2) who has invoked such available remedies without obtaining a final decision within three calendar months after their invocation, may file a complaint with the Secretary within one calendar month thereafter alleging the violation of any provision of section 401 ( including violation of the constitution and bylaws of the labor organization pertaining to the election and removal of officers ) (emphasis added) *␣*␣*.'' Subpart B of 29 CFR part 417 implements this interpretation.
