It is this strategy that will lead to the restoration of democracy in Haiti, Aristide explained in a communique issued on 29 March. Aristide was responding to the new U.S. initiative providing for the simultaneous appointment of a new prime minister and the resignation of the current military government in Port-au-Prince, which would get amnesty. This plan also provides for strengthening the international trade embargo by reinforcing the watch over the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic in order to increase pressure on the military regime. Father Aristide, who was informed of this new plan on 25 March by U.S. Vice President Al Gore, pointed out that he is sticking to the eight-point plan that he presented to the United Nations in October. The exiled president has added that if the military gives up power on the morning [of any given day], he will appoint a prime minister that very afternoon. [passage omitted]
