This was stated in an interview to the ITAR-TASS correspondent by Mikhail Kokeyev, head of the Russian delegation, and deputy head of the Directorate of International Scientific and Technical Cooperation of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry. He said that at the consultations agreement had been reached in principle that Japan will provide emergency assistance to take measures aimed at averting the need for the Pacific Fleet to carry out new marine discharges of low-level radioactive waste. For this purpose, it is planned, in particular, to provide Russia with a special tanker to store waste. The two tankers that the Pacific Fleet has at its disposal for this purpose are already full. "Some other emergency measures are also possible that Japan intends to take to render us assistance," Mikhail Kokeyev noted. He let it be understood that it was a matter of really emergency measures which could be carried out within "the next few days or weeks." The head of the Russian delegation stressed, that apart from emergency measures, Tokyo will also give Russia assistance in implementing long-term programs intended to avert the discharge by the Russian Navy of low-level radioactive liquid wastes into the waters of the world's oceans. Mikhail Kokeyev noted that the reaction displayed by Tokyo to the discharge by Russia of low-level waste into the Sea of Japan in mid- October had been constructive. "Japan did not limit itself to expressing concern about this -- Tokyo immediately stated that it was ready to give assistance to Moscow in resolving this complicated problem," the high-ranking official of the Russian Foreign Ministry stated.
