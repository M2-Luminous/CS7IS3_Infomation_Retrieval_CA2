The communist state in the north [DPRK] has isolated itself from the outside world and is playing cat and mouse with it on the nuclear issue. North Korea has again refused to give inspectors of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] access to a nuclear facility where nuclear weapons are allegedly being developed. In addition, the regime in Pyongyang is spreading slogans that are supposed to suggest that war is imminent. Even though similar things were heard a year ago, this does not necessarily permit the conclusion that this time, too, everything will end peacefully. In South Korea [ROK], reaction to the tension produced by the north is rather calm, but concern is not hidden. Seoul cannot be interested in an armed conflict with the north because it is just on the point of becoming a developed industrial state. In addition, the capital city, with its 10 million inhabitants, is only a few kilometers away from the demarcation line. While South Korea relies on "persuading" the north, the United States is demonstrating firmness. Washington has initiated the deployment of antiaircraft missiles in South Korea. One also speaks of a potential reinforcement of troops. The joint U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers, which are now to be held after all, are to be seen as a means of symbolic pressure. All this, however, should not give rise to the assumption that the United States is determined to engage in a war, if necessary. Experiences from other areas of the world can be transposed only to a limited extent. If, however, a state is like the Stalinist-Communist North Korea, one may conclude that it is not consolidated internally. This is not changed by the militant rhetoric that is used by the regime toward the outside. In the view of the Asian neighbors, this rather shows a rising degree of weakness. Not least thanks to its growing economic capacity, South Korea, on the other hand, has managed to establish normal relations with all real and potential allies of Pyongyang in the region. Even though China is opposing sanctions, its support for North Korea seems rather half-hearted. The countries in Indochina are paying tribute to the alleged ideals of Socialism only as a justification of their rule, but they are hardly interested in cooperation with North Korea anymore. Nevertheless, the saber rattling of the rulers in Pyongyang has directed general attention to the relations of military power in Korea. It turns out that the north has more weapons than the south in practically all categories. However, what do such figures tell? Since Stalin's time at the latest, it had been part of the Soviet Union's military doctrine to have as much as possible of everything. Not only in this respect does "Great Leader" Kim Il-song prove to be an eager pupil of the former Soviet despot. The only thing that would be illuminating would be a comparison of the fighting power of the armed forces of North Korea and those of South Korea, which will, however, hardly be possible because of North Korea's isolation. History knows many examples of dictators, whose arms quickly dissolved as a result of pressure from the outside. From the viewpoint of the regime in Pyongyang, a military conflict, which no one can want, would mean a weakening of the -- at least partly -- self-chosen isolation, but probably also the end of Communist rule as such. Kim Il-song's power is, not least, based on isolating his subjects from all information coming from the "hostile" surroundings. For this purpose, Kim is cultivating a unique personality cult. He likes to present himself as the great resistance fighter against the former colonial power Japan, knowing that this is well-received by patriotic Koreans in the north and the south. However, the scarce information that is available on this topic says that Kim's "achievements" in the anti-Japanese resistance fight were rather modest. If his fellow citizens were deprived of that illusion, too, the foundation of the regime would be even worse off. How important such myths for totalitarian states are is shown by looking at the history of the Soviet Union. The rule of the CPSU [Communist party of the Soviet Union] would probably have collapsed much earlier, if the bolshevik leadership could not have written the victory in World War II on its flag. If the government in Pyongyang acted at least half-way reasonably, it would have to do everything to avoid a war. However, it is difficult to rely on that, given a regime whose representatives have become prisoners of their own propaganda. Nevertheless, the militant drumming in North Korea should be received with a certain measure of skepticism. Prudent action, which avoids unnecessary provocation, should be the common guideline for the United States, China, Japan, and South Korea. Perhaps North Korea would indeed be more accessible, as it has repeatedly indicated, if it were finally recognized by Washington. Crises often reach a point where there does not seem to be any way back. However, at the moment one cannot yet speak of an unavoidable military conflict with North Korea. There is still the hope that coordinated international pressure will bring the rulers in Pyongyang to their senses.
