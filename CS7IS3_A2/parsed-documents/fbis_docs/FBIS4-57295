Amnesty International published full-page advertisements in two prominent London newspapers saying that the government allows the Colombian Army to murder with impunity. The full-page ad by Amnesty International in London's THE INDEPENDENT and THE GUARDIAN newspapers, show a street youth sniffing glue. The caption explains that many of these children are killed by death squads paid by businessmen who want to clear the streets. Amnesty International also states that the ad intends to irritate the Colombian Government, which is trying to convince the world that it is doing everything in its power to end the murders. Amnesty International also says that the Colombian Government wants to make believe that most murders are the work of drug traffickers, guerrillas, or a few wicked soldiers, but the truth is that most murders are committed by the Armed Forces or the police. The organization argues that the government does not want to face the Army and it says the Army is literally allowed to kill with impunity. Finally, the ad expresses hope that the new president, who will be elected this month, will make human rights one of his top priorities. The ad was rejected by both spokesmen of the government and the military forces. The spokesmen described the ad as biased and as part of a guerrilla strategy to damage Colombia's image and the image of the Colombian Government abroad.
