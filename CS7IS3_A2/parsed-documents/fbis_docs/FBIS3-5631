Speaking at a regular press meeting, Fujii backed off from comments he made Sunday in an informal speech made in Tochigi Prefecture, in which he indicated "as his personal view" that the economy had hit bottom. "This is an official press meeting," he said, brushing aside further questions on his earlier remarks. Fujii also repeated that he is "confident that steady implementation of the latest 15.25 trillion stimulus package will put the economy on a recovery track in fiscal 1994." The finance minister declined to comment on a meeting of cabinet ministers earlier on Wednesday to discuss Japan's "voluntary" market-opening package to address the ongoing trade dispute with the United States. He described the meeting as "free talking," but declined to comment further. The reason for the hastily-arranged meeting was seen to allow discussion over Japan's stance before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata meet U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo for an official visit Wednesday night. Asked about the latest U.S. stance of not reopening trade talks, Fujii said that Japan would "positively" take its "voluntary measures" aside from negotiations. Meanwhile, Fujii reiterated that the government is not considering a plan to boost the 10-year public works program of 430 billion yen as part of the package.
