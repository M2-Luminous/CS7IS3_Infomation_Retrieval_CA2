Do they know the method appropriate for themselves? About 30 percent of Kwanak members have had a sexual experience. However, have they ever been educated about sex, contraceptives, or even falling in love?" This is part of the article "The Third Generation," a collection of policy materials written by Kang Pyong-won (a 23-year-old senior majoring in agricultural economics). Kang was elected General Student Association president at Seoul National University [SNU] on 26 November. The Kang camp stated that the student movements of the 60's and 70's, which followed students' consciences, were first generation student movements, and the ideology-based movements of the 80's formed the second generation. They then proclaimed themselves the third generation, which dreams of the "progressive professionals" of society. The student movement is changing. Actually, the change in the student movement is not new. It is natural that the old-style student movement cannot survive the waves of change that have followed the collapse of international socialism and the progress of democratization in every facet of society. However, the magnitude of change that emerged during the elections for student association president at universities last November was beyond expectations. Yonsei University showed this most clearly in its student association president elections held on 24, 25 November. Son Yang-chol, a 25-year-old student who was considered a "non-student movement candidate," defeated the NL (National Liberation faction, whose main faction is the Chupasa faction) candidate after a fierce contest requiring two rounds of balloting. During the campaign, Son surprised his audience with his bold assertions about the "abolition of Marxism" and the comment that "inciting students through propaganda is nothing more than a religion." According to the Ministry of Education, following the student association president elections in November, as many as 37 other universities have a student association president who does not belong to the student movement. However, in 1992 there were 36 universities that elected presidents from non-student movement circles, and so Yonsei and Kukmin Universities were the only "major universities" to produce non-student movement presidents during this election. Thus the rapid progress of the non-student movement circles is not that important. The most important point is not the advance of the non-student movement circles, but the change in the characters and pledges of candidates. During the campaign, candidates consistently stressed university problems, such as education quality, rather than social problems, such as class or ethnic conflict. The organization of the "Committee for School Development in the 21st Century" and the introduction of the "system for evaluating professors' lectures" are some examples. The fact that the "Progressive Student Alliance for a Reunified Korea in the 21st Century" (the "21st Century Alliance," for short), which claims to be a new student movement, produced president elects at SNU, Sangmyong Women's University, and Hansong University, and the good showing of the "Kyongsilyon Student Association" in elections at SNU and Chonnam University are remarkable in connection with the change of character in the student movement. The "Kyongsilyon Student Association" was founded in the middle of last April and fielded candidates at SNU, Chonnam, Chungang, and Choson Universities, and at the Ansan Campus of Hanyang University. During the 25 November race at Chonnam University--an "NL stronghold"--the Kyongsilyon Student Association candidate ran a close race against the NL candidate, and was defeated by a narrow margin of 50 or so votes. In the SNU election, even though the candidate won 1,567 votes out of the 12,200 or so cast and finished fourth among a field of five candidates, he was judged to have finished very well for a first-time candidate. The "21st Century Alliance," which produced a president-elect at SNU--considered the "headquarters of the student movement," was founded on 9 October by 500 students from SNU and Yonsei, Korea, Songgyungwan, and Sokang Universities. The various factions, feeling that the student movement could no longer survive by following the styles of the NL or PD (Peoples Democracy) factions, met and founded this organization. The "21st Century Alliance" has a goal of creating "third-generation universities" that train progressive professionals. It claims that the colleges have remained unchanged and are not keeping up with society as it becomes democratized and professionalized. Members of the group said creating "progressive professionals" is their goal, but that "professional" was more important that "progressive." Kang Pyong-won, a member of the "21st Century Alliance" who was elected student association president at SNU, said: "If education were liberalized and Harvard University opened a branch in Korea, SNU--which barely ranks among the top 200 universities in the world--would not survive." He also stated he would "concentrate first on reforming college education." To reach this goal, the university should lower the number of credits required for graduation from the current 140 units to 120. It should strengthen the links between the disciplines and raise the quality of education by instituting a departmental system within each college. Son Yang-chol, elected student association president at Yonsei University, aroused interest both inside and outside of the university by insisting on a "union-like student association." Son said: "The student movement still keeps the illusion of a bureacratic system, even though the trend of the times is for the dissolution of a rigid bureaucratic system and for the direct participation of individuals and organizations. It is sufficient for the student association to have a `union' role for the sake of regulating individuals' interests." Son said: "The fact that the student association fights only social and political issues while there are still various desires on campus is a dereliction of duty." He explained, "The `movement' will be lead by leaders of the `movement,' and not by the student association." He suggested several concrete tasks to carry out, such as: Having faculty and staff use name tags, to give better service on campus; allowing only amateur athletes to participate in matches between Yonsei and Korea Universities--currently professional athletes participate; and collecting students' opinions using on-campus personal computer networks. In elections for student association president at Korea, Sokang, and Ehwa Women's Universities, radical political solgans disappeared, and pledges to "start a campaign to gaurantee a 5 percent education fund," "increase the seating capacity in library reading rooms," and "increase the number of faculty members" appeared. At Ehwa, one candidate called for the "disclosure of election expenses so that there could be student association elections that do not cost money." Two candidates revealed that they had spent 3.4 million won and 4 million won each. "Environmental" issues were a major topic at some universities, and some candidates used recycled paper for their leaflets. How will the change among the student associations alter the face of the university community next May? Will the months of April and May, previously filled with tear gas and fire bombs, recover the splendor of spring? "It depends on the situation, but I think that the time for us to resort to fire bombs has passed. We must act so that our demonstrations win people's sympathies and earn comments that what we are doing is satisfactory and good." (Kang Pyong-won, SNU) "I will guarantee the voice of fellow students when it comes to political problems. However, I do not want the student association to lead on political problems. Moreover, if outside organizations such as Hanchongnyon [Korea Federation of University Student Councils] choose Yonsei University as a meeting place and the majority of students here are against it, then that meeting cannot be held here. The student association at Yonsei has no interest in the concerns of outside political organizations." (Son Yang-chol, Yonsei University)
