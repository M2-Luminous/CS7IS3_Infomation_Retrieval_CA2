Some of the Central American officials charged that they are being pressured by the United States to change their vote. The first country consulted was Costa Rica, home of Foreign Minister Niehaus -- President Cesar Gaviria's closest rival. Here they are already claiming victory. [Begin recording] [Jose Joaquin Chaberry, unidentified Costa Rican official] We are certain we will win. We are very certain of this. We have reiterated this during the past months and the past days.... [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] But do you believe pressure is being exerted? [Chaberry] I repeat Foreign Minister Niehaus' words: If there is pressure, we will report it. [end recording] El Salvador maintains its position to support Niehaus, although Deputy Foreign Minister Rafael Alfaro said they are being pressured to favor President Cesar Gaviria. [Begin recording] [Alfaro] We continue, nevertheless, with our firm support for Foreign Minister Niehaus. [Reporter] Mr. Deputy Foreign Minister, is it true that there has been pressure on the part of the U.S. Government on the Central American nations? [Alfaro] During a meeting we held several days ago in Mexico City, an English-speaking nation said it had been directly pressured by other nations interested in garnering support for President Cesar Gaviria's candidacy.... [end recording] Honduras, a nation recently visited by President Cesar Gaviria, expressed a great deal of liking for him, but it supports Niehaus because a prior commitment had already been made with him. [Begin recording] [Protocol Director Ricardo Alonso Florez] We believe that in the first round the Central American nations will vote for the Costa Rican candidate, because he is Central American. Eventually, if there is a runoff election, a different decision could be made. [end recording]
