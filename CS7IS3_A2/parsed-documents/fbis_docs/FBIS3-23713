Zanegin, doctor of historical sciences: "Trump Card: American-Chinese Relations on the Geopolitical Scales"] [Text] Great revolutions usually attract attention by their social, domestic, and international repercussions. Yet such cataclysms change fundamentally not only the social but also the geopolitical picture of the world. The Chinese people's revolution is undoubtedly such. It led the Chinese people onto the path of socialist building and in less than half a century of complex, zigzag-like development raised China, this semicolonial country in the recent past, to the level of structure-forming value of the modern world order. The victory of the revolution caused a fundamental change in China's international position. In line with the strengthening of popular-democratic statehood and the successes in economic building, China's importance in world politics grew. But decades passed before, in our time, on the frontier of the 21st century, the geopolitical potential of the Chinese revolution began to manifest itself comprehensively and in full. For this to happen it took transition to a qualitatively different level of the basic indicators of domestic, primarily economic, development. There was, in addition, a regrouping of international forces which brought about the need for a restoration of the geopolitical balance upset by the breakdown of the coalition of socialist countries, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the present Russian administration's abandonment of the mission of maintenance of the geopolitical balance, strategic stability, and general peace bequeathed it by history. As a result, irrespective of how Beijing sees the country's future international role, socialist China, by virtue of its geopolitical size, military power (availability of a deterrent nuclear arsenal), political status (permanent membership of the UN Security Council), and social attractiveness for a large group of countries, is already changing from the status of regional power to a center of power of a global order and a factor of deterrence and geopolitical balance, replacing in this sense the former Soviet Union, and now also Russia, which is incapable as yet of occupying the place of a structure-forming value in the world geopolitical equation. The aspiration to balance is a law of international (geopolitical) interaction, it would seem. It may be recognized by a state or states and then becomes, as has been the case repeatedly in the history of international relations, the basis of a particular type of policy. But even when this does not occur, a trend toward balance is inevitably manifested, irrespective of the political wishes of this subject of the international process or the other, so that it might at any moment become a political reality. There are signs that it is China that could perform an appreciable role in the process of the formation of a new strategic balance and geopolitical stability and in the creation of that new system of international relations that will inevitably emerge from the present chaos. This prospect seems quite certain. How China's socioeconomic and political system might evolve in our time is another matter. It is hard also to foresee of what significance China will be for Russia in its new geopolitical capacity. But this will depend to a large extent on Russia. A substantial part of our country to the east of Baykal belongs to the Pacific geopolitical theater. The prospects of the development of this part of Russia will depend to an appreciable extent on its economic integration in the Asia-Pacific economic space which is taking shape, in its northeast subregion particularly. In connection with the loss of important ports in the seas of the Atlantic there is growing significance for Russia as a whole in the maritime areas of the Far East with convenient harbors ensuring an entry to the Pacific. There is every reason to suppose that Russian strategy will in time have to be paying the main attention to the Asia-Pacific direction, if, of course, Russia is destined to develop in accordance with its position of world power linking by the continental Eurasian spaces the Atlantic with the Pacific, Europe with Asia, and West with East. Nor can we close our eyes to the fact that in Moscow's natural, traditional geopolitical movement eastward present-day Russia is encountering resistance on the part of maritime Pacific powers--the United States and Japan--which are by no means interested in the appearance in the Pacific of a new strategic value or simply a competitor even. Under these conditions the significance of China and good-neighbor relations with it for the future of Russia should not evoke the least doubts. Land borders extending for thousands of kilometers separate densely populated and industrially developed areas of China from desert and backward areas of Russia. A population of more than 1 billion seeking points of contact for its forces, a dynamic, enterprising, and relatively stable state which is prepared to defend its values and which possesses all the necessary instruments for this--it is with such a China that Russia will have to deal under the conditions of the inevitable loss of illusions apropos the West and the highly ponderable probability of the development of rivalry with the United States. Yet the approach of Russia, meaning the present political leadership, is oriented, as it were, toward a complication of Russian-Chinese relations for many years to come. It is sufficient to say that the "Concept of Foreign Policy of the Russian Federation" recommends that we build relations with China with consideration of "the differences in ideology and social and political systems." This same document, on the same page, outlines the prospect of "strategic partnership" with the United States in the Asia-Pacific region based on a "commitment to common democratic values." Corresponding to these aims is foreign policy practice: The search for pragmatic advantages and the deals that are being concluded conceal only somewhat the malevolent approach, colored with ideological intolerance, of the Russian regime to relations with a most important state occupying a key position in the Asia-Pacific region and moving toward the level of global geopolitical interaction. It would seem that the possibility of the appearance of a new geopolitical rival of such a scale is beginning to trouble the United States also. This is manifested, specifically, in American foreign policy assertiveness in the new states on China's periphery. Washington, clearly disturbed by China's growing strategic importance, is seeking geopolitical levers for containing Chinese communism. It is hoped to entrust the brunt of this task to Russia, evidently. Washington's confidence that Russia's radical democrats will further America's plans to loosen the socialist system in China and direct this country's development in accordance with the East European or Russian model is easily divined here. If these plans fail, Russia, which borders China, would have to draw onto itself the main Chinese forces and, in the event of a conflict, involve its soldiers in a war for others' interests. The United States itself here, separated from the Asian continent by ocean expanses, where it has, in addition, decisive superiority in naval forces, would remain aloof from the bloodshed. An analogy suggests itself: At the start of the 1970's also the American side attempted to gain superiority to the Soviet Union by playing the "China card." In just the same way in our time Russia has been assigned the role of trump card in the geopolitical game upon which Washington has embarked for the purpose of depriving China of the fruits of the socialist revolution, which has converted this once backward country into an international factor of world significance.
