With the conclusion of the Cold War, Asian-Pacific hot spots began to cool down. The peace process sped up in Kampuchea, South Korea and North Korea strengthened their negotiations, and each of the East Asian nations began paying more attention to their own economic construction, with mutual friendly cooperation and closer relationships. A new pattern of multilateral force which was both competitive and cooperative emerged gradually in the Asia-Pacific area, and the situation in the entire region tended to be more relaxed. The relative stability and economic development in the Asia-Pacific region doesn't mean there are no negative factors which could affect stability and development. Power politics and hegemonism are still the major barriers to peace and development in the whole world and in this region; economic factors play a prominent role in international relationships, while economic development throughout the world is unbalanced, trade protectionism is growing stronger, and the conflicts between some nations (especially between the United States and Japan) is increasing. The former hot spot Korean peninsula remains in a very unstable situation, and the Kampuchea question has not been completely resolved, with new outbreaks of clashes still a possibility. Russia is in a turbulent state. There also exist in East Asia territorial disputes and ethnic and religious conflicts which could also interfere with the stability of the situation. In addition, it is still difficult to predice the future development of Japanese-U.S. relations, or Chinese-U.S. relations. Some countries still harbor suspicions about Japan developing into a military power. It is precisely because of these unstable and uncertain factors that we should pay sufficient attention to questions of Asia-Pacific security. All Asia-Pacific nations strongly demand the further economic development of their own countries, and experience has proven that this will only be accomplished under conditions of continued peace and stability in the region. Peace and stability are related to the fundmental interests of each nation; if contradictions and disputes arise among them, the only correct course of action is to seek a means of resolution through peaceful negotiations, avoiding antagonism giving way to outbreaks of violence. In varying degrees, economic development will create competition and conflict, but if we are talking about East Asia itself, these will be more compensatory in nature. Due to differences in economic base, development level, and situation, the East Asian nations are establishing a multilevel developmental structure, with closer, more cooperative economic and trade relations. The whole of East Asia has formed into a constantly expanding, huge market, and is on the steady path to regional cooperation and development. Although mutual competition will develop, mutual cooperation and benefit will be the chief aspect of this. As mentioned before, the Asia-Pacific region already had a multipolar tendency early on, and this tendency will grow even stronger. It would be impossible for one or two countries, or a group of countries, to control the entire region. The multi-power co-existence of China, Japan, United States, and Russia as well as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and Australia will serve to restrict, control, and balance the overall situation. The rise of developing countries like China and ASEAN will be positive factors in curbing great powers from fighting over this region. The situation and conditions in the Asia-Pacific region differs considerably from that of Europe, so it would be difficult to build a regional peace organ here modeled on a European model peace alliance. We have to study enthusiastically how to establish a regional peace organ which will gradually suit the region's specific factors. Based on the current situation, we should pay more attention to open up various bilateral peace negotiations and talks, while also carrying out appropriate multilateral activities, holding multiple type, multilevel, multichannel conversations, to increase understanding, communicate knowledge, and increase trust. In the 1990s, the Asia-Pacific region will be in a transitional phase toward a new, multipolar pattern. It is possible there will be tensions and crises in some areas or some individual problems, due to sharpened contradictions. However, looking at the entire entity, the Asia-Pacific region could possibly remain very stable for the next decase. Meanwhile, it will continue to attract the whole world's attention with the rapidity of its economic development. III. The backwards, disunified, old China was the frequent target of invasions by the great powers. The great powers' battles in China was one important reason for past instability, or constant disorder, and even war in the East Asia region. After the People's Republic of China was founded, it conducted a peaceful diplomatic policy of independence and self-determination. China initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and has always taken as the basic principle of its foreign affairs the establishment and development of friendly cooperative relations with all the world's nations. Now, China has become an important pillar of stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region. Striving for a peaceful and stable territorial environment is a focal point in China's foreign affairs. China pays special attention to developing relationships with nations in neighboring territory, always conducting a good neighbor policy. Now, China's relationships with these territorial neighbors are in a totally fine situation. Leaders visit each other constantly, while economic and trade cooperative relationships are growing closer and closer. Last year was the 20th anniversary of the normalization of relations between China and Japan, with widespread and deeply felt ceremonies held in both nations. In April, General Secretary Jiang Zemin visited Japan, taking relations between China and Japan to a new stage of developing friendship. In October, Japanese Emperor Akihito paid a six-day historical visit to China. Not long after China and South Korea established relations, President Roh Tae Woo visited China, and the governments of the two countries signed four agreements on trade, investment protection and other issues. In November of last year, Premier Li Peng made a formal visit to Vietnam in response to a invitation, the first visit to Vietnam by a Chinese premier in 21 years. In the first half of the year, Philippine President Ramos, Malaysian Premier Mahathir, and Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong all visited China, while Thailand Premier Chuan Leepai visited China in late August; not long ago, Central Committee Chairman Qiao Shi visited Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines. These important mutual visits strongly promoted the development of relations between China and ASEAN. Meanwhile, a delegation from the party and government, led by standing members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, visited North Korea to foster friendly and cooperative relations between China and that nation. These good political relations provide considerable impetus to the development of economic and trade relations. In 1991, trade between China and Japan grossed nearly $23 billion, 10 times what it was prior to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two nations. In 1991, trade between China and South Korea was up to $5.8 billion, and in 1992, it was up to $8.2 billion. This year, it is expected to reach $10 billion. In 1978, trade between China and the ASEAN countries was only $859 million; in 1988, it increased to $3.818 billion, a 3.4-fold increase for the decade. There have been further large increases in recent years, reaching $8.466 billion in 1992, 15 times again what it was in 1975. There is still tremendous potential for future development: At present, trade between China and ASEAN constitutes only about 5 percent of China's total foreign trade and just a little over 2 percent of that of ASEAN. There are terrorital questions which remain between China and some nations, legacies of history. China has always taken a very cautious attitute concerning these matters. Early in 1957, former Premier Zhou Enlai fully laid out for the National People's Congress China's principal considerations in resolving terrorital issues, saying that, "We want to resolve terrorital questions, with the goal of stabilizing our borders, to alleviate the international situation in a way that is beneficial to modernization, but without making our relationship with our neighbors tense." He went on to say that resolution of territorial questions must be linked with expanding the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; we should seek resolution of these questions on a basis of treating both sides as equals, favorable to each other and to friendship. The Chinese Government has conscientiously implemented the above principles and policies, treating each situation differently while being practical and realistic. It has resolved terrorital questions with some neighboring countries fairly and reasonably, while some problems are currently being negotiated and there has been some progress. At the beginning of this year, when Foreign Minister Qian Qichen visited Laos, the two sides signed a "Terrorital Agreement Between China and Laos." Concerning the issue of the Spratly Islands, the sovereign rights or which belong to China, the Chinese Government expressed the idea of "putting dispute aside, and developing together," and the positive response to this from relevant nations is growing by the day. China was subjected to endless bullying and humiliation under hegemonism, so it will always oppose hegemonism and power politics. China will never seek hegemony for itself, never engage in expansionism or threaten other countries with military force, nor will China fill any so-called "vacuum" either, setting aside the fact that no "vacuum of power" exists in the Asia-Pacific region. On a per capita basis, China's military expenditure is only about $6 at present, while the United States' is $1,100 and Japan's is $300; does this not make it clear that China's military expenditures are very low? China's military forces are completely used for defense, and it holds no military advantage in the region. The "China threat theory" is purely fictitious. China is a developing nation with one-fifth of the world's population, and its present focus is on building its domestic economy. For over a decade, China has adhered to a basic national policy of reform and opening up to the outside world, with considerable achievements. China's opening up to the world is establishing a new pattern of multi-level, multi-channel opening in all directions. This requires the development of closer economic and trade relationships with every nation in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as the long term maintainence of peace, stability, and development throughout the region. China has a weak economic base spread over a vast area. Regional development is very unbalanced throughout the country, and the average GNP still puts it among the world's low income nations. In the livelihood of the people, the problem of getting sufficient food and clothing for everyone has just been resolved, so the common standard of living will not reach the point of being comfortably well off before the end of this century. Furthermore, achieving the planned strategic goal of bringing China up to the level of a medium developed country is still a long way off, and will take several decades of hard work. Even if it is a rich and strong nation at that time, China will still strive for continual improvement and prosperity in the people's standard of living, so will still need peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and throughout the world. In summary, China's security and benefit are linked closely with the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region. China will work with each country in the Asia-Pacific region to achieve regional peace and development, moving forward hand in hand to promote greater stability and prosperity throughout the world.
