The curfew will be in effect from 22:00 until 5:00, Groznyy time. On May 28, the Chechen Government introduced a curfew in Grozny after an attempt on the president's life. The republic's Commandant Sultan Geliskhanov told Interfax on Wednesday that the curfew had been introduced after Ingushetia's Malgobek and Sunzhen regions were added to the state-of-emergency zone in the region of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict in accordance with Boris Yeltsin's decree, approved by Russia's Federation Council. On the one hand, part of the Malgobek and Sunzhen regions is a zone of territorial dispute between Chechnya and Ingushetia, and, on the other, Russian troops will find themselves in the direct vicinity of the Chechen border, he said. Geliskhanov, who is also head of the Chechen Security Department, said that control over the observance of the curfew would be exercised by the Chechen Interior Ministry and security department. Special importance will be attached to the confiscation of illegally kept weapons and ammunition. Commenting on the sociopolitical situation in Chechnya, Geliskhanov stated that "the forces which earlier tried to usurp power, have stepped up their activity again." Hoping for support from definite forces in Russia, the opposition is trying to deprive the Chechen people of their last chance to build a sovereign state, he said.
