This is what Raymond Roy, president of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry [CCIH], said. The legal action is directed especially at the list of 237 persons whose accounts have been frozen. Those people include a handicapped person, who was the victim of political violence; children; and deceased persons, asserted the CCIH, which has called on Haitians to mobilize. Roy described those sanctions that also limit transfers from Haitians living abroad to their deprived relatives in Haiti to $50 per person and per family as illegal. Criticizing the position of the United Nations in the Haitian crisis for letting itself be led by the United States, Roy pointed out that the Haitian employers' organizations were going to write to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to denounce those measures. Let us listen to the explanations of Jean Luckenson: [Begin Luckenson recording, in Creole] The country's economic situation is very alarming, even moribund. Our businesses are closed; the international community is assassinating the Haitian people. In the next few days, we are going to retain Haitian and foreign lawyers in order to try to attack the U.S. Government's unfair and criminal executive order. Clinton is wrong. Such a measure should be taken by the United Nations. I was quoting from CCIH President Raymond Louis Roy following a meeting held by about 50 employers who are members of an association of Haitian employers and industrialists. The meeting, held on Tuesday 28 June at 1130, was held to discuss the latest measures taken by the head of the U.S. Government on 15 June to force the military leaders to give up power. Those measures were the freezing of the funds abroad of those who support the putschists and the suspension of commercial flights. [passage omitted] The CCIH president severely criticized the latest measures taken by the head of the U.S. Government. According to Roy, who was wearing a white guayabera shirt with a button saying No to Occupation on his chest, the international community wants to bring about international genocide against the Haitian people. The latest sanctions have spared no one. So, the avalanche is under way, taking away all that it finds in its path no matter whether it be trash, straw, grass, or what have you. The U.S. Government took measures against all those who are supporting the putschists. According to many observers, the CCIH members have not been spared. [passage omitted] Roy said they have analyzed the latest sanctions and are looking for a solution so they do not end up in a grave. He invited all staunch Haitians, who are the victims of the international community's claws through the latest sanctions, to a mass to be celebrated on 4 July to protest the embargo and foreign occupation in Haiti.
