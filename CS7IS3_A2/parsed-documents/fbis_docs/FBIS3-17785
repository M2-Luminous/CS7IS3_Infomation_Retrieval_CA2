New tariffs for electric power for public utility needs will double in April, the newspaper points out, recalling at the same time that the average tariffs for electric power in Russia are lower than the world ones by a factor of three to four while the prices of metal, pipes, power equipment and spares "have already attained the world level". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI also reports the signing of 20 documents on Russia-Kazakhstan cooperation during Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to moscow, the long-awaited agreement on Baykonur cosmodrome, in particular. TRUD and other newspapers also dwell on the baikonur topic. TRUD carries an article headlined "Baykonur ceases to be an 'apple of discord', Russia leases the cosmodrome for 20 years". ROSSIYA newspaper carries an interview with Anatoliy Sliva, chairman of the State Duma committee on local self-government matters. "Local self-government in Russia is in a unique position now: the rights of local power bodies have been formulated and stipulated in the constitution at the level of the highest world standards, whereas the current legislation, decrees, various decisions, and subordinate legislation obviously contradict the constitution," Sliva said. ROSSIYA runs an interview with Russian Liberal-Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who does not rule out, in particular, the emergence of some new self-proclaimed state-of-emergency committee in the country. "Something is certain to happen in a period from April to November -- either an emergency committee or developments similar to the October of 1993 or some other version of events", he maintains. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) carries an article dedicated to the birth anniversary of legendary aircraft designer Sergey Ilyushin. "Even in the present-day difficult economic situation, Russia has got to find strength and wisdom to maintain the research and production potential which in future will enable it to remain among the world's leading aircraft makers", the newspaper emphasises. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on a rising suicide rate in Russia: "This always happens during election campaigns: a great number of people from among the socially most vulnerable sections of the population -- tramps, unemployed, students and pensioners -- commit suicides upon becoming convinced of the unrealistic nature of political parties' election-campaign promises". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the problems of the Crimea: "Following the elections to the Crimean parliament and an opinion poll, president Yuriy Meshkov's slogan 'my goal is to secure the reunification of the Crimea with Russia', due to which he scored an electoral win, "acquires increasingly distinct contours". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Russian State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin. "We should not allow a recurrence of the October 4, 1993, events which signified our overall defeat", Rybkin stated, voicing confidence in the success of reforms being effected in the country. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reprints an interview of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk with the newspaper KRYMSKIE VESTI (Crimean News) under a headline quoting his as saying: "I stand on this: Ukraine should be side-by-side with Russia, not under Russia." PRAVDA runs an interview with writer Yuriy Vlasov, a member of the State Duma. "It would be the greatest sin if all upright people fail to rely on the sense of patriotism in resisting the tough struggle, a struggle of expermination [as received], which is now under way in Russia and against Russia", the newspaper quotes Vlasov as saying.
