FR940622-0-00016 FR940622-0-00008 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 9 [FRL&hyph;5001&hyph;9] OMB Approval Numbers Under the Paperwork Reduction Act Agency: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Action: Technical amendment. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency is amending a table to display Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control numbers issued under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) to the consolidated table at 40 CFR Part 9. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective July 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sandy Farmer on (202) 260&hyph;2740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA is today amending the table of currently approved information collection request (ICR) control numbers issued by OMB for various regulations. Today's amendment updates the table to accurately display those information requirements promulgated under the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act. The affected regulations are codified at 40 CFR parts 30, 31 and 33. EPA will continue to present OMB control numbers in a consolidated table format to be codified in 48 CFR Part 1501 of EPA's Acquisition Regulations, in 40 CFR Part 9 of the Agency's regulations, and in each 40 CFR volume containing EPA regulations. The table lists the part and section numbers with reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and the current OMB control numbers. This display of the OMB control numbers and their subsequent codification in the Code of Federal Regulations satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ) and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR Part 1320. The ICR(s) were previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB approval. As a result, EPA finds that there is ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this table without prior notice and comment. Due to the technical nature of the table, further notice and comment would be unnecessary. List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 9 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: June 14, 1994. Carol M. Browner, Administrator.
