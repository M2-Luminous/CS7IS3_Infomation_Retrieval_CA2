At the leader's request, the delegates unanimously voted for an extension of his powers at this post "until April 2, 2004". The delegates also adopted amendments to the party rules. According to the amendments, from now on LDPR congresses are to be held once in three years, not annually. They will elect only a chairman enabling him to appoint a supreme council of the party and other leading bodies, change their composition at any moment at his own discretion. [sentence as received] For the interim between congresses, all their powers are automatically transferred to the LDPR leader. The delegates also reaffirmed that in the event of a presidential election in Russia, Zhirinovsky still remains the party's candidate for the presidency. The congress also adopted a resolution on the founding of a party television and radio network "Sokol Zhirinovskogo" [Zhirinovskiy's Falcon] which is called upon to disseminate "the truth about the party" under conditions of a "total news blackout".
