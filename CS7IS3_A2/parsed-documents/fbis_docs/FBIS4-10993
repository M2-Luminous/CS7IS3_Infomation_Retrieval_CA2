The workers are curently working on repairing the boiler of the 100-megawatt Unit No. 4. The Rente plant [as heard] has six units capable of generating 500 megawatts an hour, but has this year been working at 40 percent of its capacity due to the delay in maintenance resulting from the national network situation and the lack of resources, which are now being received. For this reason, Unit No. 4 is expected to be finished by June, and will continue operating with the other units to provide an acceptable response to the generation needs this year.
