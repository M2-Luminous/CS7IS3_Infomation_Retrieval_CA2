FR940224-2-00013 FR940224-2-00004 Comment 6: Respondent contends that the Department's application of section 771B of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. Sec. 1677&hyph;2, is in error and, absent an upstream subsidies investigation, the Department has no authority to countervail any of the paddy rice (paddy) price support and stabilization programs in this review. Respondent argues that at harvest, the RTG intervenes in the market to purchase paddy from paddy farmers at prices above prevailing market prices and holds the paddy off the market until prices improve. Although this practice serves to increase the price received by paddy farmers, it increases the millers' cost of paddy, thereby decreasing the competitiveness of milled rice, the exported product, in the U.S. and world markets. Therefore, an upstream subsidies investigation would show that the price support and stabilization programs for paddy rice provide no competitive advantage to milled rice, the exported product, and therefore are not countervailable. Further, respondent argues that the Department should determine whether 771B is relevant to the paddy rice purchase programs by reexamining the following four factors: (1) Paddy growers and rice millers are not related and there is no commonality of economic interest_in fact, their economic interests are adverse; (2) rice processing adds more than limited value; (3) there can be no circumvention of the order because both paddy rice and milled rice are included in the scope of the order and product shifting is impossible; (4) the processing operations (milling) change the essential character of the paddy rice from an inedible raw fiber to an edible grain and create the added value, whether measured by price or essential characteristics. In light of these facts, respondent claims that it would be inappropriate to apply section 771B to the paddy rice purchase programs insofar as such programs serve only to raise the price of the exported milled rice. Response: The Department disagrees with Respondent's contention that, absent an upstream subsidy investigation, the Department has no authority to countervail the paddy rice support and stabilization programs in this review. In this review, the Department determines that the criteria of 771B of the Act are satisfied, and as such need not apply an upstream subsidy analysis with respect to subsidies on raw agricultural products used in the production of processed agricultural products. In addition, the Department disagrees with Respondent's claim that Commerce has deemed four factors relevant to determining which agricultural subsidies are subject to section 771B's provisions. Respondent extracts its four factors from Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Live Swine and Fresh, Chilled and Frozen Pork Products from Canada, (50 FR 25098, June 17, 1985) (Live Swine), a determination which predates section 771B by several years. While the Live Swine determination may have provided the genesis for section 771B, it is not dispositive in the Department's application and interpretation of the superseding statutory provision, particularly in cases involving other products. Finally, the Department disagrees with Respondent's argument and reasoning that the domestic paddy purchase programs should not be countervailed because they increase milled rice export prices, decreasing the competitiveness of Thai rice in the United States and world markets. By raising the farm income of poor paddy farmers and stabilizing a domestic paddy market, the programs ensure a continuous, level supply of paddy rice for domestic millers. A drop in the supply of paddy due to either seasonal low levels of paddy production or a decrease in the number of paddy farmers could compel Thai millers to source paddy abroad at even higher prices. Prior to enactment of section 771B, the Department considered a benefit to producers of a raw agricultural product as a benefit to producers of a processed agricultural product. See Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Countervailing Duty Order; Rice From Thailand, (51 FR 12356, April 10, 1986) (Rice). In Rice we determined that ``the primary, if not sole purpose of all segments of the industry in the case is to produce a single end product_milled rice.'' We also noted that almost all of the raw agricultural product, paddy or unmilled rice, is dedicated to the production of milled rice, and determined that there is a single, continuous line of production from paddy rice to milled rice. Rice, at 12358. Section 1313 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 amended the Tariff Act of 1930 to include a new section 771B that states: ``In the case of an agricultural product processed from a raw agricultural product in which (1) the demand for the prior stage product is substantially dependent on the demand for the latter stage product, and (2) the processing operation adds only limited value to the raw commodity, subsidies found to be provided to either producers or processors of the product shall be deemed to be provided with respect to the manufacture, production, or exportation of the processed product.'' In this review, we determine that the first criterion of section 771B is met because the demand for paddy rice depends substantially upon the demand for milled rice. As in Rice, we find in this review that substantially all of the raw agricultural product, paddy rice, is dedicated to the production of milled rice. As determined in Rice, the fact that there is a single, continuous line of production from paddy rice to milled rice is further evidence that the demand for the prior stage product is dependent on the demand for the latter stage product.
