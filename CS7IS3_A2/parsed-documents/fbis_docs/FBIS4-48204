The meeting was convened to present the government's responses to workers' demands contained in the memorandum submitted to the prime minister by the labor unions on 1 May. Here is Braimah Ouedraogo with a report. [Ouedraogo] A pay rise is out of the question. According to the explanations of the budget minister, an increase of 40 to 50 percent will result in a budget deficit of 93 billion and 97 billion respectively. Therefore, there are no funds to finance such a pay rise. Fuel prices cannot also be reduced since they are no longer standardized. The commerce, industry, and mines minister, who was present, talked about the establishment of a market street which would enable small traders to obtain cheap stalls. He also talked about the National Grains Office [OFNACER] and the Faso Yaar [state-owned marketing organization]. OFNACER has already been liquidated and the minister assured consumers in high-risk areas that cereal shortages could be covered by SONAGES [expansion unknown]. However, the Faso Yaar could not be rehabilitated despite the unions' demands. This is a sector that the state has transferred to the private sector in order to make it more efficient. The state is reported to have lost more than 6 billion CFA francs in organizations such the Faso Yaar. Finally, concerning pharmaceuticals, the health minister outlined a number of measures taken to protect people's pockets. These include negotiations with the French Pharmaceutical Producers Union for the latter to reduce wholesale prices. With the 2 billion granted by France as post-devaluation subsidy for pharmaceutical imports, there are plans for price cuts of 20 to 25 percent in the next few days. The health minister promised to reduce the number of pharmaceutical importers, which should lead to a considerable reduction in retail prices for the people.
