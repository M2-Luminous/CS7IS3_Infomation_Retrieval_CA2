The catch includes 45 kg of Semtex explosives. Six Dutchmen and two Belgians were arrested. From a statement issued by the Dutch press agency ANP, it can be concluded that the gangster Yves Otte was involved in the case. Otte was shot by the state police in Hoogstraten [Belgium] on 10 December. According to the police, which presented its investigation in Amsterdam on Thursday, the weapons, most of them from former Yugoslavia, were hidden in a lubrication pit converted into a hideout. In addition to the plastic explosives, the catch also included 81 detonators, 36 hand grenades, 25 handguns, 10 so-called Brisant missiles (antitank guns), and a few thousand cartridges of 45 different calibers. Several kilograms of cocaine, amphetamines, and XTC were also found. The Dutch police arrested six suspects, all of them Dutch citizens. The Belgian state police arrested two suspects, who were wanted for a number of armed robberies. One of the arrests resulted in a shootout, during which the suspect was shot in the belly by a bullet from the state police. The man turned out to be heavily armed. In addition, he had escaped from the jail of Louvain [Belgium] last April, where he still had to serve a sentence of several years, according to ANP. This description corresponds to the events which occurred in Hoogstraten on 10 December, at an exit of the E19 Antwerp-Breda highway, where the state police shot Otte after having itself been shot at. Otte had also thrown a hand grenade. Otte got caught when the state police checked a car which turned out to be stolen in Dunkirk. Two of the three passengers offered no resistance, but Otte ran away. The arms catch resulted from an investigation into an attack on the regional police training school in Amsterdam on 29 September and into a shootout at Ede [Netherlands], where police officers were shot at from a van. During the attack on the police school, a so-called fragmentation shell was thrown at the front door; the 3,000 steel bullets in the shell riddled the door. Two policemen remained unhurt, thanks to the steel doorstep which cushioned the force of the explosion. The shootout at Ede took place after policemen had attempted to halt two stolen vans. The passengers of the vans kicked or shot out the vehicle's rear window and opened fire at the pursuing police cars. The gangsters managed to escape. Later on, a bag with hand grenades and a cap were found by the abandoned van. According to the police, most of the suspects, many of whom have a criminal record, made partial confessions. According to their statements, the attack on the police school was a rehearsal for a robbery, which should have yielded millions of guilders. What specific target the men had in mind is still unknown. Last Saturday, the police were informed of an imminent arms transport. They followed the suspect van from northern Amsterdam to Zwanenburg (Netherlands), where the arsenal and a quantity of drugs were seized. Three individuals, including a 61-year-old man, were arrested on the spot. The police does not rule out the possibility of more arrests.
