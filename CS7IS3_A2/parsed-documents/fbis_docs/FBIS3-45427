The Modern Enterprise System Is the Foundation of the Socialist Market Economic Structure 1. Enterprises are the market's basic economic units and are the main body of competition. Establishing the status of enterprises as the main body is an essential question in the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. While erecting a macroscopic framework for the market economic structure, we must reshape the foundation for the market economic structure and establish a modern enterprise system that is in keeping with the socialist market economic structure. 2. Enterprise reform has always been central to the entire economic structure reform. Over the past 15 years, enterprise reform has basically proceeded in keeping with the idea of separating ownership and the right of management, expanding the self-managing power of enterprises, reforming the forms of management, orienting enterprises to the market, and invigorating large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. The fact that the Regulations on Changing the Management Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People was put into practice has further ensured that enterprises have self-management power and has driven the reform of other aspects. The Regulations on the Supervision of the Assets of State-Owned Enterprises to be introduced soon will define property rights and responsibilities, ensure the supervisory function, and straighten out the property rights relationships, laying the groundwork for enterprises to enter the market. 3. Following the deep-going development of China's economic structure reform, the underlying causes of the inadequate vitality of state-owned enterprises has further been exposed, the main ones being the undefined property rights relationships, the irrationality of the organizational system, and the fact that the management system is unscientific. Therefore, the further deepening of enterprise reform necessitates the tackling of deep-seated contradictions, a change from policy readjustment, whose main contents are power delegation and the concession of interests, to focussing on innovations in the enterprise system, exploring an effective method of combining public ownership and market economy, further liberating and developing productive forces, and consolidating and perfecting the socialist system. 4. The modern enterprise system is the product of market economy and large-scale socialized production. It is a fruit of civilization created by men in the course of practice and is the common wealth of mankind. It is necessary to absorb and use the beneficial experiences of developed countries around the world in light of China's reality and establish a Chinese-style modern enterprise system that conforms to China's national conditions and that is in keeping with international practice. 5. The modern enterprise system China is going to establish is a new type of enterprise system that meets the requirements of socialist market economy, that takes the standardized and complete legal entity system [qi ye fa ren zhi 0120 2814 3127 0086 0455] as the mainstay, and that takes the limited liability system as the core. Its basic characteristics are: Government administration and enterprise management are separated, property rights relationships are clearly defined, the ownership of the state-owned assets of enterprises is held by the state, and enterprises have corporate property rights and are independent legal entities that operate independently and assume sole responsibility for profits and losses. Enterprises, as legal entities, possess all rights over the assets formed by investments from various sources, including the State, and become legal entities that enjoy rights and shoulder responsibilities under civil law. They assume responsibility to investors for maintaining and increasing the value of assets. The investors, as owners, enjoy rights and interests commensurate with their shares of capital investment in enterprises and assume limited liabilities. Enterprises organize production and operations in keeping with market needs and aim at improving labor productivity and economic returns, and the government does not directly interfere with their managerial activities. Enterprises are to formulate rules, establish a scientific and standardized leadership structure and organizational and management system, and coordinate the relationships between the owners, managers, and staff and workers, thus forming a management mechanism that integrates encouragement and regulation. Enterprises operate in accordance with the law, have taxes levied on them according to regulations, accept government supervision, and meet the state's macroscopic regulation and control. 6. In establishing a modern enterprise system, it is necessary to adhere to the status of the public-owned economy as the mainstay and to the leading role of the state-owned economy and allow the simultaneous development of all economic sectors. Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are the pillars of China's economy and focusing on pursuing the modern enterprise system in these enterprises is a positive exploration and is of great significance to promoting the deepening of reform and to establishing a socialist market economic structure. Enterprise reform whose contents are to establish a modern enterprise system will continue to be central to establishing a socialist market economic structure. II. Straighten Out the Property Rights Relationships and Perfect the Legal Entity System 7. In order to establish a modern enterprise system, it is necessary to perfect China's legal entity system. Under the traditional planned economic structure, state-owned enterprises, as the subsidiaries of state administrative organizations, did not have the status of independent legal persons. The state was the sole investor and competition was out of the question. Although the state has, in the course of practicing the planned commodity economy, established the legal entity system in the form of law, it is an incomplete legal entity system. Although nominally state- owned enterprises have the status of legal persons, they have no independent property rights which are indispensable to legal persons and they have difficulty establishing a property restricting mechanism. In these circumstances, they only assume responsibility for profits but not for losses, and the state still assumes unlimited liability for enterprises and enterprises are still not real independent legal persons. 8. The state-owned assets of enterprises are owned by the whole people, that is, by the state. The State Council exercises the right of ownership of the assets on behalf of the state. To state- owned enterprises, the essence of the legal entity system is to confirm that the state possesses ownership of the property and that enterprises possess independent legal property rights and accordingly enjoy rights and shoulder responsibilities under civil law. Confirming their legal property rights will continue to change enterprises from having someone assume responsibility to having the capability of assuming responsibility and achieve the integration of their civil rights capacity and the capacity for action, forming in the market thousands of legal entities that assume sole responsibility for profits and losses. 9. In order to confirm the legal property rights, it is necessary to straighten out property rights relationships and separate the ownership of investors from the property rights of legal persons. Under some conditions, the ownership of investors is reflected in their possession of stock rights, that is, as shareholders, they enjoy such rights as profiting from the assets, choosing managers, participating in the making of major policy decisions, and transferring stock rights. Investors cannot manipulate the part of a legal person's property that belongs to themselves. They can only exercise their rights as shareholders to influence the behavior of the enterprise, but cannot directly interfere with the managerial activities of the enterprise. The legal property rights are reflected in the fact that enterprises enjoy the rights of occupying, using, profiting from, and disposing of the property of legal persons and assume responsibility for their own managerial activities with independent property. The ownership and legal property rights of investors have been confirmed by law and are protected by law and are inviolable. 10. For state-owned enterprises, confirming the legal property rights will not change the state's status as the owner and the only change is the mode by which the state manages state-owned assets, that is, a change from the management of assets in physical form to the management of assets in value form. What is important is that both the value increases of and returns on the state-owned assets of enterprises belong to the state. The state assumes responsibility for the business risks of enterprises limited to only the amount of its capital investment. Moreover, by holding state-owned stock rights, the state can expand the scope of control and readjustment of state-owned assets, that is, control a larger amount of capital with a certain proportion of capital. It can also achieve the rational flow of state-owned assets and the optimum allocation of resources through the exchange of property rights, this being conducive to the structural readjustment of the stock of state-owned assets and to maintaining and increasing their value. 11. When enterprises possess the legal property rights, we should ensure that they assume sole responsibility for profits and losses by establishing the capital fund system and the assets management responsibility system. We should encourage enterprises to manipulate, utilize, and handle their own assets, and to vitalize the stock of assets and achieve an effective increase in value. In this way we should put an end to the inseparability of government and enterprises functions and lay a groundwork for enterprises to get rid of the status of subsidiaries of government administrative institutions. 12. We should straighten out the property rights relationships and perfect the legal entity system, creating conditions for the effective integration of public ownership and market economy. On the one hand, the state possesses ownership and thus ensures the nature of the public ownership of property. On the other hand, by establishing legal property rights, enterprises will become real commodity producers and managers that operate independently and that assume sole responsibility for profits and losses. This has shaped a diversified economic main body that meets the requirements for the operation of the market economic structure, is conducive to bringing into play the fundamental role of market economy in resource allocation under the state's macroscopic regulation and control, and enables state-owned assets to operate effectively under market economic conditions and to have their value maintained and increased during their flow. Following the flowing and reorganization of property rights, all sorts of ownerships intermingle and economic units whose assets are owned by a mixture of parties will gradually increase. As far as the whole country is concerned, different regions and different trades and industries can differ in the role of public ownership as the mainstay in their national economy. The role of public ownership as the mainstay is mainly embodied in such aspects as the dominant position of public assets in aggregate social assets, the public-owned economy's control over the lifeblood of the national economy, and its influence on and guiding role in economic development. III. The Organizational System of Modern Enterprises 13. In keeping with the requirements of market economy, the organizational patterns of modern enterprises should not be delineated by the nature of their ownership, but should be delineated in accordance with the forms of composition of their assets and the legal responsibilities they assume. They are generally categorized as sole proprietorship, partnership, and corporation internationally. The first two are enterprises of natural persons in which the investors assume unlimited liability, whereas the corporation is a corporate enterprise which mainly includes the limited liability company and the limited liability stock company in which the investor assumes limited liability commensurate with his amount of capital investment. In China, in addition to the above forms of organization, there is the company funded solely by the state, the state-owned state-run enterprise, and the cooperative stock enterprise. The corporation is an important form in the organization of modern enterprises and has effectively separated the ownership of investors from the property rights of the legal person and has such characteristics as having wide sources of funds pooling, limited investment risk, and a scientific organizational system. It is typical and representative of the organizational patterns of modern enterprises. 14. Corporations have already formed a complete organizational system in the development of market economy. The most obvious characteristic is that through the corporation's authority institution, decisionmaking and management institution, and supervisory institution, the owners, managers, and producers form mutually restricting relationships, whereby they are all independent and their rights and responsibilities are clearly defined. Moreover, this can be established and achieved through the law and the articles of incorporation. This organizational system both gives the managers full independent rights and conscientiously safeguards the rights and interests of the owners while being able to bring the initiative of the producers into play at the same time. 15. We can generally consider the organizational composition of a corporation as follows: -- The meeting of shareholders is the institution of supreme authority of a company. It has the power to choose and dismiss the members of the board of directors and the board of supervisors, formulate and amend the articles of incorporation, and examine and approve the company's major matters, including its fiscal budget and actual budget, investments, and profit distribution. -- The board of directors is the managing and policymaking institution of a company. Its functions are to execute the resolutions adopted at the meeting of shareholders, make policy decisions about production and management for the company, and appoint and dismiss the company's general manager. Its members comprise representatives of shareholders and representatives of other quarters. The chairman of the board is elected by the board of directors and is generally the legal representative of the company. The board of directors makes policy decisions collectively. Each director has one vote, and decisions are approved by a simple majority. Members of the board of directors have to sign their votes for the record and assume responsibility for them. This is good for policy decisions to be democratic and scientific and examines the directors' capability for making policy decisions at the same time. The company general manager is in charge of the company's daily operational and managerial activities and takes on overall leadership of the company's production and management. He discharges his functions in accordance with the articles of incorporation and as authorized by the board of directors and is responsible to the board of directors. The board of directors invites the general manager to serve rather than having him appointed by the higher authorities. The personnel and salary relationships of directors and managers are separated from the state's administrative system. -- The board of supervisors is the company's supervisory institution. It comprises shareholders and representatives of staff and workers according to certain proportions and is responsible to the meeting of shareholders. The board of supervisors supervises, in accordance with law and with the articles of incorporation, the activities of the board of directors and managers in the course of their discharging their functions and prevents them from abusing their powers. The board of supervisors has the right to examine and check the company's financial status, safeguarding the company's interests and the legitimacy of the company's business activities. The board of supervisors can put forward proposals concerning the appointment and dismissal of the directors and managers and about their reward and punishment. In order to ensure independence of supervision, the supervisors must not assume managerial or supervisory posts with the company. 16. There can be some flexibility in the organizational pattern of companies. Considering the convenience of the structural convergence and operation of enterprises funded solely by the state we can use another kind of organizational structure, that is, setting up the board of supervisors outside the company and above the board of directors. The board of supervisors comprises representatives selected by government supervisory departments; authoritative economic, financial, legal, and technical experts appointed by government supervisory departments; and representatives of staff and workers according to certain proportions. The chairman of the board of supervisors is appointed by government organizations. The functions of the board of supervisors are: To appoint and dismiss the members of the board of directors and the general manager and make decisions about rewards and punishments; supervise the company's management and the maintenance and increase of its assets; and examine the enterprise's financial report and major proposals concerning investment, financing, and profit distribution without exercising the enterprise's right to make policies concerning management. Using this pattern is favorable to enterprises converging with the Regulations on the Supervision and Management of the Assets of State-Owned Enterprises and is favorable to staff and workers participating in the management of the enterprise. Moreover, it is favorable to the reform of government departments in the future. Furthermore, we can generally combine the board of directors and the group of managers (their numbers should not be too large), that is, the board of directors is the managing group of the company and the chairman of the board acts also as the general manager and vice chairmen act as vice general managers. This method is favorable to enterprises converging with the factory director (manager) responsibility system as provided for by the Enterprise Law and protects the incentive of the factory directors (managers) of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. The majority of enterprises that have not practiced the corporate system should continue to stick to and perfect the factory director (manager) responsibility system. 17. In establishing a Chinese-style modern enterprise system, it is necessary to bring into play the role of the enterprise's party committee as the political core and ensure that the policies and principles of supervising the party and state are implemented. It is necessary to improve the structure of the leading group of the enterprise's party committee and increase the proportion of party members in the administrative leadership. Party and government leaders can take over each other's posts alternately, and they can assume party and government posts at the same time if they meet the requirements. The institution establishment and personnel allocation of the enterprise's party committee should proceed in such a way that they are competent and highly efficient and that the enterprise can make independent decisions. The party committee of an enterprise should pay good attention to fostering the party and spiritual civilization and pay good attention to ensuring supervision while rallying around the enterprise's central task. As for an enterprise practicing the corporate system, its party committee leaders can join the board of directors and the board of supervisors through legal procedures and thus participate in making policy decisions concerning the enterprise's major issues. 18. Instituting democratic management by staff and workers is one of the characteristics of the modern enterprise system. It is necessary to enhance the sense of responsibility of staff and workers as masters of their own affairs and bring into play their initiative and creativity. In state-owned and state-run enterprises and companies funded solely by the state it is necessary to bring into play the role of the representative assembly of staff and workers and the role of trade unions and strengthen democratic management. In enterprises that practice the corporate system, their trade unions communicate the opinions and demands of their staff and workers to the board of directors and the board of supervisors and safeguard the legitimate rights of staff and workers. Representatives of staff and workers should be organized and recommended for joining the board of supervisors to participate in the supervision of enterprise operations and management. IV. The Modern Enterprise Management System 19. A scientific enterprise management system is an important part of the modern enterprise system. Proceeding from overcoming the weaknesses in China's existing enterprise management system and improving enterprises' economic returns, we should establish a modern enterprise management system with the emphasis on reforming enterprises' structural establishment and their labor use system, wage system, and financial and accounting systems, and institute a strict responsibility system. 20. The structural establishment should be decided by enterprises themselves in keeping with the characteristics of production and management and with the needs of market competition and in line with the principles of clearly defining functions, rationalizing the structure, using competent personnel, and keeping rights commensurate with responsibilities. It is necessary to emphatically stress management systems, including development, quality, business and sales, finance, and information, and improve the decisionmaking expertise, enterprise quality, and economic returns. Large enterprises and enterprise groups can gradually form the management patterns of investment centers, profit centers, and cost centers. 21. Establish a modern enterprise labor employment system. Reform the method of the state's directly managing labor employment and change the employer from the state to the enterprise. Enterprises enjoy the right to employ their own labor independently according to law and laborers have the right to choose their own careers independently according to law. The employment contract is the basic form of establishing and readjusting labor relationships. The labor relationship between an enterprise and a laborer is established when the two parties sign the employment contract of their own accord and the contract is the basis for safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests. Eliminate the identity boundaries between staff and workers and between cadres and workers within an enterprise, between different forms of employment, and between enterprises employing different forms of ownership. It is necessary to establish and perfect the social security system and the labor force market as soon as possible and form an employment mechanism for an employing unit and a laborer to choose each other and rationally flow to each other. At present, it is necessary to continue to proceed with the reform of the labor system whose main body is the all-personnel labor contract system and make good arrangements for the allocation of the surplus staff and workers of enterprises in keeping with the principles that enterprises mainly make the arrangements on their own while the state helps in the process and that the basic livelihood of staff and workers be guaranteed. 22. Establish a modern enterprise wage system. The orientation of reform is to achieve enterprises' independent distribution in the complete sense, namely that with well-defined enterprise property rights and a sound self-regulating mechanism and on the premise that the growth rate of total wages is lower than the rate of increase of enterprises' economic returns and that the average wage increase rate of staff and workers is lower than the rate of increase of their labor productivity, enterprises enjoy the full independent right to distribute wages and the state does not directly interfere with their wage distribution, but legislates for, guides, and regulates and controls it on the macro scale. The supply-demand situation in the labor power market plays an essential role in determining wage levels. Wage increases are usually determined through collective consultation. The incomes of managers, the maintenance and increase of the value of assets, and the profits of enterprises are linked with one another; and the incomes of staff and workers are determined according to their skills and to their actual contributions in terms of labor so as to implement the principle of "to each according to his work" and to bring into full play the stimulating role of wages. At present, it is necessary to further improve the method of linking total wages with economic returns and combine all kinds of allowances, bonuses, and other fringe benefits into wages so that staff and workers receive their wages in a physical form and in a standardized way. 23. Establish a modern enterprise financial and accounting system. We should conscientiously implement the "Accounting Rules for Enterprises" and establish an enterprise financial and accounting system that is in keeping with international practice. We should change the practice of determining the financial and accounting systems of enterprises in keeping with their different forms of ownership, organizational patterns, and forms of management. Strengthen enterprises' internal financial management and perfect their auditing system. We should form an auditing supervisory mechanism for enterprises through their internal auditing institutions and through social auditing forces. We should abandon the concept of "state-run enterprises keeping within budgets," which was formed under the conditions of unified state control over income and expenditure, and change the status of state- owned enterprises as units that set fiscal budgets. 24. We should build up the contingent of staff and workers and elevate enterprise culture and improve the quality of enterprises in an all-round way. We should foster fine professional ethics and a spirit of making sacrifices among staff and workers and foster a spirit of cooperation in unity, loving their professions and their factories, observing the law, being faithful to their word, and being ready for new explorations and innovations. V. Steps for Establishing a Modern Enterprise System 25. Establishing a modern enterprise system is an arduous task and necessitates experimentation and the accumulation of experience. We will gradually establish it in the approximately seven years before the year 2000. In establishing a modern enterprise system, the focus is to change the management mechanism of state-owned enterprises. At the present time, it is necessary to continue to conscientiously implement the Enterprise Law and the Regulations on Changing the Management Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People, change government functions in earnest, give 100 percent of various independent rights to enterprises, conscientiously put into practice the Regulations on the Supervision and Management of State- Owned Assets, and carry out the responsibility of maintaining and increasing the value of state-owned assets. We should quicken the readjustment of the organizational structure of enterprises and gradually form a mechanism of competition. We should resolutely prevent the unwarranted pooling of funds and the arbitrary requisition of donations from enterprises, reduce the burden of enterprises in their support of social undertakings, and create fine external conditions for them to enter the market and participate in fair competition. 26. We should pursue the modern enterprise system in light of the actual situation of China's enterprises and adopt a variety of forms and treat specific cases differently. -- As for enterprises engaging in special industries and dealing in special products having to do with national security, national defense, and sophisticated technology, we must continue to retain their state ownership and put them under direct state control and management. If some of them are fitted for the corporate system, we should restructure them in keeping with the structure of companies owned solely by the state. However, where possible we should not have one company monopolizing the whole trade or industry. -- Large and medium-sized enterprises having the necessary conditions can be restructured in keeping with the structure of ordinary companies and absorb nonstate funds. -- We should vigorously and steadily develop a number of large enterprise groups which are transregional and embrace several trades and that have public ownership as their mainstay and are linked by assets, and bring into play their important role in promoting structural readjustment, raising returns through economies of scale, accelerating the development of new technologies and new products, and enhancing competitiveness in the international market. -- Small state-owned enterprises should also be standardized in keeping with the modern enterprise system. Some can be changed into limited liability companies; some can be changed to the partnership system in the form of stock sharing; some can be contracted out and leased for private management without changing their state ownership; and others can be be sold by auction, transferring their property rights. In the long run, the majority of small state-owned enterprises should gradually transfer their property rights to collectives or individuals, and the state will achieve a capital funds shift, divert the incomes from such sales to industries that urgently need developing, and use them in structural readjustment, allocating personnel, and supporting the establishment of a social security system. -- Urban and rural collective enterprises should be changed into partnership enterprises, enterprises employing partnership in the form of stock sharing, and limited liability companies on the basis of defining the sources of their assets and defining their property rights relationships and in keeping with their different situations. A few whose scale is large and whose returns are good and which conform to the industrial policy can be changed into limited liability stock companies or enterprise groups. 27. The corporation is an effective organizational pattern of the modern enterprise system. Reorganizing some of the large and medium-sized enterprises from the current "factory system" into the "corporate system" is a great reform in China's enterprise system and is of great significance in changing the management mechanism of state-owned enterprises, enhancing their competitiveness in the market, and bringing into better play their leading role. In reorganizing enterprises into the corporate system, we should follow these three principles: 1) Reorganization should proceed in accordance with the law. After the Company Law is promulgated, relevant departments should formulate regulations on company reorganization or methods for standardization and make good preparations before reorganization. 2) Conditional reorganization. For enterprises reorganizing into the corporate system, they must conduct feasibility studies, set up a rational stock rights structure, strictly assess and audit their assets, formulate the articles of incorporation, and so forth. It is necessary to prevent those enterprises that do not need reorganization and that do not have the necessary conditions from rigidly reorganizing into the corporate system and from simply changing their company names. 3) Through experimentation, company reorganization should proceed in accordance with their different types and in different periods and in groups. We should first experiment with enterprises whose profits are comparatively good, whose burdens are comparatively light, and whose leading groups are of comparatively good quality. When we have obtained experience, we should gradually promote it. We should prevent reorganizing them at the same time. 28. As for the reorganization of enterprises into the corporate system, most enterprises should choose the form of the limited liability company. The limited liability company has the characteristics of raising small amounts of funds, being easy to operate, being easy to change over, and entailing low reorganization costs. We can, in the first place, reorganize into limited liability companies those enterprises that conform to the state's industrial policy, that occupy an important place in their own areas or trades, that produce comparatively good economic returns, and that have practiced joint operations. A small number of limited liability companies which have made profits for three consecutive years and which meet the requirements can change into limited liability stock companies. As for enterprises directly reorganizing into limited liability stock companies or changing from the directional pooling of funds to having their shares traded on the market, we should strictly examine their qualifications and comply with examination and approval procedures in such a way as to be responsible to public investors. The number of listed limited liability stock companies is only extremely small and we should focus on changing them from medium-sized enterprises into large enterprises that act as the state's pillar industries. 29. Except for special trades or industries, state-owned enterprises generally should be reorganized into limited liability companies in which many shareholders hold shares so as to be conducive to the standardization of their operation. Ways of achieving this include: Scattering stock rights among different investing units and encouraging legal persons to hold each others' shares; changing creditors' rights to stock rights with the consent of the creditors and the debtors; attracting foreign investors to buy stocks and improving the structure of stock ownership; and attracting all kinds of funds from society to buy shares, including the funds set up for staff and workers within enterprises. 30. Clear and dispose of the historical debts of state-owned enterprises incurred as a result of policies so that they can participate in market competition equally. The reasons for the historical debts of enterprises are complicated, and some debts have been left over as a result of policy adjustment during the changeover from the old economic structure to the new, while others have been caused by the improper management and operation of enterprises. We should cope with them in light of different situations. Debts arising from enterprises' expanding business and developing production are normal. During enterprises' entry into the market, the historical debts incurred as a result of the state's policies should be disposed of where the financial capability allows. For example, the state's capital funds were increased when the "giving of loans instead of appropriations" was changed to "investing instead of giving loans" between 1983 and 1985. As for the loan losses caused by irresistible objective reasons and the policy mistakes of higher authorities, enterprises should have their periods of repayment extended without the imposition of interest if they are already making efforts and are in a position to repay the debts. Some should be allowed to repay debts later with interest calculated. Others should have interest suspended. Where bad debts exist, they can be written off as bank losses after they have been seriously examined by the deposit banks and with the approval of relevant departments. As for debts incurred as a result of improper management, enterprises must repay them themselves. Those which have been making losses for a long time and whose assets cannot cover their debts and the curbing of whose losses is hopelessly impossible should be made bankrupt according to law. 31. In pursuing a modern enterprise system, we badly need large numbers of operational and management personnel that both possess specialized knowledge and modern management experience and are innovative and can usher in new prospects. This is an important factor in the success or failure of the modern enterprise system. As modern entrepreneurs, operational and management personnel should become professionals with the guarantee of credit and prestige. It is necessary to vigorously train a contingent of entrepreneurs and gradually form a management system that meets the needs of market economy from personnel selection to appraisal to dismissal. 32. We should be fully aware of the formidability and complexity of establishing a modern enterprise system. For company reorganization, the main responsibility of government supervisory departments is to study overall preparations and measures, formulate relevant policies and regulations, promote experimentation, sum up experiences, give guidance, actively encourage and steadily proceed with the establishment, practice no formalism, and ensure the success rate of reorganization. IV. Quicken Matching Reforms and Improve Enterprises' External Environment (Extracts [as published]) 33. When establishing a modern enterprise system, we must conduct matching comprehensive reforms in the macroeconomic management system, the market system, the social security system, and so forth. 34. We should reform government organizations, streamline the administrative structure, and change government functions as soon as possible, and change from the direct management of economic activities to their indirect regulation and control. 35. We should establish a system for the macroscopic regulation and control of socialist market economy. -- The state is to set forth the goal and direction for economic development, formulate industrial policies, and guide the direction of enterprises' investment. -- It should standardize the tax system on the basis of practicing the revenue-sharing system. -- It should transform specialized banks into enterprise-style commercial banks and introduce the mechanism of competition, creating a fine environment for enterprises to pool funds. 36. We should conscientiously implement the Regulations on the Supervision and Management of State-Owned Assets and establish a new state-assets management system that both guarantees the maintenance and increase of the value of state-owned assets and promotes enterprises' operating with high efficiency and full vitality. The State Council exercises the functions of the owner of state-owned assets on behalf of the state. Where possible, we should directly consign to groups of companies and large enterprises the rights over state-owned assets so as to change them into holding companies. We should establish state-owned assets management companies mainly for medium-sized and small enterprises and they should manage state- owned assets in value form. 37. Vigorously foster the market and establish a complete market system. First, straighten price relationships. Second, standardize the operational and exchange regulations and procedures of various types of markets and the quality standards of commodities by means of laws and regulations and establish corresponding organizations for the management, coordination, and supervision of these markets. Third, we should foster and perfect the equity exchange market, the capital goods market, and the labor force market as soon as possible and promote the establishment of a modern enterprise system. 38. It is necessary to establish, as soon as possible, a social security system that covers all staff and workers in cities and towns, that integrates basic insurance and supplementary insurance, whose capital is rationally shared by the state, the enterprise, and the individual, and whose management is socialized, creating conditions for enterprise reform and for the free flow of labor. 39. We should establish and perfect all kinds of intermediary organizations and establish links between enterprises and the market and between enterprises and the state. First, we should set up nongovernmental accountants' offices, lawyers' offices, auditors' offices, assets assessment organizations, personnel exchange centers, and so forth. Second, we should establish and perfect all kinds of associations or societies and social groups representing different interests, coordinate the development of their trades through set channels and forms, and communicate the needs of different interest strata to the government. Third, we should establish and perfect relevant organizations that serve enterprises and the government such as employment agencies and arbitration organizations. 40. It is necessary to formulate and perfect laws regarding relevant aspects: First, laws regarding the main body of the market such as company laws, banking laws, and labor laws. Second, laws regarding market order such as an improper competition act, a negotiable instruments act, and a securities act. Third, laws regarding macroscopic regulation and control such as a budget act, tax laws, and a state-owned assets supervision act. Fourth, laws regarding social security such as a social security act and a minimum wage act. Fifth, economic penalty laws.
