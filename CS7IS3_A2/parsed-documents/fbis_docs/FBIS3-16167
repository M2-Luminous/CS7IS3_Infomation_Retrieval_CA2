Incentives for Domestic Producers May Cause Importers' Apathy"] [Text] The unapproved Russian draft budget for 1994 has been passed to the State Duma. Its main figures confirm that the government plans to offset the reduction in direct tax rates and the VAT [value-added tax] primarily by raising import tariffs. The tight protectionism in favor of domestic producers, who have still now not given up hope of converting their products into full-fledged commodities, may cause a situation, however, where actual budget revenues will be significantly lower than what is planned. A high import tariff is effective only if there is something it can be imposed on. The attached table shows the overly high level of estimated budget revenues in 1994. According to estimates made by the Finance Ministry, which had drawn up the draft budget, the relative increase in the share of indirect taxes to be received by the federal treasury as a percentage of GDP is attributable to the imposition of a new type of tax (a charge for the support of the agro-industrial sector and the coal industry), the increase in the excise rates on imported alcoholic drinks (by 30 percent) starting 1 January 1994, and a change in the distribution of VAT revenues between various levels of the budget system. In the Finance Ministry's view, the change in the share of direct taxes as a percentage of GDP has been caused by amendments made to the taxation and budget legislation (calling for new tax rates to be levied on individuals and legal entities). The Finance Ministry explains the increase in revenues from foreign economic activity in the GDP by the fact that starting from 1994 foreign currency funds are taken into account together with ruble revenues, but in order to estimate the total amount of revenues they are converted into rubles at an exchange rate forecast for the end of 1994 (to all appearances, Finance Ministry specialists hope that it will be kept at 3,200 rubles per dollar). In addition, the Finance Ministry hopes to collect the bulk of its estimated revenues from foreign economic operations by raising import tariffs. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Percentage of GDP | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1993, in real terms |1994, forecast | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Federal budget revenues, |10.6 |16.2 | |total, | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1.
