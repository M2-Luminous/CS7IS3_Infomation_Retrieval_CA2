FAGCSI-zation of All Powers Over"] [Text] The war waged for many months by the Federal Agency of Government Communications Services and Information under the Russian Federation president (FAGCSI) to be the sole master of the information systems catering to the top bodies of power has been crowned with success. Under Boris Yeltsin's edict signed Monday evening, the only structure opposing the FAGCSI -- the Administration for Information Resources of the presidential staff (AIR) -- has been abolished and its functions handed over to FAGCSI. The war between FAGCSI and AIR -- the last "electronic subunit in the system of the supreme organs of power that worked with unclassified information -- had been waged for more than a year. Its methods were fully in line with the agency's background -- the former directorate for government communication service of the KGB. Back in summer 1993, a memo prepared by the Security Ministry, the Communications Ministry, and the FAGCSI was put on the president's desk. Viktor Barannikov, Vasiliy Bulgak, and Aleksandr Starovoytov hinted at certain "state-run and commercial organizations" that enlisted the services of foreign firms to create information networks which, in the authors' view, enabled Western special services "to introduce into the Russian market systems of processing, storage, and transmission of information enabling these services to monitor information." The unnamed organizations implied that AIR and its chief, Vasiliy Kupriyanovskiy, was trying to set up a system, independent from FAGCSI, of information telecommunications which contravened the plan for the creation of "a single information space" in Russia elaborated in the former KGB Directorate for Government Communications Service. On the basis of FAGCSI, naturally. Starovoytov, however, needed another six months for finally "eating up" the last unclassified information structure. No proof of Kupriyanovskiy's "pro-spy" activities could be procured and he was fired the day AIR was abolished "for repeated gross violations of office discipline" -- taking a trip to Italy without Sergey Filatov's authorization (but with the authorizations of Filatov's deputies). The outcome of the standoff certified by the president's edict makes it possible for FAGCSI, led by a former KGB general, not only autocratically "to protect" all information circulating in the top organs of power, but also, and naturally enough, to monitor it in the same autocratic manner.
