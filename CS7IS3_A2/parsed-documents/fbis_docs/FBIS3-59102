It increased lending to ECU19.6 billion (21.56 billion dollars), up from ECU17 billion (18.9 billion dollars) in 1992. The bank finances on average 30 percent of project costs. Having a top-ranking borrowing status, it is able to raise money more cheaply and pass on the advantages to borrowers. In 1993 the EC bank lent ECU17.7 billion (19.6 billion dollars) for projects within the EC, and ECU1.9 billion (2.11 billion dollars) outside -- mainly in East Europe and the Mediterranean basin. EIB president Brian Unwin said the bank was playing a key role in the EC's economic recovery programme. "The bank is well equipped to contribute further to the European integration process in 1994," he said. Prominent in the EIB's activities in 1993 were the allocation of ECU7.8 billion (8.66 billion dollars) for the development of trans-European transport, telecommunications and energy networks. The networks are a key element in an EC initiative to speed up the integration of West Europe and to boost employment by providing a more efficient infrastructure for businesses. The bank said it had already signed network loan contracts for ECU2.4 billion (2.66 billion dollars). Nearly three quarters of the funds allocated within the community in 1993 went to the EC's poorer regions. The biggest amounts went to Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Britain and Portugal (in descending order). In 1993 the EIB more than doubled its investment loans to East Europe -- to ECU882 million (979 million dollars), up from ECU320 million in 1992. The largest recipient was Poland (just over ECU300 million). Similarly, loans to Mediterranean countries doubled from ECU321 million to ECU680 million (755 million dollars), with more than a third of the funds going to Algeria. In 1993, for the first time, the EIB extended its investment support operations to Asia and Latin America. India got ECU55 million (61 million dollars) for an electricity grid system in the south, and Costa Rica received ECU44 million (49 billion dollars) for power projects.
