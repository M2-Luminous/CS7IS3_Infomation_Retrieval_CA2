Although Mr Tsim, 47, had pledged to leave the territory as soon as the Daya Bay nuclear plant was completed, he said political uncertainties now topped his list of fears. The controversial director of the Chinese University Press said he had no confidence in China's promise to run Hong Kong on a onecountry-two-systems basis. These fears were compounded by the location of a Chinese-operated nuclear reactor on his doorstep. Mr Tsim declared when the plant was planned that he would not stomach its presence and that he would quit Hong Kong when the station became fully operational. He revealed he will be writing and doing consultancy work in New York -- a city he has always wanted to live in. Having lived in Britain for some time he was now "excited" about relocating to North America. Born in China, Mr Tsim has studied in both Hong Kong and Britain, gaining a postgraduate diploma in advanced government studies from Manchester University. He first joined the staff of the Chinese University in 1977 for a two-year stint before rejoining as the press director in 1983. He is a past winner of the award for Hong Kong's most outstanding young person.
