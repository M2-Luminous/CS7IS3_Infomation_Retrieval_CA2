Refuting rumors that Taipei-Pretoria relations are on the brink of break-up, De Klerk reaffirmed South Africa's desire to maintain normal diplomatic ties with the ROC. De Klerk made the remarks during an interview with CNA after making a campaign speech in Johannesburg. South Africa's first multi-racial election is scheduled to be held nationwide on April 26-28. The African National Congress [ANC] led by Nelson Mandela is expected to win big in the elections resulting in the formation of a coalition government between the ANC and De Klerk's ruling national party. Mandela and the ANC have strong ties with the Chinese Communists and have announced on several occasions that they will sever ties with the ROC in favor of Beijing once in power. However, De Klerk is expected to remain an influential figure in South African politics after the election and has said "Pretoria cherishes our relations with old friends."
