Mrs Beckett's recent attempts to court the Labour Left by suggesting that all union laws may need to be swept away and that the water industry might be re-nationalised under her leadership appear to have damaged her standing with moderate Labour MPs. Some have also been angered at Mrs Beckett's attempts to portray herself as the candidate who represents "continuity" from John Smith. They point out that she failed to offer the late Labour leader unequivocal support in last October's conference battle over one member, one vote. Last night several MPs including women, who had previously either nominated Mrs Beckett for the deputy job or had declined to name a preferred candidate, were said to have moved towards Mr Prescott. One of those who had been undecided, Kate Hoey, MP for Vauxhall, said: "I think I will be voting for John Prescott because, although he is not the warmest person to deal with, he is consistent. I feel no guilt that I will not be voting for another woman." A female colleague said: "I think Margaret has been arrogant in saying she is better than all the other candidates and she is the one who knows the party far better than everyone else. She has done herself no good." Supporters of Mr Prescott said that enough of those who had nominated Mrs Beckett had now changed their minds to give him a lead among MPs. Yesterday all the leadership candidates addressed a conference of the health union Unison in Scarborough. Labour is ahead of the Scottish Nationalists by only two per cent in the by-election in Mr Smith's former seat of Monklands East, according to a survey. The poll for the Glasgow-based SUNDAY MAIL puts Labour on 45 per cent.
