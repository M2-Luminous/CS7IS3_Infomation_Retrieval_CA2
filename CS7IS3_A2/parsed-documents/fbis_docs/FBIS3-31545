In brief, it is evident from the statements given by Ganic and Silajdzic that, for the time being, the two still-warring sides have drawn closer. Analyzing the factors that lead to such a turnabout, one should, among other things, examine a visit of Clinton's envoy Charles Redman to Zagreb, which lasted several days. If we view Clinton's address to the nation within this context, it becomes clear that the United States has assumed, without the possibility of a deferment, responsibility for bringing this war crisis to an end. One could also examine the influence of Zhirinovskiy and some other factors here, however, for the time being, the relation between the Croats and the Muslims is the most important, as it will ultimately determine the situation that will prevail from the Alps to the Ionian Sea. None of the statesmen wishes to say a word about Redman's initiative. However, by analyzing the statements of Granic and Silajdzic in Frankfurt, it will not be difficult to grasp the contents of this possible solution. Dr. Granic reiterated Croatia's stand on the need for cooperation with the Muslims and on the possible cooperation of the future states, which has already been contained in President Tudjman's peace initiative. Dr. Silajdzic did not repeat his previous stand. On this occasion he spoke in favor of something entirely new, from which it can be concluded that the alliance of the two peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina is possible. The Bosnia-Herzegovina prime minister said that there are still differences regarding the nuances of the internal constitution, but that this can be overcome and that the model of relations between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia should be discussed afterward. As opposed to earlier views that nothing can be solved without the Serbs, even though it was Izetbegovic who was saying it most frequently, on this occasion, the Muslim side put forward a proposal that the doors be left open to the Serbs for this type of regulation of internal relations. Therefore, one can conclude that it will be a Serbian problem whether they accept it or not. The Muslims, so it seems, are willing to enter a joint state without the Serbs. This was all agreed in the presence of U.S. envoy Redman and the leading people from the European Union. The only question remaining now is what kind of a state will this be without the Serbs who are situated in the west of Bosnia-Herzegovina? Bearing in mind that this is evidently an U.S. initiative, which has also produced threats of air strikes, the possibility that they could carry out this threat should be borne in mind. It means that Clinton's preparation of the nation for military engagement does not mean preparation for the liberation of Sarajevo, but has much wider dimensions. The Serbs will perhaps want to leave Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it might prove awfully expensive for them. On the other hand, if the world returns to the old and realistic geo-strategic divisions, the Croats and the Muslims could prosper well together. The precondition for this is the safeguarding of human rights for both peoples on the principle of reciprocity and with the supervision and guarantees of the international community. The Russians, as a very interested side, have realized too late what is happening. Sending 400 of their soldiers to Sarajevo will not bring some great change in the present U.S. plans. The leap westward of the traditional geo-strategic positions would be a gain for Yeltsin and the generals who should be placated. However, if nothing, or less than expected, materializes out of this, and if at the same time the failure is paid for in cash for the restoration of the economy, the Russians could be very satisfied. For that reason, the fact that European Union representatives were also present at the talks in Frankfurt beside the United State is also encouraging.
