Hong Kong society is hoping that this meeting can produce substantive results and an agreement to enable the airport construction to go ahead and to be completed on schedule. Signs show that after rounds of in-depth negotiations, China and Britain are narrowing their differences over the financial arrangements for the new airport. Concerned personnel from both sides are expressing optimism about the meeting. Therefore, if both sides take the Airport Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] as the point of departure, and continue to negotiate frankly and sincerely and with an attitude of seeking truth from facts, it is possible that the meeting can achieve a breakthrough or even a package deal. A member of the Airport Consultative Committee said in his analysis that there are still three main differences between China and Britain over financial arrangements for the new airport: One, the amount of debt; two, whether the debts of the airport corporation and airport railway corporation should be counted as borrowings by the Hong Kong Government; and three, whether the land along the Airport Railway should be incorporated into the annual land sale scheme of the Sino-British Land Committee. The Airport MOU expressly sets the debt for the new airport at 5 billion Hong Kong dollars, and consultation with China is required if the debt exceeds this amount. To reach an early agreement, China has stated more than once that the 5 billion was not an absolute ceiling, showing fully its flexibility and pragmatic attitude. If the financial arrangement proposed by Britain is not too wide of the mark, it should not be difficult to bridge the difference here. On whether the debts of the airport corporation and airport railway corporation should be counted as Hong Kong Government borrowings, there should not be any question that they are, because both companies are organizations dependent on and wholly funded by the Hong Kong Government, which should shoulder all their debts. It is doubtful whether the two companies could even obtain consortium loans if statements were put out that the Hong Kong Government had nothing to do with their debts. The answer to the question of whether the land along the airport railway should be included in the annual land sale scheme of the Sino-British Land Committee is in the affirmative. Anson Chan, chief secretary of the Hong Kong Government, said earlier that Britain had never suggested disposing of all this land in one sale and agreed to incorporating it in the land committee's annual land sale scheme. Therefore, there is not much difference between China and Britain on this issue. To sum up, if at this meeting both sides are more sincere and continue to negotiate with an attitude of seeking truth from facts and in a conciliatory and concessionary spirit, they should achieve substantive results and reach an agreement, and lay the foundation for the administrative structure and other systems of the new airport.
