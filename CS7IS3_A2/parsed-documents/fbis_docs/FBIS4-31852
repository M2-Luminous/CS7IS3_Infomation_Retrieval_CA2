The talks started about three hours ago. The government is represented by State Ministers Dan Mircea Popescu and Florin Georgescu, Secretary General of the Government Victor Hrebenciuc, head of the office in charge of trade union- employers' association relations, Octavian Partenie, counselors, and experts. The sides resumed discussions that were interrupted last night on ways to solve the four claims put forward by trade unions, claims that triggered the latest protest actions and trade union rallies. There are different views on the first claim, which refers to the minimum 50 percent increase of salaries necessary to stimulate the purchase power and to give up the notion of maximum admissible fund. Minister of Finance Florin Georgescu said that this increase should be connected first of all to the increase of production. The claim on supplementing the education budget by 500 billion lei -- which in fact is a sub-point of the first claim -- was also left unsolved, due to the fact that the minister of finance stressed that in accordance with the current financial possibilities, the budget for education will be supplemented by about 30 billion lei. As far as the second claim is concerned, that is to step up the act of signing collective labor contracts at all levels and of offering guarantee that these contracts are respected, the representatives of government said that they will do all they can to urge the employers' association to resume negotiations with trade unions on this issue. However, the government representatives affirmed that everything depends on the agreement of both sides. In this context, the representatives of trade unions called on the government to draft a normative act that would establish the deadline for the signing of the collective labor contract. The sides agreed that this aspect should be discussed when the current law on collective labor contract is modified. At this hour the sides are holding discussions on the third claim, that is, the recognition of legislation for working groups that was drafted after the 1989 December revolution. In this respect, Minister of State Mircea Dan Popescu said that until a new law is drafted, activity will be carried out according to the laws currently in force, our correspondent Silvia Ilies informed us. A calm atmosphere is currently prevailing in Victoria Square. The demonstrators are waiting for the results of the negotiations that are currently taking place, our correspondent also informed us.
