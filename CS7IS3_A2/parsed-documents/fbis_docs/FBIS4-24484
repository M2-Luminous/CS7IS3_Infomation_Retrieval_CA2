According to an official with the municipal planning commission, the city's strategy of restructuring state-owned enterprises was projected as early as in the 1980s. The official said that its focus of the restructuring is on the development of auto, machinery, micro-electronics and communications equipment, petroleum, marine and refined chemicals industries, quality steel pipes and other steel products. He said that Tianjin, as the third largest city in the country, has already formed a comprehensive industrial system in which light industry has played a considerable part since 1949 when New China was born. But, he added, the policies of reform and opening to the outside world have given rise to numerous joint ventures and township enterprises which are posing a great challenge to the state-owned ones and rendering them less effective in a market economy. To support the state-owned enterprises, the investment from the local government has mainly gone to the four main industries for automobiles, electronics, chemistry, and metallurgy, the official said. The city has now become one of the biggest auto production centers and the annual production output of autos has reached 120,000, he said, adding that it has added an investment of 2.8 billion yuan to expand its production to 450,000 autos each year. The official said that one of the steps the city has taken to restructure industry is to develop the local electronics industry through international cooperation. To date, he said, Tianjin has developed computer-controlled telephone exchanges, video recorders and computers jointly with many world-renowned companies, such as the U.S. giants IBM and AST, Japan's NEC and Samsung of the Republic of Korea. In addition, the U.S. Motorola company has built a semiconductor and portable telephone production center in Tianjin, he said. The official said that many of the country's vital chemical plants are located in Tianjin. Two of the country's biggest oil fields, the Dagang and Bohai fields, are also under city jurisdiction. A number of petroleum and marine-chemical projects are being built in the city, including a 140,000-ton ethylene project, a 200,000-ton polyester plant and a 2.5-million-ton refinery, he said. He said that the Bohai chemical group, the country's biggest salt-chemical industrial group, has recently been listed in Hong Kong to raise more money to develop China's fine chemicals. In Tianjin, he said, the most attractive project is the Tianjin Steel Pipe Company, with a total investment of more than ten billion yuan and an annual output of 500,000 tons of seamless steel pipes. The planning official concluded that when completed, all these projects will change the city's industrial structure and become the mainstays of the city's industries. And the output value of these four major industries last year already accounted for about 70 percent of the city's industrial total.
