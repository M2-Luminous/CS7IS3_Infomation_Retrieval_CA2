Venkatramani] [Text] There has been considerable media cerebration about the precise diplomatic strategy that India should adopt to prevent and pre-empt the United States from selling F-16s to Pakistan. The debate has begun to acquire a certain sense of urgency because of the impending visit of the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, to the U.S. What has accentuated the strategic importance of carrying conviction to Capitol Hill on the F-16s is the attempt by the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, Mr. Strobe Talbott, during his just concluded visit to Delhi, to convince India about the strategic wisdom of the U.S. parting with 38 F-16s to Pakistan in return for the latter capping its nuclear programme. Our sense of judgement is clouded at the moment by the political and emotional aftermath of the significant recent visits of Mr. Talbott and his immediate junior, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, Ms. Robin Raphel. On the one hand, Mr. Rao felt a compelling political need to talk tough with Mr. Talbott; on the other, Delhi could not help but betray its sense of lurking fear about the F-16s adversely altering the balance of power in the subcontinent. I would argue that it is a deep-rooted sense of culture and conviction, independent of the immediate provocation, that we have to exhibit in responding to the question of the U.S. sale of F-16s to Pakistan. Instead of giving the impression that we are merely opposing the sale of the F-16s, we should broaden the base of the diplomatic debate to discuss the nuclear question per se. We have consistently refused to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] on the ground that it was discriminatory. We have taken an issue-based position on the NPT. I think it similarly behooves us as a nation to take a principled stand on the broader nuclear question itself, instead of treating the F-16s as an immediate expediency. What this means is that we have to take a position not only against the sale of F-16s to Pakistan; we have to fight against the unwitting dissemination of American nuclear weapons technology around the globe; more, we have to crusade against the spread of U.S. nuclear reactor technology itself to the rest of the world. India should seize the F-16 opportunity to nail the American nuclear lie. Delhi can take up the cause of effectively proving that there is no such thing as a safe nuclear reactor technology. Every nuclear reactor produces, among several other radioactive by-products, 400 to 500 pounds of plutonium annually. You need just 10 to 20 pounds of plutonium to make a bomb. Therefore, the yearly radioactive waste discharged by an average nuclear reactor holds enough toxic potential for the manufacture of anything from 20 to 50 atomic bombs. Through plutonium, nuclear reactor technology and nuclear weapons technology have become inseparably interlinked. The ecological hazardous potential of plutonium should not be underestimated at all. Named after Pluto, the Greek God of the underworld, plutonium is the most long-lived radioactive by-product of a nuclear reactor; it remains poisonous for at least 500,000 years. Just think for a moment that this stretch of time is more than 100 times longer than the entire span of recorded history. It is more than 50 times longer than the time that has elapsed from the end of the Ice Age to the present day. Less than one millionth of a gram of plutonium can cause cancer. One pound of plutonium, if uniformly distributed throughout the earth, can afflict every human being with lung cancer. It is crucially important to realise that plutonium in the environment does not vanish with the death of an infected organism. A contaminated dead animal, for instance, may be eaten by another animal; it may also rot away, and mix with the soil. In any case, plutonium will remain in the environment, and will continue to poison one organism after another, one living being after another, for half a million years. It has been authoritatively estimated that if the American nuclear industry expands according to current projections, and somehow manages to miraculously contain its plutonium with 99.99 percent perfection, it will be responsible for 500,000 fatal lung cancers every year for 50 years after 2020 AD. This incidentally will amount to a 25 percent increase in the total death rate in the U.S. It is to be clearly understood that there is no putting the clock back on plutonium after it gets created as a byproduct; there is no unscrambling of the scrambled egg; there is absolutely no foolproof method of containing plutonium after it is made. As American nuclear technology seeps to the rest of the world, tonnes of plutonium are bound to get routinely transported across highways and through rail roads. India should work for adequate universal appreciation of the fact that at every step in the process of generating nuclear energy there, is continuous and invisible radioactive poisoning of both the workers in the nuclear industry and the entire natural environment. From the mining, milling and enrichment of uranium to the fabrication of fuel rods, the operation of a nuclear reactor and the handling of nuclear waste, there is radioactive contamination of the human and physical environment at every stage. The radioactive substances that continuously escape into the atmosphere from the site of a nuclear reactor emit a range of subatomic particles that can penetrate your skin and damage your body cells. You also stand the risk of taking in radioactively polluted food or water that can do you incalculable internal harm. All the advancements in American technology have not yet found a solution to the serious problem of decommissioning a nuclear reactor at the end of its useful life. The development and proliferation of the so-called faster breeder reactors only carries the nuclear risk a step further. These reactors use plutonium itself as a fuel and are much more dangerous than the ordinary commercial reactors. India can demonstrate its deep-rooted ecological sensitivity by driving the point home to the world at large that there is no such thing as a safe level of nuclear radiation, contrary to what the American nuclear industry would have us believe. It is relevant to note that Ralph Nader had made the point somewhere that nuclear power has become in many ways America's ``technological Vietnam.'' It would be a little sad if Mr. Narasimha Rao were to cosy up to Uncle Sam to stop the sale of F-16s to Pakistan. The Pressler amendment and the F-16 should be just flea-bites in the Indian-world-view. If India were to take up the cause of the development of technology for effectively harnessing solar energy, like, for instance, the development of commercially viable photovoltaic cells to covert sunlight into electricity, well, that would, mesh in with our native culture of concern for the environment. After recently espousing the cause of ``the middle path'' in the U.K., it will only be in the fitness of things if Mr. Rao were to give a call, for a transition from a poisonous nuclear era to a promising solar age, in the U.S. Mr. Rao should take the bull of the American nuclear industry by the horns rather than merely oppose the sale of F-16s.
