FBIS3-1248 "drafr056_c_94040" FBIS-AFR-94-056 Document Type:Daily Report 23 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 23 Mar MB2303140194 MB2303140194 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Big Defence Force Call-Up -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 23 March in a page-20 editorial says "the country's situation before, during and immediately after the election seems destined to become more volatile, not less; so there is a strong argument for the authorities to tap all available security manpower in the form of a big Defence Force call-up. In deciding on this step, the SADF [South African Defense Force] top brass will have been encouraged by the discipline and efficiency of their troops in the Bophuthatswana crisis." De Klerk, NP `Main Casualties' in Goldstone Report Fallout -- In an article on the same page, Patrick Laurence writes that President de Klerk and his National Party "are likely to be the main casualties in the fall-out" from Justice Richard Goldstone's interim report implicating top police generals in politically motivated violence. "De Klerk's immediate reaction has been to place all the policemen named in the report on compulsory leave and to declare himself in favour of an investigation into the allegations by an international team of policemen, assisted by one of South Africa's four attorney-generals and an eminent jurist from outside South Africa. But De Klerk's actions may paradoxically be not enough and too much: not enough to allay suspicions in the black community that he has lost control of his security forces and too much for the police generals and white conservatives to stomach." The failure of the De Klerk government to prosecute military officers in 1993 "works against it on both flanks. Black radicals see it as evidence of his unwillingness to take decisive action; white conservatives interpret it as evidence of his willingness to sacrifice innocent men to appease the ANC [African National Congress]." BUSINESS DAY Call For Policemen Indemnity -- "Unpleasant as it may seem, the way to the truth about police and the `third force' is probably through offering indemnity to policemen who may have inside knowledge," declares a page-10 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 23 March. The priority must be "to find out what happened." "If policemen committed or encouraged political murders, it is important to know on whose orders they acted. What matters now is accountability, whether of senior officers or senior politicians. Name the killers, but blame those who sent them, failed to stop them or pretended they did not exist."
