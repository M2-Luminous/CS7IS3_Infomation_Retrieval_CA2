So far, all incumbent principal leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels throughout the country have attended the study course once. Study classes and training courses on Volume III of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping are being held in various parts of the country as scheduled. Taken as a whole, the situation in previous studies was good and the achievements gratifying. Leading cadres at all levels, particularly those at the county sectional level or above, should continue to exert themselves and seize the opportunity to persistently and profoundly study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and apply what has been studied to practice in order to raise this study to a new level along with the improvement of the entire party's ideology and theory. "Persistently" means that we must persist in studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's works for a long period. Leading cadres should not think that they can relax because they have attended the study course, have read Comrade Deng Xiaoping's works once, twice, or three times, and have understood the main contents. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's works are simple and easy to read and most leading cadres can understand them, but it is not easy to master their basic principles or apply them. This requires persistent efforts. Of course, unlike the "study course," they cannot spend too much time on their studies because they are busy with daily affairs, therefore, they should be good at fitting in time for their studies. It is necessary to work out a feasible plan to combine concentrated study with daily study, and collective study with individual study. All leading cadres, particularly high-level cadres, should put the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping on their desks and regard his works as "mottoes." Whenever they come across problems, they should read his works. If they persist in doing this and form such habits, they will benefit a lot from it. "Profoundly" means that we should not stop after getting a little knowledge but should continue to make arduous and profound efforts to master the essence and scientific system of Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is necessary, through a period of study, to understand the main contents of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the questions expounded by Comrade Xiaoping in different periods, his views on certain questions, his remarks in different periods, and so on. But this is only the "way" to the "hall and room," and we should move forward along this "way" and try to thoroughly understand the two major issues of contemporary China and contemporary China's Marxism by taking all problems in reform and development into account. The process of profoundly studying Comrade Xiaoping's theory is a process of his theory permeating our minds and a process of using the essence and scientific system of his theory to arm our minds. Thus, while repeatedly studying the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, we are required to use his works as standards to measure ourselves and as guidance to sum up our work. In this way, we will improve our understanding, have a good idea of the overall situation, uphold what is correct, overcome what is wrong, rectify what is one sided, and really arrive at profoundness. Applying what has been studied is the fundamental aim of persistent and profound study and is also a basic method of studying theory. Comrade Mao Zedong said long ago: "It is necessary to master Marxist theory and apply it; the sole purpose of mastering it is to apply it." Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics is contemporary China's Marxism. The sole purpose of mastering this theory is to use it to analyze and resolve major problems in China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. In applying what has been learned, we must make earnest efforts. In the course of establishing the socialist market economic structure this year, a number of major reform measures have been introduced. The current reform is like "storming heavily fortified positions," during which many new problems and new situations must be properly understood and resolved. We may say that practice is urgently calling theory for help; thus, there is a vast field for theory to be applied to. Now, the most important thing is to make contributions to serving the major aspects of the situation. The major aspect of the party's and country's work for this year is to seize the opportunity to deepen reform, expand the scope of opening up, promote development, and maintain stability. The key issue is to properly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability. This basic principle of the party Central Committee is the result of using Comrade Xiaoping's theory to comprehensively analyze and correctly judge the present international and domestic situation and is the outcome of combining theory with practice. Leading cadres at all levels should use Comrade Xiaoping's theory as guidance in deepening their understanding of the overall situation and enhancing their consciousness and determination to implement the "20-character principle." In localities, departments, and units under their leadership, they should creatively proceed with their work and make practical contributions to promoting reform, development, and stability. Persistently paying attention to leading cadres' theoretical studies is a "key project" of "arming cadres with a scientific theory" and is also the key to making a success of the entire party's studies. Party committees at all levels should conscientiously sum up their previous experience and do a better job of this major issue of fundamental and long-term significance.
