FR940802-2-00044 FR940802-2-00035 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION [CC Docket No. 91&hyph;141; DA 94&hyph;819] Commission Requirements for Cost Support Material To Be Filed With Virtual Collocation Tariffs for Special Access and Switched Transport AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. SUMMARY: On July 25, 1994, the Commission adopted a separate Memorandum Opinion and Order modifying its rules governing provision of expanded interconnection service. Specifically, the Commission lifted the requirement that local exchange carriers provide physical collocation, but required certain local exchange carriers to provide virtual collocation. In this Order, the Common Carrier Bureau (Bureau), under delegated authority, establishes specific requirements for the cost support information that must accompany the local exchange carriers' virtual collocation tariffs.

The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirement to OMB for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3507. Persons wishing to comment on this information should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10236, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395&hyph;3561.

Please note: The Commission has requested expedited review of this collection by August 1, 1994 under the provisions of 5 CFR 1320.18. Title: Commission Requirements for Cost Support Material to be Filed with Virtual Collocation Tariffs for Special Access and Switched Transport. Respondents: Business or other for profit. Frequency of Response: One time collection. Estimated Annual Burden: 16 respondents; 1 response per respondent; 194 hours per response; 3104 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: The information required is necessary for efficient review of the required revisions of the local telephone companies' expanded interconnection tariffs. The information collected will be used to determine whether the charges offered are just and reasonable as the Act requires. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis: The Commission has determined that Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), does not apply to these rules because they do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The definition of a ``small entity'' in Section 3 of the Small Business Act excludes any business that is dominant in its field of operation. Although some of the local exchange carriers that will be affected are very small, local exchange carriers do not qualify as small entities because each of them has a monopoly on ubiquitous access to the subscribers in their service area. The Commission has also found all exchange carriers to be dominant in its competitive carrier proceeding. See 85 FCC 2d 1, 23&hyph;24 (1980). To the extent that small telephone companies will be affected by these rules, the Commission hereby certifies that these rules will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of ``small entities.'' Summary of Report and Order: In Memorandum Opinion and Order in this Docket adopted on July 14, 1994, the Commission required all Tier 1 local exchange carriers (LECs) other than participants in National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA) pools to offer virtual collocation. Those tariffs must be filed on or before September 1, 1994, to become effective on December 15, 1994. In the Tariff Review Plan Order released concurrently with the Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Common Carrier Bureau, under delegated authority, adopted requirements for cost support information which LECs must submit with their virtual collocation tariffs. The Tariff Review Plan (TRP) disaggregates expanded interconnection service, by basic service function, into the following seven categories: (1) Provisioning Function, (2) Entrance Function, (3) Termination Function, (4) Cross-Connection Function, (5) Equipment Installation Function, (6) Maintenance and Repair Function, and (7) Technician Training Function. The Bureau recognized that the Commission did not mandate a detailed rate structure, but required LECs to categorize their rate elements into these functions for purposes of the TRP. For each function, the TRP requires a complete list of plant and equipment, including the name of the plant or equipment item, the associated Part 32 account numbers, gross investment amounts, and estimated depreciable lives. The TRP also requires detailed expense and tax information, including the name of the expense or tax, the Part 32 account numbers, and the expense or tax amount. In addition to the TRP, LECs must provide documentation supporting their entries in the TRP form, submit cost support information for the overhead loading factors used to develop their expanded interconnection rates, and overhead loading factors on a service-by-service basis for all point-to-point special access services they offer. Finally, LECs are also required to provide a sample price out for the provision of 100 DS1s, assuming that nonrecurring costs will be amortized over a five year period at an 11.25 percent discount rate.
