Ballinger, senior vice president, expects over 80% will have one by 2000. ``We'll never hit 100%, but I would like, in theory, to have a card in very customer's hands, ``Ballinger says. Issuers also expect the percentage of consumers with a debit card who use their card at least once a month to grow in the next seven years. While only about 25% of the issuers say their activation rates currently average more than 70%, 43% expect that their rates will exceed 70% by 2000. (See tables 6 and 7.) ``The activation rate continues to creep up, especially as younger users replace older customers,'' says Patricia Bauer, senior vice president of Minneapolis-based First Bank Systems. U.S. Bancorp's Kresge notes that POS is also pushing up activation rates with his customers as some who had no use for their debit cards at ATMs find they like using them at the point of sale. Like debit cards, new ATM deployment is expected to enjoy only modest growth. About 32% of the networks and 50% of the issuers expect the number of their ATMs to grow by less than 3% annually, while only 13% of the networks and 5% of the card issuers expect this growth to exceed 15% annually. (See tables 8 and 9.) A few networks and banks, however, are expecting more active new ATM deployment, particularly at off-premise locations. ``We have a tremendous amount of corporate relationships where we can put ATMs in work locations,'' says Fifth Third's Ballinger. ``We're looking at deploying 25 to 30 ATMs a year in the workplace. Some will pay us to install ATMs so they can get rid of or cut their cashier functions.'' And some banks note they expect to deploy more new ATMs to perform non-traditional applications beyond cash withdrawals and accepting deposits. A few innovators already have been deploying advanced ATMs which can cash checks, issue account statements, sell stamps or allow consumers to apply for bank loans. ``The traditional cash withdrawals and deposit-taking terminals have leveled off,'' says Edward Gough, president of Ohio-based Money Station network. ``But other ATM applications such as EBT will push ATM installations for expanded functions that will add to the growth of ATMs.'' This projected growth is slightly less than the growth in recent years. In 1993, the number of ATMs in the U.S. grew by 8.6%. It grew by 4.5% in 1992, 4.2% in 1991, 5.9% in 1990 and 4.3% in 1989. (See table 10.) And projected growth is considerably less than the double-digit growth of the early 1980s. Despite modest expectations for debit card and ATM growth, networks and issuers have higher expectations for total EFT transactions. Executives expect the most growth in POS transactions while seeing growth of only 10% or less for ATM transactions. The result will be significant overall transaction growth. About 55% of the network executives and 53% of bank card issuers expect their EFT volume growth to exceed 15% annually. Another 26% of the issuers and 10% of the networks expect growth to be between 10% and 15% annually. (See tables 11 and 12.) ``Between now and the end of the decade, the number of POS transactions will equal the number of ATM transactions,'' says Edward Gough, president of Ohio-based Money Station network. ``POS is now only 5% of our total volume.'' Others also expect POS to lead the growth. ``We will see a lot of transaction volume growth,'' says Olen Thomas, vice president of Richmond, VA.-based Crestar Bank. ``The POS component of transaction volume could grow by 50% a year for the next two to three years.'' Despite modest expectations for ATM transaction growth, network executives say it still will be healthy. ``We keep expecting the rate of growth in ATM transaction volume to slow, but last year it exploded,'' says James Martin, president of Wisconsin-based Tyme network. ``In POS, we expect a 55% increase in 1993 and we expect ATM volume to continue to grow 10% a year.'' Networks projecting the lowest rate of growth_less than 10%_typically do not offer or plan to offer POS and also do not have ambitious plans for other new electronic payments programs. These projections would indicate that POS, which finally seems ready to take off after years of hopeful expectations, will drive EFT volume increases in excess of the 12% to 14% growth that had been common in recent years. (See table 13.) Although POS has been growing slowly in recent years, new regional POS programs throughout the country, the advent of national POS programs, the skyrocketing level of acceptance of debit cards by supermarkets and penetration of POS into new markets like fast-food restaurants and specialty shops have raised the expectations of both network and financial institution executives.
