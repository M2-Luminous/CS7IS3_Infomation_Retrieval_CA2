Environmental Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat (Austrian People's Party) has been inundated with criticism both from the opposition parties as well as from the coalition party--the Socialist Party of Austria. Meanwhile, the "industrial branch recycling companies" are teetering precariously on the brink of bankruptcy. The efficient use of packagings and the reuse of packaging waste, which today in Austria amounts to about 1.5 million tons, are the goals of the Austrian packaging ordinance. It obligates suppliers to take back the sales and transport packagings and either return them to the original supplier, reuse them, or otherwise utilize them. Businesses can free themselves from this obligation by concluding a license contract with Altstoff Recycling Austria AG (ARA) and paying a license fee. In exchange for which, ARA takes over the packaging waste materials and finds ways of utilizing them. This initiative, under the motto "less government-more private industry," came under ideological crossfire almost immediately. The Social Democrats would prefer governmental regulation with a packaging duty rather than a system run by private industry. The problems manifested themselves in early February. Austria Glass Recycling (AGR), an affiliate of ARA responsible for the collection of used glass products, found itself on the verge of financial collapse with a budgetary deficit of 70 million schillings. At the same time, ARA was already rumored to be threatened by a billion schilling deficit in its budget. The head of ARA, Christian Stiglitz, complained that "no one could realistically expect that a project like this, which in its first six months has undergone such growth, would be immune to some developmental disruptions." The development of the "Mega Project," he continued, has proceeded most promisingly to now. In just six months, some 6,000 companies throughout Austria have contracted with ARA. In the case of Germany, only 15,600 contracts had been signed in three and a half years. The first balance sheet, published on 1 March, showed a brisk income of about 2.2 billion schillings (DM 315 million), for 1994. Another 300 million schillings are expected this year through the acquisition of new license partners, so that about 2.5 million schillings instead of the originally planned 4 million schillings, are available for collection and utilization purposes. Christian Stiglitz asserts that the main reason for the "current income shortfall" is the large number of "free loaders," i.e., companies that take advantage of the ARA system without paying for it. Sharp action will now be taken against such companies. In cases where new cost estimates are the problem, rate charge restructuring will have to be considered. In view of the crisis, Socialist Party member Josef Cap is demanding that "the packaging ordinance be lifted for an unspecified period of time so that the ARA can reexamine its operating conditions." As in Germany, the system is on the brink of bankruptcy because of inadequate control- and sanction-mechanisms. Franz Floss believes that the present disposal system is not able to fulfill its own ecological intention of damming up the flood of waste. The spokesman of the Greens fears that the consumers will be called upon to make up for the losses. On the other hand, Environmental Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat hopes that the ARA will be able to save some 700 million schillings (DM 100 million) through replanning. The difference remaining to close the 1.2 billion schilling deficit in the ARA balance--only 500 million schillings--could be realized through discounts and deferment of payments of the disposal operation (200 million schillings), advance payments and liability transfers to the economy (200 million schillings, and other similar measures taken by the cities and communities.
