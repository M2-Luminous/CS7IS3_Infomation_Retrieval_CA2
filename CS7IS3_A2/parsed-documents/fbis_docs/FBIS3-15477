Kokoshin believes that, on the one hand, a decreased defense order may bring about the collapse of major manufacturers of defense products and negatively affect the 15 million people employed by the military industrial complex. On the other hand, a strong army is a guarantor of success in implementing economic and political reforms today. Though we do not have any external enemies any longer, the Armed Forces now have a direct effect--albeit not immediately obvious for ordinary people--on the social and economic situation in the country by preserving a certain, though fragile, balance in local conflicts in Tajikistan and the Caucasian region. [Begin Kokoshin recording] There is a danger of these conflicts expanding and getting out of control, of their gradual transformation into large-scale wars. Of course, the intensity may vary at different stages, but they would have the most negative effect on the internal stability in Russia. Should we fail to keep in check the situation in those countries, imagine what would happen if Russia were flooded by millions of refugees. [end recording] Kokoshin asserts that the Defense Ministry is not being excessive in its demands, asking only for those resources that would ensure the healthy operation of the Armed Forces and the fulfillment of the defense order that has already been approved. Incidentally, 70 percent of the expenditures are being allocated for social needs. Social unrest among the military may upset stability of the state itself.
