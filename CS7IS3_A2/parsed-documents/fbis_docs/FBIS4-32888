Observers believe President Caldera's decision to remove FIV President Abdon Vivas Teran was prompted by the way he handled Aeropostal's privatization, which was considered a failure because the bid was declared invalid. It is also said the decision was prompted by the rejection of Air Force Commander General Otto Garcia Rivara, who reportedly objected to the fact that one of the enterprises participating in the bid was a Colombian airline. He believes Aeropostal is a strategic Venezuelan company, and one must take into account the border problems we have with our neighbor. OCI [Central Information Office] chief Guillermo Alvarez explained that Abdon Vivas Teran will remain in the government even though he has left the FIV. This means he will possibly be appointed to another post in the ministerial cabinet. [Begin recording] [Alvarez] I cannot report new changes. These are the ones the president authorized us to announce today. [Briceno] Does this mean Mr. Abdon Vivas Teran is now out of the government? [Alvarez] He is obviously out of the post he held. This does not mean he is out of the government. [end recording] Alvarez announced Alberto Poletto will still be in charge of the Foreign Trade Institute [ICE]. This situation might propitiate a merger of the ICE and the Development Ministry, which would become the industry and commerce ministry. Ciro Zaa Alvarez has been appointed to the MTC [Ministry of Transportation and Communications]. Zaa was formerly in charge of the Urban Development Ministry and Francisco Gonzalez, current president of the Urban Development Fund, was temporarily appointed to the post. President Caldera's plans include the unification of these infrastructure ministries. Luis Carlos Palacios has been appointed to the Central Office of Coordination and Planning, replacing Enzo del Bufalo, who tendered his official resignation to the head of state. Another appointment made by President Caldera was that of Alfredo Gruber, current president of Palmaven in the Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation who will be in charge of the Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana. To conclude, Pompeyo Marquez has been given responsibility for coordinating the government's social programs. The new ministers will be sworn in by President Caldera on Monday [30 May] at Miraflores Palace.
