Is a new Cold War emerging? [Woerner] I hope that we can prevent this by means of a policy that makes the available alternatives clear to Russia: Either it continues the reforms and follows the path of cooperation with us or it risks that the world becomes dark again. NATO wants the first alternative and, together with Russia, it wants to establish a new European security system. [DER SPIEGEL] It seems likely that the frontlines will become more rigid again. Fascist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is threatening the Germans and others with complete destruction. [Woerner] Even though Mr. Zhirinovskiy achieved a considerable number of votes at the elections, he does not determine the guidelines of Russian policy. These are still determined by President Yeltsin, and he is not interested in confrontation. [DER SPIEGEL] He is also becoming increasingly aggressive and nationalist in his statements. [Woerner] We see that, too. However, one does not know to what extent he is serious about that or just triying to safeguard himself against the right. It is clear that close cooperation, for which we are striving, is incompatible with the revival of an expansionist Russian foreign policy. [DER SPIEGEL] But it would probably help NATO to get out of the identity crisis in which it has been mired since the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. [Woerner] The NATO summit will prove that such a crisis does not exist. The alliance has never been as popular as it is now. There are many countries that want to get in, but no countries that want to get out. [DER SPIEGEL] There is a lot of quarreling about where NATO is supposed to be heading. The British and the Americans want to return to the origins as a purely military alliance. The Germans see the alliance primarily as a political instrument to stabilize Eastern Europe. [Woerner] There will always be differences of opinion about the course because we are a democratic alliance. I am sure that the summit will confirm the classical role of the alliance and, in addition, define two new ones. First, we need crisis management and the safeguarding of peace beyond the NATO borders and, second, the projection of stability toward the East. [DER SPIEGEL] At the moment, the alliance offers a rather miserable picture in this respect. [Woerner] I strongly object! It is not a miserable picture if one switches from confrontation to cooperation with all former opponents within the period of just two years. This is a virtually revolutionary change. [DER SPIEGEL] Why did the alliance not seize the opportunity when Yeltsin said in Warsaw in August that he is not against NATO membership by the Poles, Hungarians, or Czechs? [Woerner] We are acting in line with our own standards and not on order. Furthermore, Yeltsin talks differently today than in Warsaw. He has changed his course. [DER SPIEGEL] And NATO promptly refuses to take in new members. [Woerner] Our course is determined by ourselves and not by Mr. Yeltsin. I am energetically in favor of taking in some of the states in Central and East Europe. They are so clearly part of the West in cultural and historical terms that one must anchor them there. This is our historic mission. I hope that the alliance will resolve at the summit that it is basically ready for expansion. [DER SPIEGEL] There will neither be a schedule nor criteria for new members. In reality, no one in the West is willing to give security guarantees to Warsaw or Budapest at the moment -- especially not the nuclear power United States. [Woerner] You are right: At the moment, we are not willing to give a schedule or criteria for membership. There will be no security guarantee at the summit. But, I think some countries will get it over the course of time. [DER SPIEGEL] There is only the question of when? [Woerner] This remains open at the moment. The Americans -- whom you just mentioned -- are very serious about a security guarantee, because if they give one, they fulfill it. However, they are also certainly willing to expand the alliance -- but in a way that does not offend the Russians. [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, Moscow does have a veto right? [Woerner] We do not give a veto right to anyone. However, it is certainly understandable that we do not want to do anything now that would promote a radicalization in Russia or pushes the country out of a gradually growing Euro-Atlantic community during a very sensitive period of history. History and future generations would not forgive us for that. [DER SPIEGEL] Therefore, NATO offers everyone who wants to get into the alliance a lot of topical ointment, called Partnership for Peace? [Woerner] Why topical ointment? We offer a substantive package of specific cooperation, with which some states can prepare for membership without offending others. [DER SPIEGEL] Your package is a fraud. It just contains plans that the North Atlantic Cooperation Council had already announced in December. [Woerner] That is not true; we go far beyond that. First of all, Partnership for Peace means making the doctrines and defense structures and the budgets and operational concepts of the partner states compatible with ours in such a way that this will result in better cooperation or, under certain circumstances, even membership. This includes joint exercises and, selectively, joint training. In my view, later on there will be technological cooperation concerning equipment. I see a very broad range here -- over a long period, of course. [DER SPIEGEL] The Central and East Europeans think this is too little; they feel left in the lurch by NATO. [Woerner] It makes me angry that not only here but also in East Europe people constantly talk in extremes. The issue is not the wrong alternatives: security guarantee or security vacuum. The security situation of these states has already improved as a result of the current cooperation with the Atlantic alliance. We have stated again and again that their security is a matter close to our hearts. Anyone who thought of touching them would have to think very thoroughly about what reaction he would have to expect from the alliance. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you have understanding for Czech President Vaclav Havel? He says: Nonexpansion by NATO at the moment would be a fatal mistake, a giving in to chauvinist forces in Russia and encouragement of imperial ambitions. [Woerner] I understand Vaclav Havel's line of arguments. It differs from mine only in some aspects. However, he exaggerates the conclusions. On the contrary, we do not reject these states. They can embark on the path that will one day lead to membership. [DER SPIEGEL] Does this offer apply to all states to the east of the old NATO, including the still-nuclear power Ukraine and the Baltic states? Lithuania has just formally requested acceptance into the alliance. [Woerner] Partnership for Peace is aimed at everyone who is interested. There will come a time when we will differentiate. [DER SPIEGEL] After all, the fear is that the European continent will be divided into spheres of influence as in the past: here NATO, there the former Soviet Union, and the rest remains an unstable Europe in between? [Woerner] NATO does not establish spheres of influence, nor will it promote the establishment of such a sphere by others. Our concept is cooperative security for all of Europe. [DER SPIEGEL] A relapse into a policy of power and alliance as in the last century is feared. [Woerner] In contrast to the period at the beginning of this century, now we have two international instigations that can prevent the threatening relapse -- the European Union and the Atlantic alliance. They are facing two historic tasks: first, establishing the new overall Europe by including the largest European power of today and tomorrow -- that is, a strategic partnership with Russia; second anchoring the new democracies in Central and East Europe in the structures of the West. [DER SPIEGEL] Are these not very contradictory goals? [Woerner] Why should this be mutually exclusive? Of course, it is always the task of the statesman's skill to make sure that both processes take place harmonically and are coordinated. For this we need diplomatic skill, cautiousness, flexibility, but also leadership. After all, the alternative is that this Europe will fall apart and old categories of power policy will become dominant again. We have a unique historical opportunity, which one can also ruin or fail to seize. [DER SPIEGEL] Do we absolutely need NATO and the Americans for that? [Woerner] Yes, they provide the geopolitical balance -- even in a cooperative relationship with the Russians. On the other hand, the alliance is necessary also for the current balance in West Europe, because otherwise the old question: "Who controls whom?" in Europe might occupy first place again. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you seriously believe that NATO and the European Union will be able to master these tasks? [Woerner] Who else? [DER SPIEGEL] Despite the fact that even there the forces of disintegration are growing? [Woerner] I do not dream of denying that. In view of the current historical transition periods and the disappearance of the great enemy, the centrifugal trends are increasing. So far, we have managed to come to grips with that, and I think that we will be able to do that in the future as well. [DER SPIEGEL] What is the strategic partnership between the West and Moscow supposed to look like? [Woerner] The alliance does not yet have a complete concept for that. However, I can give you my personal opinion and cite some elements of cooperation, which should be a part of it: first, worldwide safeguarding of peace; second, the attempt to prevent or master nuclear disasters; and third, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This will be an enormously important field. For this purpose, one day we could establish joint crisis control centers to counter future threats, such as terrorism with nuclear or chemical weapons. In addition, there should be more intensive strategic tasks and the respective national security interests should be respected, which should not be confused with the establishment of spheres of influence. [DER SPIEGEL] Why do you not follow the proposal by Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev that the NATO Cooperation Council should be given far more authority, from consultations in crises to the duty of assistance? [Woerner] Even though the NATO Cooperation Council is being developed further, the focus must not shift to it to such an extent that the actual NATO would be just an appendage. [DER SPIEGEL] Would this be so bad? [Woerner] It would deprive the Cooperation Council of its actual support. Many of our partners would oppose that. One can ruin the alliance in two ways. Either one prevents it from taking over new tasks in addition to its important task of defending its own alliance area by military means or one turns it into a collective security system just like the CSCE. [DER SPIEGEL] Therefore, you are praising NATO as an international peacemaker? [Woerner] We have been that and we will remain that. [DER SPIEGEL] How does that fit in with your constant complaints that the alliance failed in its first operation outside the alliance area, in the former Yugoslavia? [Woerner] I have said that the international community has failed. The alliance has only a modest share in that, because then the Europeans were not able to come to grips with the Balkan crisis; they did not turn to NATO but to the United Nations. The United Nations still holds the responsibility. [DER SPIEGEL] In the UN Security Council, it is precisely the same states that have a say as in NATO. [Woerner] You forget that there are still other influential members. I only cite Russia and China. [DER SPIEGEL] But they are not the ones that made a solution to the conflict fail, but it was the different interests within West Europe and the United States. [Woerner] I would have to say a lot about that. [DER SPIEGEL] Please do. [Woerner] No, no. I do not want to pin the blame on one single state. To my deepest regret, their international community did not act in time and not energetically enough. We could have prevented a lot of misery. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you believe that after the disaster in Yugoslavia and the experiences of the UN mission in Somalia, the NATO states will once again manage to rustle up the political will for major blue helmet operations? [Woerner] I very much hope that they will learn the appropriate lessons. There is no lack of that. I also hope that the allies will not lose courage now to participate in well thought-out, well-planned operations for safeguarding peace under a unified command. Giving up would mean throwing out the baby with the bath water. [DER SPIEGEL] The Balkan war and Somalia have shown that nothing goes when the Americans do not want it. Does NATO dwindle to being the deputy sheriff of the United States? [Woerner] If that, then the sheriff. But joking apart: The United States is still playing -- thank God -- an important role. Without American leadership very little is happening in Europe -- at least up to now. On the other hand, in particular, our summit will give the Europeans the opportunity to strengthen their influence within the Atlantic alliance and, possibly, also outside. There is only the question whether they will find the strength and cohesiveness to seize this opportunity. [DER SPIEGEL] For a long time, the Americans did not want that. [Woerner] Correct, but today they are interested in having the burden eased by a Europe that is capable of action not only politically but also militarily. [DER SPIEGEL] Europe is still very far away from that. [Woerner] As a European I say: unfortunately. But things can get better. [DER SPIEGEL] The Americans want to foist another task on the alliance, namely stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, if necessary by force. [Woerner] Why do you say "foist"? Is it not in everyone's interest to counter these dangers in time? [DER SPIEGEL] We think that this is a problem that can be better solved by politicians and diplomats than by the military. [Woerner] Political and diplomatic efforts are certainly most important. However, you cannot ignore the fact that nuclear weapons and other mass destruction means continue to proliferate in this world -- despite all the political and diplomatic efforts. You cannot simply say that this is not also a military problem. This would mean closing one's eyes to reality. [DER SPIEGEL] Should NATO send troops when the Libyans or the Iranians develop nuclear weapons? [Woerner] Just think of what would have happened if one had not put a stop to Saddam Husayn. NATO must be permitted to think about what is going to happen if such weapons were to be used against its members and whether there is a financially feasible protection, for instance, against individual missile attacks. [DER SPIEGEL] Who, specifically, is threatening NATO at the moment? [Woerner] There are a number of states that are acquiring missiles and nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, or at least intend to do so. I do not want to list them individually here. Why not? Of course, I could name them, but I have no intention of doing so. [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Woerner, at a dinner in October, you told the NATO defense ministers that you had to live solely on rice and carrot juice. Are you now permitted to eat something more substantial again? [Woerner] May one not make a joke anymore? But if it reassures you: yes. However, I will still have to remain on a diet for some time. I feel okay with it and I think it helps. [DER SPIEGEL] There were efforts to replace you earlier because of your failing health. [Woerner] The opposite is true. There were fears that I would resign after the summit. However, I have been elected until 1996, and I intend to work my full term of office -- provided God preserves my health. [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Woerner, thank you for this interview.
