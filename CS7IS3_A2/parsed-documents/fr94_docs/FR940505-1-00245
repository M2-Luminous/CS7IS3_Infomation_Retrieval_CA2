FR940505-1-00245 FR940505-1-00012 Subpart GGG_California Federal Implementation Plans ยง52.2950 General FIP provisions. (a) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply. Administrator means the Administrator of EPA or his or her authorized representative. Capture efficiency means the weight per unit time of VOC entering a capture system and delivered to a control device divided by the weight per unit time of total VOC generated by a source of VOC, expressed as a percentage. Capture system means all equipment (including, but not limited to, hoods ducts, fans, booths, ovens, dryers, etc.) that contains, collects, and transports an air pollutant to a control device. Clean Air Act means 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. Control device means equipment (such as an incinerator or carbon adsorber) used to reduce, by destruction or removal, the amount of air pollutant(s) in an air stream prior to discharge to the ambient air. Control efficiency means the product of the capture efficiency times the destruction or removal efficiency of a control system, expressed as a percentage. Control system means a combination of one or more capture system(s) and control device(s) working in concert to reduce discharges of pollutants to the ambient air. Destruction or removal efficiency means the amount of VOC destroyed or removed by a control device expressed as a percentage of the total amount of VOC entering the device. EPA means the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Reports submitted to EPA shall be addressed care of U.S. EPA, Region IX (A&hyph;1), 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. Exempt compounds means any of the following compounds: methane; ethane; chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22); trifluoromethane (HFC-23); dichlorotrifluoroethane (HCFC-123); tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a); dichlorofluoroethane (HCFC-141b); chlorodifluoroethane (HCFC-142b); 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC-124); pentafluoroethane (HFC-125); methylene chloride; 1,1,1-trichloroethane (methyl chloroform); trichlorotrifluoroethane (CFC-113); dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12); trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11); dichlorotetrafluoroethane (CFC-114); chloropentafluoroethane (CFC-115); 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134); 1,1,1-trifluoroethane (HFC-143a); 1,1-difluoroethane (HFC-152a); or perfluorocarbon compounds which fall into these classes: Cyclic, branched, or linear, completely fluorinated alkanes; Cyclic, branched, or linear, completely fluorinated ethers with no unsaturations; Cyclic, branched, or linear, completely fluorinated tertiary amines with no unsaturations; or Sulfur-containing perfluorocarbons with no unsaturations and with sulfur bonds only to carbon and fluorine. Facility means all of the pollutant-emitting activities that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control). Grams of VOC per liter of coating, less water and less exempt compounds means the weight of VOC per combined volume of VOC and coating solids and can be calculated by the following equation: E:GRAPHICSEP05MY94.003 Where: W s =weight of volatile compounds in grams; W w =weight of water in grams; W es =weight of exempt compounds in grams; V m =volume of material in liters; V w =volume of water in liters; and
