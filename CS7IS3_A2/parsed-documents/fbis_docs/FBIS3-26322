Both sides will hold the fourth round of talks in late March this year in order to reach a consensus on the text of the agreement on the three issues of routine affairs. Following conclusion of the talks, Tang Shubei said that after four days of earnest discussions and common efforts, both sides had reached understandings on the following issues: 1. Both sides feel that they have reached a wide range of understanding on three issues of routine affairs, including the "repatriation of hijackers," the "repatriation of personnel who enter the other side's territory in violation of relevant regulations and other related questions," and the "handling of maritime disputes in the Taiwan Straits." Both sides agreed that this has laid a good foundation for the holding of the fourth round of talks and the signing of a written agreement. Both sides have agreed to hold a meeting at the vice secretary general level in Beijing in late March in order to reach a consensus on the draft agreement on the three issues. Jiao Renhe hoped that Tang Shubei and his ARATS counterparts will proceed to sign a formal agreement in Taipei on the basis of the draft agreement. 2. Both sides have also agreed that during the fourth working meeting to be held in late March between the two organizations, both sides will hold formal discussions on other topics included in the "Joint Agreement on the Wang-Gu [Ku] Talks." The topics of discussions will include the protection of intellectual property rights; joint operations against maritime smuggling, robbery, and other criminal activities in the Taiwan Straits; and economic, scientific, and technological exchanges and cooperation. 3. Entrusted by ARATS President Wang Daohan, Tang Shubei handed Wang's letter to Jiao Renhe on 1 February, inviting SEF Chairman Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu] to visit the mainland this year. Jiao Renhe said he would actively create conditions for the second meeting between Wang and Gu. The time and venue of the Wang-Gu meeting will be discussed at the March meeting. 4. The two sides also agreed to assist each other in the handling of the inherited property of some of the personnel who left the mainland for Taiwan [before 1949]. On the basis of reaching the above understandings, both sides will publish a news release tomorrow. Tang Shubei said after holding discussions, both sides have enhanced mutual understanding and promoted the formation of consensus. This fact shows once again that high-level face-to-face meetings are very important because it is conducive to increasing mutual trust and reaching mutual understanding. The current visit to Beijing by Jiao Renhe for discussions in this meeting was absolutely necessary. He said it is in this scene that President Wang Daohan has invited Chairman Gu Zhenfu to visit the mainland. After the conclusion of the talks, Jiao Renhe also said: The method and attitude adopted by both sides for discussing issues were conducive to their solution. After long hours of discussions, both sides have reached an understanding. They will proceed quickly to make arrangements for the next round of consultations on issues of routine affairs.
