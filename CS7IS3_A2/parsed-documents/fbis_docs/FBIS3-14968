At a press conference Monday, Brazauskas noted that the step was premature because there has been no legal evaluation of the actions undertaken by the organizers and the executors of those events. "Maybe they would have been acquitted in court -- that is a different question." Commenting on Lithuanian-Russian relations, Brazauskas said no changes have occurred lately. The president praised the Lithuanian government's initiative to find out why Russia does not send ratification documents to the agreement on the most favored nation trade status. [passage omitted] Brazauskas said he has not yet had a change to read the Russian draft agreement on military transit through Lithuania. The president said he expect the head of the working group for talks with the CIS to acquaint him with the document this week. In Brazauskas' words, misunderstandings over Russian military transit can be avoided by improving the currently existing order of transit. A system of permits must remain and must "function very precisely," he said. He said it is an "oddity" that having declared the need to demilitarize the Kaliningrad region as soon as possible, Lithuania suddenly suspends Russian transit through its territory. Brazauskas said Lithuania should create uniform transit rules for all countries in the future.
