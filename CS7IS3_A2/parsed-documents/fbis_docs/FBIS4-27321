Likewise, negotiations on automobiles and auto parts will open in Washington on 2 June, and those on government procurement of telecommunications equipment and medical equipment in Tokyo on 3 and 7 June, respectively. In the automobile negotiations, U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten will come to Japan in the week of 6 June, and hold vice ministerial-level talks with Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice minister of international trade and industry. Apart from the above three priority sectors, discussions on intellectual property rights, one of the other five sectors the United States wants to negotiate, will also begin in Washington around 10 June. After the recent informal meetings in Washington which resulted in the decision to resume the framework talks, working-level talks are being held to finalize concrete points of agreement for each sector. Of the three priority sectors, the issue of liberalizing insurance covering injury and illness, where U.S. companies have an advantage, is expected to be the focal issue in insurance sector negotiations. Negotiations on government procurement and automobiles and auto parts will concentrate on the issue of "objective criteria," on which no conclusion was reached in previous unofficial discussions. On intellectual property rights, copyright protection for computer software, and standardization of the patent systems in Japan and the United States are expected to be the topics of discussion.
