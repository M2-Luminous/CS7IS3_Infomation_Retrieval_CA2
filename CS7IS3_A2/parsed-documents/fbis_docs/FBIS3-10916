A Justice and Peace Commission statement pointed out that although it is encouraging that PRD leaders, as well as members who perpetrated the acts, made apologies and rejected violence, the Commission wishes to remind everyone that the ethical agreement that was signed seeks to avoid and prevent incidents of this type and reiterates to the signatories their responsibility to honor this agreement. The Justice and Peace Commission urged all political parties and all citizens to stop insults and attacks and to seek together the path leading to a consensus. Meanwhile, the PRD issued a communique accepting and respecting the Justice and Peace Commission's admonishment. It also called on the PRD Court of Honor and Discipline to apply the corresponding disciplinary measures to those members responsible for the attack. The PRD again prompted all its members to honor the commitments that the party made in the Santa Maria La Antigua Ethical-Electoral Pact.
