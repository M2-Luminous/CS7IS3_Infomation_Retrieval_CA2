FR940926-0-00011 FR940926-0-00004 Regulatory Analysis See the discussion in the Regulatory Flexibility Certification for the final regulatory analysis for this rule. Regulatory Flexibility Certification As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Based on the information available to the Commission at the time the proposed rule was published, the Commission previously certified that the proposed rule, if adopted in final form, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The information to support this was obtained from the Department of Energy's national laboratories and some industry sources. The Commission also invited any small entity that determined that it is likely to bear a disproportionate economic impact because of its size to notify the Commission. The Commission received four comments on the proposed rule from U.S. manufacturers that utilize radioactive sources containing Cf&hyph;252. Two of the companies qualify as small entities. Through their comments, the Commission became aware of the potentially detrimental economic impact that the revocation of the general licenses under which they were permitted to export Cf&hyph;252 would have. In view of these adverse comments, the NRC asked the companies to provide sales data on their exports to better reflect the implications of the new regulation. Based on a review of this summary data, the NRC, in cooperation with the companies, found that the impact of the rule changes on future sales will be much less than they had feared. First, new general licenses are established to permit the export of CF&hyph;252 sources in quantities up to 100 millicuries to most countries, even when they are shipped separately from the equipment in which they are to be used. This understanding, in itself, reduces much of their concerns. Further, other new general licenses are established to permit the export of unlimited quantities (except as limited by existing general licenses) of Cf&hyph;252 sources to NSG member countries. These new general licenses will allow the companies to export a significant quantity of their Cf&hyph;252 sources, including replenishment sources, without obtaining specific licenses. In addition, the companies may submit broad, long-term licenses to export their Cf&hyph;252 sources to their medical, scientific, industrial, and reactor-related customers in friendly, non-NSG countries, thereby eliminating case-by-case review. Such licenses could authorize exports of Cf&hyph;252 sources in sufficient quantities to cover startup sources and replenishment sources for Taiwan and South Korean power reactors for a number of years. The anticipated value of the exports under such licenses would range from $260,000 to over $2 million. Other such licenses could authorize exports of Cf&hyph;252 sources and replenishment sources to medical, industrial, and scientific customers, with total export values under such licenses ranging from $100,000 to over $500,000. The current fee would be $1300 for each specific license application submitted. These steps will greatly reduce the financial burden of the license application fees and the additional paperwork. The processing of an export license application of this type normally takes less than 45 days for final action. The annual burden imposed by the rule is estimated to average less than 3 hours for an exporter for each specific application. The staff expects less than ten new applications a year as a result of this rule. As an additional step to address the concerns of the exporters, the NRC consulted with the Department of Energy technical specialists to determine if any adjustments could be made to the proposed amendments for the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides, particularly Cf&hyph;252, to lessen the burden on U.S. exporters that export these materials to non-NSG member countries (exports to NSG countries would still be under general licenses). However, no acceptable adjustments were identified. We confirmed with U.S. nuclear weapons design experts that all of the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides, including Cf&hyph;252, could have some utility in nuclear explosive devices and that the 100 millicurie threshold for control was appropriate for the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides. There are no alternatives for achieving the stated objective. This rule is necessary to conform NRC's export controls to the international export guidelines of the NSG. The United States and other NSG member countries have formally agreed to control these materials because of their utility in nuclear explosive weapons. Thus, the regulation is required to satisfy an international obligation of the United States. The foregoing discussion constitutes the regulatory flexibility analysis and the regulatory analysis for this final rule. Backfit Analysis
