He said: "We are in the post-Cold War period and priorities have changed. For this reason Honduras, through its legitimate authorities, must point out to the United States the new areas on which we must work." These new areas, he said, are basically the struggle against drug trafficking and the control of illegal immigrants -- something that can be checked under the circumstances of free economies, employment opportunities, and democracies capable of guaranteeing the human rights of the Central American people. He noted that, personally speaking, he has always struggled to keep Honduras from becoming the backyard of a superpower. "We said this in the 1980's, and we say it now in the 1990's," he explained. For the first time, he affirmed, the interests of the United States and those of Honduras and the rest of Central America coincide because there is a new government in the North American country and it has a new foreign policy. The minister added that Honduras is now a mature nation ready to engage in a new relationship with the United States, adding that it is also ready to decide whether there is any sense in today's world for Palmerola Air Base to remain a platform for military operations at the regional level. "On the contrary," he said, "it is necessary to turn Palmerola into a regional center for fighting drug trafficking, something that would benefit the United States as well as our countries." The civilian utilization of the airstrip, which was designed for military purposes, cannot be ruled out. Minister Paz Aguilar said, "The only thing we would have to do to turn Palmerola into an airport in the country's central region is to invest in construction of a terminal." The minister said such changes must be based on new attitudes. "We have to discuss the problem of immigration, because the Honduran people have quotas restricting their entry into the United States, and Eastern European citizens are finding it easier than the Latin Americans to enter the United States." In conclusion, Minister Paz said there is no specific date yet for reviewing the treaties because the new phase of relations with the United States is just beginning.
