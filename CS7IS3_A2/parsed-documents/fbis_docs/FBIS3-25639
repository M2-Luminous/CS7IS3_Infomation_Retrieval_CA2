Colonel John White, British military officer in Mozambique, told LUSA that if the request is not successful within the next few days the team of two British instructors, who arrived in Mozambique in early February, will leave the country on 31 March. According to a British project for training 15,000 soldiers, who will be part of the first infantry battalions of the new unified army, the British military team would only follow the training of the first three battalions. Then training will be conducted by Mozambican instructors trained in Nyanga, Zimbabwe.
