FR941003-1-00098 FR941003-1-00006 (2) The Agency Official should collect available information, determine whether the undertaking involves a programmatic action, a land management area, or a specific project, and carry out further identification by making a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the area of potential effects, with reference to the nature of the undertaking, its likely effects, and the extent of available information on historic properties. (i) In order to provide a reliable basis for a ``reasonable and good faith effort'' to identify historic properties subject to effect, agencies should: (A) Consult with the SHPO, local governments, Indian tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, and other Native American groups and traditional cultural authorities, community organizations, academic institutions, and others with knowledge of or concerns with history, culture, historic preservation issues, and specific historic properties that may be affected; (B) Consult existing registers of historic properties, including but not limited to the National Register of Historic Places and State and local registers, reports of prior historic property surveys, and knowledgeable projections of historic property distributions; (C) Review other existing information on historic properties potentially affected by the undertaking, including any data concerning the likelihood that unidentified historic properties exist in the area of potential effect, and relevant background information sources on each areas history, prehistory, architecture, sociocultural characteristics, and cultural geography as appropriate. (D) Determine to what extent available information provides a reliable basis for decisionmaking consistent with Section 106 requirements and 36 CFR Part 800, and determine the need for additional investigations given the number of alternatives under consideration, the scale of the undertaking, the nature and severity of likely effects, the accessibility of each area of potential effect, and similar factors. (ii) Programmatic actions. For undertakings involving the potential effects of a program on historic properties and historic and cultural values, the identification of historic preservation issues and historic properties subject to effect should include agreement with other consulting parties on a process for ongoing identification and evaluation of properties. This may include administrative modifications to or adaptation of the standard portions of the Section 106 process contained in the Council's regulations in ยง800.8, and may categorize types of resources that will be subject to varying identification and evaluation methodologies. For example, a programmatic undertaking to maintain, modernize, selectively staff, and partially abandon fire observation towers in national forests nationwide could involve a long-term plan to use historic records to identify and evaluate historically significant types of towers against agreed-upon criteria. (iii) Management and maintenance areas. For undertakings involving the potential effects of land-use planning or maintenance practices for specific management units, such as a national park, national forest, military installation, Federal office complex, or similar discrete area, the identification of historic properties subject to effect should involve incorporation of the process into a standard operating procedure for a General Management Plan, Historic Preservation Plan, Land Use and Resource Management Plan, or similar comprehensive planning tool with an appropriate national, regional, or statewide context to evaluate the historic significance of identified resources. For example, ongoing management activities for a Bureau of Land Management district should include a continuing program of sample field survey, predictive modelling, and regional evaluation criteria, tied to other resource management needs and operating procedures for mineral exploration, range and timber management, road construction, fire control, and recreation programs. (Such a program is also required under Section 110 of NHPA). (iv) Project areas. For undertakings involving the potential effects of a specific action or series of actions such as new construction, a decision needs to be made whether the project is large-scale and complex, or small-scale and less complex.
