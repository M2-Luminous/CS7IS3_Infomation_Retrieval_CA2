Joint-stock corporations and corporations with limited liability are the most active in this area. For the most part, however, these investments are in the tertiary sphere, the acquisition of production capacities is sporadic. Two-thirds of the investments are of a material character. Property participation by Czech foreign exchange nationals abroad--in other words, direct investments from the Czech Republic--amounted to $45.2 million for 1993, according to preliminary data, according to what the director of the Foreign Exchange Department of the Czech National Bank, Jiri Zimola, told our newspaper. According to him, Czech enterprises are substantially more active in this regard in comparison to previous years. In 1992, approximately $28 million was invested abroad, and, in 1991, investments abroad amounted to only $3 million. The period 1992 and part of 1993 was a preparatory one for privatization. This is also reflected in the lower degree of interest on the part of state enterprises in activities abroad, the director noted. In 1993, more than 90 percent of the investments were accounted for by stock corporations and corporations with limited liability. The share of state enterprises in this endeavor was about 1 percent. Last year, the largest investments abroad were made, for example, by Skoda Mlada Boleslav (in Great Britain), the Prachovice Cement and Lime Kilns (Netherlands), Invest Plzen (Russia), Strojimport (Austria), CSKD Intrans (Slovakia), the Maritime Navigation Enterprise (Malta), and the Stone Industry of Brno (Croatia). Last year, the largest investments were made in Malta, where a maritime freighter was purchased and, at the same time, registered. Other than that, the top investments were made in Russia, Slovakia, and Great Britain. The absolute majority of investments are aimed at business and services because enterprises are attempting to use them in support of their exports, according to J. Zimola. Meanwhile, the acquisition of production capacities is more isolated for the time being. One of the few examples of this type of investment can be the Vitkovice Ironworks investment in Algeria, the realization of which is in the negotiation phase for the time being. Because investments in the tertiary sphere are financially relatively undemanding, the overall value of direct investments is not overly great, the director added. In relationship to the volume of foreign exchange flowing into the Czech Republic, these investments represent substantially only a negligible amount. However, the interest in production investments, and, thus, the overall volume of direct investments, should grow together with the progress made in the privatization of large industrial enterprises, he added. According to the foreign exchange law, all investment activities abroad are subject to foreign exchange permission issued by the Czech National Bank, following negotiations with the Ministries of Finance, Industry, and Commerce. Primarily, consideration is given to project investment returns that, when dealing with investments in the tertiary sphere, are currently running at about two to three years; in the case of production investments, returns are running at four to five years. The Czech National Bank is also interested in the form of the investments. Last year, only a small portion (22.9 percent) was realized financially. Some 63 percent of the investments were material in character (primarily by providing mechanical equipment). The remainder involves principally the capitalization of accounts receivable.
