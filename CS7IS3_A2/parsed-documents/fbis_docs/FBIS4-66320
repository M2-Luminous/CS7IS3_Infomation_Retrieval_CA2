This breakthrough in domestic research on nuclear-pumped lasers also realized a thermal neutron injection rate of 6 x 10[.sup]14[/] n/cm[.sup]2[/]-s after polyethylene moderation. Based on the moderator structure, we designed an internal gas-filled amplifier tube assembly with the following pressure proportional mix: [.sup]3[/]He:Ar:Xe = 3.47 x 10[.sup]4[/]:3.47 x 10[.sup]4[/]:2.67 x 10[.sup]2[/] (Pa); tube length is 600mm and diameter is 34mm. With about 1.4 x 10[.sup]16[/] fissions per pulse, using a plano-concave cavity stabilizer, we did a total of eight shots in the experiment and the results of all eight firings are essentially in agreement. The observed waveform is shown below in Figure 2 [Fig. 1, not reproduced, shows a photograph of the experimental apparatus]. Figure 2: Laser Waveform
