As is the tradition, the new year is a time when resolutions are made and relatives and friends extend their best wishes to one another. President Pascal Lissouba, who is no exception to the rule, addressed the nation on the evening of 31 December. In his message, the head of state outlined measures that would bring about peace, which our country badly needs for its development. Here is what President Pascal Lissouba said: [Begin Lissouba recording] The first challenge is to ensure a spiritual and moral awakening through systematic education of our people, especially our children. The second challenge is to rebuild the country and to rebuild towns that were destroyed or ruined by blind and savage violence. The third challenge is to make people understand, support, and consolidate the process toward peace and reconciliation among communities which have been torn apart. It is only when we are ready to accept and assume the contents of these challenges that a new political initiative will be proposed to our people in consultation with the leading political groups so that social peace will be truly consolidated. The tragic events which occurred in the country are sufficient proof that the Congolese political class has not yet understood the first thing about democratic values, which still remains [words indistinct]. If it took Europe 100 years to achieve that, Africa should achieve these democratic values within just a few years. [end recording] President Lissouba also had a message for the youth, especially the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development [MCDDI] and the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy [UPADS] activists. He called on them to demonstrate the fact that they are the reflection of Congo and its future. [Begin Lissouba recording] I turn to our political party activists, and more especially to you, youth of MCDDI and UPADS. You are all children of Congo, and I owe it to you all, in my triple capacity as a father, a man of science, and a statesman, the heavy responsibility to see to your welfare, your education, and your training. It is necessary that your parents -- and it should also be the same for your various parties -- make this a duty, a privilege, and even an essential priority. Indeed, Congo as a whole is suffering. It is suffering from the image you are creating for it; it is worried about your future. I therefore call on you, through your political leaders, to pay heed to (?what we propose), to cease-fire, show discipline, and to put an end to provocation, which leads to rebellion and acts as an excuse for various reprisals. It is a necessary condition that will enable your political leaders to present their political problems and peacefully find the most favorable solutions for the youth of this country. I also call on the national mediators, the political parties, and the general staff of the Congolese Armed Forces, the joint staff of the security forces to agree on the conditions, the modalities, and programs for training, organizing, educating, and assessing all our unemployed youth who interrupted their studies or were illegally recruited as private militiamen. It is only under these conditions that the people who have been traumatized by so much atrocity can be reassured. This must necessarily be accompanied by the streamlining of the Armed Forces, and the restoration of confidence and discipline within the Army. There should also be more solidarity between the Congolese Armed Forces, the gendarmerie, and public security agencies. The reorganization of the Armed Forces [words indistinct]. [end recording]
