Between January and August, imports totaled $6.435 billion, an increase of 55.7 percent over the same period of the previous year. According to the director of the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), Rodolfo Uribe, this growth rate means that external purchases are stabilizing, especially considering that in the first half of the year, the increase was 77.9 percent. In the first eight months of the year, Colombia's exports totaled $4.662 billion, 2.5 percent higher than the figure for the same period in 1992. This means that imports were $1.773 billion higher than exports, resulting in a deficit in the balance of trade. Last year, the shortfall was just $414 million. In other words, in a year, the trade deficit (spending on imports exceeding earnings from exports) quadrupled. The trade gap can be explained by the increase in domestic demand for foreign goods, the recession in developed countries, the decline in international prices for Colombia's main exports, and the coffee crisis. If the government's predictions hold true, by the end of 1993 the trade deficit should fall to $1.297 billion. In other words, the country will have to curb the rate of imports even further and add more dynamism to exports. The government expects external sales to rise by 5.6 percent by the end of the year, while imports are slated to grow by "only" 48.5 percent. By Sector When imports are broken down by sector, it can be seen that the greatest increase is in capital goods and construction materials. Foreign purchases in this sector totaled $2.508 billion, a jump of 91.20 percent over the figure for the first eight months of 1992. The greatest dynamism can be seen in construction materials, with a growth of 110 percent. Capital goods for industry rose 53 percent, to a total of $1.452 billion. Colombians bought foreign consumer goods amounting to $1.125 billion, an increase of 70.69 percent over the previous period. Colombia's main supplier continues to be the United States, whence 34 percent of its imports came during the period in question. Purchases made in the United States were less dynamic, however, than those made in Japan and Venezuela, Colombia's two other major partners. Whereas U.S. imports rose by 47.7 percent, imports from Japan and Venezuela doubled. Customs revenues (from tariffs and the value-added tax) doubled as of August, climbing from 441.406 billion pesos to 937.956 billion pesos. The greater increase, 95 percent, was seen in value-added tax (IVA) collections. The DANE explained that the import figures are subject to change as a result of corrections or revisions in payments made by the Directorate of National Taxes and Customs (DIAN).
