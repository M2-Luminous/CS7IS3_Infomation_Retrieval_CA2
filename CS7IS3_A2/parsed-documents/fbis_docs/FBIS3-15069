Answering the wish by the Russian president, Karadzic said that during the preparation for the meeting Bosnian Serbs will show a maximum of contructiveness, with due account of the quality criteria for the territorial delineation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic voiced gratitude for the decisive actions of the Russian president for the political settlement of the crisis around Sarajevo. Kozyrev and Karadzic have said that arrival of a Russian peace- keeping contingent in Sarajevo, the strict performance of its duty as part of the UN Protection Force are a weighty and stabilizing contribution creating prerequisites for further progress in normalising the situation in the city and around it. Karadzic said that the Bosnian Serbs agree to the opening of an airport in the city of Tuzla that will welcome deliveries of humanitarian cargoes. Bosnian Serbs proceed from the fact that Russian observers will take an active part in the control over the non-military use of the airport. This goes in line with the desire of the envoy of the UN Secretary General on the former Yugoslavia. For its part, the Russian side said about preparedness to send its observers to Tuzla. [sentence as received] During the discussion of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Russian side pointed to the need to show the maximal restraint and cooperation with the UN Protection Force. This was welcomed by Karadzic and other leaders of the Bosnian Serbs. "NATO ACTION NO ACCIDENT," RUSSIAN DEFENSE OFFICIAL SAYS The shooting down of four, presumably Serbian, planes by NATO air force was "no accident," a senior official in the Russian Defense Ministry told Interfax. He said that "the Americans who have long since sided with the Muslims always wanted to put pressure to bear on Bosnian Serbs. The UN 'no-flight zone' resolution was passed more than a year ago but never applied until now even though it had been repeatedly violated by Bosnian Serbs, Muslims and Croatians." The official said that the NATO action in which USAF jets were involved was directed less against Bosnian Serbs than against Russia which had scored significant successes "along the Yugoslav line." He believed that "the noise over the Ames' case was consistent with the action in Bosnia. Americans do whatever they want and behave as if they won the cold war." On the other hand, he did not want to make the U.S. more guilty than it was. "There was no evil design in letting the planes drop their bombs before shooting them down. In Bosnia-Herzegovina where the positions of the warring parties tend to 'intertwine' it takes just minutes from the take off to the start of bombing," he said.
