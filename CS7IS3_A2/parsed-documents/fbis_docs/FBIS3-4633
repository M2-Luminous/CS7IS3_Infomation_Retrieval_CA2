Will the PPP put forward someone new? Who will replace Buya Ismail and will he be capable of matching the agility shown by Harmoko and Megawati? Although it is not yet clear what political tricks Harmoko and Megawati will put into action, we can make some quick guesses. Harmoko will probably raise the issue of poverty, which the Sixth Development Cabinet has made a priority. There is some evidence that this problem hurt GOLKAR in the eyes of the people in the last general election because the PDI took over the notion of the "little people," which is identical to poverty. On the other hand, Megawati might stir up the problem of democratization and human rights and also indirectly resurrect the romantic notion of her deceased father's greatness and advance the fervor of the "little people," something already brought up by Soerjadi. Although the 1997 general elections are still four years away, they feel closer because conjecture is that the "festival of democracy" at the end of this century will be very intense. All that's left is the PPP. Will it grasp the best opportunities in this arena of struggle or will it allow the party to become smaller, trapped as it is between GOLKAR and the PDI? It is clear that the appearance of Megawati on the scene is an indication that the current of political democratization is growing stronger and that the undercurrent can no longer be dictated to according to the will of the superstructure. The undercurrent is showing that it is winning and this, we can be certain, will burst out everywhere. We can be sure that the congresses to be held by the NU [Moslem Scholars Association] and by the PPP in 1994, for example, will be important political events. Various political observers have recently pointed out that 1994 will be a difficult year politically; this cannot be separated from those two events. At the same time, conjecture is that demonstrations on human rights, democratization, or cases of that kind will also continue to flare up. Conjecture is that the NU congress will be very lively because up to now there have not been any candidates for the position held by Gus Dur (Abdurahman Wahid -- editor) who can equal the quality of his leadership. Although Gus Dur stated some time ago that he was not willing to be a candidate for the general chairmanship of the PB [Executive Committee] of the NU, the majority of NU's rank and file, especially the younger generation, still hopes that he will be prepared to lead them again. Things will be very lively if Gus Dur is willing to be put up again as a candidate on grounds that he is receiving strong support from the undercurrent, even if the superstructure seems less than willing to accept him. So it is thought that there will be a political clash. The problem is: Whether that clash will be as strong as the one in the PDI or not depends on how the government views it, especially as far as the interests of GOLKAR's political hegemony are concerned. At the same time, projections are that the PPP congress will be even more intense because the strong current of democratization which is running through it will force the NU to reclaim its position in the PPP after having been dominated for such a long time by the MI [Indonesian Muslims]. It is quite possible that these two factions, which have been jockeying for position in the PPP for such a long time, are now setting up strategies for the upcoming congress. The NU is busy trying to figure out how to reclaim its dominance and the MI will make every effort to defend its position. Conjecture is that the clash will be intense and the slogan "fusion is now complete," promoted up to now by members of the PPP, will be tested again. The NU will claim its position as the PPP's largest shareholder. Political gamesmanship is a matter of the battle for and the distribution of power. Having learned from the Megawati case, the NU will probably not want to accept a candidate for its leadership who is just handed to it by the bureaucracy, i.e., by the MI faction, as has been done up to now. But this all depends on the level of NU's political independence within the PPP. Has it gotten to the point where it can think strategically in that way or can it still be easily manipulated, as it has in the past? NU's desire to reclaim its position in the PPP is part of the nervousness felt by NU members at seeing the development of GOLKAR and of the PDI under the respective leadership of Harmoko and of Megawati. Only if the NU wholly returns to the PPP will the party be able to rise again, as when it was triumphant in the 1977 and 1982 general elections. As is well known, the PPP has gone downhill since the 1987 general elections, after the NU adopted the firm policy of no longer supporting the PPP. In fact, in the 1987 general elections NU figures stood shoulder to shoulder with each other to deflate the PPP's figures. This just shows that without the NU the PPP is actually just a toothless tiger, there is nothing in it. The NU adopted a firm policy of no longer supporting the PPP because of the political actions of Naro, who is from the MI faction, towards NU figures within the PPP. It seems easy to ignore the fact that Naro was a government man who was infiltrated into the PPP to deflate that party's figures so as to guarantee GOLKAR's continued political hegemony as the "single majority party". It is quite clear that Naro's political maneuvers were intended to push the NU somewhat out of the PPP and over into GOLKAR. This is quite natural because GOLKAR needs strong roots and GOLKAR knows that no group has stronger underground roots than the NU. Isn't GOLKAR just a "banyan tree"--and note that this is NU's symbol--which, no matter how big it is, cannot be sturdy without fertile "soil"? Before it merged with the PPP, the general elections of 1955 and of 1971 proved that the NU was strong. In the 1955 general election, for example, the NU took third place with 45 seats, behind the PNI [Indonesian Nationalist Party] and Masyumi. In the 1971 general election the strong political forces which had been victorious during Bung Karno's time, such as the PNI and Masyumi (which became Parmusi [Indonesian Moslem Party]/MI), became weaker, except for the NU, which still held its own. Because of its sturdy roots, NU's power could not be shaken even though it was hit by various political crises. On grounds of a program of political restructuring, the NU was forced to merge with the PPP together with other small Islamic political parties. It must be admitted that when the PPP was created, the NU was the dominant faction compared with the other parties. It is not an exaggeration to say that the keys to the PPP's strategic politics at that time were held by charismatic NU figures. The NU was unable to face up to this program and was forced to merge into the PPP. Even though it was predicted from the start that the party would be dogged by internal conflicts, it turned out that the NU was able to smooth them over in order to face an even greater battle: winning the general election. But when Naro entered the picture, NU politicians could no longer continue to tolerate them. The firm policy of not supporting a particular political party--the PPP--allowed NU members to make their own political decisions. In the 1987 general elections GOLKAR's spectacular rise was actually closely connected to the contributions made by NU rank and file, most of whom changed their political choice from the PPP to GOLKAR. NU politicians struggled to support GOLKAR in hopes that the NU, the largest mass organization in the country, would get a sufficient political reward. But it seems that NU's strong support of GOLKAR in the 1987 general elections was not welcomed in any significant way. It is clear that temporary use was made of the NU in the interests of the 1987 general elections and that afterwards it was disposed of again. Ironically, many NU figures were willing to be manipulated in that way when they sacrificed the support of the rank and file who made a large contribution to GOLKAR's victory. In turn, the break in GOLKAR-NU relations could no longer be avoided and it seems that the NU no longer fully supported GOLKAR in the 1992 general elections, which resulted in a drop in the number of votes for that party, especially in the NU's base, for example in East Java. Conjecture is that the strained relationship between GOLKAR and the NU will mean that NU politicians, for example younger figures such as Slamet Effendy Yusuf, will not be among GOLKAR's leaders in the period 1993 to 1998. If NU politicians are not among GOLKAR's leaders in the period 1993 to 1998, conjectures are that the relationship between the NU and GOLKAR will become even worse. That is why it is possible that the NU's rank and file will return in droves to the PPP at the next general election. It is clear that at the 1994 PPP congress the NU, as the largest shareholder, will reclaim its position at the top of the party leadership. [passage omitted]
