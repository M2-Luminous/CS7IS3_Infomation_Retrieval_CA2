At a meeting in Siegen, the Bundestag group's working group on defense accepted Defense Minister Volker Ruehe's concept without any major changes. It provides for cutting Bundeswehr troops from 370,000 to 340,000 and for reducing compulsory military service from 12 to 10 months. Ruehe will have to win the approval of the CDU/CSU Bundestag group today. On Monday [25 April], Free Democratic Party [FDP] Chairman Klaus Kinkel seemed once again to be uncertain about whether to agree to the troop reductions. CDU/CSU Defense Policy Spokesman Paul Breuer said after the meeting on Monday that the Bundestag group experts consider a 10-month military service in the main defense forces possible. This is the part of the troops used for national defense. Anyone who voluntarily does his service in the crisis-reaction forces, must, however, serve for 12 months. The working group says that the name "Soldier for Months (SaM)," describing soldiers serving in the crisis-reaction forces, has been dropped in favor of "W-12." This clearly shows that the crisis-reaction forces used for missions abroad are committed to society by their compulsory military service. The 10-month military service does, however, not imply a shorter alternative service, because those doing military service do not get compensatory time off and face higher demands. The working group's resolution document also says that the Bundeswehr must remain in a position to be extended to 370,000 troops in the event of an emergency. The necessary structures must be maintained. But still, some of the sites could be closed down, Breuer said. But this cannot be discussed before the Defense Ministry's concept has been completed. The working group demanded that profits be achieved through rationalizations and cuts, stay in the defense budget. The deputies also said that the number of civilian Bundeswehr employees and their organization must be balanced against the military part of the Bundeswehr. This means that of the existing 151,000 civilian staff, 20,000 could be laid off. Speaking after his party's presidium meeting on Monday, FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel said a strength of 370,000 troops remains desirable, particularly for foreign-policy reasons. But he said he could also see the bottlenecks in the Bundeswehr budget. The FDP has never been opposed to reducing the Bundeswehr strength. Yet, alternatives have to be considered first. Kinkel and FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer think that Ruehe's concept leaves many questions unanswered. The CDU/CSU group wants to discuss Ruehe's plans today. Resistance is expected from several deputies. Breuer said that the meeting will once again bring "sweat to Ruehe's brow."
