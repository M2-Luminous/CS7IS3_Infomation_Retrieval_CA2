The Russian Federation Defense Ministry leadership and leading aviation firms are examining the most diverse ways out of the situation which has taken shape. One way could be the attraction of nonbudget funds to finance promising scientific research and experimental design developments, authorized by the government's 9 March 1994 decree. To this end the experimental machine building plant named for Myasishchev, the specialized "Russkoye oruzhiye" corporation, the Smolensk aircraft plant, and the "Aviainvest" joint stock company have concluded an agreement on cooperation and joint activity and the creation of a new corporate body -- the "Myasishchev-Avia' closed-type joint-stock company. The main aims of the "Myasishchev-Avia" joint-stock company will be the development, production, sale, and servicing, both on the domestic and the foreign market, of promising developments of the Myasishchev experimental machine building plant. It is a case of the "Geofizika" high-altitude aircraft designed for optical and radar monitoring of the earth's surface and the monitoring of the environment's ecological situation, the "Gzhel" light multipurpose freight and passenger aircraft (up to 500 kg of payload or up to six passengers), the joint Russian-Indian project for the "Duet" passenger liner for medium-distance routes, the M-112 freight and passenger aircraft, and other programs. The joint-stock company which is being created is viewed as the prototype for a financial-industrial group in the field of planning, producing, and selling aircraft including on the foreign market. Using both state and nonbudget funds. In implementing this project the Myasishchev experimental machine building plant will monitor the development of promising competitive models of aircraft, the "Russkoye oruzhiye" specialized corporation will monitor the development of the financial strategy for the development of the "Myasishchev-Avia" joint-stock company, the attraction of nonbudget funds, and marketing, the Smolensk aircraft plant will monitor the production of experimental models of aircraft developed under the leadership of the "Myasishchev-Avia" joint-stock company and their subsequent series production, and the "Aviainvest" joint-stock company will monitor collaboration with the air force and quality control through the institute of military representatives.
