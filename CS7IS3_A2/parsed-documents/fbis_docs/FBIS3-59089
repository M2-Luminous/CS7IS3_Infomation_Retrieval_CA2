[Pangalos] I have to say at first that Greece is not administering a hostile policy against Turkey and especially not against the Turkish people. We are only issuing criticisms concerning the human rights issue. I have to note that our critical statements do not outdo similar statements made by several of my European colleagues, the international press, or the Turkish media. [Birand] You insist on having human rights respected in Turkey while the human rights of Turks in Western Thrace are being violated. This creates a very important concern for Ankara. [Pangalos] The rights of Muslims in Western Thrace are even greater than what is granted to them by international agreements. [Birand] What strikes us as most disturbing and worth noting is that, after a few quiet years, a drastic change occurred in Greek policy after you joined the government. A hostile policy toward Turkey began, nonexistent during the government headed by Konstandinos Mitsotakis. [Pangalos] The government of Mr. Mitsotakis was a right-winged government and did not give too much importance to the human rights issue. We are a left-winged government and we use the same criteria for both Turkey and Greece when judging human rights issues. I would like to note that also in Greece all is not well. [Birand] The Cyprus issue is the major concern of the Papandreou government and they definitely want to reach a solution during their term. For this reason the first thing they did when coming to power was to include south Cyprus into the Greek defense system. According to the agreement signed by Greece and south Cyprus, Greece took the responsibility of south Cyprus' air and naval defense. This agreement was negatively received by the Turkish government in Ankara. Apart from this, Greece started drilling oil around the Thasos island which created suspicions regarding the intentions of the Papandreou regime since the area drilled was close to the international water agreement region -- still under discussion -- although inside the borders of Greece. [Pangalos] You have 40,000 soldiers in Cyprus as well as heavy tanks and your planes are continually flying over the Turkish side. In spite of all this, the small measures we take disturb you. The fact that you are alluding to a Greek threat, although our planes are unable to reach Cyprus, only shows that Turkey has adverse intentions. [Birand] Turkey and the Turkish people believe that the Greeks and the Greek Cypriots are not interested in solving the Cyprus issue. [Pangalos] Why should we not want to reach a solution regarding the Cyprus issue? [Birand] We think that it is easier for Greece to put down Turkey in the international arena. [Pangalos] We have lost the war in 1974. We have a very big military force and we are proud of it. Yet Turkey has to make a choice, either it will be a country that values conquests -- as in the past -- or it will be a country that values its development and relations with other European countries. These two values cannot coexist. Turkey has to decide which way to choose, either it will be a military power or it will give importance to development. Nobody can sweep the issue of Cyprus under the carpet. The problem exists and a solution has to be reached. [Birand] Your notion of a solution is to give the Turkish Cypriots the rights granted to a minority population and consequently close the issue. Your approach does not include recognizing the equal rights of the Turkish Cypriots. [Pangalos] What is the meaning of political equality? Is political equality giving 50 percent of the political power to 10 percent of the Cyprus population and the remaining 50 percent of the political power to 80 percent of the Cyprus' population? Is this distribution democratic? This is not called democracy but it is called Turkish oligarchy. How will you react if 18 percent of the Turkish population has half of the assembly seats? This is impossible. [Birand] The problem is obvious. If we go back to the Aegean, we see that we are faced with a situation that was nonexistent during the Mitsotakis period. You started oil exploring around Thasos island. [Pangalos] Listen, I do not want to go into details with you about something that is being done within our territorial waters. Even the fact that you ask me this question, the fact that your press and politicians are discussing this issue, shows that you have not yet become part of the international world. [Birand] That is how the crisis of 1987 erupted. [Pangalos] We did not start it. Look, even this discussion is ridiculous. All this should be settled in line with international rules. If there is a settlement, fine. If there is not, then the question must be taken to the International Court of Justice in the Hague and settled there. [Birand] Another development which disturbs Turkey is Greece's positive attitude toward the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. While the PKK is being banned in several European countries, Athens is signaling that it will grant extensive freedoms to that organization. PKK militants can demonstrate in Athens and be active as political refugees. Greek parliamentarians frequently show their solidarity with the PKK. This situation greatly disturbs Turkey. Turkey describes Athens' attitude toward this most sensitive issue as a show of hostility. [Pangalos] The PKK does not base itself in Greece. We do not allow any political activity against Turkey. There are certain Kurds here. They have the status of political refugees as recognized by the United Nations. These people stage demonstrations. They have the right. Everybody has the right to demonstrate in the city. If they create incidents, they are arrested. It happened recently. Some of them hurled stones. They were caught, prosecuted and punished. [Birand] Is the PKK a terrorist organization or not? [Pangalos] Listen, there is a people living in southeastern Turkey. They want their identities to be recognized. If you can resolve this, the problem of terrorism will automatically be resolved. If, after that, persons emerge trying to use terrorist methods, they will be isolated in the community. [Birand] It is not that simple. They resort to extreme violence. Everybody knows that. While this happens, we turn to Athens and we see that the PKK is there. [Pangalos] No, the PKK has no official bureau here. You cannot find the PKK here. They cannot carry out any activities. There are Kurds here. Their representatives talk to the press on behalf of the Kurds, not on behalf of the PKK. Do not forget that we are not a police state. We cannot drag Kurds from the street, torture them, and interrogate them to find out if they are PKK members or not. [Birand] Another point that disturbs Turkey is the fact that Greece places obstacles in the relations between Turkey and the European Union [EU]. Under the pretext of the Cyprus problem, Greece tries very hard to prevent the EU from extending even a cent to Turkey. In fact, Greece has turned into a clear cut policy its determination not to have the 12 EU countries open the door for Turkey. The key to that door is claimed to be Cyprus. [Pangalos] Yes, we have a political condition. Maybe it was we who proposed it, but the 12 accepted it, and it became a EU resolution. Now, it is impossible for the other countries to say that Turkey has been in Cyprus for a long time, that it does not want to withdraw, and that it should be allowed to stay. These other countries cannot come and tell us to lift our veto. That cannot happen now.
