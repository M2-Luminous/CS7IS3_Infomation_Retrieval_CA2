According to former vice-prime minister for economic reforms, "two currency exchange rates are restraining exports and those industries which depend on imports." As is known, as of today, according to Ukraine's national bank currency exchange rates, the U.S. dollar is equivalent to 16,500 karbovanets, but the "black market" rate is over 45,000. "As a result, the national bank has sold only $75 million during March, less than a half of what was sold before the introduction of the fixed exchange rate," Viktor Pinzenik said. According to the deputy, currently exchange offices are selling as much currency as the whole system of the national bank. Viktor Pinzenik told deputies that as a result of such a ratio of internal and world prices, exports have become unprofitable. He proposed to change the currency regulation act. The parliamentary session intends to consider the currency question this week. Deputies plan to hear a government report on social and economic state in the country and a report on this issue prepared by the Supreme Soviet chairman. The election of Ukraine's prime minister will constitute a problem. The majority of deputies think that it is inexpedient to change the head of the government before presidential elections.
