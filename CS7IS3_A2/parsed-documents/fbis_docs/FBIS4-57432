Ranking National Police chiefs will hold a Commanders Council today, to study the government measures, which have sparked a negative response in the police ranks. "How are we going to be subordinate to criminals?" asked a source close to the institution. Sergio Caramagna Valinotti, chief of the Support and Verification Commission (CIAV-OAS), who was present at the meeting between the ministers and the "recontra" leaders, reported they had also agreed to allow 11 "recontra" chieftains to reenter the Walter Mendoza Academy next Friday. The chieftains had abandoned the academy "to protest" the dismissal of "Cascabel" and "Pajarillo" from the police forces. Murderers and Criminals [subhead] According to the Information and Study Office, the National Police expelled the recontras because they were criminals and had deserted the police ranks. Furthermore, it denied that those men would return as "the functions of policeman and criminal do not coincide." According to police files, the men under "Cascabel" set fire to two motorcycles and are the ones who murdered Captain Miguel Guido Quiroz, First Lieutenant Jose Agurcia Garcia, and soldiers Antonio Castillo Perez and Andres Zuniga, among other crimes. Mendieta explained that the recontras who will reenter the forces will work at police stations in the northern part of the country and said it had been a "very satisfactory" meeting as it showed how Nicaragua had advanced to solve problems "peacefully and through dialogue." The meeting was not attended by any National Police representative. The meeting was held on the fifth floor of the Silvio Mayorga Building at 1100 yesterday morning. The recontras used Minister Mendieta's private elevator to get to the meeting. Present at the meeting were Deputy Government Ministers Frank Cesar and Joaquin Lovo; Jose Angel Talavera, alias "Chacal," and his brother Esteban; and Mateo Guerrero, president of the Nicaraguan Human Rights Association (ANPDH). The members of the FN-3-80 [3-80 Northern Front] traveled to Managua expressly to meet with government officials after the recontras refused to talk with El Jicaro Police Chief Subcommander Marcos Ruiz last Sunday, to find a solution to the conflict. Military sources have confirmed that the seizing of Quilali had been peaceful and that the rebels had not used weapons. The recontras held the town's main entry and exit points and the offices of Telcor, the municipality, the Agricultural and Livestock Ministry, and Ecodepa [expansion not known].
