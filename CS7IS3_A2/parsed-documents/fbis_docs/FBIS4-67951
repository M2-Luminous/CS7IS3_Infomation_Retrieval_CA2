The source said that IAEA plans to send five inspectors to North Korea and asked Pyongyang to issue visas to three inspectors in addition to the two who had already obtained visas. If things go on smoothly, the five IAEA inspectors would leave Vienna where the IAEA Secretariat is located on April 30 and fly into Pyongyang via Beijing on May 2 or 3. ``IAEA's position is that sample of after-use fuel should be taken without fail at the time of the change of fuel bars,'' the source said. ``I understand that IAEA chose to send inspectors on the condition of the later discussion of sample taking inasmuch as the deadline for fuel rod change is imminent.'' The five IAEA inspectors will not only witness the change of fuel bars but will also conduct routine checks such as the change of films and battery of surveillance camera, the source said. A North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said on April 27 they would accept seven items out of the eight-point inspection demanded by IAEA with the sole exception of sample taking. Besides, North Korea expressed the willingness to place after-use fuel rods under IAEA surveillance until sample is taken under an agreement they would reach with IAEA.
