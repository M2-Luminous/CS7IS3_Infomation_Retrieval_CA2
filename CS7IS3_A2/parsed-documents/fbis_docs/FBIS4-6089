Earlier last week Watanabe, leader of the third largest power bloc in the LDP, disclosed his readiness to run for a Diet premiership election to pick the successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Watanabe told reporters Sunday, "I will give up my party membership as a matter of course." On Friday LDP President Yohei Kono met Watanabe in a bid to ask Watanabe not to leave the party. Watanabe, however, expressed his readiness to form a new alliance with Shinseito and Komeito, the two key parties in the governing coalition, in order to "surmount the crises now confronting this country." The second round of Kono-Watanabe talks was scheduled for Monday.
