"We have already retrieved a quantity of arms, some of which do not exist in the regular Army's arsenal, which were found in the possession of opposition activists," Colonel Jean-Marie Guembo told the press, without however specifying the number or type of weapons retrieved. "Our task is progressing satisfactorily," he stated, stressing that the role of the mediation force is "to occupy the frontlines in order to definitively stop the violence." According to the officer, peace" has gradually become a reality in the capital since political leaders, who are mostly responsible for the violence, pledged to stop supporting the fighters politically and militarily." Established on 30 January after a cease-fire agreement between deputies of the presidential group and the opposition, the mediation force, which is 400-strong, was deployed on 18 February in Brazzaville's southern districts, which have suffered most from the fighting between the two opposing militias that left several hundreds dead between June 1993 and last January. These soldiers are also charged with preparing the necessary security conditions for the return of tens of thousands of people who fled the southern districts during the fighting.
