Putting forward the Georgian plan to resolve these problems, Major General Vladimir Chikovani, commander of the republic's Internal Troops and member of the Georgian delegation at the Geneva talks, remarked in conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent that the Russian side is taking a constructive stance in Geneva and showing its committment to bringing peace to Abkhazia and resolving the fate of hundreds of thousands of civilians forcibly expelled from their native lands. The Georgian plan also met with the support of UN representatives at these talks. The main thrust of the Georgian plan, the general said, is the need to monitor the withdrawal of all armed formations with their weapons and combat equipment from all the lines of active confrontation in the conflict zone and from all the regions of Abkhazia to which it is planned to return the refugees. The Georgian plan is based exclusively on the principles and provisions of the quadrilateral agreements, and stems from the logic of the nonresumption of military operations and the termination of the conflict.
