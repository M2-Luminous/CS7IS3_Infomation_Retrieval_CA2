Although the package calls for government expenditures of 1.6 trillion lire for 1994 and 1.3 trillion lire each for 1995 and 1996, Giugni said that for the present, he can only guarantee the funds for 1994. However, according to an article in LA REPUBBLICA, the labor unions are "lukewarm" to the government's measures. Natale Forlani, secretary of the Italian Confederation of Trade Unions (CISL), said that although they contribute to solving some of the unemployment problems, the measures are far from meeting the need to increase investment and provide adequate income to workers affected by the industrial crisis. The LA REPUBBLICA article details the following provisions of the bill: * "Mobility status" Aid--Supplemental unemployment benefits that kick in after the regular, 36-month unemployment benefits run out and which are intended to assist unemployed workers in the interim between receiving unemployment benefits and pensions, will be extended to seven years. Participation in this "mobility" program will be broadened to include the clothing, textile, and building industries. It will also be extended to Fiat's Alfa plant in Arese, previously excluded because it was not classed as a company in industrial decline. * Unemployment Compensation--The benefit will be raised from 25 to 30 percent of the salary of the last year of employment and will be gradually raised to 40 percent. The 5 percent raise will be accomplished in 1994 in two installments. The IL MESSAGERO article adds details of the following provisions: * Unemployment Insurance (Cassa Integrazione)--This benefit will be extended to small companies with 15 to 50 employees. Benefits will be increased to 1.5 million lire monthly for employees with salaries over 32 million lire per year. Companies such as Fiat will be allowed to use both the unemployment insurance program and private company benefits, called "solidarity contracts," which had been prohibited by law. * Research and Development--Some 40-50 billion lire have been allocated for R&D to boost hiring in technical fields and to improve products in order to become more competitive. * Reduced Work Week--Contributions to the unemployment fund will be reduced from 0.45 percent to 0.20 percent for those companies that adopt flexible or reduced work weeks.

Commenting on this appointment, which was made by new Finance Minister Paul Martin in December, LE DEVOIR deputy editor Jean-Robert Sansfacon writes that monetary policy may change in the long term but not in the short term. The new Liberal government believes it is possible to navigate between price stability and job creation. Sansfacon argues that Martin "is perfectly right" to maintain the goal of keeping inflation under 3 percent for the next five years. At the same time, however, "he must not forget another objective, more fundamental than price stability: employment." Sansfacon concludes by cautioning Martin that if maintaining inflation below 3 percent forces him to raise interest rates to the point of harming employment, he should remember that the Conservatives lost the October 1993 election over this issue. Commenting on the Thiessen appointment in LE SOLEIL, editor Raymond Giroux points out that Martin "had no real choice" but to replace Crow "if he wanted to give Canadians the image of a really new and credible government." Although Martin claims "the Bank of Canada will not change its monetary policy," Giroux "is willing to wager" that the new governor will allow inflation to rise a few tenths of a percent during the next several months. After all, he adds, "no economy can really expand without an inflationary push."

During this time he concluded the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), participated in the completion of the Uruguay Round, traveled to Chile to assess the chances for enlarging NAFTA, and prepared for next month's visit by his South Korean counterpart with whom McLaren wants to negotiate a bilateral Canada-South Korea trade agreement. In Gherson's view, the reason behind this "frenetic activism" is the "ambitious" minister's desire to prevent Canada from losing trade opportunities before a new "super dynamic" World Trade Organization (WTO) is in place. McLaren is quoted as saying that the WTO "embodies the realization that trade and investment are global activities--and that's new and important." Furthermore, McLaren speculated that as the WTO "is built up and finds its feet," it may overtake existing regional trading arrangements.

A further sign of U.S. intentions was the 11 January meeting which brought together two European deputies with Frank Tonini--a representative of U.S. film producers' chief Jack Valenti- -and John Newbeggin. Newbeggin is an assistant to David Putnam, British film producer and a member of the EU's taskforce on its planned audiovisual "green book." The article contends that this "sudden interest" by the United States in European politics is taking place at the same time the French Government is lobbying its European Union (EU) partners to extend the EU broadcast quota system and industry subsidies, and to transfer the legal responsibility for TV broadcasting decisions from the broadcasting country to the receiving country. The commentary notes that in shifting legal responsibility to the receiving country, such stations as Ted Turner's TNT would be inhibited from "inundating" Europe with U.S. broadcasts from Britain and U.S. broadcast freedom would be affected.

The ability of the United States--China's largest textile market--to stem the "flood" of Chinese textiles entering that country is a "small tour de force" for President Bill Clinton's administration which used to advantage the "sensitive" issue of China's diverting textile trade through third countries to conclude the accord. The bilateral agreement will allow the United States to "impose a new balance" with the Chinese but may also allow it to "play the NAFTA card," argues Weil Besancon President Denis Weil. "Limiting Chinese textile export growth will allow the United States to favor trade relations with Mexico, where wage costs are competitive in textile production," Weil adds. While the United States will profit from this agreement, Europe may not. The EU is China's second largest textile market and EU industrialists fear the flow of Chinese textiles into the EU will accelerate as it diminishes toward the United States. Such an increase would aggravate the trade balance between China and the EU. In 1992, the EU had a 29 billion franc (Fr) trade deficit in textiles with China; France alone had a deficit of Fr3.2 billion. The article also claims the difference in tariffs between the EU and China is "flagrant," with the EU tariff at 12 percent on imports from China and Chinese tariffs 100 percent on imports from the EU. The EU does not yet have the technical means to control its borders nor viable statistics to measure the impact of any increase in textile imports, according to Thierry Noblot of the Textile Industries Union. (DiI) (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 20 Jan 94 p 7) BULL PLAN 'IRRITATES' EU COMMISSION--The French Government's delay in communicating its plans to restructure the government- controlled Bull computer company "greatly irritates" the EU Commission, according to an article in LES ECHOS. Furthermore, a report in LE FIGARO claims the Commission could block the government's planned Fr2.5-billion capital increase for Bull because of insufficient information about the deal. The LES ECHOS article cites EU Competition Commissioner Karl Van Miert in an interview given to the Paris daily LE MONDE as stating that French plans are "completely illegal." Van Miert added, "The French Government promised us a restructuring plan for months but nothing has come of it. Meanwhile, competitors in other member states complain. It has put the Commission in an impossible situation. It can not condone more (French Government capital increase) payments (to Bull) and if this happens, there should be a hearing at the European Court of Justice." Additionally, LES ECHOS reports that the Commission, which claims it has only received an "overview" of French Government plans, is still reviewing the Fr4 billion that the government paid to Bull in 1992 as a capital increase and the Fr2.5 billion more supplied by the government and co-shareholder France Telecom in February 1993. In December 1993, the government supplied Bull with a new tranche of Fr4 billion. "With the new payments forecast for this year, the total aid package could reach Fr15 billion," Van Miert claimed, noting the case of Air France, which the French Government tried to supply with Fr7 billion after having previously given the airline Fr1.5 billion.

If foreign subsidiaries of these 21 companies are taken into consideration, 1,760 companies would be involved in the privatization effort which would bring the total number of employees affected to 1 million. If the program is completed, France's public sector will be reduced by a third. INSEE reports that at the end of 1992, the government controlled 1,750 companies and 1.74 million workers--the largest public sector in Europe. In the manufacturing industries, 9 percent of the work force would be involved if the privatizations are completed. In the financial industry, the share of government employees will go from 32 percent to less than 5 percent. In the future, three quarters of government employees will be concentrated in seven large companies with a monopolistic character: electricity, gas, and coal companies EDF, GDF, and CDF respectively; railroad company SNCF; metro company RATP; the Post; and telecommunications company France Telecom. INSEE notes that aside from privatizations, layoffs in the public sector have affected 43,000 workers in 1992, or 2.4 percent of the work force. (DiI) (Paris LIBERATION in French 11 Jan 94 p 16) PRIVATE YARD TO BUILD NAVY SHIPS--The French Navy will soon ask the French Government to order two "assault" ships--new models called Nimis (interarmy ships for support missions)--from a civilian shipyard an article in LIBERATION claims. This choice is revolutionary because using the private company, the Chantiers de l'Atlantique in Saint Nazaire, defies the tradition of constructing Navy ships at the government's Department of Naval Construction (DCN) facility in Brest. The DCN's naval yard belongs to the Defense Ministry and specializes in research and construction of the country's most "important" military ships, employing more than 6,500 engineers, technicians, and workers. It had proposed a new type of ship for the Navy's needs, the BIP, which was to cost around Fr1.5 billion. However, the head of Chantiers de l'Atlantique, Alain Grill, offered to build two Nimis for the same price. It will be some time before the government confirms the Navy's choice. It is clear, the article notes, that a "serious naval battle" will erupt in the months ahead between these two shipyards. The stakes are big since, in addition to a 9-percent subsidy from the Ministry of Industry and advanced payments for the equipment, they entail in large part the future of the DCN naval yard, which will soon run out of new construction orders and if none are forthcoming will have to rely on its maintenance contracts to survive. According to the article, the cost of the Nimis was not the only factor in the Navy's choice, however. Military studies have all come to the same conclusion that the Nimis, which are not built to withstand heavy attack, are what the Navy needs to perform "showing the flag" duties rather than the BIP's, more suited for warfare. While the DCN has stated that it is open to adopting new forms of manufacturing, it concluded, "if the most complex system needed on a ship is air conditioning, this is not our line of work." (DiI) (Paris LIBERATION in French 22, 23 Jan 94 pp 5-6) GERMANY COMMENTATOR SEES RECOVERY PRODUCING CRISIS--Commentator Helmut Maier-Mannhart believes that ongoing cost-cutting efforts may enable German industry to recover international markets but worries that this same development may increase unemployment, leading to a social and financial crisis. Writing in the 14 January Munich SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, Maier-Mannhart concurs with Baden-Wuerttemberg Economics Minister Dieter Spoeri's thesis that German industry's recent restructuring efforts will yield a great increase in productivity, ultimately yielding substantial improvements in Germany's global competitiveness. As an example of this development, Maier-Mannhart points to Volkswagen, where Chairman Ferdinand Piech has managed to make his company operate profitably at just 90 percent of capacity, rather than the 100 percent previously required. Maier-Mannhart points out, however, that this trend toward "lean production" also has a downside: increased productivity means it takes fewer people to turn out the same quantity of a particular product. On a large scale, this means a higher unemployment rate and greater demands on public resources to support those thrown out of work. The expected "Renaissance of industry," the author concludes, may thus coincide with "a social crisis" and a "state of emergency" in public finances. Maier-Mannhart sees few efforts to come to terms with this threat and notes that, in any case, Germany is incapable of undertaking the necessary fundamental structural change in a year punctuated by so many elections.

According to a Telekom spokesperson, plans call for TEL eventually to grow to 14,000 kilometers, a goal which will require participating utility companies to invest about 700 million German marks (DM). The initial section, which is about 3,700 kilometers long, runs from Frankfurt to Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava, and Budapest in the north, with a southern spur extending to Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia. A subsequent phase of the project would expand the network to include Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, and Moldova. Eventual connections to Moscow and Helsinki are also envisioned. (RH) (Munich SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG in German 14 Jan 94 p 24) HESSE CREATES TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION FOUNDATION--The Land Government of Hesse has decided to create a Hessian Technology Foundation to promote industrial innovation. According to Hessian Economics Minister Welteke, the foundation is a response to the "crisis of innovation" in the economy, the country's lagging international competitiveness, and the failure of industry to exploit new areas of technology. According to its constitution, which was coordinated with representatives of business, labor, and academia, the foundation will work primarily with small businesses. The Land of Hesse will provide the foundation with starter capital of DM10 million, which is expected to yield DM600,O00 to DM700,0O0 annually for ongoing operations. The Hessian Land Development and Trust Company, an agency of the Land Government, will manage the foundation, freeing up resources which would otherwise be absorbed by administrative costs. (RH) (Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG in German 12 Jan 94 p 5) ITALY 3 MILLION NEW JOBS NEEDED BY 2000--On 12 January Labor Minister Gino Giugni presented a white paper on employment stating that 3 million new jobs must be created by the year 2000 to meet current and future employment needs. Giugni claimed that while such a statement can be considered "provocative" given that 550,000 jobs were lost in 1993 and the ranks of the unemployed grew by 350,000, it is "exactly what Italy needs." This is the case, he added, because Italy has high labor costs compared with other industrialized countries. Giugni admitted that creating that many new jobs is a "desperate undertaking" and although Italy's GDP is expected to increase 3 percent per year during this time, realistically only 600,000 jobs can be expected to be created. Giugni suggests attacking the problem by providing better education and increasing flexibility in the labor market. He claims that the market needs an additional 250,000 high school graduates and 110,000 university graduates yearly to increase the education level of future workers, which is currently among the lowest in Europe. As for flexibility, he suggests that part time work should be encouraged, along with employment mobility within industries and geographic areas, and that measures be taken to expose the underground economy where "millions of the employed are hiding." (AB) (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA in Italian 13 Jan p 19) SWEDEN INSTITUTE SAYS FUTURE LOOKING BRIGHTER--According to the latest report from the Konjunktur Institut, new industrial orders are picking up for the first time in four years, and Swedish industry seems to be coming out of the recession. The 1993 results were particularly impressive in the saw mill industry, which has begun to reach full capacity. The construction industry, still suffering from decreasing demand, is lagging behind. Production is responding only slowly to increased orders but is expected to pick up in 1994. Some industries, especially lumber and electronics, will begin hiring additional workers in the first quarter of this year.
