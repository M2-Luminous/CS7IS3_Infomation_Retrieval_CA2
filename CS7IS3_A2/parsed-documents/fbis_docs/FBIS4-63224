The reason is that the Chinese had already had their fingers burned once from trying to introduce a foreign (Soviet) development model and had paid a huge price for it. The successful progress of reform in China should generate close interest from us. We should hardly be expected to blindly borrow the experience of "special economic zones" -- we do not have a Russian diaspora able, like the "overseas Chinese," to pay for 60-90 percent of the development of their native provinces. We should not copy the experience of creating "small industries" in the countryside -- we do not have a 200-300-million surplus peasant labor force. Even the very attractive "open-door policy" could hardly be replanted here -- the Chinese did not have such highly developed industry, science, and technology when they gave the "green light" to foreign exports and capital investment in strategically important sectors. Instead we should learn the political techniques of preserving the unity of the state and stability in society. The Chinese miraculously averted the collapse of power during the 10 years of turmoil that were the "Cultural Revolution," and are now showing their skill in combining the interests of elites in the capital, regions, and sectors, the party and military nomenklaturas, and state, private, and foreign enterprises. It is this political stability that has made China attractive to foreign investment and loans -- which came to $110 billion in 1993. One way or another, the Chinese success stands out particularly against the backdrop of the prolonged crisis in Russia and the even more disastrous situation in the adjacent regions of Siberia and the Far East. Around 32 million people currently live there, but by 2010, if there is no change in the current unfavorable economic and demographic trends, there will be no more than 8-10 million people left in the endless expanses east of the Urals. By then Russia's GNP, according to certain academic estimates, will be only 75 percent that of China. For the first time in the four centuries of Russo-Chinese relations the Middle Kingdom will have overtaken us in its development. A new batch of problems has been created by the rapid development of economic ties between Russia and China, particularly border regions. Real estate is being illegally bought up by entrepreneurs from the other side of the Amur, and illegal immigration has become widespread. In certain population centers the number of "guests" already exceeds the number of Russians. Typically, even the relevant organs have no accurate figures on the scale of this phenomenon. But unofficial estimates range from several hundred thousand to 2 million! Meanwhile the local authorities are giving the "go-ahead" to the creation of permanent "Chinatown"-style settlements -- Chinese "ghettos" such as exist in certain cities in Europe, America, and Southeast Asia. In developing "fraternal" ties with adjacent Chinese regions, the leaders of our settlements and cities are often guided by immediate advantage and proceed solely on the basis of local interests. And general state interests are suffering. I see the main reason for this as being that these -- state -- interests have not yet been clearly formulated. Yet another problem has been brought about by the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the formation of sovereign Central Asian states in the area where Russia and China meet. Additional factors -- primarily ethnic and religious -- have emerged to complicate an already difficult situation. It seems that China is a clear winner -- after all, the subdividing of the "soft underbelly of Russia" gives it extensive opportunities to make economic and other inroads. But the prospect of an ethnic and religious "renaissance" in the Central Asian states -- and still more the prospect of an interstate union being set up on the basis of the idea of the economic, cultural, and religious integration of "Greater Turkestan" -- cannot fail to put Beijing on its guard. It knows that relatives of the Kazakhs, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Kirghiz [Kyrgyz], and Uighurs make up a considerable proportion of the representatives of PRC "ethnic minorities" -- who account for 90 million of the PRC's 1.2 billion citizens and inhabit around 60 percent of its national territory. Some of the problems of Soviet-Chinese relations -- primarily border problems -- have been transferred to the Central Asian states. But they do not yet have the potential to effectively resolve these problems. As a result, Russia has to all intents and purposes been left with its former level of political responsibility in this region. The military-strategic area is being preserved here within the borders of the former USSR -- this was confirmed by a recent conference of the leaders of border services in the CIS countries. Moreover, the Russian Federation is continuing the traditions of the Russian Empire and the USSR in their many centuries of relations with the Middle Kingdom. Thus, there are obvious problems in our ties with our largest neighbor on the Eurasian landmass. They can only be solved by having a unified state strategy that envisages at least short-term programs for developing relations with China for the federal center and Federation components, as well as a policy agreed with the sovereign states of Central Asia. In elaborating a federal program, we undoubtedly need to proceed on the basis of the major documents signed during President Yeltsin's state visit to Beijing in December 1992. This program should include measures for the priority development of Siberia and the Far East, including incentives for migration, tax breaks for enterprises of all forms of ownership and for investors, and improvements in the provision for the military. We should recall the experience of the settlement of the Far East in the Russian Empire and allocate a proper role to the Cossacks, whose forebears opened up the region and served the state in protecting its borders. We need to tighten up procedures on the border and in the adjoining region, and prevent the creation of "Chinatowns" that could become a major irritant to locals and a source of complications on an interstate scale. Of course, Moscow will also have to undertake some major spending, including subsidies from the state budget. The vagaries of market relations will not be evenhanded in the competition between our economic structures and those of China -- Russian entrepreneurs will have to be protected by corresponding laws and administrative measures, while not "cutting off the oxygen supply" to our partners on the other side of the Amur. I would like to say a few words about the other problems on the Russo-Chinese border, which stretches for 4,375 km. In deciding the issue of the ownership of several islands on the Amur and Argun Rivers we need once again to take account of both state and local interests. In our talks with the Chinese I think we should also use the tactic of joint economic exploitation of disputed territories. Special mechanisms of collaboration with China should be created for Russian Federation components directly participating in Russo-Chinese cooperation. Clearly, it would be expedient to develop such mechanisms in the form of targeted federal regional cooperation programs that include a system of preferences and exemptions. The federal authorities should provide the program participants with a clear-cut plan for cooperation, changes in regional quotas, tax breaks and customs concessions, and access to centralized credit resources and subsidy funds. Particular attention should be devoted to the system of the functioning of Chinese citizens on Russian territory -- capital inflows should not be accompanied by the Chinese population becoming established. As for cooperation with the Central Asian states, Moscow must take the initiative in concluding a range of bilateral and multilateral treaties on mutual relations with the PRC. For instance, the idea of economic development for the Semirechye zone in the area where the Russian, Kazakhstani, and Chinese borders intersect looks attractive. We need to do everything in our power to ensure that the processes of rapid Chinese development, the coming revival of Russia -- of which I am confident -- and the inevitable process of the creation of a Eurasian union or confederation of Eurasian states do not counteract each but interact, complement, and strengthen each other. Relations with China are too important to Russia to be allowed to drift.
