Political measures are called for that can stimulate economic activity and promote investment in the economy, which is in reality independent of the rest of the world. This is the opinion of Allan Larsson, who headed a joint working group for the European Social Democratic Party on combating unemployment. He presents the group's conclusions. Is it possible to garner broad support for a new economic policy that unites West Europe in the struggle against mass unemployment? Or are we so divided that there can be no hope for gathering the necessary forces? There are at least some positive signs. In early 1993, Jacques Delors and the Danish Government under Paul Nyrup Rasmussen, which at that time held the chairmanship of the EC, placed the battle against unemployment high on the European agenda. The summit meeting in Copenhagen in June was a small but important step forward. Work on Delors' white paper has focused political attention this fall on Europe's greatest misfortune--the fact that more than 20 million people are out of work, half of them for more than a year. But the public debate gives the impression that there is a deep split. On one hand, there are those who cherish the laissez-faire mentality that led Europe into this crisis of mass unemployment. They simply offer more of the same, a fine tuning of the neoliberal policy with deregulation, reduced government responsibility, and increased insecurity. On the other hand, there is a growing number of people--ordinary citizens who are deeply concerned, perceptive economists, conscientious politicians--who regard the present situation as so serious that they want to see a thorough analysis and rethinking of the policy that led to this record level unemployment. They want a total new direction, not just fine tuning of the present policy. In order to promote the need for new ideas, new directions, and innovative measures, Willy Claes in Belgium, Felipe Gonzalez in Spain, Franz Vranitzky in Austria, Wim Kok in the Netherlands, Ingvar Carlsson and all of the other party leaders of the European Social Democratic Party (PES) initiated a comprehensive program--The European Employment Initiative. Under my leadership during the fall, the study group worked with leading economists in Europe, with Delors and his colleagues on the EC Commission, and with experts in diverse national organs. In connection with this work, I visited 15 countries in West Europe in order to gain some insight into various national situations and to obtain advice on designing a new policy on full employment. We have now handed over the report, entitled "Put Europe Back to Work," to the chairman of the PES [Social Welfare Committee], Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Willy Claes, who is also chairman of the EC Council of Ministers, and to all of the other party leaders. The report will provide the basis for their discussions and resolution at a meeting in Brussels tomorrow (Thursday), the day before the European summit meeting. We concentrated upon Europe's two major economic threats: mass unemployment and the growing deficit in public finances. These two problems are closely related and must be approached through a common economic policy. We posed five questions in the quest for answers concerning the high and growing unemployment: Is unemployment due to trade and overwhelming international competition? To new technology that replaces jobs? To an imbalance between savings and investment, that is to say, a lack of demand? Or is it sluggishness in the labor market that prevents Europe from increasing its rate of growth sufficiently to push down unemployment? Or is it due to an antagonism between the integrated European economy that we have created and the fact that every country continues to conduct its own national policy? We have come to the conclusion that answers can be found in all five areas, but mostly in the last three mentioned: structural problems in the labor market, faltering demand, and the lack of a coordinated policy to take advantage of the integrated European economic potential. I will present a few facts that will open new perspectives on what can and should be done. The European countries, the EC and EFTA [European Free Trade Association] nations, are economically so closely interwoven that we now have in practice a single integrated European economy. This integrated economy is surprisingly independent of the rest of the world. No less than 93 percent of all investment and all consumption stems from production in West Europe. Only 7 percent is derived from imports from other parts of the world. This tells us that there is much more scope than is generally imagined for a concerted action that promotes growth and creates new jobs. This tells us also that there is a greater need for free trade than is generally believed. Our integrated European economy is currently suffering from weak demand on the one hand and structural problems in the labor market on the other. There is a gap between investment and financial savings in the private sector on the order of 6 percent of GNP, a lag in demand representing 8 to 9 million jobs. The surplus of financial savings, which in reality is an expression for a deficit in real savings, or investment, has a flip side, namely a deficit in public finances that currently amounts to 6 to 7 percent of GNP. The weakness in economic activity in the private sector is the source of the deficit in the public sector. When jobs disappear and unemployment rises, public finances are undermined from two directions: Expenditures grow and revenues weaken. The underlying structural deficit mirrors a second structural problem: long-term unemployment and cuts in social services. We concluded from this and other factors that a program of action is needed that in magnitude and duration diverges radically from all that has been tried and discussed before. Such a new economic policy for full employment must have two pillars: investment in business and investment in education and skills. Above all, Europe needs more businessmen, more businesses, and greater investment in the private sector. Political measures designed to stimulate economic activity play a decisive role in creating confidence in the future and interest in investment. We wish to generate as many confidence-creating measures as possible through monetary policy. We suggest that ECOFIN [EC Council of Economic and Finance Ministers], that is, the EC's economic and finance ministers, as well as EMI [European Monetary Institute], the new monetary institute, mount a concerted action to bring down interest rates in Europe. Low interest rates make productive investments more profitable and promote a balance between savings and investment, a key objective of monetary policy. A new economic policy--based upon investment in business, research and development, infrastructure, housing, and urban renewal--is necessary but not sufficient. It is just as necessary to deal with the structural problems in the labor market, the lack of correspondence between the demand for training and job skills on the one hand and the range and quality of education on the other. Europe has a labor market that is out of phase due to the fact that demand for labor changes quickly as a result of new technology and international competition, while change is slow in the educational system, which is not organized for the new job market. Thus we propose joint initiatives aimed at forcefully increasing investment in training and job skills. We would like to increase quality and capacity by an additional 5 million places in education, job training, retraining, and skill level development. An investment such as this will impact approximately 2.5 percent of the work force and will have very positive, long-term effects on growth and immediate effects on the battle against unemployment. A new economic policy for full employment--with the object of first and foremost creating jobs in the private sector--is the most important measure for revitalizing healthy public finances. Cutting unemployment in half will go far in helping to balance Europe's national budgets. Our program "Put Europe Back to Work" is based upon the simple but fundamental insight that work is a greater contribution to economic and social progress than unemployment is. It is also based upon the insight that Europe has an enormous potential for growth through the mobilization of people's desire and ability to work and create new resources. It is high time for joint action, for a collective policy that builds not on the limitations of national economies, but on the great possibilities that an integrated European economy offers.
