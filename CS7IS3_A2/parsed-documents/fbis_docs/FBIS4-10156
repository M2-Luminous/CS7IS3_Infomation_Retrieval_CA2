He said the media is controlled by powerful organizations established during the previous administration. The president said such organizations frequently do not have any mercy on the administration's need for space, adding that his government was seated only a short time ago and had to administer the many conflicts that currently are surfacing. "My government guarantees the most absolute freedom of the press, which is controlled by powerful communications organizations that were established during the previous administration and that frequently do not have any mercy on the administration's need for space in the short time it has had to administer the many conflicts that are surfacing today," the president said. Wasmosy read his speech during a working luncheon with European Parliament President Egon Klepsh and various European deputies. The head of state said the method for administering conflicts in a true democracy was quite different from the methods used in the past autocracy. Regarding the social crisis, Wasmosy told the European deputies that his government was committed to facing the social problems caused by poverty, disease, ignorance, and lack of communications in wide areas of the country with courage and determination. Wasmosy said his government used the invaluable democratic instrument of dialogue, compromise, and agreement with opposition forces, adding that the opposition controlled both houses of Congress. The head of state stressed that this attitude permitted them to close a pact with the opposition that will guarantee the democratic governability of the country. Wasmosy said the pact with the opposition will allow them to fulfill, in freedom, the people's long delayed and legitimate aspirations. The president admitted that the country's economy was fragile and weak because 76 percent of the 4 million inhabitants earned their incomes from agriculture, adding that agriculture depended on the success or failure of cotton and soybean crops, which usually are affected by international markets' cyclical variations.
