There were three extensive, serious, and constructive conversations with Serbian President Milosevic. We continued our contacts with the leaders [words indistinct]. It is not without satisfaction that I can now say that, in my view, I have a serious basis for concluding such an agreement. It envisages disengagement of the fighting sides; in other words, it will be a real agreement on ending the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and not just another declaration on ceasing hostilities.
