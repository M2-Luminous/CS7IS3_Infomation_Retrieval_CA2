Some of his people are asking if his strong antigovernment course of action makes any sense at all, and they are disquieted by the declining election preferences for the party. Milos Zeman, who threatened that his arrival as head of the Czech Social Democratic Party [CSSD] would become a tragedy for the rightist parties, does not allow, in an interview for MLADA FRONTA DNES, any questioning of his work as head of the CSSD: [Zeman] Politics is a long-distance race. It is measured not in months but in years. We will become a dangerous opposition to today's conservative government, as dangerous as the Labor Party is to the Conservatives in Great Britain or the Social Democrats to the Christian Democrats in Germany. [Leschtina] After you were elected you said that your party would flood parliament with legislative bills. Where are they? [Zeman] We presented a bill to abolish the senate and one on conflict of interests. In a short time, we will be presenting two bills--one on territorial division and one on the obligation to prove one's source of income and property. [Leschtina] This is not a formidable flood of bills. Moreover, according to information available to us, the bill on the conflict of interest has not been presented to parliament yet. [Zeman] Your information is not correct. We have already presented the bill to committee, and we are now holding talks with the Civic Democratic Alliance on whether we can come up with a joint draft. Otherwise, I admit that our original idea to establish a team of well-paid experts whom we need to draft individual sections of the law has been abandoned because our coffers are empty and we have debts. Owing to our lack of funds, our original intentions have been curbed but not changed. [Leschtina] You have promised to disclose a number of privatization affairs, including the "violation of the law by the Civic Democratic Party." Can you give an example to our readers of a case in which you have caught the Civic Democratic Party violating the law? [Zeman] We have presented dozens of these. For example, the Aero Holding affair, which was presented by Deputy Kraus, the Plzenske Pivovary [Plzen Breweries] affair presented by Vaclav Grulich, the affair surrounding the buildings of the Research Institute of Agricultural Technology belonging to a religious order.... I could continue.... [Leschtina] They are cases that have been discussed in the press. Have you yourselves come up with evidence that the Civic Democratic Party has violated the law? [Zeman] The opposition can only suggest that the cases that had been revealed be sorted out. We have suggested several times, always in vain, that a parliamentary commission be established. We have submitted a report to the Control Office. Our party is not a detective agency able to discover all of the violations of the law in all the minute details. [Leschtina] As long as you say that the law has been violated, you can initiate criminal proceedings at the Office for Investigation. Why did you not do so after you had said that Communist Party of Czechoslovakia property was used, to a certain extent, to finance the election campaign of the parties with a strong anticommunist program? [Zeman] You are asking me to assume the role not only of a detective office but also that of the prosecutor general, which has been abolished, by the way. A political party may express suspicion that the law has been broken and present supporting arguments. [Leschtina] What arguments can you bring to support the suspicion that one of the rightist parties financed its election campaign using some communist property? [Zeman] We are willing, of course, to present evidence, if parliament deals with the problem. Specifically, this case happened in North Bohemia. [Leschtina] You are not going to tell us more? [Zeman] Our sources are from former inspection authorities. You will certainly understand that I do not want to say anything specific because we would be unable to acquire more information. [Leschtina] Very often, in connection with the Civic Democratic Party, you say that we have, once again, one-party rule. The Civic Democratic Party, however, is working in coalition with three parties and is unable to push for anything without their support in parliament. [Zeman] I do not want to dramatize the situation, but I do realize that there is a significant difference between the situation after and before November 1989. Nevertheless, if I have to use your arguments, I must say that even the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia did not have an absolute monopoly. Other government parties shared power, at least formally. [Leschtina] Are you then comparing the Civic Democratic Party and other coalition parties to the powerless members of the National Front? [Zeman] I am not saying that the two things are identical, but I am saying that pushing for only one acceptable alternative means limiting the democratic space. [Leschtina] In the annual report you presented to the Central Executive Committee of the CSSD in January, you said, among other things: "Zhirinovskiy's relative success may finally have opened the eyes of those who have been idealizing our right-wing parties and refuse to see their inclination toward authoritarian, and, in extreme case, fascist, forms of government." Do you believe that our right-wing parties have fascist tendencies? [Zeman] I was building on Mr. Kotas's statement some time ago that the more right-wing that people were, the better. With my sentence I am reacting to the idea that the more right-wing I am, the more democratic and open I am. Josef Kudlacek, the publisher of CESKY DENIK, is of the opinion that we should become even more right-wing. I was trying to use the proof by contradiction. If you amplify a certain trend, which has authoritarian forms in our country, you can demonstrate its extremes. The fascist form is such an extreme. Mr. Kudlacek or the Republicans are certainly extreme right-wingers. [Leschtina] These gentlemen are not in government. Does that mean that you do not believe that the government parties have fascist traits? [Zeman] Our coalition is being accused of having authoritarian inclinations. However, I cannot exclude the possibility that, if some representatives from the ruling parties--I mean mainly their fundamental wings--found themselves facing a difficult situation, they would show fascist traits. On the other hand, I firmly believe that those who describe themselves as pragmatists will win within these parties. [Leschtina] How do you explain that the continued growth in your party's popularity has halted and declined, according to recent polls? [Zeman] As I said, without money, successful politics cannot be conducted for a long time. Almost everything is done on the basis of voluntary work in our party, and this is why we often react with a certain delay, and--I have to add self-critically--we often lack expertise. By cooperating with a team of qualified experts, we can become a more efficient and aggressive opposition. I do not need to remind you that the popularity of our party is better than Mr. Lux's party, which has 85,000 members and whose chairman we can see constantly on television. [Leschtina] On the other hand, the Civic Democratic Party still has the support of two-thirds of the population. What is the reason for that, in your opinion? [Zeman] People have the feeling, thanks to coupon privatization, that they have become rich owners, and they are expecting fat dividends, which makes them satisfied with the government. However, the enterprises that thousands of small owners are unable to control are facing a gradual downturn. When the people sober up from their illusions, from the dream that every little old lady in the Orlicke mountains has become a minicapitalist, as Tomas Jezek [National Property Fund chairman] put it, they will turn away from the Civic Democratic Party. [Leschtina] Are you sticking to your statement that our coupon privatization is the fraud of the century? [Zeman] I am convinced that it will soon become clear that the feedback that has been severed between the owner and management will lead to a decline in output in a large number of our enterprises. From this viewpoint, the statement about the fraud of the century holds. [Leschtina] Are you not underestimating the intelligence of our population when you say that 80 percent of the nation has swallowed the bait? [Zeman] The Bolshevik concept of nationwide ownership is not very remote from the idea of coupon privatization, and the majority of our population swallowed it in the past. We cannot argue by saying that, if the majority agrees with an idea, this is sufficient proof of its correctness. We would then have to accept the absurd fact that Hitlerism was correct because almost 80 percent of the population agreed with it. [Leschtina] Those are dangerous comparisons. [Zeman] You cannot infer from this that I am comparing the existing regime to Hitlerism--God forbid! I am only describing, using a drastic example, that majority approval may be meaningless. [Leschtina] Are you suggesting that your party's strategy should be based on the fact that people are somewhat retarded, but they will realize it, and one day they will understand the avant-garde management of the CSSD? [Zeman] I have never said anything like that. We are not visionaries, we are not turning away from today's problems, and our reactions--to the security situation, for example--testify to this fact. Apart from that, we are trying to react to problems that do not seem topical to a number of people, but soon will be. A classical example of these problems is unemployment, a problem that is dismissed by the majority but that will become a topical problem tomorrow. We are preparing specific programs to deal with unemployment now. [Leschtina] Recently, your adviser Oto Novotny came up with a document saying that the Social Democrats cannot become successful in the long run through a confrontational strategy and by criticizing the government without giving it credit for its successes. How does the man who has become a celebrity because of his statement "we must go for the government's throat" react to this document? [Zeman] The case of Mr. Hirs and many others shows that a policy that would meet the government halfway is political suicide for the opposition parties. Every day the opposition must vehemently criticize errors by the government, its conservatism and its monetarism. Monetarism ceased to be a topical issue in economic science a long time ago. This is what other social democratic parties in Europe are doing, in any case. [Leschtina] Their criticism is specific and does not go beyond the borders of elementary political culture, which cannot be said of some of your statements. [Zeman] Look, U.S. President George Bush once said that his dog Millie understood foreign policy better than Bill Clinton. I do not see any reason to use less juicy statements than a politician who, unlike us, lived in the milieu of the traditional Western culture for 40 years. [Leschtina] Some CSSD members are afraid that Zeman's antigovernment bigotry will become an increasingly large burden on his party on a political scene that is stabilizing. Will your election for leader of the CSSD become a tragedy for the CSSD? [Zeman] First, I do not believe that our political scene is stabilizing. The constant deterioration of the economic situation will lead to political unrest. As regards my future: Sartre wrote that the truth about yourself becomes the genuine truth only after it is understood by others. I would like to add that the truth becomes the genuine truth for a politician only when it is understood by the electorate.
