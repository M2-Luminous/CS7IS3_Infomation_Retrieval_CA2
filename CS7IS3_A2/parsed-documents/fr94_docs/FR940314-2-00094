The certification notice was published in the Federal Register on March 4, 1994 (59 FR 10429). At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The findings show that several workers were laid off a few months prior to the Department's impact date of August 1, 1993. The findings also show that the workers were laid off as a result of a company decision to import office filing supplies. Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification with a new impact date of April 1, 1993. The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,213 is hereby issued as follows: All workers of Smead Manufacturing Company, Hastings, Minnesota engaged in employment related to the production of office filing supplies who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after April 1, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.
