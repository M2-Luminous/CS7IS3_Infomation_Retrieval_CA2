[Ricupero] I am very optimistic about what will happen in the short-term because all steps to make stability a reality have been taken. We have ensured the fiscal reform through the Social Emergency Fund. There is pressure and there are difficulties but I believe we will achieve a good operational result in the budget. We have the largest reserves in our history and they are enough to cover our imports for 12 months. We have reached agreement about our debt and reopened the doors to the international market. We are even preparing a Treasury certificate. I have appointed a working team to define the details of this certificate. Through it, we will be able to attract resources at lower interest rates in the domestic market. We have also had unprecedented crops: 75 million tonnes. Following the 1992 recession, the economy has grown 4.5 percent during the last 15 months. International conditions are improving. There is a large group of favorable indicators that convinces us that when the real is implemented, the inflation rate will drop in a swift and accentuated manner. [Chaim] How will this happen? [Ricupero] The inflation rate will drop for several reasons. Particularly because the de-indexation of the economy will be very advanced. We believe the inflation rate will begin to drop in an accentuated manner after the second month. [Chaim] Will it be possible to maintain the inflation rate at very low levels for a long time? [Ricupero] Until the end of this year, I am sure it will. My main concern is about the medium- and long-term. The government has never hidden that the consolidation of the economic adjustment will demand structural reforms that will require modifying the Constitution. This is why I made such a big effort to see the constitutional reform continue -- not to benefit from it. Even if the constitutional reform had been very well advanced, its effects would only begin to be felt in the medium-term. My effort sought to make things easier for my successor. [Chaim] How will you convince Autolatina [car-manufacturing company] workers, and all other workers, that despite the increase in prices, salaries need not be readjusted? [Ricupero] As I have frequently said, it is an illusion to think that salary hikes obtained through strikes will solve that problem. These excessive increases -- as much as 19 percent -- currently being granted worry me. The worker rejoices, the inflation rate is pushed up, and shortly after that the salary increase is consumed. What you achieve with your left hand, the right hand -- inflation -- destroys. People must realize that the only salvation is stability, which is the pre-condition for growth because economic growth depends on investment. With inflation like ours, there is no investment. In 1992, our investment rate dropped to 14.5 percent of the GDP, while in the 1970's it stood at 25 percent, like that of the Asian Tigers. [Chaim] You have just eight more months in the government. Do you have time to do something more concrete in such a short period of time? [Ricupero] I believe there is time enough to reestablish a very high-level of stability in the economy. [Chaim] How? [Ricupero] We will adopt rules for the new currency that will create confidence about issuance control. We will also adopt rules to link the real to international reserves. At the same time, I will not limit my horizon strictly to the implementation of the stabilization plan, which is my main task: I will act in two areas that need defined policies; first I will define an industrial policy that can be competitive abroad. I plan to do that together with the Science and Technology Ministry and the Industry and Commerce Ministry. Our commercial opening lacks one detail: an industrial and competitive policy. At the same time, I want to enter the job policy area, although this area is not the responsibility of my ministry only. The best way to solve social problems is first, to put an end to inflation and second, to create jobs. I believe a lot can be done in eight months regarding policy definition... [Chaim] What is the job-generating policy that you intend to implement? [Ricupero] The main subject in all economies is the job issue. The problem has not been solved either by market or by socialist economies, which alleged attained full employment but based on a surplus -- a company that needed 100 employees has 300. I think Brazil -- beside supporting the many different small and middle-size enterprises, and gradually reducing taxes -- must face a very serious problem which is the very high cost of generating job openings, the so-called social cost. We, in Brazil, with our poor economy, have higher social costs than Denmark. What is worse, our social services are very bad. For every dollar a Brazilian businessman pays in salaries, he pays 81 cents for social benefits. We must thus convince the left and the labor unions that this situation cannot improve the workers' wellbeing. The path to the wellbeing of workers is via a productive sector that generates abundant, well paid, and good quality jobs. That is how the social matter must be solved. [Chaim] But there are powerful sectors that benefit a lot from inflation and which are against stability... [Ricupero] There are sectors that coexist and even prosper under an economy like ours. We must create the conditions to end this situation. Brazil must attain a stability like in Europe, where it is a vindication of the people. I feel there is hope for such a thing here. During the Cruzado Plan, with all its mistakes, there was great pride in being Brazilians, the people felt they had a strong currency. There is no reason why this should not happen again. That is why I asked the president to announce the new currency. The currency is a symbol of sovereignty. [Chaim] What is the acceptable inflationary expectation for the real? [Ricupero] I cannot give you a figure. It is difficult to calculate, mainly because Brazilian indexes measure past inflation. It is very complicated to explain that the first indexes of the real will measure inflation from the former month. That is why I cannot answer. But inflation will be very low after the second month. [Chaim] How will you prevent businessmen from excessively readjusting their prices? [Ricupero] By negotiating, by using the law we have, and by increasing competitiveness. [Chaim] But this formula has not worked very well. [Ricupero] It is my responsibility to administrate the economic plan. I believe the plan belongs to everyone. I do not see any contradiction between the interests of a candidate and the plan's consistency. Anyone who wishes to become president will find an economy on the way to stabilization. Even Lula said that. It is obvious. It is better to be Rodrigues Alves [Brazilian president from 1902 to 1906] than to be Campos Sales [Brazilian president from 1898 to 1902]. Campos Sales left Catete Palace [then Government House in Rio de Janeiro] booed by the public until he boarded the train for Sao Paulo. Rodrigues Alves was popular because he inherited a streamlined economy and he was able to do many things. Which do the candidates prefer?
