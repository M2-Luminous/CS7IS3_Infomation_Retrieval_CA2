FBIS4-703 "drafr072_c_94002" FBIS-AFR-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Mediation Efforts `Collapse' Over Preconditions Mediation Efforts `Collapse' Over Preconditions Buthelezi on Terms of Reference MB1304164694 London BBC World Service in English 1515 GMT 13 Apr 94 MB1304164694 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] The attempted international mediation between the South African Government and the ANC on the one hand, and Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party, IFP, on the other, to bring the IFP into the election process has ground to a halt even before it has begun. The mediators -- Henry Kissinger and Lord Carrington -- are kicking their heels after IFP negotiators refused to go to the venue where the mediation talks were supposed to take place. Chief Buthelezi claims that the ANC has gone back on its word given at the weekend meeting and is insisting that the election dates, between April the 26th and April the 28th, aren't up for discussion. The whole process is stalled, while government, ANC, and IFP officials try to sort out the deadlock. On the line, Jeremy Skeet asked Chief Buthelezi if he held out any hope of the mediation talks getting off the ground. [Begin recording] [Buthelezi] Well, it is difficult to be optimistic when people shift things around like that because after all the consolidated agreement or the consolidated terms of reference were actually something we considered because the ANC insisted, and we were surprised that they have brought in these issues now which have stalled the process we should be starting by now, you know, if it hadn't been for that purpose. So, I just hold my tongue that things will work out. I don't want to abandon hope, but I am just holding tongues in the hope that things will work out. [Skeet] Now, it was Inkatha and you yourself who originally called for international mediators. The international mediators have come, but at the moment it looks as though that's broken down, and some people are going to blame you for this. They are going to say: Well, you never really wanted to take part in the elections. [Buthelezi] Blaming for what? I am not surprised, Mr. Skeet, that you are asking me this question because the BBC is also in that game of trying to heap blame on me. I don't think that I could have been more explicit than I have been even now to say that even now my delegation is waiting to go to the venue. Now, you are putting that question precisely because you are putting in the minds of listeners that we are to blame for this when actually the thing has been stalled by the ANC. [Skeet] Okay, let me ask you another question chief minister. What needs to be done by the government and the ANC to bring you on board in these elections? [Buthelezi] But surely it (?wasn't a) matter for mediation now, because there was a deadlock. What more can I say than that? Because we asked for a mediation in the first place precisely because there is a deadlock. I don't think that I have any thing to contribute to that question more than that. [Skeet] But now with the mediation effort apparently failed, does that mean that Inkatha will definitely not take part in the elections? [Buthelezi] Well, as far as I am concerned it has not failed. I have told you very explicitly in clear terms that we are waiting to hear now what happens at the meeting in which the IFP, the government, and the ANC are participating at this moment as you are talking to me. [Skeet] But so, if nothing comes out of this meeting this afternoon, that is it as far as you are concerned? [Buthelezi] No, that is a decision you are asking me to take. Fortunately, I don't take decisions like that. It will be the IFP Central Committee that will take decisions if that happens, and even now I have not abandoned hope that this thing can be sorted out. [Skeet] You say that you haven't abandoned hope, but [words indistinct] an outside observer it looks as though there is no hope in South Africa at the moment. There is a lot of killing going on in Natal. [Buthelezi] You are entitled to your opinion, of course, on that. I mean, I don't begrudge you that, Mr. Skeet. You are quite entitled to make that conclusion, but it isn't necessarily mine. [Skeet] How do you think you can help stop the killing that is going on daily in Natal and kwaZulu? [Buthelezi] How can Major stop the killing that goes on with the IRA there? [Skeet] But people ask him that question. I am asking you, how do you think you can help in bringing about peace in Natal-kwaZulu? [Buthelezi] We have just been discussing at length with me the fact that the deplorable problems of this country have not been resolved. As long as those problems are not resolved, I don't think I have a magic wand to stop, you know, what is going on, which has been going on for 10 years. You should know from your library or cuttings which you have in your library that the peace accord which was signed in this country in which Mr. Mandela, Mr. de Klerk, and myself, and other leaders signed, and that my people, IFP, have been involved in the peace committees, but a few days ago, right here where I am in the Reef, one of the leaders was shot by the members of the South African Defense Force, you know. But in spite of that we have not withdrawn from the structures which are trying to bring about peace. [end recording]
