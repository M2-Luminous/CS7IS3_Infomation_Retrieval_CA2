They said the information highway project calls for setting up a nationwide optical fiber network to connect every Japanese home by 2010, as recommended in a recent report by an advisory panel to the posts and telecommunications minister. Hata told reporters Tuesday night his cabinet hopes to establish an in-house research organization because bureaucratic red tape has prevented speedy work on the subject. In testimony before the House of Representatives Budget Committee on Tuesday night, Hata said he is aware of criticism that Japan lags behind the United States and other countries in proceeding with its own information highway project. He said he wants the nation's private sector to fully participate in the project, which could be a Japanese version of the U.S. information superhighway launched by Vice President Al Gore. A high-ranking government source said the Hata cabinet plans to open the in-house research arm within this month or by early July at the latest. Members of the new group will include the prime minister, the chief cabinet secretary and posts and telecommunications and trade ministers, the source said. Hata told reporters on Wednesday morning his administration will get advice from the private sector although the new group will not have private sector people as members.
