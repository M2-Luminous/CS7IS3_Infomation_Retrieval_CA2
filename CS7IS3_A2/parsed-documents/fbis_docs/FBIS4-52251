A Foreign Ministry statement issued that day said the situation on the Korean peninsula required replacement of the cease-fire pact with a peace treaty to ensure "genuine peace and safety." Pointing to the deployment of Patriot missile batteries in South Korea and "Team Spirit," the joint South Korea-U.S. military exercise, it charged that the United States has "completely renounced the Armistice Agreement it concluded with us in the name of the United Nations." It added, "the Armistice Agreement has become an empty sheet of paper that can no longer guarantee peace on the Korean peninsula," taking note of the March 1991 appointment of a South Korean officer as chief U.N. delegate to the Military Armistice Commission, replacing the U.S. officer who had until then served as chief U.N. delegate. It was on March 25, 1974, that Pyongyang first proposed a North Korea-U.S. meeting on replacement of the truce pact with a peace treaty. The offer, then and now, is considered by North Korea watchers here to be part of a propaganda offensive against the South. Naming only the United States as the other party to the peace talks is totally wrong, according to many North Korea watchers. South Korea not only took part in the truce talks through the commander of the U.N. Forces but also participated in the Geneva political talks on Korea held under a U.N. General Assembly resolution adopted on Aug. 28, 1953. North Korea must therefore name South Korea as a party to the talks if it really wants a workable peace treaty. That is why the proposal has not been accepted by the international community over the past 20 years since North Korea first made it in 1974. In January 1984 North Korea revised the proposal, offering a tripartite meeting, apparently recognizing what was wrong with its 1974 proposal. The North Koreans' true intention behind the peace talks offer is to increase "the revolutionary forces in South Korea," North Korea watchers say. In the above-mentioned Foreign Ministry statement, North Korea called for a non-aggression pact, removal of war threats, a ban on additional deployment of troops and arms, and a U.S. troop pullout from South Korea, with a view to neutralizing the South Korea-U.S. defense treaty to break the balance of military power on the peninsula in the interest of South Korea's "revolutionary forces." It should also be noted that North Korea, when making the first peace offer in 1974, tried to cash in on the withdrawal of 20,000 U.S. troops from South Korea in 1971 under the 1969 Nixon doctrine calling on Asians to guarantee their own security. This new U.S. Asia policy also resulted in normalized relations between Washington and Beijing and Tokyo and Beijing. Until its first peace offer to the United States in 1974, North Korea had insisted on an inter-Korean peace talks proposal made in June 1962, while launching campaigns to "increase the three great revolutionary powers" and to strengthen "the four great military lines" on the domestic front. Pyongyang's peace offer to Washington is considered to have three aims, according to North Korea watchers. The first is exclusion of the South from the peace talks so that the North can take the initiative in inter-Korean relations. This, the North may hope, will promote anti-government sentiment against Seoul and further Pyongyang's scheme to increase revolutionary forces in the South. The second is neutralization of the South Korea-U.S. defense treaty and the last is diplomatic isolation of the South from the world community. A peace treaty with the United States would justify the legitimacy of North Korea as the only sovereign state on the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang's second peace offer appears to be aimed at securing a third round of high-level North Korea-U.S. talks, as it came when the nuclear standoff remains unsettled. North Korea may want to raise the issue of establishing a peace treaty in the next meeting with the United States in a bid to divert the world's attention from the nuclear issue. And if the third round of talks broke down, the Stalinist North would blame the United States for heightening tensions on the Korean peninsula and use this as an excuse to renounce the Armistice Agreement. So the new peace offer, along with Pyongyang's withdrawal from the Military Armistice Commission, is regarded by North Korea watchers as psychological warfare against South Korea and the United States. The peace proposal is just another tactical variation of the Stalinist country's strategy to unify the divided country under communism.
