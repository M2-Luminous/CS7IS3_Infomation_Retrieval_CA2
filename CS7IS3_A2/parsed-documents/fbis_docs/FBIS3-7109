In your assessment in what aspect Vietnam's relations with Malaysia can be further improved: Are you satisfied with the current state of relations between the two countries? What are the obstacles to enhancing the relationship, if any? In conjunction with your visit can we expect Vietnam and Malaysia to sign new agreements for new areas of mutual cooperation to enhance the already excellent ties between the two countries? [Do Muoi] In the past time, the relations of friendship and multifaceted cooperation between our two countries have seen fine developments. I'm satisfied with the harmonious developments in economic as well as political relations between our two countries. The two countries have exchanged many high-level delegations and signed many cooperative agreements, creating favourable political and legal basis for the development and expansion of cooperation on various fields in accordance with the potential of each country. At the invitation of H.E. [His Excellency] Dr Mohamad Mahathir, prime minister of Malaysia, I'Il conduct an official and friendship visit to Malaysia. The main objectives of this visit are to study Malaysian precious experiences in socio-economic development, to consolidate and further strengthen mutual understanding and trust, thereby contributing to the more effective development of the cooperative relationship between our two countries. This will create favourable conditions for concerned agencies of the two countries to strengthen and expand the existing cooperation in various fields, meeting the aspiration and interests of the peoples of our two countries. My visit this time doesn't aim at signing concrete cooperative agreement, which is under the competence of the two states. [Correspondent] Your Excellency, you were once quoted in a newspaper article that you encourage party and government officials to travel abroad and bring home experience to turn Vietnam into a strong country with rich people. In this context, do you think Malaysia can also play a role towards helping Vietnam achieve that objective? Can we also reverse the scenario. In what way can Vietnam help Malaysia share Vietnam's expertise in certain fields? [Do Muoi] Vietnam attaches importance to the research and proper application of good experiences of the world under our own circumstances in order to build a Vietnam of `rich people, strong nation, just and civilized society'. The achievements in the renewal process of Vietnam over the past years recognized by the world community have also proved that we have combined harmoniously the national self-reliance and the trend of cooperation for development in the present era. Vietnam and Malaysia are geographically close and share many similarities in culture as well as traditional practice and customs. Malaysia has carried out excellently its strategy of socio-economic development and has drawn many precious experiences, which are highly appreciated internationally. At present, Malaysia ranks second among ASEAN investors in Vietnam. I am fully confident that, provided with these factors, Malaysia will play a deserving role in helping Vietnam build and develop the country in accordance with the good relationship between the two countries. On our part, we're ready to exchange views with Malaysia on questions of Malaysian concern in the spirit of friendship, trust and cooperation for the prosperity of our respective country and for the common wealth of Southeast Asia. [Correspondent] Finally, Your Excellency, what is your vision of Southeast Asia and Asia as a whole in the near future? [Do Muoi] Peace and development which are the age-old aspiration of nations are now becoming more and more imperative need of all countries in the world. Southeast Asia has never enjoyed favourable conditions as it does at present for the cooperation among countries in the spirit of understanding and friendship in an effort to achieve their common goal of maintaining peace stability and creating an international environment favourable for the development of their individual countries and the region as a whole. Prompted by this spirit, Vietnam has signed the Bali Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, become an ASEAN observer and is now participating in a number of ASEAN commissions and projects, preparing for its admission to ASEAN when conditions are ripe. Vietnam will also participate in the ASEAN Regional Forum on Security held in Bangkok. We support the Malaysian initiative for the East Asia Economic Forum. A prosperous Southeast Asia is not only an indispensable condition for the construction of each country but also a very important factor for peace, stability in Asia-Pacific as a whole, a centre which is drawing much attention from the world community for its dynamics and great prospects in the 21st century. For Vietnam, strengthening its cooperation with other countries in Southeast Asia and Asia-Pacific is of special importance. Our foreign policy enjoys warm sympathy and response from Malaysia and other countries. We are striving for a consistent objective, that is to maintain durable peace for national development cooperation, making considerable contribution to prosperity of the region and of the world as a whole.
