The U.N. Security Council must make the final decision as far as the possibility of deploying peace-keeping forces is concerned, Ardzinba said in an interview with Abkhazian television Saturday evening. Participants in the Georgian-Abkhazian talks held in Geneva on January 11-13 called for stationing Russian troops as peace-keepers on the border River Inguri. Abkhazian frontier troops must be deployed on the border alongside of the peace-keeping forces, Ardzinba said. As for Abkhazia's armed forces, their units, he noted, will be stationed in Gali District "behind international peace-keeping forces". Before the issue of deploying peace-keeping forces is settled "Abkhazia must strengthen its army and be ready to protect its territory", Ardzinba pointed out. With reference to the return of refugees to Abkhazia, the Abkhaz leader said that this will relate primarily to the inhabitants of Gali District. According to him, the Abkhaz authorities will have individual approaches to everyone who wants to return to Abkhazia. "Those with blood on their hands can hardly expect to get back to Abkhazia," he declared.
