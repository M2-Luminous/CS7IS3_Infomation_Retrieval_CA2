Ghalib 'Ali Jamil, Yemen's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, told the Kuwaiti daily Al-Siyasah: "If the Arabs and the world want Yemenis to continue slaughtering each other for 100 years, they only have to recognise the secession" of the self-declared Yemen Democratic Republic. "We will then be two countries and for decades we will devote ourselves to war, instead of development," he said, adding both sides would use oil revenues to buy arms. Civil war broke out on May 5, four years after conservative North Yemen was unified with the Marxist South. Southern leaders declared the independent republic on May 21, but it has yet to be officially recognised by any country. Jamil also criticised the adoption of a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire. "Yemen's affairs, which are strictly local, should not have been brought before the Security Council," he said.
