These figures were released by the IBGE [Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]. A diagram of Brazilian poverty levels and concentration prepared by the IBGE will be exhibited at the entrance hall of the Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] building until 10 June. The IBGE has also verified that misery exists everywhere in the country. The most developed Brazilian region -- the southeast -- has the second largest number of destitute people in the country, with a total of 2.6 million destitute families, i.e., almost 29 percent of the overall number. According to IBGE, there is great social imbalance in the southeast region. The highest levels of poverty in this region are concentrated in the states of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro, while the lowest levels are in Sao Paulo State. In absolute figures, however, the largest number of shantytowns in the country are located in Sao Paulo State -- 594 -- but only 6.8 percent of the state's population live in them. Recife, Pernambuco State, is the great champion in this sad race. Almost half of its inhabitants -- 48.8 percent -- live in shantytowns. Among the state capitals, Salvador has the lowest number of inhabitants living in shantytowns: only 4 percent. Twenty-five percent of the northeastern region destitute, or 1.2 million poor people, however, live in Bahia State. In Rio de Janeiro County, for example, 16.5 percent of the inhabitants are destitute. In Rio de Janeiro State, however, there are 661 shantytowns. In Minas Gerais State, the city with the largest number of destitute people is not Belo Horizonte but Betim, where 15.5 percent of the people live in shantytowns. According to Dora Hees, an IBGE geographer, the figures for the southern region have surprised IBGE experts: 14 percent of the overall destitute people in the country live in the region, most of them in the states of Parana and Rio Grande do Sul. Hees said: "The southern region has been revealing unexpected poverty conditions." She explained that the land distribution and modernization of agricultural production have been contributing to expelling the people from the countryside. Surprisingly, the IBGE figures show that the urban zones of the northern region have the best standard of living in the country. The largest number of destitute families in the region -- 39,638 -- live in Belem, Para State. Six and one-half percent of the Brazilian poor live in the central-western region, most of them -- 55,610 families -- in the Federal District.
