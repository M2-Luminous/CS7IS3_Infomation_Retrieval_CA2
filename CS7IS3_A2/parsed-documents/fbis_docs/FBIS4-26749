The group could potentially increase the production level to 500,000 within a few years if China's market for private cars is developed. Currently, China only makes cars for taxi and government use. PSA Peugeot Citroen joint ventures signed or under negotiation could represent more than a third of the current long-term production potential in China in association with all foreign makers. VAG (Volkswagen-Audi) is second behind PSA Peugeot Citroen in terms of expected production capacity with 450,000 units, followed by U.S. company Chrysler with 200,000, Korea's Daewoo with 150,000, and Japan's Daihatsu at 100,000. Peugeot, the second European auto maker to come to China, arrived in 1985 just after Volkswagen and is today expanding its base in Guangzhou, with the help of the city council. Guangzhou owns 46 percent of the joint venture Guangzhou Peugeot Automobile. PSA Peugeot Citroen, which owns a 22 percent stake in Guangzhou Peugeot, is in the process of completing phase two of its industrial set up, intended to bring production capacity of its 505 series to 50,000 a year. It has also negotiated the construction of a new factory with an annual capacity of 150,000 model 405 cars. Construction of the 120 hectare factory requires an investment of 600 million dollars and completion of the project before the century's end in order for Peugeot to expand along with the expected growth in the car market here. In several years, the domestic car market is forecast to triple from the current level of 550,000 cars, of which 225,000 are made locally. In Wuhan, 800 kilometers north of Guangzhou, Citroen is building two ultra-modern European-size factories which will employ 11,000 people. The factories are scheduled to go into operation in 1996 and are expected to produce 150,000 ZX cars for a total investment of five billion French francs ($910 million). The first factory in Wuhan will be devoted to assembling vehicles. The second, built in Xiangfan, 350 kilometers (217 miles) to the west, will make motors, gearboxes amd suspension systems. Citroen's double chevron logo will be associated with Dongfeng Motor Corporation, a former truck maker, which owns 70 percent of the joint venture. Citroen holds 25 percent of the company, Societe General possesses four percent, and Banque Nationale de Paris has one percent. The annual capacity of the two sites is expected to be 300,000 vehicles. The joint venture is expected to introduce the smaller AX car, intended for private customers, a market which barely exists at the moment. Despite a population of 1.2 billion, China in 1993 estimated that only 50,000 cars belonged to private individuals. Citroen and Peugeot differ from Japanese makers, who are barely present in the Chinese automobile industry, in that they agreed to major transfers of technology in order to get the contracts. The pair also expect a major local integration rate of about 60 percent, which will be closer to 100 percent near 2003 or 2004. The two companies say they would like to have separate distribution networks, which are only now beginning to develop.
