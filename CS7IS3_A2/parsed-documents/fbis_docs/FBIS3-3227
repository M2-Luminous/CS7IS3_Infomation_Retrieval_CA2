Li Ganliu said: This policy reflects the will of the people of all nationalities across the country; embodies the CPC's sincerity and goodwill; takes cares of history and reality; takes into account the interests of the people of all walks of life in Taiwan; and is in line with the national conditions and wishes of the people. Li Ganliu pointed out: Since the beginning of last year, significant changes have taken place in relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and in the situation of peaceful reunification. The mainstream in the development of the situation is a positive one, which manifests itself mainly as follows: Cross- Strait economic ties are becoming closer, and a pattern of economic and trade development characterized by mutual complementarity and mutual benefit has initially taken shape. Contacts between personnel of both sides are becoming more frequent, with the level of contact rising steadily; exchanges have entered a new stage in which extensive and in-depth discussions have been conducted in various branches of learning. Progress made in the "Wang-Ku talks" has contributed to an historic stride forward in standardizing and institutionalizing cross-Strait exchanges. Finally, the white paper on "The Taiwan Issue and China's Reunification," published in a timely manner by the State Council, demonstrates the Chinese Government's principled stand and basic principle for solving the Taiwan issue; thereby safeguarding state sovereignty and territorial integrity, solemnly repudiating the fallacies on "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," as well as "Taiwan independence," and invoking a strong response at home and abroad. "However, some new negative factors unfavorable to peaceful reunification are increasing within the island of Taiwan, enhancing obstacles to the development of cross-Strait relations." Li Ganliu said: In the past year or so, on the one hand the KMT authorities on Taiwan have continued to pursue its unpopular mainland policy to seriously interfere with the further development of cross-Strait relations and to obstruct the opening of "Three links" between the two sides; on the other hand, internationally, the KMT authorities have been pursuing more intensively their separatist policy known as "a phased two-China policy," and vigorously launched their "money offensive" and "elastic diplomacy" tactics. In particular, last year the KMT authorities escalated their activities on "returning to the United Nations" with the aim of winning "dual representation," and recently they launched their so-called "vacation diplomacy." Facts have proven that the KMT authorities on Taiwan have not changed their erroneous stand on the question of reunification at all. If this situation continues, they will never be able to free themselves from being passive, and they will become more and more isolated. Li Ganliu stressed: Mr. Sun Yat-sen pointed out long ago that "In the face of the mighty tidal current of the world, those who bow before it survive and those who resist perish." Reunifying the motherland to invigorate the Chinese nation is the common aspiration of the Chinese people, including the compatriots in Taiwan as well as the Chinese nationals overseas, and is an irresistible historical trend. If the KMT in Taiwan is not blinded by its own interest but is willing to be a responsible political party, it should put the interest of the nation above all else, conform to the trend of the times and the desire of the people, and make a correct choice. The stalling tactics it has been adopting in an attempt to seek temporary comfort and ease will not last long. Its attempt to create "two Chinas" in a disguised form by relying on foreign forces is doomed to fail. A reliable guarantee to ensure a sustained development of Taiwan's economy is to rely on the mainland and to maintain a mutually beneficial and mutually supplementary relationship with it. The KMT authorities in Taiwan should reach an appropriate conclusion after weighing the advantages and disadvantages. Li Ganliu said: China's affairs should be solved by the Chinese people themselves. The Taiwan issue is an internal affair of China. We strongly support our government's just stand in safeguarding national dignity and opposing interference by any external forces. A wise policy for the KMT authorities in Taiwan to adopt is to cast away illusion, look facts squarely in the face, change their attitude, be sincere, accept the proposal of the CPC, agree to establishing the "three links" as soon as possible, and conduct talks between the KMT and CPC. So long as consensus on the reunification of the motherland is reached, all problems can be solved through consultations. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang shares historical origins with the KMT on Taiwan, and has a responsibility to promote the reunification of the motherland. At this important juncture, we would like to sincerely offer our advice. We hope the KMT authorities in Taiwan will think carefully and make a decision in the interest of the country and nation, so as to bring a bright future for the people of Taiwan and write a new page in the annals of the KMT.
