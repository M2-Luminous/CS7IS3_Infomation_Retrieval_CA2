[Spychalska] The fundamental task that was assigned to me when I was elected chairperson was to maintain and to consolidate the organization; to improve its image and extend support for it. The union did win new supporters. During my tenure, as many as 11 new structures and over 350,000 new members joined the union. Today we have 4,782,000 unionists. However, many unionists have left us, particularly as a consequence of transformations and layoffs. [Reszka] Did the union become stronger when it was under your leadership? [Spychalska] Strength is not reflected merely in the number of members. We learned how to negotiate and hold talks. We have increasingly better and stronger arguments. [Reszka] These successes are not easily seen where the Charter of Social Guarantees is concerned, for instance. You started to talk about it with the Suchocka government and there are still no effects. [Spychalska] The negotiations on the charter really started in February of this year; however, they have been going on for too long anyway. The stand of the unionists is not adamant enough, and the government is prolonging the talks; it is not making any definite measures or clear declarations. I am getting the impression that the government is afraid of solutions, that it is afraid to make decisions of a political nature. [Reszka] Did you expect so many problems with the government, which includes so many of your political colleagues? [Spychalska] I knew that things would not be easy -- I was aware of the situation. I thought, however, that they would have more courage and determination. [Reszka] Before the elections, the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] was rather certain of its economic program. Do you feel that it is not hurrying to implement it? [Spychalska] Yes, I do. Especially as far as the equal starting point for both sectors of the economy is concerned; this is found not only in the program of SLD, but also in the program of the entire governing coalition. This was a primary issue. [Reszka] I understand that it has not been put into effect. However, before the government was formed, you formidably announced that you would not give up even one item in the SLD election program. [Spychalska] This is still the case. [Reszka] This program includes a few dozen pages full of promises... [Spychalska] ...plans that were supposed to be put into effect. What causes friction is the fact that even though we signed the program, we bear joint responsibility for it, and we are already paying the price for being in the coalition, there is still no four- year schedule for the implementation of the program. [Reszka] What price are you paying for being in SLD? [Spychalska] Sometimes our members are dissatisfied that everything is proceeding too slowly and that the government has no clear policy. [Reszka] Still, your unionists are still favorably disposed toward the government? [Spychalska] Their views are now much more moderate than they were at the beginning. [Reszka] You have travelled extensively outside Warsaw prior to the congress. Have the unionists asked you about the various promises, such as stimulating the housing sector, lifting the popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases], full implementation of the "Pact on Enterprise..." [Spychalska] These were the most important issues at those meetings and they will come back at the congress. [Reszka] But how did you respond to the unionists? [Spychalska] (after a moment of silence) Well..., I presented the actual state of affairs to them. That is, the state of affairs that is within the parliament -- because this is what I know; what the government is doing -- I do not know. [Reszka] You do not know what the government is doing? [Spychalska] Well, I do not, I have problems. I only know what the government has sent over to me in order to consult me on those issues. Therefore, I can guess that this is what the ministers may deal with next. [Reszka] The evaluation of the situation is not very good, then. It is worth recalling that in September last year you said that you would give the government three to six months of peace: "We will be trustful and restrained." Will a war with the government break out after the six months? [Spychalska] The government had six months to prepare the budget; however, it also should have used this time to prepare the foundations for the implementation of the election program. But this is still missing. This issue may be discussed quite sharply at the congress. [Reszka] Does this mean that it does not pay for OPZZ to be in SLD? [Spychalska] It generally does not pay for unionists to be in the Sejm. We were already convinced about that in the previous Sejm; however, the political situation was not stable enough for us to be able to conclude a political contract with the party: implementation of the program in return for support. I believe, however, that the presence of unionists will not be necessary in the next Sejm. [Reszka] Talking about contracts. As far as privatization is concerned, do you find your views closer to those of Sejm Deputy Pek or Minister Kaczmarek? [Spychalska] Well... middle of the road, more or less. We do not definitely oppose privatization; however, neither are we supporters of everything being for sale, of such a "total privatization." No extremes. [Reszka] You have talked about future political contracts. However, you already concluded a certain contract when you entered the structures of SLD. Do you feel deceived? [Spychalska] I feel disappointed. This program kept all of us together. The fact that it is not being implemented has put the coalition under question. [Reszka] What is OPZZ going to do, then? [Spychalska] The congress will set the specific dates. The most fundamental issue is a social agreement which must include a clear schedule of the implementation of the program. There is a chance to sign the Charter of Social Guarantees very soon. I think that at that time, the government will get not more than two or three months for the preparation of a clear schedule. If that is not done, it will mean that our presence in the coalition just does not make sense. [Reszka] Perhaps the SLD program was too simple? You spoke about stimulating the economy very soon, about tariffs, tax police... It turns out that it all cannot be achieved fast. [Spychalska] Indeed, it cannot be achieved fast. There are many factors, including the international ones... Sometimes the prescriptions were too simple indeed; however, this is a characteristic of an election campaign. One should draw conclusions from this. Resorting to oversimplifications is very often disastrous. People interpret well the information that they want and they demand that it be put into effect. [Reszka] Do you admit to mistakes? Do you think there were things you could have done better? [Spychalska] Yes, I do. A large part of the SLD program was prepared by Marek Borowski. He was the economic guru of this group and we trusted him. I sometimes read this program because I have one copy of it, with the signature of Borowski. When he was still deputy prime minister and we could not reach an agreement, I would show this program to him and say: "These are your own words and we believed you." Today we feel a little deceived. [Reszka] What would he answer? [Spychalska] "Well, you know, it was a campaign, it is only a program; I thought, but when I came here the situation was more difficult..." [Reszka] You are expressing unfavorable opinions about the government, the coalition. Is this the election campaign before the congress already? [Spychalska] No, it is not. These are facts. I am still a supporter of the idea of negotiations. I would only like the other side to treat this as we do. It is not because the congress is drawing near that I am criticizing the government. [Reszka] Aleksander Kwasniewski, leader of the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP], is publicly supporting you. [Spychalska] He is not a delegate. His statements are ill- timed, too early, and moreover, out of place, which I have told him. [Reszka] Why do you think you are a comfortable person for him? [Spychalska] Go ask him! He will not corroborate the thesis about my "being comfortable." He has enough troubles talking with me. [Reszka] Perhaps he would have even more troubles with someone else? [Spychalska] Perhaps..., but not necessarily, because people often take rather adamant stands when they are not parties to a conflict. Then they relent. I am just the way I am and I will not change. I think that one of the features of my character is that I am able to listen. This makes the other side trust and respect me. [Reszka] Spychalska belongs to the "Gray" (the seat of SdRP -- editor's note), I learned from one unionist... [Spychalska] (laughs) I am surprised. This was probably in the context of that statement by Kwasniewski. I come across many statements of the "Gray" which criticize me for being too independent. I think, therefore, that as far as my "belonging to the Gray" is concerned, the situation is rather quite the contrary. [Reszka] Is OPZZ not too dispersed? The heads of the branches reach agreements without the head of the center. Does this not place OPZZ in the position of a group of several dozen persons who do not have much influence on unionists? [Spychalska] I do not think it is a mistake. The advantage of the movement is the fact that it consists of branches and that the branches are independent. We have chosen this form of activity on purpose: independent branches and the serving role of the center. I would not feel good in a union governed by a structure based on commands. This structure works to our advantage. [Reszka] You want to sign a social agreement and you cannot order unionists to do anything. Are you a serious partner for the government? [Spychalska] Yes, we are. We can reach a consensus without issuing orders. [Reszka] I have heard the opinion that the OPZZ heads who are simultaneously Sejm deputies do not have much time left for unionists. [Spychalska] This is a fact and the most fundamental accusation. Out of six persons who are in the OPZZ leadership, five are deputies. These proportions should be more balanced. However, there are also extreme views: that the function of heading the union should not be merged with being a Sejm deputy. I am a supporter of balancing these proportions in the leadership: a group for contacts with the parliament, the government, and a group for contacts with the unionists. [Reszka] So far, no one has publicly announced that he or she would like to compete with you at the congress. Are you that strong? Are your competitors afraid of you? [Spychalska] I do not think that there are any elements of fear there. Nor do I think that I am that strong. I could point to seven or eight persons who would be excellent substitutes. I am aware of the fact that various meetings of bigger and smaller groups are being held. This is only normal. However, no one has come to me and said: "Listen, I want to run as well." This would be nice. When I decided to run for the post of the deputy chairperson, I came and said it. [Reszka] How many opponents in the elections will you have? [Spychalska] Three, I think. [Reszka] Do you predict a difficult fight. [Spychalska] I certainly do. [Reszka] Are you going to win? [Spychalska] I do not know. I am not superstitious, but this is just not certain. I think that there will not be a total attack. [Reszka] How are you going to persuade the delegates that it is you who should be elected? [Spychalska] The bargaining chip will be the concept of labor organization. [Reszka] It is so marvelous that you will be elected. [Spychalska] I do not think that it is so extraordinary, but it certainly is rational from my point of view. [Reszka] What will you do if you lose? [Spychalska] I have received many offers for interesting work -- that is not a problem. Two of them are very interesting indeed: one concerns work in the banking sector, and the other -- in journalism. It will not be a post in the government. [Reszka] Will you leave OPZZ? [Spychalska] I certainly will. I am not going to inflict myself there. [Reszka] If you win, what will change in OPZZ? [Spychalska] The organization of work. The style of the work of the center and of the units subordinated to it is a little slow. It must be an organism that reacts fast. This calls for statutory changes.
