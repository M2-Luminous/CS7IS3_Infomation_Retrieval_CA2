"Though there has been no tangible progress in North Korea-IAEA talks in Vienna, we believe North Korea will turn affirmative by the time the IAEA Board of Governors meeting opens on Feb. 21," he said. The official observed that North Korea now seems trying to make most of the inspection issue as a valued "negotiation card" in the talks on the nuclear question. He said that the question of inspecting two undeclared facilities at Yongbyon would be handled at third-round U.S.-North Korea high- level talks. However, if the North Korea-IAEA talks fail, the February IAEA Board of Governors meeting would certainly declare that the safeguard continuance of the North Korean nuclear facilities was broken, in which event the nuclear question woud unavoidably be referred to the UN Security Council, he said.
