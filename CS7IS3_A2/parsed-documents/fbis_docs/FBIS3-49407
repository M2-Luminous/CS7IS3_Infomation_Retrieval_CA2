There have recently been so many events that the Ministry of Internal Affairs has to say something about, they cannot fit into an interview. We first asked Minister Jarnjak to assess safety in the Republic of Croatia. [Jarnjak] It has been noticed that the number of the most serious crimes, such as murders, terrorist actions, or planting of bombs and explosives, has dropped compared to 1992. We are happy about this and wish to highlight it as the main characteristic of 1993. We can say that safety is better than in the previous years. Clearly, there has also been less war conflict. It must be pointed out that we have had two tourist seasons, in which not even the slightest incident has occurred, so that we can say that Croatia is a stable low-risk country. The remark made by the Italian minister of internal affairs during the meeting in Italy in June 1993 that Italian citizens know that Croatia is safer than Italy is interesting in this context. [Barisic] Still, some towns are more dangerous than others, Split for example. [Jarnjak] The Ministry of Internal Affairs makes a list of everything that happens in the country every month. Based on this information we plan our actions and personnel changes, if necessary. After we had discussed these monthly reports we realized that the situation in Split is worse than the Croatian average, which was the signal for us to respond to this situation. The first thing we did was to improve the personnel structure. We took a series of measures, among other things we dismissed the then chairman of the Police Department for Split and Dalmatia, but the new one did not achieve the expected results, either. Then we brought a third man and gave him until the end of 1993 as a deadline to create order. We also took preventive and repressive actions, we brought several hundred policemen from other parts of Croatia to Split to help their colleagues, especially at border crossings and in Dubrovnik. After that, 500 new policemen came to help establish order. Split is a distinct area from many aspects, primarily because of refugees, but living in the city no longer entails any great risk, but is like any other town in Croatia. I think that safety in Split is improving and that it will soon be above the Croatian average. [Barisic] What do you think about the border between Croatia and Herceg-Bosna as far as smuggling and economic crimes are concerned? [Jarnjak] This is a very complex question. As the deputy minister of internal affairs, I met with representatives of the Croatian communes in Bosnia-Herzegovina as far back as 1991. We discussed this problem and reached the agreement -- according to the proposal by President Tudjman -- to establish some kind of border because the Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovia kept on buying various goods, especially gasoline, in Croatia. That kind of border was not a problem for honest people, but smuggling developed into a big problem here. Legal stipulations favored it since the taking of goods to Herceg-Bosna was treated as a classic export, which could not be controlled. After this stipulation became ineffective, this border became like any other; the crime is here no bigger than at any other border crossing. It was at this border that we achieved good cooperation between the police, the customs and the finance police. I think that we have established good cooperation with Mr. Prlic, the prime minister of Herceg-Bosna, and with Mr. Coric, the minister of internal affairs, by a recent agreement, which is already showing the first results. This is now a flexible, open border, but nevertheless everything is under control. [Barisic] What are relations between the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Croatia and the institutions of Herceg-Bosna like? [Jarnjak] The Ministry of Internal Affairs and, I dare say, me, as the minister, did everything we could to help our Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina defend themselves. We are now helping them in organizing their police from the point of view of logistics, personnel and organization. We visited the border crossings in 1991 and talked to the people who are now high-ranking officials in Herceg-Bosna about the preparation of the defense strategy. I informed Mr. Tudjman on these talks and asked him to help us define the best way to help them. The president supported our ideas so we founded a training center, and this was visited by Croats from the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We made a program in the Ministry of Internal Affairs that included an 11-day course organized in Makarska. This program can be compared to a spider's web; several people who wanted to become local commanders in their Croatian place in Bosnia attended the course. They were taught to organize themselves and make units. I would like to point out that these courses were organized as early as 1991 -- while there was peace there. Approximately 1,500 people attended these courses. They have been in charge of the defense of Herceg-Bosna from the very beginning. When the first group completed the course and went to Bosnia-Herzegovina, they were sworn in by Mate Boban on behalf of Herceg-Bosna, and by me on behalf of Croatia. These courses were secret because these people were not to be discovered. I told you all these things to show you that our cooperation dates back to 1991. I would like to add that we did not interfere with the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state; we simply did not want to allow Croatian regions to remain unprepared for defense. [Barisic] What do you think about the documents published in the press accusing Tomislav Mercep, an adviser at the Ministry of Internal Affairs? [Jarnjak] I do not think that he is being charged with something, he is only being accused, because he can be charged with something only by the attorney general. It is correct that during the investigation of the murder in the Zec family some people made very broad statements and told us things we did not know before. The collected material was forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General. The outcome of the trial for murder is well known, but we as the Ministry of Internal Affairs have no right and we do not want to comment on decisions made by courts. After I read the article in GLOBUS, I first tried to find out whether the Ministry of Internal Affairs gave any kind of information about this case and asked the Ministry employees to make written reports. I learned that the Zagreb Police Department reported on this case in the second half of December 1991 at the request of the Office for the Protection of the Constitutional Order, and there are documents about it. We wrote our report in three copies: One was left at the Zagreb Police Department, and two were forwarded to the aforementioned office. The complete case was submitted to the attorney general for further procedure. This means that the police accomplished its part of the task. As far as concerns the question how our report reached the public, I have to say that I examined the Ministry employees; all persons who could have somehow had access to the report, or had any knowledge on it, were asked to make written reports. They stated, with moral and financial accountability, that none of them enabled anybody to come to this information. [Barisic] Does this mean that this information leaked out from the Office for the Protection of the Constitutional Order? [Jarnjak] I do not know where the information came from, but I would like to point out that according to written reports it did not come out from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Should it be proven during the investigation that one of the Ministry employees made a false statement, the consequences are clear, regardless of who this person is. The Ministry of Internal Affairs will not tolerate the removal of documents marked as "state secret." I would like to stress -- no matter who this person is. Not because the public should not be informed, but because the case has been handled by the attorney general, in which case the Ministry of Internal Affairs can be involved only upon order of the attorney general if necessitated by some additional information. From this point of view it is clear that Ministry employees are not allowed to bring information into circulation. These are the facts and the genesis of the whole case. Personally, I think that the person who spread this information did not have good intentions. If he wanted to stimulate the functioning of the constitutional state, it would have been enough if he had told the attorney general and judicial authorities to handle the case, since the attorney general is not obliged to accept all information received from the police. For this reason there is a division of power into the executive, judicial and legislative. I think that the attorney general should have responded and stated whether there was material for bringing a charge against Mercep or not. We do not want to protect anybody, but nobody can be blackened by information at a point when the deed has not yet been proven. It is also bad to pull this case out of the context of 1991 and look at it from the perspective of 1993. I do not want to excuse the committed crimes, the law has to be respected, but the law has to respected also as far as the spreading of confidential information is concerned. I shall always support correct work. We know which institutions could have treated this case and which we could have contacted if we wanted to do Croatia good. I think that the person who spread this information did no good either to the individuals connected with this case or to the state. I condemn such methods. [Barisic] How many applications for Croatian citizenship were refused and why? [Jarnjak] We received 527,581 applications, and 25,493 applications were rejected, mostly because the formal conditions were not met. It is important to know that numerous people came to Croatia as refugees and that many of them asked for Croatian citizenship. It is clear that the applicants who have not lived in Croatia for at least five years were refused. A small number of applicants were refused for other reasons, so that the number of negative applications is not that big taking into consideration the total number of applications. [Barisic] The Serbian People's Party constantly stresses, however, that the Serbs have problems in obtaining Croatian citizenship. [Jarnjak] Whenever the Serbian People's Party asked us for an explanation in a case, we reconsidered it and responded. I cannot speak in general about dissatisfaction because there are examples that some associations submitted lists consisting of 150 people who were allegedly refused Croatian citizenship, and more than half of them never asked for it. For this reason I cannot accept general accusations of the type that Serbs, for example, have problems with it. Also Croats have problems. Very indicative is the following information. Up to now 2,483 Croats have asked to renounce their Croatian citizenship, whereas only 82 Serbs have made such an application. There are rumors that the Serbs do not feel like leaving Croatia, and I can say that there are no significant reasons why they should feel like leaving Croatia. This is a sign that the constitutional state is functioning. You have to admit that it was not easy to solve all these cases in one or two years. The Ministry of Internal Affairs worked in four shifts, day and night, we entered all applicants into the computer (we have the data stored on diskettes now); we created a data base for Croatia. Some data still have to be checked, but we have a data base. At the beginning people had to wait for a long time for their documents, but we do not have this problem any more. It is normal that there are people who cannot obtain Croatian citizenship. There is not such a state in the world that would give everybody citizenship. In some states people wait for years. Admittedly, it is a special situation, but I have to repeat that in most cases only those applicants were refused who did not fulfill the basic conditions. These people are entitled to appeal before the Administrative Court. If this court makes a positive decision, we carry it out immediately. [Barisic] What is the national structure of the Ministry of Internal Affairs employees? [Jarnjak] There are 93 percent Croats, 4.7 percent Serbs, 1.3 Muslims and 1 percent others. [Barisic] This structure will probably change if Manolic's proposal that members of Martic's units enter the Croatian police is accepted. [Jarnjak] Croatian citizens of Serbian nationality will join the Croatian police; not every applicant, only those who meet the criteria established by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. This means that they will have to pass certain tests. We cannot accept a criminal or a person who has already been convicted. Apart from that, Croatian policemen are required to have appropriate education. Not everybody is entitled to be a Croatian policeman. These criteria will be applied to future policemen of the Serbian nationality. Nobody can be admitted without having fulfilled these conditions, otherwise the professional level of the Croatian police could fall below the level we need. [Barisic] The administrative law on the rights of minorities provides the possibility of autonomous police in Glina and Knin. [Jarnjak] We are prepared to organize also these police forces, we have established police departments in these communes and we have plans on how to organize the work in the police stations in all the places that should have them: Petrinja, Glina, Knin, Topusko, Vukovar, Beli Manastir, Okucani.... When the conditions are met, we shall organize the police's work there: border control, maintenance of law and order as well as all the other tasks that the Croatian police has to perform. According to the administrative law from 1991 the police forces in these places should be formed according to the national structure of the population. We shall respect this law. [Barisic] Which international organizations was the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Croatia admitted to and what is the cooperation with these organizations like? [Jarnjak] We were only interested in Interpol, which we joined in 1992. Our cooperation with Interpol members is good and useful. Interpol works according to the principle that the member states within an area sign bilateral agreements on cooperation in the prevention of crime in general. We have signed such an agreement with Slovenia, Italy, Hungary, Ukraine, and Albania. Apart from that, we have signed a protocol with Slovakia. Now we have to sign such agreements with other close countries, such as Austria, Germany and others. The everyday cooperation with close countries is good, especially in stamping out organized crime. We have already had several successes in actions with the police of the neighboring countries. [Barisic] What is cooperation like with the police of the Muslim part of Bosnia-Herzegovina? Can you comment on the rumors that Zagreb is the largest logistics base for the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is fiercely attacking the Croatian enclaves in Central Bosnia? [Jarnjak] From time to time the Croatian police checks the work of humanitarian organizations as possible logistics centers. The people who work there must have legal status in Croatia, in order to prevent illegal acts or crime that could affect the sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia. There might be various rumors, but these are the facts. [Barisic] What are the priority tasks of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the next period? [Jarnjak] We have the necessary personnel and the technical equipment now. We shall now have to solve the problem of our facilities, because our police stations and even department offices do not have appropriate accommodation. As far as other priorities are concerned, we shall especially insist on the high quality of police work. We shall work on the further education of our staff. Further on, we shall have to improve the discipline, there must be no incidents whatsoever. In short, we shall make our police professional; the Croatian policeman must be a correct and kind professional, loyal to his state and his people, regardless of his working conditions and the place in which he works.
