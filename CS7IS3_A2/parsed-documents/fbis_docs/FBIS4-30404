FBIS4-30404 "dreas123__a94008" FBIS-EAS-94-123-A Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan SDPJ Divided Over Returning to Coalition SDPJ Divided Over Returning to Coalition OW2406132694 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2406132694 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] will hold an extraordinary session of the Central Executive Committee in the morning of 24 June to make a final coordination of intra-party opinion on whether the SDPJ should return to the ruling coalition or not. The SDPJ believes that if it decides to return to the ruling coalition as a result of a top-level meeting between SDPJ Chairman Murayama and Prime Minister Hata, the Hata cabinet would resign en masse. The ruling coalition parties and the SDPJ have failed to reach an agreement on how to reform the current tax system. The SDPJ aims for an early agreement with the ruling coalition parties on reforming the current tax system after holding the intra-party debate again. Some SDPJ members are still showing strong resistance to raising the consumption tax and it remains unclear if the intra-party coordination of opinion on the issue will go smoothly. If a situation is created wherein talks between the SDPJ and the ruling coalition parties run into rough sailing, centrists and leftists in the SDPJ, who are cautious about the SDPJ's return to the ruling coalition, will certainly react against the SDPJ's return to the ruling coalition. The SDPJ leadership is likely to be hard-pressed to run the party. How many members of the SDPJ will vote for or abstain from the vote on a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet has become a focal point as the talks between the ruling coalition parties and the SDPJ have entered a final stage. Members of "Taiyo" [Sun], a policy study group formed by leftists in the SDPJ, have suggested that they would vote for the no-confidence motion or abstain from the vote in a backlash to the SDPJ's move to return to the ruling coalition. Former SDPJ Secretary General Tsuruo Yamakuchi and Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDPJ Diet Affairs Committee, who are known to be cautious about the SDPJ's return to the ruling coalition, met with Chairman Murayama at the Diet in the afternoon of 23 June to ask the latter not to make an easy compromise with the ruling coalition parties. Mindful of the moves within Sakigake [Harbinger] and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to back Murayama as the prime minister, they told Murayama, "if you are backed as a candidate for prime minister, you should run for the post." SDPJ legislators Tadatoshi Akiba, Hideko Ito, and Seiichi Kaneta have issued an emergency statement opposing the SDPJ's unprincipled return to the ruling coalition" and handed Chairman Murayama the statement. Ten SDPJ legislators including Yamakuchi have signed the statement. There is a view within the SDPJ that the emerging intra- party caution about the SDPJ's return to the ruling coalition would heighten depending on the outcome of talks between the ruling coalition parties and the SDPJ, and the heightened caution would affect the adoption of the no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet in the Diet Meanwhile, rightists in the SDPJ are saying that since the prime minister has expressed his willingness to make his cabinet resign en masse on the premise that the SDPJ returns to the ruling coalition, "there is no just cause to vote for the no-confidence motion."
