The announcement was made by Sandro Kavsadze, Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze's envoy, after the talks with Abkhazia held at the Russian Foreign Ministry and mediated by a representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on Friday. "The Georgian side categorically refuses to differentiate between the refugees as to who took part in the war and who did not because the bloody conflict has involved almost the entire population, including Georgians, Abkhazians and other nations," Kavsadze said.
