Vanuatu Public Service Association (VPSA) coordinator Joseph Watsuh said his union may pull out of the Vanuatu Council of Trade Unions (VCTU) because it had failed to support his members in court. Watsuh said he was satisfied with the judgement of the Vanuatu Supreme Court but the union was disappointed no member of the VCTU had attended the hearing. "VCTU put us in a difficult situation, and it looks like they don't back us when we're in trouble", Watsuh said. [passage omitted] "We'll meet with the VPSA executive," Watsuh said, adding: "In the meantime, we might decide not to follow any more calls from the VCTU." The four defendants sentenced Friday were among 50 arrested by police when violence broke out at a picket in a government building here on Tuesday after the VCTU called a general strike.
