It concerned Russia's granaries, which are allegedly empty. Grain reception enterprises, according to Cheshinskiy's rumors, have already bought all the Russian peasants' grain surpluses at the former extremely low price of 90,000 rubles [R] a tonne on average. Wheat from state resources is now being used. And since it costs R200,000 a tonne owing to spending on storage, transport cost, and "jacked up" interest rates, you can expect a rise in the price of your daily bread. Arkadiy Gurevich, director of the "Roskhleboprodukt" Joint-Stock Company's Market Conditions and Pricing Analytical-Information Center, confirmed the planned rise by the end of the year in the price of Russians' basic food -- to at least 1,000 RUBLES A LOAF. He based this sorry idea on the fact that prices of fuel and energy resources are "rocketing" in turn as a result of which reception, cleaning, and drying of grain are more costly. Plus storage costs.... But, according to Gurevich, the Ministry of Agriculture is still taking on a great deal. When he made his statement Cheshinskiy was evidently taking into consideration the fact that the ministry had informed agrarian specialists at local level of so-called advised rough prices for harvest 1994 grain. And these guidelines are over twice as much as last year's. For instance, peasants will be demanding R220,000-250,000 per tonne of food wheat. Insofar as beginning this coming fall, grain that is more costly from the outset will be coming in for processing, "Roskhleboprodukt" considers it its duty to prepare Russia for the new prices of the finished bread. This stance on the part of "Roskhleboprodukt" leaders has caused indignation within the Ministry of Agriculture. People there categorically deny giving agricultural enterprises any advice about the specific prices of this harvest's grain. What is more, some of the ministry's leading specialists view Cheshinskiy's move as gross indiscretion on the part of a commercial agent who regards a Russian peasant's tractor as a free ride. They think that grain farmers will naturally sell the new harvest's grain at a higher price than in previous years. But Cheshinskiy intends to give them only a fourth of the 1,000-ruble loaf of the future. And that is daylight robbery. Incidentally, of this R1,000 the cost of processing accounts for at most R100, delivery accounts for another R100, and R50 is the trading outlet's share.... Together with the cost of the raw material, that is to say the actual grain, the above expenditure on bread production totals, according to Agriculture Ministry economists' rough estimates, not R1,000 but merely R500. And it is clear who will get the other R500 demanded from the customer and where it will go. I am talking about "Roskhleboprodukt," which has a fortune of its own. Nothing to do with the state. Many people in the ministry are puzzled as to why this commercial and essentially private structure has been accorded the function of state buyer for grain procurement. "Roskhleboprodukt" is moreover being given the role of monopolist agent between the grower and the miller and then the customer. Were this and other middlemen to be taken out of the picture, Russian foodstuffs, bread included, would be 40 percent cheaper. The picture looks strange. Leonid Cheshinskiy hinted that the motherland's granaries are already empty. Some other sources of information attest that there is nonetheless almost 18 million tonnes of grain in these granaries -- almost six months' supply. Yet the silos and, even more so, the barns out in the countryside are brimming with grain, and, being last year's grain it is consequently cheap. Why then is "Roskhleboprodukt" scaring us today with the thought of tomorrow's prices of our main foodstuff? There is the view that the firm wants to get preferential loans from the state for the coming procurement campaign without waiting for the harvest. In all self-respecting countries grain production and the grain question in general is an area of state policy. Apart from perhaps present-day Russia where the state has given up the "palm" in this business to a commercial structure. But what if our motherland's granaries become a private storehouse? Then you will really see what prices will do. And do not grumble about it.
