Qian, also chairman of the Preliminary Work Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, made the remark at a reception in honor of Hong Kong and Macao deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this evening. He said that the Chinese Government has the determination, confidence and ability to realize smooth transfer of the sovereignty over Hong Kong and maintain the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong because "Hong Kong's prosperity in the past was created by Hong Kong people mainly consisting of Chinese" and "Hong Kong people can administer Hong Kong well." At the same time, the determination and confidence rest with that "our policy precedes from the reality of Hong Kong, and with the fact that the mainland's reform and opening up policies are producing positive influence on Hong Kong's economic development," he said. He said that on the eve of the opening of the current NPC session, the British Hong Kong authorities tabled to the Hong Kong Legislative Council (Legco) the remaining parts of Chris Patten's "political reform bill" for discussion. This is another unilateral act to sabotage Sino-British cooperation by the British side after the Legco passed Chris Patten's partial political reform bill and the British side first publicized the content of Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political structure in a White Book. Qian said though the British side talked loudly about cooperation with China, the acts and deeds of the British Government on the Hong Kong issue have shown the very opposite. "We cannot hold any illusion on this issue any longer," he said. He said that China today is no longer what it was in the 1840's. "The day when Chinese people were subordinated to the oppression and humiliation of foreign colonists has gone forever." He said that the elaboration on the Hong Kong issue in Premier Li Peng's Government Work Report is the solemn declaration of this firm stand of the Chinese Government and people. "Now, we are going to join the Hong Kong compatriots who love the motherland and Hong Kong and rely on our own efforts to ensure the smooth transition of power and long-term prosperity of Hong Kong," he said.
