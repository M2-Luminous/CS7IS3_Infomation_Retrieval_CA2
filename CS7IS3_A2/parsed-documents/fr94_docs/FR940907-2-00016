ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces will hold a closed meeting on Wednesday, September 14, 1994, from 9:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m. in Pentagon Room 2E687A, Washington, DC. The Commission meeting will consist of a briefing from the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Army discussing operational missions of the United States Army. Material to be presented and discussed will consist of both classified and unclassified information in a format that makes it impractical to separate the two. In accordance with Section 552b(c)(1) of Title 5 U.S.C., disclosure of such classified information would be contrary to the interests of national defense; therefore, this meeting will be closed to the public. Extraordinary circumstances created by scheduling conflicts compel notice of this meeting to be posted in less than the 15 day requirement. For further information, contact 1LT Michael Bob Starr, (703) 696&hyph;4250. Dated: September 1, 1994. Patricia L. Toppings, Alternate OSD Federal Register Liaison Officer, Department of Defense.
