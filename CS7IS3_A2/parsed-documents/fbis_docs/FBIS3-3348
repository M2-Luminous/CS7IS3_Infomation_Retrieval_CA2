Security Council. Hosokawa told a news conference he expressed "strong concern" in talks with Chinese leaders that the inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency ended insufficiently and the dialogue between Seoul and Pyongyang failed. He refused to comment on specific actions Japan will take if the issue is brought to the Security Council. "But generally speaking, if some kind of action is decided at the U.N. Security Council, Japan will consider a responsible way to cope," Hosokawa said. He said China plays an important role because it has deep relations with North Korea and he strongly urged the Chinese Government during talks with the Chinese leaders to play a major role in solving the North Korean nuclear problem. Hosokawa, currently on a three-day visit to China which started Saturday, held talks with President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng prior to the press conference at the Beijing New Century Hotel. He said he could have "frank discussions" with the Chinese leaders on issues such as North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons, Japan-China cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, disarmament, arms control and human rights. Hosokawa said he wants to build future-oriented relations with China based on Japan's remorse for its wartime actions. In talks with Li earlier in the day, Hosokawa referred to his policy speech in August in which he expressed "deep remorse and apologies for the fact that past Japanese actions, including aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for so many people." Li welcomed Hosokawa's remarks, telling him it was the "most frank and sincere attitude" he has ever heard, according to Japanese officials. The prime minister told the news conference he agreed with the Chinese leaders that the two nations will make efforts to further develop economic and diplomatic relations between the two sides. Hosokawa said he did not think the Chinese leaders have "objections" to his view that human rights are a "universal value recognized by the international community." He declined to comment, though, on a row between China and the United States over China's human rights record. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who visited China earlier this month, urged China to improve its human rights record as a condition for extending most-favored-nation trade status with Beijing. Hosokawa also declined to comment on specifics, such as the treatment of pro-democracy activists. In talks with Li on Saturday, Hosokawa called for improvement in China's human rights record by referring to a declaration adopted at an international conference on human rights held last June in Vienna. The declaration notes that promotion and protection of human rights are legitimate items for concern for the international community.
