It Will Advocate `Moderate Reformist' Positions"] [Text] Each political crisis in Russia over the past few years has invariably been accompanied by rumors, talk and "fairly authoritative" statements about the creation of a certain pro-reform "super-party" led by Boris Yeltsin. Moreover, the president himself has repeatedly stressed the need for forming such a structure. As a rule, things did not move beyond the talking stage. Now, however, rumors about a "presidential party" seem to be materializing. The formation of the "super-party" will be the concern of regional "committees in support of the Russian Federation's first president," advocating "moderate reformist-democratic positions," and structures of the President Foundation led by well-known democratic movement activist Lev Shemayev. No doubt, the president's administration and some executive power structures will also make a contribution to creating a presidential party. According to Nikolay Medvedev, chief of the Russian Federation presidential administration's Directorate for Liaison with the Territories, some time at the end of February the groups taking the initiative on founding a presidential party will hold their first meeting in Samara. It will be attended by representatives from Samara, Ulyanovsk, Saratov, Penza, Volgograd, Ryazan, and Moscow. In particular one of the delegates from the Moscow branch will be the president's representative in Moscow, Vladimir Kamchatov, who was unsuccessful in contesting a seat in the Federation Council. In Shemayev's opinion, the Samara conference will become the first stage in the formation of grass-roots structures of the presidential party. According to Shemayev, the main task of the future party is to look for an idea capable of rallying all the healthy forces in Russia. This idea will serve as a basis for the party program, while the program itself is most likely to be of an economic rather than political character, presenting a concept for the country's economic development for the next 10 to 15 years. It is expected that along with rank and file members, representatives of the enterprise directors corps and of banking and commercial structures will also join the party. Medvedev did not rule out that the centrist-minded members of democratically oriented parties and movements, including Russia's Choice, may "insist that their programs be adjusted in line with the current political and economic realities," as a result of which part of the pro-reform association participants may affiliate with the presidential party. At the same time Lev Shemayev said he doubted that such politicians as Gennadiy Burbulis, Sergey Shakhray, or Arkadiy Volskiy will have anything to do with the leadership of the future super-party. According to Lev Shemayev, the emerging party is going to nominate Boris Yeltsin as candidate in the next presidential elections. The leadership of the majority of democratic parties and movements has so far not reacted in any way to the possible appearance of a presidential party. Meanwhile Sergey Shakhray, chairman of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, noted that the only way to ensure the speedy creation of the presidential party is to organize the entire vertical executive structure as a party structure. According to Shakhray, such a course of events can lead to "purges" in the state apparatus and a weakened executive branch.
