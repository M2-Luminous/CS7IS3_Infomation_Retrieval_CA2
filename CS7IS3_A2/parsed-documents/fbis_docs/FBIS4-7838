Three weeks ago, during the withdrawal of the Serbian artillery from the vicinity of Sarajevo, rumors appeared that General Ratko Mladic's "career was over." The same sources--people close to the military and political leadership of the republic of Srpska [RS]--quickly denied their own story. Few people, however, failed to notice that General Mladic has been seen less and less often in public, and that his chief of staff, General Manojlo Milovanovic, is speaking up more and more often. In the latter's appearances, a certain "dropping of the ball" has been evident, that is, a certain spirit of conciliation that has underlined Mladic's uncompromising attitude even more. After all, the acceptance of NATO's ultimatum, wrapped up in the guise of a Russian diplomatic initiative, had to appear to Mladic like a personal defeat. On 10 February 1994, he stated to the newspaper VOJSKA (the Army of Yugoslavia's organ): "As far as I am concerned, the war will symbolically be over for me when the Muslims surrender their weapons to me in the same Volunteer Street (the center of Sarajevo) in which they committed a disgraceful attack and crime against the former JNA's [Yugoslav People's Army] military column." Theoretician Mladic showed that he had not given up this position just a few days before the expiration of the ultimatum, when he suddenly came out with the assertion that the RS army, which had then already begun to withdraw, would not withdraw. The episode with the ultimatum, in addition to being a good illustration of Mladic's attitudes, also indicates the outlines of the extent of his influence. Specifically, the final withdrawal could not be started, in spite of Karadzic's acceptance of the obligation, before Mladic talked with Vitaliy Churkin in Belgrade in the Federal Assembly's offices on Thursday, 17 February, three days before the expiration of the ultimatum. They say that the general was very furious and quite unpleasant to that emissary, who made it clear to him that he had to withdraw or suffer very serious consequences. In the end, however, he had to accept the demand. Where does Mladic get so much power that international negotiators' direct contact with this general is essential for the success of an agreement that has already been accepted by the RS's political leadership? The fact is that Ratko Mladic is a legend among the Bosnian Serbs. He began to gain his fame back during the war in the Krajina by carrying out rapid and harsh offensive actions. He also used the same approach in pushing through the corridor that was a sine qua non for the survival of the RS. There is no doubt that Mladic is a competent officer. He is considered to be one of the few people in the former JNA who studied Clausewitz, Sun Tsu Wu, and other theoreticians in detail. He did not limit himself to just planning operations, however: He often sat in an armored vehicle himself and led the attack. With these and similar steps, he succeeded in establishing himself among the people as "a Serbian officer of the old school." Back in Knin he was also inclined toward political maneuvering, and he continued to follow that course after his transfer to Bosnia. Many people think that he most used his influence for political purposes during last year's Bijeljina session, and then the Pale session, of the RS Assembly, when the Vance-Owen plan was rejected. At that time Zeljko "Arkan" Raznjatovic showered Mladic with abuse, accusing him of "ordering the deputies to reject the plan" accepted by Slobodan Milosevic and the Serbian leadership. The fact that all of that did not shake Mladic's position shows that no matter how skillful he is, this general is not just acting on his own behalf. Sources close to the RS military and political leadership claim that Ratko Mladic is actually a very direct champion of part of the Army of Yugoslavia's military leadership. According to those sources, Radovan Karadzic's influence over the RS army is negligible. Allegedly, through Mladic part of Yugoslavia's military leadership is ensuring that it keeps considerable autonomy from Federal Republic of Yugoslavia political structures. If influential circles in the Army of Yugoslavia really want to keep at least partial political influence and relative independence from the civilian authorities, there is nothing more useful for those purposes than the existence of the war conflagration in Bosnia. Those circumstances immeasurably increase the army's importance and ensure that it has influence over the adoption of political decisions that depend to a great extent on the assessments offered by military circles. The downing of the aircraft over Bosnia is introducing new elements in this story. Although it turned out, according to the UN's findings, that the four aircraft took off from the Udbina airport in the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK], it is hard to believe that it all happened without the RS army's involvement. Airport Furthermore, several hours after the aircraft were shot down, artillery fire was opened against Tuzla. There was a fierce response to it, at a time when a political agreement on opening the Tuzla airport was already on the way. That was later confirmed in Moscow, once again in spite of Mladic's explicit opposition. "In connection with the story about intervention, people are asking me why I did not allow UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] tanks to come to Bosnia and why the Serbian side is opposing the opening of the Tuzla airport.... But when they land planes in Tuzla, that will be an open threat against Belgrade as well! It is a `step by step' occupation," Mladic told VOJSKA. In spite of everything, however, there are no signs that any sort of campaign is being started against Mladic. In a way there is still a sort of balance of power and the conflict is not too severe. One analyst has described all the recent steps by the RS that do not follow Milosevic's and Karadzic's policy as "petty malice." The military structures both here and in the RS will hardly venture to engage in any more serious confrontation. Their financial position, in fact, is such that they are extremely dependent upon the state budget. The bond announced a month ago for the RS army has allegedly collected 200,000 German marks. The amount appears large, but it is only enough for a tank battalion (27 tanks) to operate for two days. On the other hand, Mladic's popularity and the support of part of the military establishment are securing his position for the time being, provided that there is no serious clash with the Serbian leadership. "Someone will hardly make a decision to replace Mladic as long as the war is going on," says one person familiar with the situation in Bosnia.
