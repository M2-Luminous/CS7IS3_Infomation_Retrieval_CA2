FR940216-0-00246 FR940216-0-00010 (i) An estimate of the quality, composition and volume of its 1990 gasoline, or allowable substitute, based on the requirements specified in §§80.91 through 80.93; and (ii) Its baseline emissions values calculated per paragraph (f) of this section; and (iii) Its 1990&hyph;1993 blendstock-to-gasoline ratios calculated per §80.102. (2)(i) The quality and composition of the 1990 gasoline of a refinery, refiner or importer, as applicable, shall be the set of values of the following fuel parameters: benzene content; aromatic content; olefin content; sulfur content; distillation temperature at 50 and 90 percent by volume evaporated; percent evaporated at 200 ○F and 300 ○F; oxygen content; RVP. (ii) A refiner, per paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, shall also determine the API gravity of its 1990 gasoline. (3) The methodology outlined in this section shall be followed in determining a baseline value for each fuel parameter listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (b) Requirements for refiners, blenders and importers _(1) Requirements for producers of gasoline and gasoline blendstocks. (i) A refinery engaged in the production of gasoline blendstocks from crude oil and/or crude oil derivatives, and the subsequent mixing of those blendstocks to form gasoline, shall have its baseline fuel parameter values determined from Method 1, 2 and/or 3-type data as described in paragraph (c) of this section, provided the refinery was in operation for at least 6 months in 1990. (ii) A refinery which was in operation for at least 6 months in 1990, was shut down after 1990, and which restarts after June 15, 1994, and for which insufficient 1990 and post-1990 data was collected prior to January 1, 1995 from which to determine an individual baseline, shall have the values listed in paragraph (c)(5) of this section as its individual baseline parameters. (iii) A refinery which was in operation for less than 6 months in 1990 shall have the values listed in paragraph (c)(5) of this section as its individual baseline parameters. (2) Requirements for producers or importers of gasoline blendstocks only. A refiner or importer of gasoline blendstocks which did not produce or import gasoline in 1990 and which produces or imports post-1994 gasoline shall have the values listed in paragraph (c)(5) of this section as its individual baseline parameters. (3) Requirements for purchasers of gasoline and/or gasoline blendstocks. (i) A refiner or refinery, as applicable, solely engaged in the production of gasoline from gasoline blendstocks and/or gasoline which are simply purchased and blended to form gasoline shall have its individual baseline determined using Method 1-type data (per paragraph (c) of this section) from every batch of 1990 gasoline. (ii) If Method 1-type data on every batch of the refiner's or refinery's 1990 gasoline does not exist, that refiner or refinery shall have the values listed in paragraph (c)(5) of this section as its individual baseline parameters. (4) Requirements for importers of gasoline and/or gasoline blendstocks. (i) An importer of gasoline shall determine an individual baseline value for each fuel parameter listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section using Method 1-type data on every batch of gasoline imported by that importer into the United States in 1990. (ii) An importer which is also a foreign refiner must determine its individual baseline using Method 1, 2 and/or 3-type data (per paragraph (c) of this section) if it imported at least 75 percent, by volume, of the gasoline produced at its foreign refinery in 1990 into the United States in 1990. (iii) An importer which cannot meet the criteria of paragraphs (b)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section for baseline determination shall have the parameter values listed in paragraph (c)(5) of this section as its individual baseline parameter values. (5) Requirements for exporters of gasoline and/or gasoline blendstocks. A refiner shall not include quality or volume data on its 1990 exports of gasoline blendstocks or gasoline in its baseline determination. (c) Data types _(1) Method 1-type data. (i) Method 1-type data shall consist of quality (composition and property data) and volume records of gasoline produced in or shipped from the refinery in 1990, excluding exported gasoline. The measured fuel parameter values and volumes of batches, or shipments if not batch blended, shall be used except that data on produced gasoline which was also shipped shall be included only once. (ii) Gasoline blendstock which left a facility in 1990 and which could become gasoline solely upon the addition of oxygenate shall be included in the baseline determination. (A) Fuel parameter values of such blendstock shall be accounted for as if the gasoline blendstock were blended with ten (10.0) volume percent ethanol. (B) If the refiner or importer can provide evidence that such gasoline blendstock was not blended per paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, and that such gasoline blendstock was blended with another oxygenate or a different volume of ethanol, the fuel parameter values of the final gasoline (including oxygenate) shall be included in the baseline determination.
