You may recall the interview at the start of the week on Network Africa, with the country's minister of natural resources, Monyane Moleleki, who had been briefly detained and released along with three other ministers by dissident soldiers. They also shot dead the deputy prime minister, Selometsi Baholo. Well, it now seems that these ministers and others may well have left the country for nearby Botswana. Veronique Edwardes is in Lesotho at the moment, and on the line to Maseru I asked her what she has been able to find out about the ministers' whereabouts. [Begin recording] [Edwardes] The government came out with a statement saying these ministers had actually left to go to this country on ministerial duties and will be returning back to the country as soon as they finish what they were supposed to do. [Gerard] So, you are saying that the government has now actually commented on the ministers leaving? [Edwardes] Yes they have, and this leaves a lot of questions unanswered, because most people are asking the questions, if these ministers were supposed to go out on ministerial duties as the government now has now has come out with a statement to this effect, why did they leave in such a hurry, and why leave at night, and why were the officers not informed? Because I went to most of the offices of these ministers, apparently their secretaries did not even know that the ministers were out of the country, and at some point I even met some of the bodyguards of some of these ministers who had dutifully turned up for their duties and did not even realize that theirs ministers were not available. [Gerard] So, just to clarify, Veronique, are we talking about five ministers who have gone to Botswana? [Edwardes] I noticed about five or six ministers that are unaccounted for, the minister of natural resources, Mr. Moleleki; the minister of education, Mr. Mosisili; the minister of information and broadcasting, Malie; the minister justice, Mr. Albert Malope; and then the minister of trade, industry and tourism, who is the brother of the prime minister, Mr. Shakhane Mokhehle, and the prime minister is away. The minister of health is away, so you have a skeleton of a cabinet left, with?three ministers and a junior minister who was just employed last week. [Gerard] So, where did the statement from the government come from? Who actually made it? [Edwardes] The information came from the permanent secretary from the Ministry of Information last evening, and it was very short, and nobody really expanded more on what he had to say other than that these ministers were out on official duties and that they will be returning. [Gerard] Can you describe first the atmosphere in Maseru at the moment, given these rather strange goings on, and still in the aftermath of the shock of the assassination of the deputy prime minister? [Edwardes] In the towns and cities people do not care much as long as they are not directly by it, or if they are not personally affected by what is going on. This is what is really amazing, because on the surface of it, the people look very docile as if they don't care about what is going on, but deep down, when you talk to people you would know that they are worried, they are afraid, they don't know what is going to happen, and there are so many questions that they would like the government to answer.
