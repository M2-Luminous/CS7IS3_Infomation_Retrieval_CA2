Last Tuesday and Wednesday the city of Zahedan witnessed an all-out war. A group of armed men who were apparently protesting the destruction of a Sunni mosque in Mashhad began demonstrating against the regime in a mosque in the center of Zahedan. JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI's correspondent reports that they tore Islamic Republic flags and chanted slogans against the leaders of the Islamic government. At the same time, revolution guards and policemen, who had prepared the city for a celebration of the anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeyni's arrival in Iran, fired on the demonstrators and received return fire from them. For about half a day Khayyam Street in the center of the city of Zahedan and the surrounding areas became a complete war zone and the scene of heavy fighting. Several residents of the city told news correspondents that the windows of their homes had been broken by bullets. IRNA gave no further details, but it insisted that the demonstrators are counterrevolutionaries and that these incidents mostly take place on the days of the anniversary of the revolution, and it added: The hezbollah nation resisted the counterrevolutionaries, and despite the situation that developed, the ceremonies were held. Figures on the numbers killed and wounded have not yet been published. Reliable reports from the province of Khuzestan also tell of an atmosphere of unrest that is worrisome for the regime. Last week a group making contact with news agencies and Iranian and foreign publications reported mass arrests of their friends and associates. On the other hand, the Islamic Republic Government published a statement according to which national and army officials have the direct permission of the president of the republic to leave the country at any time. The issuance of such an order by the government, in view of the existing circumstances in Iran, indicates various kinds of problems. Based on reports received from Iran, the unrest in Zahedan began when a report was received from Mashhad that the regime intended to destroy the Sunni mosque in Mashhad. The protest against this began initially with a gathering that took political sanctuary in Zahedan's Maki Mosque, and then it led to a demonstration where attacks were made against the decorations, lamps, and placards, which were made to mark the beginning of the Ten Days of Dawn celebration. In this attack two revolutionary guardsmen were killed and several of them were wounded. According to the newsletter of the expatriate organization HEZB-E MELLAT-E IRAN, Mowlavi 'Abdolhamid, Friday Imam of Zahedan, is one of the wounded. His wounds are said to be "severe." Talks with Mowlavi 'Abdolhamid by the Islamic Republic's representatives, who had come from Tehran to calm the unrest, ended with no result. In the midst of this, 'Ali Khamene'i, commander in chief of the armed forces, appointed 'Ali Mohammad Basharati to replace him for three years on the police force so the regime will be better able to resist uprisings. The Islamic government also staged a demonstration on its own behalf in Zahedan. In this demonstration the regime's mercenaries chanted slogans in favor of the government and against what they called counterrevolutionaries.
