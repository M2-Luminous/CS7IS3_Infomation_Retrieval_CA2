The minister said he had met with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin before leaving on the visits and called these meetings "rich in content." Kozyrev said the prime minister was "determined to maintain financial discipline, even restrict it, and limit spending and loans." Kozyrev said Chernomyrdin intended to attend to the European Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to explain Russia's economic policy there. "We are planning considerable steps to streamline the economic reforms," he pointed out. The foreign minister said he believed it a big mistake of Moscow's western partners and friends to wait for the failure of reforms in Russia. "It is necessary to make real business and help the Russian reforms instead of waiting for the scenario of the end of the world to come," he said. In an answer to an Interfax question, Kozyrev said his political views had seen no changes. "Kozyrev is still the same," the minister said. "He still supports good-neighborly relations with the Baltic states and an organized withdrawal of (Russian - IF note) troops on the basis of agreements rather than cries about occupants, etc., what I call political hysteria. But he still supports observing human rights." At the same time, Kozyrev regretted that the Baltic states "were going further along the way of violating human rights." Among such violations, the minister indicated the "attempt to deport dozens of thousands people" from Latvia and "possibly Estonia."
