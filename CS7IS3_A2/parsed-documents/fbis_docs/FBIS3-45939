The river originates from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Its upper reaches are within China where it is called the Lancang River, while its lower reaches are called Mekong River, running through Laos, Myanmar (the former Burma) and Thailand. Ding Weimin, an official of the Department of Communications of Yunnan Provincial Government said at today's opening of the meeting that expert groups of the four countries all made proposals to their own governments after they made a joint survey tour of the river last year, February to May, urging that an agreement on opening the river to navigation should be signed as soon as possible. During the four-day meeting, representatives from the four countries will thoroughly discuss a draft of the agreement. After the meeting, the participants will go to make a further survey of a section of the river. A source from the meeting said that the results of the Sino-Lao- Myanmar-Thai joint survey last year showed that a 60-ton vessel can negotiate the river all year round and a 150-ton one can use the river for eight months a year. If the river is dredged, 300-ton vessels would be able to use the river all the year round.
