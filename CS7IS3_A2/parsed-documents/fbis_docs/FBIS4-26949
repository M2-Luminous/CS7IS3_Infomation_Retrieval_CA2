The latest report from the customs authorities shows that China's bonded zones have played a vital role over the past few years in the development of export processing, overseas trade and services, such as packaging, transport, storage and exhibition. It also shows that up to the end of March this year, of the 5,813 firms approved to enter the zones, 3,404 are foreign-funded ones, accounting for 59 percent of the total, with an overall investment of 8.8 billion U.S. dollars including 3.4 billion of foreign investment. Total exports and imports in the 13 zones have reached 1.74 billion U.S. dollars, including 100 million U.S. dollars in transit trade; goods processed in the zones were worth 200 million U.S. dollars, including one billion U.S. dollar worth of goods in bonded warehouses. Starting in 1991, China has built tax-free zones in 13 coastal cities, covering a total of 17.62 sq km. According to the forum, great achievements have been made since the founding of bonded zones, but much remains to be done to abide by international practices. Customs authorities and relevant governmental departments urged the streamlining of management institutions according to the international rule of free trade and simplifying of customs formalities. The forum said that all goods can pass through the zones freely except for those banned by the state. The storage of commodities such as pesticides, fertilizer and refined oil is encouraged. It said that the internal tax levy system will also be readjusted and foreign currency is allowed to circulate in the bonded zones.
