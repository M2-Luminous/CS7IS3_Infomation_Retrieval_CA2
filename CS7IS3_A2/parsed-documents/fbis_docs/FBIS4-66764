Algiers--Sitting right on the sidewalk, a group of adolescents was quietly playing dominoes. From the nearby mosque could be heard the chant of the muezzin calling the faithful to evening prayers. The city was calm. Algiers was winding down as though nothing had happened. As though death were another story. Helene Saint-Raymond, a nun belonging to the Little Sisters of the Assumption, and Henri Verges, a Marist priest, were very familiar with the city. Sister Helene, 67, arrived here in 1968, while Father Verges, 64, came in 1969. Both were perfect Arabic scholars, and they worked at the Ben Cheneb Library in the upper Casbah--one of the few places were lycee students from the neighborhood could gain access to books at the cost of a few dinars. It was there, in their office, "practically before the eyes of the young people," that they were shot to death in the early afternoon. Their assailants, "two young terrorists armed with automatic pistols," according to the French-language daily EL WATAN, managed to escape. "We are stunned. I can't find words," sighed one of their priest friends, who himself has lived for many years in one of those "working class" suburbs--meaning "deprived" suburbs and therefore commonly regarded as bastions of armed Islamism. In all, it is estimated that there are more than 400 French Catholic religious scattered around the territory. "I pay attention, yes, of course," the old priest added. But how can one defend oneself in this lethal lottery that has claimed over 3,000 victims nationwide in the past two years? By restricting one's movements as much as possible, avoiding "high-risk" neighborhoods, and constantly changing one's residence and the routes one takes. But those rules can be followed only by a tiny minority of privileged individuals, whether Algerian or French. Obviously, French religious are not in that category. March for `Dialogue' Like the some 20,000 registered individuals with dual nationality, the majority of whom are French women married to Algerians and in many cases residents themselves of the "working class" neighborhoods, Catholic religious are easy prey for the supporters of terrorism. The shock here is tremendous. Because they are French and Christian, members of the French religious communities are the best possible targets from the standpoint of attracting media attention. The death of two of their number provides tragic confirmation of what many people were refusing to see: neither divine providence nor neighborliness protects foreigners. The massacre of 12 Croatian nationals--of Christian origin--in the Tamezguida region east of Algiers last 14 December profoundly shocked the Catholic community. But it did not convince them of the need to pack up and leave. Pending the return of Algiers Archbishop Tessier, who was in Rome at the time, no public statement was issued in Algiers. The spokesman for the French Government, Nicolas Sarkozy, said that "Algeria is currently one of the most serious topics of concern for the prime minister." In Algiers, the Ministry of Interior firmly condemned the double murder and gave assurances that the perpetrators would be "found and punished." It added that Algeria, "famous for its hospitality and its respect for human life, is not and will never be [the Algeria] of murderers." This new tragedy in the Casbah--where French cameraman Olivier Quemener was killed last 1 February--occurred barely two hours after the conclusion of the silent march in support of "dialogue" and "reconciliation" that had been organized by about 10 political parties, including the FLN [National Liberation Front] (formerly the single party) and such "moderate" Islamist movements as Hamas, Ennahdha, and former President Ahmed Ben Bella's MDA [Algerian Movement for Democracy]. Is that proximity in time and space (the Casbah is right next to Martyrs Square, where the demonstration ended) a coincidence? According to the most probable theory, the murder of the two religious could be the work of "radical" Islamists hostile to all "dialogue" with the government and eager to remind people of their presence following the "clean-up" operations carried out by security forces in the main cities in the Algiers region. But extremist "bearded ones" are not the only ones opposing the potential negotiations that the historic leaders of the former Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) have reportedly begun in secret with the military hierarchy now in power. Some of the French-language newspapers have not hesitated to denounce the "march of shame" and harshly criticize the "conservatives" who, under the pretext of dialogue, are calling on the nation to "shake the hands of terrorists." Judging from what the newspapers say, the demonstration by the "reconcilers" attracted only 20,000 people in Algiers, compared to the 100,000 who were expected. While the daily LE MATIN mocks what it regards as a "fiasco," its rival newspaper LIBERTE sums things up in a terse headline: "The People Did Not March."
