FR940617-1-00038 FR940617-1-00012 The agency agrees that antibacterial or antiseptic personal cleanser products are practical for home use, to help prevent cross contamination from one person to another, especially after diaper changing and caring for invalids or ill family members. The agency also agrees with one comment that claims relating to general health-care and personal hygiene similar to the claims allowed for health-care personnel handwashes may be suitable because such claims explain the uses of these products in lay terms. In the Federal Register of July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644), the agency separated the first aid antiseptic uses of OTC topical antimicrobial drug products from the ``non-first aid uses.'' In that document, the agency proposed that the following terms and categories be deleted: skin antiseptics, skin wound protectants, and skin wound cleansers; and the agency proposed that the appropriate labeling, instead, be included in a new category called ``first aid antiseptics'' (56 FR 33644 at 33649). Several uses proposed by one comment, i.e., ``minute cuts and abrasions from shaving and other minor traumas,'' are considered as describing ``first aid uses'' and are adequately covered by the labeling provided for ``first aid antiseptics'' in proposed §333.50(b) (56 FR 33677), which contains the following: ``First aid to help'' (select one of the following: ``prevent,'' (``decrease'' (``the risk of'' or ``the chance of'')), (``reduce'' (``the risk of'' or ``the chance of'')), ``guard against,'' or ``protect against'') (select one of the following: ``infection,'' ``bacterial contamination,'' or ``skin infection'') ``in minor cuts, scrapes, and burns.'' The agency believes that the first aid indication is sufficiently broad to cover minute cuts and abrasions from shaving and that it is not necessary to include the words ``other minor traumas'' in the indications statement. Beyond the first aid uses described in the first comment, the agency recognizes a need for an OTC ``antiseptic handwash'' product for repeated or daily use over an extended period of time for some of the other uses described by the comment. The agency agrees with the comments that health-care personnel handwashes are appropriate for such use because submitted data from effectiveness studies, for uses subject to this rulemaking, were derived from handwashing tests similar to or the same as tests described in the agency's previously proposed testing guidelines (see 43 FR 1210 at 1240), i.e., ``Modified Cade Procedure,'' ``Glove Juice Test,'' and ``Test for Health-Care Personnel Handwash Effectiveness.'' The agency is proposing in this tentative final monograph in §333.455(a) that a health-care personnel handwash can also bear a statement of identity of ``antiseptic handwash.'' (See section I.B., comment 3.) For products labeled for multiple uses including both antiseptic handwash and first aid labeling claims, the general statement of identity would be ``antiseptic'' as described in section I.B., comment 3. The product would then need to incorporate the monograph labeling for both antiseptic handwash as well as first aid antiseptic. The term ``cleanser'' included in claims requested by the comments is not appropriate in this rulemaking because it is considered to be a cosmetic claim in view of the fact that the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) defines a cosmetic as ``articles intended to be *␣*␣* applied to the human body *␣*␣* for cleansing *␣*␣*'' (21 U.S.C. 321(i)(1)) and thus may be misleading to consumers. As discussed in section I.I., comment 19, the terms ``microbicidal'' and ``germicidal'' may appear in the labeling of OTC antiseptic drug products under certain conditions. Accordingly, the agency is proposing as the indication for products bearing the statement of identity ``antiseptic handwash'' a general claim similar to one recommended by one of the comments, i.e., ``for handwashing to decrease bacteria on the skin.'' The agency has determined that this claim may, at the manufacturer's option, be followed by one or more of the following examples: ``after changing diapers,'' ``after assisting ill persons,'' or ``before contact with a person under medical care or treatment.'' Descriptive statements such as ``contains antibacterial ingredients'' and ``for the purpose of promoting good individual and family hygiene'' are considered to be examples of statements not significantly related to the safe and effective use of the product and thus are outside the scope of the rulemaking. Such statements may be included in the labeling of these OTC drug products subject to the statutory provisions against false or misleading labeling. The agency has determined that the indication proposed for antiseptic handwash drug products is also appropriate for health-care personnel handwashes and is also proposing the following indication for health-care personnel handwashes. ``For handwashing to decrease bacteria on the skin'' (which may be followed by one or more of the following: ``after changing diapers,'' ``after assisting ill persons,'' or ``before contact with a person under medical care or treatment.'') In addition to the indication proposed above, the agency is proposing that health-care personnel handwashes may also bear the following indication: ``Handwash to help reduce bacteria that potentially can cause disease.'' The agency is proposing the statement ``recommended for repeated use'' as an ``other allowable indication'' for antiseptic or health-care personnel handwash drug products (see below). The agency sees no reason to continue to include ``antimicrobial soap'' as a separate product category. Soap is considered to be a dosage form, and specific dosage forms are not being included in the monograph unless there is a particular safety or efficacy reason for doing so. Antimicrobial ingredients may be formulated as soaps for some of the uses discussed in this document, e.g., handwash; however, the designation ``antimicrobial soap'' is no longer being proposed for inclusion in the monograph. In addition, the agency considers the other product categories that are being proposed to be more informative to the users of these products. Based upon the comments, the agency is proposing labeling appropriate for professional or consumer uses as follows: Section 333.455␣Labeling of Antiseptic Handwash or Health-Care Personnel Handwash Drug Products. (a) Statement of identity. The labeling of the product contains the established name of the drug, if any, and identifies the product as an ``antiseptic,'' as stated above under §333.450(a), and/or ``antiseptic handwash,'' or ``health-care personnel handwash.'' (b) Indications. *␣*␣* (1) For products labeled as a health-care personnel handwash. ``Handwash to help reduce bacteria that potentially can cause disease'' or ``For handwashing to decrease bacteria on the skin'' (which may be followed by one or more of the following: ``after changing diapers,'' ``after assisting ill persons,'' or ``before contact with a person under medical care or treatment.'') (2) For products labeled as an antiseptic handwash. ``For handwashing to decrease bacteria on the skin'' (which may be followed by one or more of the following: ``after changing diapers,'' ``after assisting ill persons,'' or ``before contact with a person under medical care or treatment.'')
