These people specifically insisted that I outline my thoughts regarding the possibility of restoring a military- dictatorial government in the event the alliance formed to support my candidacy were to win the elections. On previous occasions and through other means, I have had the opportunity to refer to the topic. I have pointed out that one factor must be taken into consideration: the internal transformation -- which was unthinkable in other times -- that has taken place within the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] regarding its operation. In spite of the complexity of its statutes based on a difficult community organization, we have complied with all steps required for the democratic selection of candidates. Unrestricted nominations and direct and secret elections led to an internal mobilization to a degree never seen before. To this effect, I am proud to say that the custom of choosing leaders and candidates from outside the party according to the likes or dislikes of the chiefs of military zones has been surpassed. This has led to a democratic practice that strengthens party organization; thus the PRD has become an important factor in the consolidation of the system. My fellow party members and I are aware that access to state leadership is only possible and desirable through respect for and compliance with the rules of political coexistence. At the proper moment, we rejected all attempts to disturb institutional order through acts of force or riots that tried to change the structure of the state or stability. More than once, we firmly said that any political or military adventure that sought to shorten the presidential term of Guillermo Endara would be openly rejected by our party. This led to severe criticism by some politicized groups for which such a criteria "extended the life of Endara's government" and led -- according to them -- to a sort of suicide because all hopes for redeeming the country were reduced to an electoral result. That was the same time at which the proposal for a constituent assembly was promoted, based on the erroneous idea that it could direct the course of events and substantially change the country's situation if the legitimacy of the government was questioned. The aforementioned facts show that the PRD decided to take political action within the system, with clean and open cards and with a sincere admission of the errors that at one fateful moment isolated the party from the majority of the nation. Within the PRD, we feel a noble and healthy pride at having surmounted such difficult stages and at having reached a new democratizing conscience that, in just four years, has turned it into an obligated point of reference at the hour of describing the national situation. Meanwhile, there is no military group that, for reason of any political force, can reassume direction and control of public functions. Nobody in Panama has that ability to garner nationwide support. No one can lead all the driving forces of the nation to establish autocratic governments that do not comply with the norms of political and social coexistence. To this effect, I think that any president, party, union, or group that tries to substitute the laws of political consensus with a government that has unrestrained power will be left without the national support necessary for its legitimization. Consequently, its possibilities for ruling will be reduced to a minimum. There is currently no political or social condition that will allow the existence of autocratic or dictatorial governments. Even at the international level, there is no room for new radical experiments, given that the collective conscience abroad emphasizes the new paths man must follow, greatly concerned over his rights and freedom, without forgetting the urgent social needs that have been increasing in recent years. Therefore, I point out that the democratic organization should try to improve so it will likewise have the ability to offer true solutions to the people with fewer resources and will grant them the educational instruments to develop in today's complex society. The only thing that we ask is that the rules of the game not be changed; that it be accepted that we exist; that we participate in the system; that we are prepared to win; and that our government is completely feasible. It is a simple duty of understanding the reality of the country in a mature manner and with a sense of responsibility.
