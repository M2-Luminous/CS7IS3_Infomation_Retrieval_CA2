FR940804-1-00020 FR940804-1-00009 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 226 [Docket No. 940701&hyph;4201; I.D. 113093B] Designated Critical Habitat; Johnson's Seagrass AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: NMFS is proposing to designate critical habitat for Johnson's seagrass ( Halophila johnsonii ) pursuant to section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Because the subject matter of this proposed rule is closely related to a proposal published on September 15, 1993 (58 FR 48326), to list Johnson's seagrass as a threatened species, NMFS is announcing a public hearing to consider both proposed rules. NMFS is also reopening the comment period for the proposed rule to list Johnson's seagrass. The hearing will be held September 20, 1994, in Vero Beach, FL. Johnson's seagrass is found on the east coast of Florida from Sebastian Inlet to central Biscayne Bay. Within this range, five areas in proximity to Sebastian Inlet, Ft. Pierce Inlet, St. Lucie Inlet, Jupiter Inlet and Lake Worth Inlet are proposed for critical habitat. In addition, the proposed critical habitat designation identifies those physical and biological features of the habitat that are essential to the conservation of the species and that may require special management consideration or protection. The economic and other impacts resulting from this critical habitat designation, over and above those arising from the listing of the species under the ESA, are expected to be minimal. The designation of proposed critical habitat provides explicit notice to Federal agencies and the public that these areas and features are vital to the conservation of the species. DATES: Comments on both proposed rules must be received by October 13, 1994. The public hearing will be held on Tuesday, September 20, 1994, at 7:30 p.m. ADDRESSES: Send comments and requests for the environmental assessment on the proposed designation of critical habitat and the status review for listing Johnson's seagrass to Dr. William W. Fox, Jr., Director, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910. The public hearing will be held in the Commission Chambers of the Indian River County Administration Building, 1840 25th Street, Vero Beach, FL. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Margaret C. Lorenz, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 301/713&hyph;2322, or Colleen Coogan, Southeast Region, NMFS, 813/893&hyph;3366.
