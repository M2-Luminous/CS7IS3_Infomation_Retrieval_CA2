Does that mean that you have provoked a new "war at the top"? [Bugaj] It is true that the Sejm acted on our recommendation, although I had mixed feelings about it because, in my opinion, the main difficulty was that the president's initiative could have delayed the progress of the ongoing work on the new Constitution. I believe that we must have a new Constitution in good time before the presidential election, but the president appears to think otherwise. On the other hand, as regards the "war at the top" question, I think that such a war could indeed be waged, but not necessarily for the above-mentioned reason. If the president were to stand at the head of the dissatisfied masses, could lead a war against the parliamentary majority, but that war would not necessarily be directed against us because we too dislike the policies of the present government. [Onichimowski] It is said that four fundamental areas in the life of a state are crucial for its existence and survival. Let us try to evaluate the current state of affairs in each of these areas. The first of them is external security. [Bugaj] The situation here is not felicitous. In the past year, we have noted unmistakable attempts to rebuild elements of Russia's imperial policies and a far-reaching skepticism on the part of our Western partners as regards the chances of their involvement in any operations designed to protect our security. I do not want to say that they are doing nothing at all in that direction, but they are certainly most restrained, if not reticent. Of course, there is no immediate reason to sound the alarm: The situation is far from wonderful, but it is not overly dramatic, either. Everything is still in our hands: We can and should decide ourselves whether our state is to be internally strong and cohesive, whether our citizens can be satisfied with their government and their parliament, and whether our economy is capable of producing surplus resources with which to finance adequate national defense so that we can rest safely in the knowledge that the situation in that area is not deteriorating. [Onichimowski] The second sphere of concern is our internal security. [Bugaj] Here a very considerable deterioration took place over the past years. Some people believe that this should be counteracted primarily by building up the numeric strength of our police force. Unfortunately, this will require substantial funds, but we should shape our policies so as to restrict and eradicate the root causes of social pathology. After all, we do not have enough resources to provide three policemen to patrol every street corner and enough police presence to watch every house in every area. The causes of the mounting incidence of crime are to be found in the widening gap between different groups' financial circumstances, and also in the growing unemployment.... It is no accident that people can walk everywhere in perfect safety in the streets of Scandinavian cities. [Onichimowski] The rising incidence of tuberculosis in our society is not a favorable reflection on our successive governments' record in the area of health protection, is it? [Bugaj] In this respect, we are, in my opinion, on the eve of the introduction of a substantial and much-needed reform, which, however, is still waiting to be put into practice. [Onichimowski] Instead, there has been much discussion about it for many years now.... [Bugaj] I agree with you: Much is said, and nothing happens. All that is happening at present is that the health service's budget is being reduced, money is being taken away from vital health services, and there are no visible signs of progress in organizational actions or the construction of a rational financial system for the sector. I find the present situation deplorable. It is most probably being continuously compounded by the repeated changes of health ministers and by the fact that we still have no public-service system, which would go on working and discharging its duties regardless of the constantly changing political configurations. [Onichimowski] And, finally, the fourth sector. It is paradoxical that the standards of education, the unrestricted availability of cultural goods, and the general level of civilizational development attained under the Polish People's Republic was instrumental in overthrowing that regime, whereas our new sociopolitical system has brought a pronounced regression in all of these areas. [Bujak] If we are to discuss the realm of culture, we must admit that in certain areas state patronage was far from rational: It was geared a little too obviously to the promotion of specific ideological messages. Unfortunately, the state's withdrawal from its patronage role has been too drastic. On the other hand, education definitely needs funds urgently, and that money must be found somewhere. I believe that, regardless of the reasons for the present state of affairs, we have already moved past the worst depression in this area, and there is some hope that the situation will gradually improve. [Onichimowski] To conclude, let us touch on a subject close to your own heart: privatization. What do you think of the proposal to recall Deputy Bogdan Pek from his post of chairman of the Sejm Commission for Ownership Transformations? [Bugaj] I am emphatically against this idea. Even if Deputy Pek has at times been clumsily "undiplomatic" in his attempts to investigate the truth and counteract the pathological phenomena that abound in the field of privatization, he has nevertheless demonstrated real integrity and determination in uncovering such instances and battling against them. If he were to be recalled, it would be a symbolic act pointing clearly to the Sejm majority's intention to cover up for and protect those guilty of suspect practices. From what I know of the privatization process, there is much questionable activity associated with it, so we should stop viewing it entirely theoretically and instead begin taking pragmatic action. We certainly need to increase parliamentary control over these processes. [Onichimowski] Thank you for talking to us.
