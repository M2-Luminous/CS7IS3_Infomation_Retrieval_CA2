Kyaw Min, minister of mines; Vice Admiral Than Nyunt, minister of health; Brigadier General Myo Thant, minister of information; Colonel Pe Thein, minister of education; U Soe Tha, minister of communications, post, and telegraph; responsible officials from the Office of the SLORC; directors general and managing directors from departments concerned; and other responsible officials. [passage omitted] Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt and his entourage proceeded to the Northern Military Command headquarters where they were welcomed by Kachin national leaders. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, SLORC secretary-1; and Major General Saw Lwin, chairman of Kachin State Law and Order Restoration Council and commander of the Northern Command, then held a separate meeting with the KIO [Kachin Independence Organization] leaders -- U Mali Zut Zaw Mai, U Lamon Tu Jai, U Gori Zaw Saing --and intermediaries -- U Lawan, U Sabwegyun, and U Khun Myat in the office of the commander. [passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Khin Nyunt] Today can be described as an auspicious day for the Union of Myanmar [Burma], for the entire national people, for Kachin State, and for the indigenous people residing in Kachin State. I describe today as auspicious because the peace talks between our SLORC delegation and the KIO delegation have reached a successful conclusion [nyein-chan-ye sway-ne-hmu aungmyinhmu ya de achay-ahne myo yauk te atwet]. This is attributed to our mutual consultations and talks following the state's goodwill invitation to the armed organizations in the jungle to return to the legal fold. The KIO held honest and sincere talks after realizing the genuine goodwill of the state. Following these talks, our two sides reached an understanding and we were able to realize peace as a result. [end recording] Continuing, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that since Myanmar's independence 40 years ago, there has been armed conflict with the KIO for over 30 years due to differences of views. However, conditions have changed under the SLORC administration. He said there can be a problem in a family due to differences of opinion among the family members, but such a problem is only temporary and they are not antagonisms which last for a lifetime. He said it is our conviction that the time has come for indigenous people to reunite and reconcile. Therefore, the SLORC has invited the indigenous armed organizations to return to the legal fold. He said the two sides have reached agreements and achieved peace because the KIO, which welcomed the government's invitation, has held honest and sincere talks with mutual understanding. [Begin Khin Nyunt recording] We have reached this stage. So, what do we do for the next stage? We must work for progress and development of the Kachin State and the ministers and senior departmental heads have come along with me to do this work. We will work for the progress and development of Kachin State with these persons. I estimate that Kachin State has lagged behind in development for over 20 years. We will all work in unison with momentum and cooperate in order to make up for the backwardness. The government will provide assistance and the indigenous people residing in the Kachin State as well as the KIO must cooperate. I dare say that if the three sides cooperate and work in unison, the development of Kachin State, which has lagged behind, will accelerate. [end recording] Continuing, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that in setting priorities for development projects, priority will first be given to construction of roads and bridges, opening of hospitals and clinics under the health sector and schools under the education sector, and promotion of appropriate technology and crops which are suitable to local conditions under the agriculture and livestock breeding sector. He said there is plenty of land suitable for forestry and cultivation of crops in Kachin State, but land has not been cultivated due to armed conflict. If these lands are reclaimed and put under cultivation, the economy of the state will develop at an accelerated rate. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that endeavors for national development schemes and national unity during the SLORC administration of over five years are known to all. Endeavors are being made with the objective of developing Myanmar into a modern and developed nation on one hand, while efforts are being made for the emergence of a firm constitution while upholding the three cardinal causes -- nondisintegration of the union, nondisintegration of national unity, and perpetuation of national sovereignty. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that priority is being given to border region development with a view to promoting unity among national people while drug eradication is also carried out. At the same time, he explained, the state has been working for peace with genuine goodwill by inviting the armed organizations in the jungle to return to the legal fold. He said mutual understanding has been reached with the KIO today and that outstanding success has been achieved and he attributed the success to the mutual goodwill and sincere efforts of the state government and the KIO. He said he believed that peace could certainly be achieved if the remaining Karen, Mon, and Karenni armed organizations in the jungles hold frank, cordial, and sincere talks with the state government with genuine goodwill. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that the KIO will have to continue to work in order to participate legally in the process of emerging a firm constitution. He said once there is a constitution, Kachin State will be led by Kachin nationals and other states will be led by their nationals concerned. In order to have such leadership, it is necessary for all nationals to participate in working for a firm constitution. Continuing, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that the National Convention has obtained 104 basic principles on which such a firm constitution should be based and that panel discussions are being held to discuss details of the basic principles relating to each chapter. Once the discussions are completed, [the reports] will be submitted to a plenary session of the National Convention. Details relating to the 104 basic principles such as the chapter heading on the state, state structure, and head of state are currently under discussion. He said the KIO needs to observe the National Convention. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said the ministers and departmental heads in his entourage have prepared for the development of Kachin State. He disclosed that the Ministry of Progress of Border Areas and National Races and Development Affairs has allocated over kyat 20 million for building Myitkyina-Tanai-Nanyun Road, Mogaung-Kamaing-Longin Road, Hopin-Kontha-Nyaungbin Road and that electric generators, motor vehicles, and assistance have been collected for distribution. He said priority will be given to agriculture in working to develop Kachin State and the state will provide technology, machinery, seeds, and fertilizers in the areas where the state wants the KIO to give priority. If the peasants work hard the development of Kachin State, which has fertile lands, will accelerate. He said the state will set up economic enterprises which are viable. He explained that as Kachin State becomes peaceful and prosperous, travel throughout the state will become possible and international tourism will develop. He said international tourists will be interested in Indawgyi region and confluence point [of Irrawaddy River] and if these areas are made attactive, the development will take place in a short time. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that if the people of Kachin State endeavor and work together in unity, and if the KIO cooperates in areas where it is able, then Kachin State will certainly develop. In conclusion, he said, the SLORC is striving with genuine goodwill to reestablish solidarity among the national peoples, ensure the perpetuation of national sovereignty, prevent any loss of national independence, and strive toward the emergence of a modern and developed nation. He said now that the KIO has joined hands with the SLORC in these endeavors, there will be greater momentum in our work. He said he could see that the Union of Myanmar will emerge as a modern and developed nation in the near future if the remaining indigenous armed organizations come to realize the genuine goodwill of the national government, as the KIO has, and work hand in hand with honesty and sincerity. Therefore, he said, the time has now come for the national peoples and indigenous armed organizations to join hands with the state government with genuine goodwill, the correct attitude, and honesty. Next, Kachin national leader U Zaw Mai [KIO deputy chairman] delivered a speech. He said the KIO took up arms and went underground in the jungle in 1960-61 when its demands for the rights the Kachins lost prior to 1962 and during the era of the AFPFL [Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League] government were rejected. He said there was a plan to establish a separate state at that time. After much political experience, however, we conducted a review to determine whether our policy was correct. We then adopted a policy of not seceding from the union. But there are still groups that have not accepted this decision. They are observing the situation. They will gradually develop faith in the government when they witness the success of projects carried out with genuine goodwill by the state government. [Begin Zaw Mai recording] What kind of goodwill does the SLORC government currently have toward the country? We will observe whether these are only words or if they are carried out in practice. I have studied the state leaders' speeches in detail. I have also studied the radio and newspapers as well as the (?personalities). Only after four or five years, the SLORC government's goodwill toward the national peoples and the nation. [sentence as heard] Of course, there is one thing: The SLORC government is human; we are all human. We cannot say everything done by humans is correct and complete. Then there was the state government's invitation to the armed organizations in the jungles to come out and hold talks. They went to the extent of saying that if we did not like it we could go back and continue to fight. At first, I thought they could possibly be correct. U Bran Seng, our chairman, submitted it to the Central Committee, and it was discussed thoroughly at the central level. We deliberated whether the time had come to make peace; whether it was supported by the people. The government side welcomed it, but what was the people's view? We deliberated for two years, considering what our views were toward the present government. We sent people throughout Kachin State. We sent them everywhere -- Putao, (Hopet), Tanai, Mogaung, Mohnyin, Bhamo, Shwegu, and the Kachin region in Northern Shan State -- and asked for the people's views. We did not ask everyone. We asked people who had political knowledge or were interested in politics. These people included veteran politicians, former senior public servants, and educated people. The general view was that the situation was good, and we were urged to try. We were advised to watch what they were doing, and if it did not work to go back to the jungle, as allowed by the Myanmar Government side. We were urged to try, and our Central Committee took the matter under consideration. After that, our Central Committee adopted a policy that said: Do not promise what you cannot fulfill, but once a promise is made follow through; that is, do not go back on your word. Once we decided to undertake something, we must implement it accurately. Once we decided to undertake something, we must adopt a policy -- a plan -- on how to proceed from one step to another. We must set a goal. We adopted a policy of participating in some capacity in an endeavor to obtain genuine peace and establish a new nation. It is believed that a peaceful and prosperous Kachin State will contribute to the union. We decided to begin in accordance with this policy. Now it has been over a year since we began the peace talks with the government. The government and our intermediaries -- three people -- patiently initiated this work. That is why, at this moment, I would like to say that I will work for the peace and prosperity of the entire Kachin State as well as the peace and prosperity of the entire union. [end recording] Maj. Gen. Saw Lwin, commander and chairman of the Kachin State Law and Order Restoration Council, then explained about the renovation and construction of roads and bridges in Kachin State. After his explanation, the secretary-1 presented gifts to the Kachin national leaders and took a group photograph with them. The State Law and Order Restoration Council, with a view to reestablishing national unity and building peace, held sincere and frank talks with the KIO delegation that were marked by perseverance and mutual effort. The two sides held five rounds of talks in 1993 in Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin State. Understandings and agreements on a cease-fire were reached on the morning of 23 February 1994 [apyit-akhat yat-saing-ye saing-yar nar le thabawtunhyi-hmu-myar ko]. In the evening, Maj. Gen. Saw Lwin, commander and chairman of the Kachin State Law and Order Restoration Council, hosted a dinner at the Malihka Mansion in honor of the secretary-1, ministers, and national leaders.
