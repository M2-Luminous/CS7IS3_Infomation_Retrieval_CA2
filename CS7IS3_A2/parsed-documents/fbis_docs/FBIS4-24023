Its task would be to stop the rotting process from affecting the healthy parts of Free State society and then to build on them into the future, OFS Premier Patrick Lekota said in his state of the nation address at the second sitting of the Provincial Legislature in Bloemfontein on Monday [20 June]. Mr Lekota said that since the election there had been a pattern of events that suggested there were several conceptions of the meaning of freedom. These conceptions differed from that of the legislature and of that of the negotiators and authors of the interim Constitution and violated the provisions of that Constitution. It was a conception that could only be described as a "general free-for-all, dog-eat-dog and the devil gets the hindmost". That was the only way to describe the wholesale plunder and theft of movable public property, the vandalism of immovable property, unauthorised occupancy of public buildings, the setting up of kangaroo courts in the jurisdiction of recognised traditional leaders, the extortion of monetary contributions to fake funeral funds by dubious characters masquerading as activists of well-known political parties/organisations and the commandeering of minibus taxis by groups of thieves, bent on selfish motives, said the premier. Mr Lekota said there was deep concern with the wholesale occupation of property of individual farmers, property developers, church property and that of business. This destroyed black and white property owners alike. While sensitive to the plight of deprived communities, this approach could not be encouraged. It was a violation of rights enshrined in the Constitution. He said that in QwaQwa there were people who had occupied public homes before the election. Proper rental had not been collected from the occupants because of the ineptitude of those who had composed the political leadership. This situation had been inherited by the new government, but it could not allow it to continue. Urgent steps had to be taken by the minister for local government to negotiate proper rental and ensure that it was paid. A second category of illegal occupants of public property were those who took advantage of the uncertainty of transition after the election. People who were using public facilities for private gain had to vacate these facilities with immediate effect or the legislature would be compelled to act against them. It would be a breach of faith and a crime against the people if members of the Legislature allowed friends or relatives undue access to public property or any other resources. Mr Lekota said he was resolute that his administration should live up to the standards of public honesty and fairness that the people of the OFS deserved. If they "lacked the guts" to protect the property of the people against a few individuals then they deserved none of the trust placed in them. The OFS administration would not fire anyone from employment without proper procedures of hearing. The principle of "audi alteram partem" [hear the other side] would guide its actions at all material times. But those who, after a proper hearing, were found unable to account for their actions could and must expect action against them. Mr Lekota made this point in the light of the "nonchalant and lackadaisical manner" in which sections of the civil service had been reported to have approached their work since the election. Those who conceived of freedom as a condition of permanent holiday, endless drinking sprees, laxity of group and individual discipline, salary without service, sluggishness, general collapse of order and organisation had to "revisit their orientation". They were in the wrong place in the OFS. The OFS intended to deliver on the promises made before the elections. This meant hard work and there was no room for the lazy or reluctant fellow-travellers. Everyone had to prove on a daily basis that they deserved their job. Otherwise the deserving unemployed should get a chance to prove themselves.
