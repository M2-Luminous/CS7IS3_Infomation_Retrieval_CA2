ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to amend FAR policies and clauses on Prompt Payment. This proposed rule, in combination with changes made by Federal Acquisition Circular 84&hyph;45, dated March 31, 1989, will complete the implementation of changes made in OMB Circular A&hyph;125 (Revised), dated December 12, 1989, to comply with the Prompt Payment Act Amendments of 1988 (Public Law 100&hyph;496). Changes are also proposed to clarify, simplify, and correct inconsistencies in the existing FAR text and clauses. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted to the FAR Secretariat at the address shown below on or before July 5, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule.

Background Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 84&hyph;45 published a final FAR rule in the Federal Register at 54 FR 13332, March 31, 1989, to implement changes required by the Prompt Payment Act Amendments of 1988 (Public Law 100&hyph;496). The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implemented the statutory requirements by revising OMB Circular A&hyph;125, Prompt Payment. The Circular was published as a final rule in the Federal Register on December 21, 1989, and became effective 30 days after publication. OMB's final guidance differed somewhat from earlier proposed coverage which served as the basis for the FAR changes published in FAC 84&hyph;45. This proposed FAR rule implements the guidance published in OMB Circular A&hyph;125 (Revised). Major FAR changes proposed include: (1) Clarifying policy on partial payments for partial performance by establishing coverage at FAR 32.102(d) and 32.903(f); (2) revising and adding definitions at FAR 32.902 to be in consonance with definitions in OMB Circular A&hyph;125 and to make related editorial changes; (3) adding coverage at FAR 32.904 to address an ongoing problem with contracts containing more than one set of payment terms; (4) clarifying policy at FAR 32.905(a)(1)(ii) concerning use of extended acceptance periods; (5) adding coverage at FAR 32.905(c)(6) to address construction prime contractor certification requirements under the clause at FAR 52.232&hyph;5; (6) adding coverage at FAR 32.905(j) to address the use and payment of ``mixed'' invoices; (7) adding coverage at FAR 32.907&hyph;1(b)(3) concerning interest penalties in relation to electronic funds transfers; (8) adding coverage at FAR 32.907&hyph;1(g) concerning additional interest penalties and contractor demands for such penalties; (9) adding coverage at FAR 32.910 to address construction contractors' payment of interest on unearned amounts under the clauses at FAR 52.232&hyph;5 and 52.232&hyph;27; and (10) revising the clause at FAR 52.232&hyph;5 to include the specific criteria required by A&hyph;125 for construction contractors' requests for progress payments. FAR clauses 52.232&hyph;5, 52.232&hyph;8, and 52.232&hyph;25, 52.232&hyph;26, 52.232&hyph;27, and 52.232&hyph;28 are amended to reflect the proposed FAR text changes. In addition, numerous changes are proposed to clarify, simplify, and correct inconsistencies in the existing FAR text and clauses. (Note: The requirements that no late payment penalty payments be made to certain foreign vendors were removed from the FAR by FAC 90&hyph;20, Item XIII, March 10, 1994, 59 FR 11368.) B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed changes to FAR 32.102, subpart 32.9, and related part 52 clauses at 52.232&hyph;5, 52.232&hyph;8, 52.232&hyph;25, 52.232&hyph;26, 52.232&hyph;27, and 52.232&hyph;28 may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because the proposed rule will apply to all small businesses who contract with the Federal Government and to all small businesses who enter into construction contracts with contractors holding prime Federal construction contracts. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) has been prepared and will be provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy for the Small Business Administration. A copy of the IRFA may be obtained from the FAR Secretariat. Comments are invited. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subparts will also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 91&hyph;91), in correspondence.
