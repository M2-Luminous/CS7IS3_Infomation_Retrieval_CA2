Aldrich Ames, 52, who was in charge of Russian affairs in the antiespionage organization of the CIA, and his wife, 41, have been prosecuted for committing espionage activities. On 21 February, the FBI arrested Ames on his way to the office and his wife at home. Ames was employed by the CIA for 31 years. He engaged in espionage activities for the former Soviet Union and Russia for a long time. This high-ranking U.S. intelligence official was revealed to be a double spy who sold out U.S. secrets to the former Soviet Union, and after it was dissolved, to Russia from 1985. Maria, Ames' wife who was studying at a college until she was arrested, was born in Colombia and worked as an agent for the CIA until she moved to the United States. The U.S. Department of Justice noted that this is one of the largest spy incidents in history, and the volume and sensitivity of intelligence gathered by this spy couple are very rare. U.S. social circles were surprised by the announcement of the Ames spy incident. President Clinton stated that this is a very serious incident and that the United States will immediately lodge a protest with the Russian Government. According to Justice Department officials, the FBI began investigation of Ames based on material from an intelligence official of the State Security Bureau of the former Soviet Union who defected to the United States two years ago. The FBI tapped a telephone, collected typewriter ribbons used by the Ames, examined trash and copying materials they threw away and documents saved in their computers. The FBI also conducted investigation of their income and expenditures. As a result, the FBI finally obtained sufficient evidence and indicted the Ames couple on suspicion of espionage activities. The FBI then arrested them and is now investigating the case. According to the document of indictment, which consisted of 39 pages filed, the FBI has seized a large number of material proving that Ames engaged in spy activities. The FBI announced that over the past 10 years, the Ames couple offered top secret material to the former Soviet Union and Russia pertaining to activities of intelligence officials and agents of the former Soviet Union and Russia who cooperated with the United States and the CIA. They received at least $1.5 million in return. The revelation of the spy incident involving the Ames couple gravely embarrassed the Clinton government. The press report noted that Clinton has already offered $4.1 billion in assistance to Moscow in order to help Yeltsin establish democratic systems and push ahead with economic reform. Nevertheless, Russian spies are still maneuvering to steal secret intelligence from the United States and even skillfully infiltrated the CIA. The press urged Washington to reexamine relations with Moscow.
