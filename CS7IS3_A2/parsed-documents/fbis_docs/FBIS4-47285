V. Kazakov, A. S. Rabinovich, and A. S. Kheyfitz, All-Union Institute of Refractories; UDC 666.762.852.017:620.187]:621.762] [Abstract] The alloying of silicon carbide components with aluminum was studied to determine its effect on component structure and electrical properties. Three tubular specimens were extruded from an 85 wt. % primary SiC (SiC') mass and fired in a siliconizing packing at temperatures between 1900-2200ï¿½C for 5.5 to 6 h in a resistance furnace. During firing, the specimens were arranged in a symmetrical fashion relative to the tubular graphite heating element. Sintering of the green extrusions and structural formation was more readily effected by the addition of process carbon to the raw material and by the formation of carbon residue released during thermopyrolysis of the binder. These carbons, together with the carbide-forming elements present in the packing, helped to form secondary SiC (SiC''). In order to alloy the SiC with aluminum, an aluminous substance was also added to the packing. After they had cooled, the specimens were fired a second time. It was found that this method of forming SiC components creates a layered structure in which SiC'' grains are alloyed with aluminum, and that this structure promotes consistent electrical resistivity throughout the component cross-section. The degree of alloying can be monitored by X-ray microspectrometry. Electrical resistivity can be estimated within the framework of a generalized model of conductivity in a multi-component medium, in which SiC forms a continuous matrix, and SiC' grains make up a discrete phase.
