FR940128-2-00213 FR940128-2-00137 Appendix Evaluation and Conclusion On October 7, 1993, a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) was issued for a violation identified during an NRC inspection on December 14, 1992, through January 13, 1993. Indiana University School of Medicine responded to the Notice in a letter dated October 29, 1993. In its response, the licensee disputes the validity of the cited violation. Further, the licensee takes exception to the NRC Staff's application of identification and licensee performance civil penalty adjustment factors. The NRC's evaluation and conclusions regarding the licensee's requests are as follows: Restatement of Violation 10 CFR 35.32(a) states, in part, that each licensee shall establish and maintain a written quality management program to provide high confidence that radiation from byproduct material will be administered as directed by the authorized user. Pursuant to 10 CFR 35.32(a) (1) and (3), the quality management program must include written policies and procedures to meet specific objectives that: (1) Prior to administration, a written directive is prepared for any teletherapy radiation dose; and (2) final plans of treatment and related calculations for teletherapy are in accordance with the written directive. 10 CFR 35.2 defines a written directive as an order in writing for a specific patient, dated and signed by an authorized user prior to administration of radiation and containing, for teletherapy, the following information: The total dose, dose per fraction, treatment site, and overall treatment period. Contrary to the above, as of January 13, 1993, the licensee's quality management program for teletherapy dated January 16, 1992, did not have a procedure for: (1) Ensuring the written directive contained the total dose, dose per fraction, treatment site, and overall treatment period and (2) verifying the dose calculations for administrations of three fractions or less to confirm that the final plans of treatment are in accordance with the written directive. Consequently, on November 13, 1992, the licensee's authorized user signed and dated a written directive for teletherapy treatment that failed to include the overall treatment period and the licensee failed to verify the dose calculations, since the treatment called for less than 3 fractions, to ensure the final plans of treatment were in accordance with the written directive. Summary of Licensee's Response to the Violation The licensee disputes the validity of the cited violation, the assigned Severity Level, and the NRC root cause analysis, as follows: 1. The licensee asserts that the proposed violation did not cause the misadministration even though the written directive did include the overall treatment period. In the written directive for the patient treated November 13, 1992, the number of fractions is written as ``2 fx'' which means the treatment period is to include two fractions or treatments. This is the licensee's interpretation of the overall treatment period. The licensee asserts that the term ``overall treatment period'' is not defined in the regulations or in Regulatory Guide 8.33. According to the licensee, the presence or absence of the documentation of the overall treatment period would have no bearing on the initial interpretational error made by the dosimetrist or the subsequent oversights by individuals who were verifying the correctness of the treatment. 2. The licensee notes that the treatment was performed on an emergency basis and that this fact causes the standard verification procedure to change depending upon the availability of staff. According to the licensee, while neither the Quality Control/Quality Assurance Program (QA/QCP) nor the Quality Management Program (QMP) include specific procedures for verification when less than four treatments are prescribed, no change in the subsequent chart checking procedures would have resulted because the treatment in question as an emergency. The licensee also asserts that it verified the dose calculations in that the prescribing physician/authorized user and two radiation therapists attempted to verify that the treatment to be delivered was in accordance with the written directive. According to the licensee, while none of these individuals identified the calculational error made by the dosimetrist, their failure to identify the error was related to the wording of the written directive rather than the failure to follow proper procedure. 3. The licensee challenges the categorization of the proposed violation as a Severity Level III violation. The licensee asserts that the misadministration occurred due to inconsistencies in the format of the written directive, and that the QMP was followed and the appropriate checks were made. According to the licensee, the violation would be more appropriately categorized at Severity Level IV since it does not represent a programmatic weakness in the implementation of the QMP, the failure was isolated to the single event, and the consequences were limited and did not adversely affect the patient. 4. The licensee disagrees with the NRC's statement that, ``The violation contributed to the occurrence of a misadministration on November 13, 1992.'' NRC Evaluation of Licensee's Response to the Violation This enforcement action focuses on the licensee's failure to develop and implement an adequate QMP. As a result of the misadministration, the NRC performed a detailed review of the licensee's QMP during the followup inspection and enforcement deliberations. The result of this detailed review was that the NRC identified substantial deficiencies. The inspection determined that the licensee's written QMP did not have procedures for: (1) Ensuring that the written directive contained the total dose, dose per fraction, treatment site, and the overall treatment period; and (2) verifying the dose calculations for administrations of three fractions or less to confirm that the final plans of treatment are in accordance with the written directive. The licensee has not provided any information to demonstrate that its written QMP addressed these procedures. These deficiencies represent a programmatic (as opposed to isolated) failure in the implementation of the QMP; therefore, the violation was categorized at Severity Level III in accordance with the NRC Enforcement Policy, Supplement VI.C.6 (57 FR 5792).
