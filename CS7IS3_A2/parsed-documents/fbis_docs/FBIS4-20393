Responsible editor: Sun Ye (1327 0396)] [Text] The resolution of the 14th CPC National Congress to the effect that establishment of the socialist market economy shall be the target of the reform indicates that China has entered a new phase in its transition from the highly centralized system of planned economy to market economy, a system abounding in vigor and vitality. Energetic pursuit of the new forms and new tasks of developing the socialist market economy entails the need for our party to deal with circumstances and conditions that are different from those of the past. As a consequence, party building will have to face extremely complex and very special contradictions. The urgent and effective resolution of these new and particular contradictions is of important theoretical and actual significance for the strengthening of party building, for the enhancement of party guidance, for the socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics, and for the development of all undertakings of reform and opening to the outside world. First Contradiction: The contradiction between the complex composition of the party membership and society, on the one hand, and the unanimous call for progress by the party membership, on the other hand. The political party is the organization and political representation of the class; the composition of the party membership is directly and closely related to the particular economic structure of the society and to the class and strata of this society. As China is now developing a market economy and establishing this new system of market economy while it is still at the initial stage of socialism and possessing only backward and unevenly developed productive forces, the realities of China's situation demand, objectively, the development of a pluralistic economic structure, where the system of public ownership and distribution according to work are the primary constituents and where other economic sectors and distribution methods are supplementary. With the advances in China's reform and the extended existence and common development of pluralistic economic components, changes in China's economic structure will become more widespread and thoroughgoing. The complex changes of the economic structure will naturally result in changes in the component members of China's society and particularly in the composition of its strata, and it will furthermore, to a certain extent, have an effect on the economic composition of the party membership. For instance, in the actual present-day economic life, changes have already occurred in the economic relations of some party members, as some party members have distanced themselves from the original public ownership economy, are engaging in individual economy, private-run economy, or foreign-financed economies. There are others who are engaged in individual and other kinds of economies who are now joining the ranks of party members. If we compare the complexity of the present social composition and economic relations of party members with the artificially changed production relations prior to the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the much too early elimination of nonpublic ownership economic sectors and the social composition of party members with the corresponding conditions of the unitary economic structure of the public ownership system (ownership by the whole people, ownership by the collective) and the unitary class and strata structure (workers, peasants, intellectuals), the situation now certainly appears not as "pure" and "simple" as in the past. We have to affirm that the complexity of the social composition and economic relations of party members has adapted to the nature and condition of China's socialist force at the present stage. However, due to the special circumstances and specific influences of different economic relations, it was not possible to prevent that some party members--though with the precondition of uniformity of basic standards and demands for progress--engender certain divergences with regard to the extent of their political consciousness, awareness of the social stratification, value concepts, and methods of actions to be taken. The Chinese Communist Party is the vanguard of the Chinese working class; the demands of the party and those of each party member are essentially identical. The Party Constitution prescribes: Members of the CPC are vanguard fighters of the Chinese working class. They are imbued with communist consciousness, they must serve the people wholeheartedly, must be ready to make any personal sacrifices, and must dedicate their lives to the realization of communism. In view of the complex social composition of the party membership under the conditions of market economy, a problem that we are now faced with and that must under no circumstances be ignored, a problem in matters of party building, is how to bring onto one denominator the exemplary role and the particular demands of party members in the different economic sectors, and how to achieve conformity of their actual actions in their various individual economic activities, a conformity with the prescribed standards of party membership. A related problem is how to set up and run party organizations in different economic sectors and to develop the functions of their particular specialties so that they may also conform with the demands of the party organization. This too has to be carefully explored in actual practice. Second Contradiction: The contradiction between the complexity of the party-masses relationship under the conditions of market economy, on the one hand, and the fundamental identity of party and masses interests, on the other hand. The Chinese Communist Party is the faithful representative of the interests of the Chinese people of all nationalities. The lofty ideal of every member of the CPC is to serve the people wholeheartedly, without regard for special personal interests. Precisely because this is so, the party has always maintained flesh-and-blood ties with the masses during the protracted periods of revolution and construction, and has evolved the excellent tradition and working style of relying on the masses and closely linking up with the masses. As we are presently energetically promoting the socialist market economy, we must push on with the liberation and development of the productive forces, impel all-round progress in society, and bring happiness and prosperity to the masses. On a foundation of this kind, the relationship between the party and the masses is bound to become even closer. However, the energetic development of market economy, especially in its initial stages, may manifest some complex relationships between party and the masses. This has easily led to many contradictions between the party and the masses, as well as between party cadres and the masses, contradictions that are characteristic for the market economy, and it is these contradictions that have generally manifested themselves particularly openly and visibly. The party-masses relationship is after all one of interests, and its fundamental demand is that the party faithfully represent, and make every effort to realize, the interests of the broad masses of the people. Enduring, stable, and close party-masses relations are built on a certain objective material basis and on the foundation of common interests, and these comprise present vested interests as well as also the pursuit and expectations of future interests. Reform, opening to the outside world, and market economy have stirred up much enthusiasm and creativity among the broad masses, to increase economic production and to strive for prosperity. In the practical execution of the reform by the entire party and the entire society, material interests and economic interests have become the important problems that have now most of everyone's attention. Development of the socialist market economy is, of course, apt to bring immediate and long-term benefits for all, including party members, but it is not possible to provide these benefits simultaneously and equally for all, some will still temporarily remain without certain benefits. Especially during the initial stage of the developing market economy, when certain of its aspects have not yet matured and perfected, it is particularly difficult to avoid that certain contradictions will show up with regard to material benefits, and this can, in turn, become the cause of increasing dissatisfaction and louder voices of discontent among the masses. If it were the case that all of us party members, especially party members who are cadres in leading positions, would lack the mass viewpoint, would have inflated selfish desires, would misuse powers for private gain, show unhealthy tendencies, or even be party to all kinds of corrupt practices, this would with certainty aggravate the contradictions among the masses and add to the conflicts with the masses. Development of the market economy is bringing with it certain complex circumstances that affect the party-masses relation. They demand of us that we earnestly and effectively set about the task of party building in all its various aspects, and that we energetically explore how to utilize, under the new situation, the mechanism of the market to harmonize and resolve the contradictions in mentalities and in ways of doing things within the party-masses and cadre-masses relations. We must also, one step further, consolidate the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the masses. Third Contradiction: The contradiction between the complexity of inner-party contradictions under the conditions of market economy, on the one hand, and the unity of party ideology and party organization, on the other hand. As the vanguard contingent of the working class, the party is--like everything else--an entity consisting of complex contradictions. Inner-party contradictions reflect the objective realities of society, as these contradictions manifest themselves in different forms under different conditions. The inner-party contradictions under the new situation manifest themselves roughly in the following three respects: First, contradictions of ideology and political consciousness. This refers mainly to various divergences in ideology and political consciousness engendered by the sharp collision and confrontation of new and old thoughts and concepts, and of the new and old modes of thinking, among party members during the period of China's social remolding. This remolding progresses from seclusion to opening up, from natural and semi-natural economy to commodity economy, and from the planned economy system to the system of socialist market economy. It is an inevitable trend of conflicts involving inner-party ideological and conceptual contradictions that they will adapt to the demands of the new ideology and new concepts of socialized large-scale production and market economy development. They will gradually take the place of the old ideology of small-scale production methods combined with the planned economy system. With intensified development of market economy, and the continuous manifestation of its superiority, there will gradually be no more market for those "Leftist" or rightist things. However, we must not overlook the fact that as a consequence of the intensified reform and the broadening of opening to the outside world, the value concepts of members of the CPC may become exposed to assaults from Western pluralistic value concepts, and may be invaded by various decadent feudal and bourgeois ideologies, which may make it difficult to maintain a high degree of ideological uniformity throughout the entire party. Second, contradictions in the course of practice. The development of socialist market economy is placing a new task before the members of the CPC. It requires liberation of minds, seeking truth from facts, opening up new paths and creating new things, study of the new situation, resolving new problems, creating new experiences, and setting up a new system. The difficulties of accomplishing this new task in the course of actual practice can well be imagined. It will of course entail large contradictions and problems, and be the cause of many differing opinions and differing outlooks in the work to be performed. Under these conditions, it will certainly be difficult to keep the entire party altogether in step. Third, contradictions of inner-part interests. The Party Constitution prescribes that party members must accept the interests of the party as the uppermost concern in life. The individual interests of every CPC member must unconditionally be subordinated to the interests of the party and the people. The party organization, on the other hand, must also be solicitous of and show consideration for the individual interests of the party members; this is a fundamental rule for the settlement of contradictions involving inner-party interests. Reform has set in motion an interest-promoting mechanism among the people, a mechanism working for liberation and development of productive forces, and the long-suppressed individual-profit consciousness has become liberated among all members of the society, including the members of the CPC. Now, the individual interests of party members are indeed also prominently put forward for due consideration, and are frequently, publicly, and "sensibly" arrayed on par with the interests of the party and the people. In the past, some party members would have been ashamed to bring up openly demands for consideration of individual interests, but now they dare discuss and put forward such demands. They even dare to "haggle over prices," and in some cases even create certain "confrontational" situations in questions of inner-party interests. Contradictions between individual party members, on the one hand, and the party and the people, on the other hand, are fundamental factors that actually -- under the conditions of market economy -- adversely affect the cohesion within the party, and its attractiveness and fighting strength. If these contradictions are therefore not effectively resolved, it will be impossible for the party to maintain a high degree of unity in ideological, political, organizational, and operational respects. It will then also be impossible to shoulder the leadership responsibilities for reform and opening up and for the socialist modernizations. Under the new situation, the complexity of the inner-party contradictions not only increases the difficulties for party building, difficulties that have to be overcome within the body of the party itself, it also provides party building with an enhanced impetus for efforts to resolve the internal contradictions and for continuous self-perfection and self-development. In this new historical era, the circumstances the party finds itself in and the tasks to be shouldered by the party have greatly changed. Due to these changes the party has to face many new complex situations and new problems in ideological, political, organizational, and in working style respects. The new reality demands of us that we must abide by the fundamental political line of the party, that we must uphold the principle of having the party control its party members and strictly administer the party, and that we strengthen and improve party building. The task that is presently most important and pressing is in the sphere of ideological buildup. We must give utmost attention to the party's theoretical buildup, and, with the party's theoretical buildup as nucleus, we must strengthen the party's entire ideological buildup, making an effort to arm the entire party through the buildup of socialist theory with Chinese characteristics. As to the organizational buildup, our objective must be to enhance the party's centralized, unified leadership, to strengthen democratic centralism, to perfect the leadership system and the mechanism of the party's internal political life. As to the build-up of the party's working style, we must make close linkage of party and masses the fundamental concern, must correctly deal with the internal contradictions of the people, and resolutely control negative, decadent phenomena, reducing them to their lowest level. Through strengthening and improving party building and by directing our efforts to enhancing the governmental and leadership qualities of the party, we shall place the party, which will then have assumed a completely new attitude, at the front line of reform and modernization. It shall become a party with courage to reform to reform, a party imbued with vitality, a strictly disciplined, a just and honest party, that will select worthy and capable people to fill positions, and a party that will be eminently effective in its service to the people.
