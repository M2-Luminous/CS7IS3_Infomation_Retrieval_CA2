The shipyards do not want to accept the sweeping rejection by the Federal Government. According to information received by WELT AM SONNTAG, they want to take the weapons deal once more to the Security Council of the government if a cooperation agreement with U.S. companies should be concluded. Currently, a group of German companies (Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, Thyssen-Nordseewerke, and Ferrostahl) are holding talks with a U.S. shipyard consortium on the construction of small submarines for Taiwan. The Germans are to supply the body, and the Americans will equip the ships. A total of 10 ships worth a billion German marks each are involved. No decision has been made. If a cooperation should come about, the government in Washington would approach the German Government concerning the wish for cooperation, the companies involved hope. On this basis, the Security Council would have to make a new decision. The supporters of this deal hope that it would be difficult for the Federal Government to reject the U.S. wish because this would have a negative impact on Germany's reliability as a cooperation partner in international weapons deals. The Security Council banned the delivery of submarines to Taiwan in 1993 out of consideration for communist China. Since then, the German group has been trying to obtain a participation in the construction of submarines abroad. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) stated last week that German submarines will not be supplied to Taiwan by a roundabout way. The companies did not want to accept that. "The decision of the Security Council only applied to direct supplies to Taiwan," a spokesman of the shipyards told WELT AM SONNTAG. The consortium is being supported by a group of about 150 officials from the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and Free Democratic Party of Germany in Bonn who also supported the direct deal with Taiwan. The decision of the Security Council does not apply to supplies for companies in NATO countries, CDU official Guenter Klein from Bremen told WELT AM SONNTAG. According to Klein, the cooperation would be covered by the existing principles of the Federal Government for the export of military equipment, adopted in 1982. They contain the following regulation: "As far as cooperation between weapons companies in different NATO countries that are not the subject of government agreements is concerned, supplies for these countries are, basically, not subject to any restriction -- in accordance with the regulations on direct supplies." However, the government reserves the right to influence exports.
