FR940713-1-00045 FR940713-1-00009 12. Application Caps Next, we turn to two related proposals by the Educational Parties. The first is a cap of three to five applications that an individual nonlocal ITFS entity could file during a window. Such applicants, according to the Educational Parties, often work with frequency speculators and, backed by these wireless cable entities, submit a number of applications simply to bargain with other wireless cable entities seeking to construct a viable wireless cable system. Second, they propose an additional cap of 25 applications associated with the same wireless cable entity, including any entity with direct or indirect common ownership or control. According to the Educational Parties, wireless cable lessees should have to file with their associated ITFS applications information detailing who has any direct or indirect interest in the wireless cable lessee, including any interests as an owner, officer, or director. 13. We invite comments on whether circumstances at this time warrant inquiry into either of the proposed measures. Adoption of either proposal might diminish the number of applications submitted, thereby easing the processing burden substantially. In addition, it would likely limit multiple filings by frequency speculators and their affiliated applicants. However, wireless cable operators require a minimum number of channels with which to operate a viable wireless cable system. Thus, stringent caps could obstruct the rapid development of robust wireless cable systems that can vigorously compete in the rapidly expanding video marketplace. They could also retard the development of ITFS systems, which often obtain funding from the wireless cable lessees. Also, commenters should address how to justify the proposed discrimination against nonlocal applicants. We note that such entities establish eligibility through letters of intended use from an official of each receive site, and through the service on a local programming committee of an official of each receive site. Thus, we invite commenters to address whether and what kinds of limitations would promote both ITFS and wireless cable development. How can we balance the efficiencies of such limitations with the costs they might impose? If an application ceiling would serve the public interest, how many applications associated with one entity should we allow per window? How would we define common control for the purpose of either ITFS or wireless cable? Should we base our definition on actual control, or on attribution of ownership? 14. Expedited Consideration of Applications The Educational Parties and WCA propose that, under certain circumstances, we give expedited consideration to ITFS applications in return for the applicant's agreeing to an accelerated construction schedule. WCA suggests that a wireless cable lessee be able to request and obtain expedited consideration of an application with which it is associated, if the lessee has access to a certain minimum number of channels in the area. 3 In return, grantees would be required to order their equipment within 21 days of Public Notice of the grant, and construct the facilities within six months. Extensions would be granted only under compelling circumstances, such as the inability of the manufacturer to deliver timely ordered equipment, or accidental damages to essential equipment. WCA claims that adoption of the proposal would accelerate the development of both ITFS and wireless cable systems. In addition, the Educational Parties propose that educators without excess capacity leases also have access to such expedited consideration. 3 WCA proposes expedited consideration only if the wireless cable lessee already has 12 channels, at least 4 of which are MDS. This would include licensed access to MDS or ITFS stations, cut-off non-mutually exclusive proposed MDS facilities, and/or proposed ITFS stations (including the ones at issue). WCA Comments at 7. 15. While we do not now view the implementation of the proposal as practical, we invite comments on the proposal and how it might be implemented. The staff may have to expend substantial resources determining which applications were eligible for expedited consideration, enforcing the requirement for ordering equipment, and enforcing the construction deadline, thereby delaying service to the public. Also, would the public be served if we denied an extension request when construction is nearly complete at the end of the six months? Finally, the likely substantial number of applicants requesting expedited consideration could defeat the purpose of the proposal. In the alternative, would processing efficiency be adequately improved by a stricter enforcement of the existing requirements for extensions of time? 16. Assignment of Construction Permits We now turn to a related proposal to diminish the incentive of frequency speculators to submit applications for permits that they intend to later assign for profit. We propose to formalize our current practice of limiting the allowable consideration for unbuilt ITFS facilities to out-of-pocket expenses, as is now applied to the sale of broadcast construction permits. We seek comment on the proposal. 17. Application of the Four-Channel Rule Section 74.902(d) of the Commission's Rules generally limits an ITFS licensee to four channels for use in a single area of operation. However, we have not clearly defined what constitutes an ``area of operation'' for the purpose of the rule. A clear benchmark would make the standard easier for applicants to comply with and would also increase the speed of processing. 18. The staff has considered a single area of operation for this purpose to extend no farther than 20 miles from the transmitter site. We seek comment on whether we should adopt that figure as a rule. Commenters should address whether an educational institution is likely to routinely serve an area extending beyond that radius. Alternatively, should we instead define an area of operation in terms of interference, rather than of distance? Specifically, we seek comment on whether we should consider two sites to be in different areas of operation, as long as one could operate at maximum authorized power on the same channel at each site without co-channel interference. 19. Offset We next turn to our policies toward offset. 4 Currently, we apply the 28dB D/U ratio standard to determine co-channel interference. However, we do not require offset if an objection is raised by one of the affected parties. Instead, we have encouraged privately negotiated agreements to use offset to resolve interference. Consequently, we must decide between two mutually exclusive applications when, if the applicants used offset, both could serve the public without objectionable co-channel interference. To require offset between otherwise grantable mutually exclusive ITFS applicants would help maximize the number of educational entities that can avail themselves of the service. Thus, we propose requiring the use of offset in such circumstances when all affected transmitters are capable of handling frequency offset stability requirements. Such a requirement, we believe, would both accelerate the granting of applications and allow for a greater number of ITFS licensees, thereby increasing service to the public. Also, although we currently require new applicants to use equipment capable of utilizing offset, we have not always done so. Accordingly, we would not apply the proposed rule to facilities predating the requirement that lack offset capability. 4 A licensee utilizing offset operates at a frequency either slightly higher or slightly lower than the standard frequency for that channel. Specifically, such a licensee operates its facilities with a carrier frequency # 10 kHz from the nominal carrier frequency.
