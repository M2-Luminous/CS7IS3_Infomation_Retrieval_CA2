To promote discussions on this issue, he stressed the need to hold ministerial meetings, saying: "Talks should be held between Foreign Minister Kakizawa and U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Kantor before the end of June." Regarding macro policies, he expressed strong hope that Japan will decide by July to reduce its taxes for three years before making any tax increases. [Omago] Is it correct to assume that Japan and the United States, at the recent unofficial negotiations, confirmed that both countries will not set numerical targets, that progress in market liberalization shall be measured qualitatively and quantitatively by several objective criteria, and that the discussions' goals [kyogi] are to increase sales of foreign goods and services with competitive power in the Japanese market? [Cutter] "That is right." [Omago] The USTR and other government organizations made a proposal at negotiation meetings in individual fields, saying they wanted to set future numerical targets regarding the number of stores that sell foreign goods, and other matters. Do you not think this is contradictory to the agreement reached at the unofficial meeting? [Cutter] "Such a U.S. proposal itself is not in conflict with the Japan-U.S. agreement. Numerical target means we set up specific figures as future goals and make it mandatory for Japan to reach these goals. However, the U.S. Government does not want that. Since we agreed to measure the degree of progress by applying several objective criteria, which will be introduced in each field, and not to use the degree of progress as an excuse to impose sanctions, I am sure we can incorporate a standard [kijun] regarding future figures into one of the criteria." "Japan said last year that objective criteria figures must be used to measure progress made in the past because all numerical standards for the future are numerical targets. This is not a theoretic view. Because of this, we are having negotiations. We are not saying we need a complete agreement on this point. However, it is against the agreement for resumption of the negotiations to refuse to have discussions on this matter." [Omago] There is a deep-rooted view in Japan that the USTR is taking the leadership for negotiations in the United States. [Cutter] "I do not think we should separate the USTR from other U.S. Government departments. Policies, even in the field where the USTR is acting as a contact point for negotiations, are determined by National Economic Council (NEC) secretarial meetings . USTR Kantor is one of the top VIP's, if I may name one. However, the final decisions are made by NEC secretaries, including Rubin, special assistant to the President, USTR Kantor, Finance Secretary Bentsen, and Tyson, Council of Economic Advisers chairwoman." [Omago] Some people in Japan think they can accept the idea of setting objective criteria for foreign companies' procurement shares only in the government procurement field. What do you think of this? [Cutter] "This is news to me. I have been talking to Assistant USTR Barshevsky, who is in charge of government procurement. I am sure she does not know about that either, and we have not heard any proposals in this regard. However, it is a good sign if there is such a proposal. It will be extremely beneficial." [Omago] Can you comment on macroeconomic policies? [Cutter] "Both Japan and the United States made record of the fact that Tsutomu Hata, then deputy prime minister and foreign minister, explained to USTR Kantor at Marrakech in Morocco a plan designed to cut taxes for three years before making tax increases. This is a very important decision (aimed at a significant reduction of Japan's current account balance). We understand that Japan's political situation is in a state of confusion. This does not mean, however, that Japan does not have to come up with new macro policies in time for the developed nations' summit talks in July (Naples summit)." [Omago] Are you aiming to reach mutual accords on all three priority areas -- government procurement, insurance, and auto and auto parts -- before the summit? [Cutter] "Ideally, yes. But, the reality is that we are not setting a deadline. We will be satisfied if we can check the discussions' progress, which are incorporated in last July's original agreement between the top leaders of Japan and the United States. There is no need for us to reach accords on all three fields prior to the summit." [Omago] Are the next deputy ministerial talks going to be held? [Cutter] "We would like to see, for a little while, how the situation develops. Foreign Minister Kakizawa and USTR Kantor will meet in Paris next week and ..." [ellipses as received] [Omago] I am sure Foreign Minister Kakizawa will not be able to go to Paris because the Diet is now in session. [Cutter] "That is news to me too. It was Foreign Minister Kakizawa's idea, so we were hoping the meeting would be held. They should hold a meeting even if they are not able to meet in Paris. If their meeting is held by the end of June, we will be able to pave the way for subsequent negotiations."
