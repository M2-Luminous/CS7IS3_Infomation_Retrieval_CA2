He believes that the cost of humanitarian operations is too high. By the end of 1994, the Belgian UN troops in Yugoslavia and Rwanda will have cost him 1.7 billion Belgian francs. In 1995, the Defense Ministry intends to earmark just 1 billion Belgian frnacs for such expenditure. Any extra costs will have to be found from "other sources." In the meantime, the sale of army equipment is going well. Although the cabinet may have already decided last Friday [1 April] to prolong humanitarian operations in Croatia and Bosnia, Minister Delcroix firmly intends not to allow his budget to be derailed by the international commitments of the Belgian Army. DE MORGEN learned yesterday from the minister that in 1995 just 1 billion Belgian francs will be set aside for financing the activities of UN troops. "In 1994, we will end up spending 1.7 billion Belgian francs," said his spokesman. "The cost of the operation in Rwanda will be 613 million Belgian francs. The commitment in the former Yugoslavia (Belbat, Bosnia Road) will amount to 1 billion." As the argument goes: "If the government were now to comply with a possible request by the United nations to make an additional effort, then the money would have to come from `elsewhere.'" In the past, the costs of foreign contracts were often shared by the Defense Ministry and the Development Aid Ministry, or the European Union offered a financial helping hand (e.g. in Somalia). It would appear that in the long term, Delcroix only wishes to remain active in the former Yugoslavia. One billion Belgian francs per annum is not enough to keep the 1,000 permanent troops in the field. The mission in Rwanda is due to end in November 1994. Meanwhile, Bosnia Road, the mission involving army engineers in the region around Sarajevo, was extended Friday until October 1994. Sales In the meantime, the Defense Ministry has also adjusted the estimated revenue generated by selling off army property and equipment. At the end of 1993, it was anticipated that such sales would total 3.5 billion Belgian francs. The new estimate is 4 billion by 1997. Nonetheless, 1993 was a disappointing year. It had been hoped that income totaling 600 million Belgian francs might be generated, but since the only money coming in was the result of sales of light equipment, the actual revenue totaled just 250 million. However, there is light on the horizon. DE MORGEN has learned that the negotiations with Chile on the sale of the superfluous Mirages are "promising." A letter of agreement has been signed in which Belgium guarantees not to look for another buyer before June. Chile has 2.5 billion Belgian francs available for the Mirages. Delcroix also seems firm in his intention to sell the Hawk missiles to Turkey, despite the strong criticism from Agalev [Flemish Environmental Party], the VU [Flemish People's Union], and the peace movement. After all, the new law governing arms deals prohibits the sale of military equipment to any country which is involved in a civil war. "We must not be hypocritical," says Delcroix's spokesman. "Turkey is a NATO country. If we ask that country to keep its armed forces up to date, thereby helping to guarantee the collective security of the alliance, then we cannot refuse to supply it with arms. Either we must regard Turkey as no longer being a NATO partner or we must behave like a full partner of that country. The government certainly has no plans to drop Turkey." No information about the price that Turkey is prepared to pay for the Hawk antiaircraft missiles is currently available. The sale of military properties should also accelerate in the coming months. Some properties will be sold by public auction, others privately. "That depends on the Finance Ministry. We, at the Defense Ministry, are not allowed to dispose of our property ourselves." Could the proceeds from such sales not be used to boost the budget allocated for humanitarian uses? "No," said the spokesman, "it was already decided previously that the 4 billion Belgian francs generated by the sales would not be used to fund personnel or operations. The armed forces still have a very long list of equipment that has to be purchased in the context of rearming the Belgian Armed Forces. That is our priority if we want to ensure that our armed forces remain ready for action in the future." "The proceeds of the sale of military equipment will be used to this end. The revenue generated by sales of the real property will go toward modernizing the remaining barracks."
