Georgiy Kostenko, academician, under "How Should the Army of Ukraine Be?": "The General and the Lieutenant Both Need Training, or on the Problems in the Formation of the Staff Skills of the Officer Personnel of the Armed Forces"] [Text] In analyzing and comparing World War II documents, historians throughout the world note a high level of staff skills of officers of the Red Army, which at that time predetermined a common understanding of the orders and directives from the supreme commander down to the platoon leader and in our time a high readability of front documents. Approved and crystallized in the battles of the Great Patriotic War, staff skills have subsequently become that quality indicator that defines the degree of professionalism of officers. In the process of the development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, our officers have a unique opportunity not only to bring their staff skills up to world standards but also to give them a national coloring. Unfortunately, this is not happening. The author of these lines, being chairman and member of certification boards at different levels and also being involved through the nature of his work in the study of official documents, has reached an alarming conclusion: today it is necessary to speak not only of the further improvement of staff skills of officers of command and control agencies but also of their partial restoration. Staff skills are a constant factor that represents the totality of theoretical knowledge and practical skills that the officer needs to perform his official duties. This does not contradict military art, which includes the theory and practice of command and control of forces. In addition, regardless of the position held, the staff skills of the officer are characterized by system knowledge of questions having to do with his immediate functions, by the continuous search for new knowledge and more advanced practical skills within the limits of the position held and for a step higher, and also by the possession of the means to perform duties on the basis of interchangeability. The qualitative indicators that best characterize the genuine staff skills of the officer are knowledge of the achievements of contemporary military thought; the ability to collect and analyze the necessary information in a timely manner and to make the correct conclusions, proposals, and recommendations; and the capability to comprehend adequately the intention of the commander (chief) and ability to put his decision into effect through means guaranteeing a common understanding by all subordinates. Knowledge of the balance of secrets in his field of professional interests makes it possible for the officer dependably to keep secrets entrusted to him and not to overload regime agencies with obsolete information. The lowering of staff skills is a sign of the decline of the professionalism of the officer, which is fraught with the danger of his performance of official duties at an amateur level. Each of the indicators enumerated above could be the subject of a separate conversation. But the intention of the present notes is to show the basic reason for the lowering of staff skills and to propose a simple, effective, and inexpensive means of improving them in the command and control agencies of all levels. The assertion that it is possible to establish an effective mechanism of military development in the absence of the corresponding skills of the officers is the result of incorrect thinking and profound error. The lowering of staff skills is the result of a set of objective and subjective reasons. And as bitter as it may be, it should be recognized that the determining reason is the second one, which is expressed in diminished interest in comtemporary military theory. It is not difficult to see that inadequate immersion in the theory of the subject is the basis for the complex situations in which individual leaders find themselves who try to carry out partial reforms outside of the state program for the development of the armed forces. In the period of intensive military development as one of the components of the development of the state, knowledge of current theory of his subject of professional interests is the basic indicator of the staff skills of the officer and a criterion for the assessment of his professionalism. Errors at the theoretical level lead in practice to economic expenditures that are inadmissible for us today. The negligence of the command and control agency is the other side of the low staff skills of its officer personnel. I dare express the unpopular idea that the responsibility for the poor performance today must be assigned equally to the author of the document and to the command agency that is directed to carry it out. If for guidance use is made of a document wherein it is impossible to clarify the content of the subject, then there is no answer to the question: "What is to be done?" and, the main thing, if there is no clear determination of the final result of the activity, then such a document was based on negligence in the planning stage. Personal conversations with the developers of such schemes permit one to reach the depressing conclusion that they have a negative attitude toward military theory as the highest form of organization of military knowledge. Is there an effective way to raise the staff skills of all categories of officers? From 1979 through 1989, I carried out investigations in the course of 46 operational-tactical, command-staff, tactical, mobilization, testing, and experimental exercises, including 9 with field firing. My conclusion is that an exercise on any scale carried out without preliminary theoretical preparation of the officer personnel comes close to an experimental exercise not in form but in content and this is the reason for its poor results. And there is another aspect of such organization of exercises. To analyze exercises with theoretically untrained personnel is ignorant from a pedagogical point of view and immoral from an ethical point of view. To raise staff skills, it is necessary to give back to officer personnel their striving for in-depth theoretical knowledge on the subject of their professional interests. For this there is a simple, effective, and inexpensive mechanism--preliminary conferences and seminars on the subject of the pending exercises and training drills. Such a mechanism is effective because of the consistent integration of theory and practice and the possibility of approving the corresponding theoretical positions under the conditions of Ukraine with their subsequent adjustment and the refinement of existing plans. Today this has one other rather important meaning. To begin an exercise or training drill without preliminary theoretical study of the theme is wasteful from an economic point of view and useless from a juridical point of view, because in the near future the conditions of contract service will prohibit taking personnel out into the field without preliminary theoretical training. In the intervals between exercises and training drills, up-to-date staff skills of the officer are developed through his assimilation of the theory of the subject of his professional interests in the process of daily creative labor and initiative. In conclusion, I would like once again to stress that staff skills can be raised only if the officers assimilate current military theory. There is no other way.
