[Begin recording] [Correspondent Akif Tevekguloglu] After achieving independence, Azerbaijan had the opportunity to expand economic, political, and cultural ties with many countries. Relations between Azerbaijan and Iran--which are closely related historically, religiously, and linguistically--have entered a new stage. However, it must be noted that not all the opportunities are being used to develop the brotherly and friendly ties between Azerbaijan and Iran. In expressing these views during the talks with the guests, Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev also noted that there are no more obstacles before the Azerbaijani people to develop ties with Iran, and the border settlements and cities in both countries should play a major role in this task. [Aliyev] Azerbaijani lands bordering on Iran should play an important role if the ties between Azerbaijan and Iran are to be improved and expanded. Both the Azerbaijani and Iranian border regions are important. Undoubtedly, Iran's territory is large and it has large provinces in the border regions. Azerbaijan's territory is small compared to Iran and most of it borders with Iran. However, the border regions both on the Azerbaijani and Iranian side are playing a major role in the development of ties between us. That is, they occupy an important place. In this regard, East Azerbaijan, the general-governor of which is my friend Abdol 'Alizadeh, and hence the city of Tabriz, occupy an important place in this. When I was still in Nakhichevan and you were in Tabriz, we had the same opinion, and in developing and broadening the ties between Nakhichevan and with Iran, particularly through Eastern Azerbaijan and Tabriz, we were pursuing the aim of developing the ties between Iran and Azerbaijan in general. [Tevekguloglu] Speaking on behalf of his delegation, 'Ali Abdol 'Alizadeh thanked President Geydar Aliyev for the reception. He noted that we deeply feel the profound suffering experienced by Azerbaijan and we believe that you are capable of extracting the people from the existing grave situation. The Iranians are impatiently waiting for your visit. They would be extremely pleased to see you in Tehran and Tabriz. The guests then proposed that Baku and Tabriz be formally declared sister cities. Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev gladly accepted this proposal. Afiaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the Azerbaijan Supreme Soviet; State Adviser Vafa Gulizade; and Iranian Ambassador to Iran 'Ali Akbar Nahavandian were present at the meeting. [end recording] Chairman of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Rasul Guliyev today received the visiting Iranian delegation headed by Governor-General 'Ali Abdol 'Alizadeh. The chairman of the Supreme Soviet briefed the guests on the Azerbaijani president's position on the socio-political situation in the Republic, on exceedingly serious problems in our Republic arising from Armenia's aggression, and on the need to establish peace in the region and condemn the aggressor. Rasul Guliyev noted that the Azerbaijani president is giving great importance to the future development of Azerbaijani-Iranian ties and pointed out the urgency of using all possible means to develop ties between our peoples, who are closely tied to one another with historical, religious, and cultural roots. He also highly assessed Iran's selfless assistance to the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, which has been placed under a blockade by Armenia, and the assistance provided to the refugees by the neighboring country. Mr. Abdol 'Alizadeh expressed his views on Iran's positions on the Armenian aggression and on future development of ties between the two countries. A number of other problems of mutual interest were also discussed during the meeting. Iranian Ambassador to Azerbaijan 'Ali Akbar Nahavandian and other officials participated in the meeting. The delegation of Iran's East Azerbaijan Province was also received today by the Deputy Chairman of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Afiaddin Dzhalilov. Representatives of Azerbaijani ministries, governmental departments, and firms participated in the meeting. Afiaddin Dzhalilov noted that important documents on further developing the ties between the two countries were signed during Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's visit to Baku some months ago. Such visits have a positive effect on the implementation of the signed agreements. Mr. Abdol 'Alizadeh, the governor-general of Iran's East Azerbaijan Province, said that he was pleased with the development of the ties between the two countries. He noted that these ties are now entering a new stage and that Iran will take important steps in this direction. The Iranian border delegation visited the martyrs mausoleum to honor the memory of those martyred for Azerbaijan's independence and territorial integrity.
