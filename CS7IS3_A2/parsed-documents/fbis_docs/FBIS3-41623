Undoubtedly he will just shrug his shoulders in surprise. Really, do we have time for that? They say that ecological problems are the problems of a ``well-fed'' society. For now, our society is not in that category. It is not improbable, however, that after having assured ourselves of a reliable piece of bread, we shall find ourselves under a sky that is riddled with ozone holes. This problem faces both the ``well-fed'' society that promotes the consumers' paradise, as well as the ``hungry,'' who have been tightening their belts for severty years in expectation of mythical benefits. We all live on the same planet. What will convince us? Poplar leaves one meter long? Six-legged colts or toxic fish that attack people? A second Chernobyl? Or a third or fourth...? The discrediting of Russian nuclear energy is the goal of the ``Greenpeace Russia'' ecological organization, according to Sergey Yermakov, deputy chief of the Department for Public Information and Communication of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Atomic Energy (``Who Benefits From It?'' DELOVOY MIR, 30 July 1993). He reached this conclusion ``without having any direct evidence,'' but based only on the ``activities of one branch of `Greenpeace Russia.''' He noticed that one of its leaders, a certain Litvinov, who is a United States citizen, has a Russian passport. S. Yermakov concluded that ``Litvinov and a number of other activists of that organization are not concealing the fact that as a first priority they are carrying out plans to discredit Russian electrical and nuclear power.'' The representative of the Ministry of Atomic Energy declined to comment on ``this fact,'' and suggested that readers can do it themselves independently. Well, what kind of commentary is proposed here? In order to answer, we have to remember what was talked about a little earlier: ``... behind the attempts to discredit Russian nuclear power stations ... is the desire to squeeze Russia out of her traditional markets and lessen the interest of her potential partners in purchasing Russian nuclear power equipment and technology, as well as an attempt to impart an inferiority complex' to our experts, so that it would be easier to obtain new ideas, plans, and technology from Russia.'' Continuing in this same terminological vein, it is fully logical to suspect ``Greenpeace Russia'' of wanting to weaken the country's security.... The international ecology organization ``Greenpeace'' was formed in 1971. It has its branches in dozens of countries and is presently supported by five million inhabitants of our planet. Nothing at all can be said about any kind of assistance from ``Greenpeace Russia'' with regard to increasing security measures at Russian nuclear power stations, a step that has been called for both by the representative of the Ministry of Atomic Energy and by the editorial offices of DELOVOY MIR. The goal of that organization is to present the problems to governments, which should then resolve them. ``Greenpeace''--as an international organization--and all its branches in different countries, including Russian, take their stand against the nuclear industry and demand the closure of all nuclear power stations beginning with the most dangerous. This goal has remained the same since the 1970's, when the organization began its anti-nuclear program. I agree with S. Yermakov that our domestic nuclear fuel cycle ``is for all practical purposes no worse than what the West has.'' I shall only note that the processing and enriching stage for the uranium is one of the dirtiest in the world. Everywhere. I agree that financial assistance allocated by the European Community after Chernobyl began to be spent on the ``bureaucratic machine.'' But the money would not have disappeared if it had been put into a specific program. No such program, however, was ever proposed. I do not agree that the ``Ministry of Atomic Energy is able to exercise full control over the situation in the nuclear industry branch.'' The Ministry of Atomic Energy depends on the Russian joint-stock company that has a monopoly over selling electrical power to foreign countries, as well as domestically. Enterprises of the Ministry of Atomic Energy constantly complain about poor financing. Pre-labor strike situations develop at these enterprises, and sometimes they turn into labor strikes. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, contacts between facilities of industrial branches have also fallen apart. Everyone resolves this problem in his own way: The managers of the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station, for example, are trying to organize a consortium of enterprises in Leningrad Oblast. Accidents happen one after another: Mid-May at the Zaporozhskiy Nuclear Power Station; end of May--at the Kolskiy Nuclear Power Station; and mid-July--at the Balakovskiy Nuclear Power Station. I agree that the ``technology in our country for building reactors is superior to that of the West in a number of specific details.'' But only on paper. In practice, the situation is different. All existing reactors are experimental models: Among them is not a single one that went into series production, from which it follows that not a single aspect of technology proved itself. In constructing the foundation blocks for the Balakovskiy Nuclear Power Station, the marble pads were replaced by local limestone, with which ground water actively interacted, causing the limestone to dissolve. The marble was used, according to unsubstantiated information, to build a departmental sanatorium. I do not agree that ``construction (of the RBMK [channel-type, graphite-moderated] reactor) ... changed for the better with regard to security or that it conforms to world standards.'' Ye. Reshetnikov, Deputy Minister of Atomic Energy, noted at one of his press conferences last year that theoretically it was impossible to modernize the old Russian reactors. Dmitriy Tolmatskiy, coordinator of anti-nuclear programs for ``Greenpeace Russia,'' adds that whatever is done consists only of cosmetic measures, as for example, increasing the number of rods. Hans Blix, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), compared the RBMK reactors to old Ford automobiles: One can go for a long time in a car like that, but only if you choose the direction correctly and drive slowly. He emphasized that these reactors could not be brought up to Western standards bacause of the excessive cost of the protective casings. I think that many readers will agree that it would be very problematical to drive in an ``old Ford,'' on Russian roads that are full of economic ruts, inter-national potholes, and political bumps. In the 1960's it seemed that nuclear energy would become an inexhaustable, inexpensive, and harmless source for those living on our planet. Time gradually dispersed these illusions. In 1979, an accident at Three Mile Island; 1986--the accident at Chernobyl. The peaceful atom turned out to be not as harmless as many had thought. There were fewer and fewer supporters of nuclear energy. Right now not a single insurance company will insure a nuclear power station anywhere in the world. Atomic energy has become insolvent, not only from an ecological, but also from an economic standpoint. Before, the cost of atomic energy did not include expenditures for liquidating accident damages, mining the raw material, processing and transporting it. Alternative sources of energy require a lot fewer expenses, as we shall discuss later. All this led to the nuclear industry being squeezed out of the world energy producing market. This conclusion was reached by researchers at the Institute for World Processes (Washington), the Services for Energy Information (Paris), and the International Greenpeace organization (Amsterdam). From their ``Report on the Status of the World Nuclear Industry: 1992'' (hereafter cited as ``Report''), we find that at the beginning of 1992 there were ten fewer nuclear power stations in the world than in December 1988; and at the end of 1991, 49 stations were being built around the world, which is four times fewer than ten years ago. S. Yermakov does not agree with this. He maintains that ``an accelerated development of nuclear power engineering is taking place in a number of Western countries,'' and he cites the examples of Japan, France, and England. Since Japan and France are exceptions to the worldwide trend, all supporters of nuclear power engineering in the world are rallying to their ``expansionist'' plans. The nuclear industry in France began to develop in the 1970's as a result of concern at increasing oil prices, according to the ``Report.'' At present, 56 reactors working at full capacity provide 75 percent of France's electrical power. Since there are seven reactors too many, France has to sell its energy to neighboring countries at low prices. France has nearly one half of the nuclear power potential of Western Europe. As a result of this large-scale construction, the debt of the state municipal services of France was 214 million French francs (or 38 million US dollars) at the beginning of 1992. The debt grew because huge subsidies were given as a reward for using nuclear energy and to justify investments in this branch of industry. For the amount of energy produced per one megawatt of power in a nuclear power station, France is on a rather low level in comparison with other countries. This gap will increase if five additional nuclear power stations are built by the end of the century. The development of French nuclear power engineering is, however, slowing down and is now at the level where it can only support the work of the state nuclear industry. The last order for building a nuclear reactor was received in 1987. Japan has 42 nuclear power stations that provide 27 percent of all the country's energy. Ten additional stations are being built. By the year 2010, the government plans to have 80 reactors, which is improbable. There is also serious opposition to these plans: 47 percent of the population believes that Japanese nuclear power stations are ``relatively unsafe'' or ``completely unsafe.'' Even nuclear experts agree that new nuclear power stations can be built only in countries that already have them. In the last five years, however, not a single new area has been acquired for this purpose. What then would replace nuclear power stations if we decide--after all--to do away with them? Alternative sources of energy: Solar, wind, tidal, and geothermal plants. But the main attention, according to Lika Galkina, coordinator of anti-nuclear programs of ``Greenpeace Russia,'' should be devoted to gas turbine plants of the ``Vityaz'' type that we already have. A necessary parallel action is to decrease losses of oil and gas during extraction and transportation. Several million tonnes of oil spill out of broken pipelines every year in Russia, notes Aleksey Yablokov, adviser to the president of the Russian Federation on ecology and health protection. The most lit up part of our planet as seen in a night photograph taken from space is the area of Northwest Siberia: Tens of thousands of continually burning torches merge into a spot brighter than New York, Los Angeles, or Tokyo. The quickest and most effective way to slow down global warming, according to U.S. Vice President Albert Gore, is to stop the gas leaks in Siberia. A great amount of energy is lost in thermal and electrical grids because of the use of old power-consuming technology and simply because of poor insulation of houses. In order to regulate heating, special battery-operated valves should be installed, as has been done in all developed countries for many years now. Incidentally, 70 percent of the people living in Munich turn off their heating even when they go for a two-hour walk. The loss of electrical energy will be substantially less if old electrical motors are exchanged for new, more efficient ones. Electrical motors in most of the industrial countries now use over one half of available electrical power. Fluorescent lamps, replacing the usual incandescent lamps, give off as much light, use one quarter of the energy needed by their predecessors, and last ten times longer. It would be advisable to introduce conditions for the efficient use of energy in making financial loans, such as, for example, what the World Bank did with a loan to Brazil. ``After me, the deluge!'' This pronouncement of Louis XV is, unfortunately, more famous than the slogan of the ``Greenpeace'' people: ``To save in the environment what can still be saved!'' How can we reach the point where we shall think not only of our stomachs, but also about nature which fills our stomachs with its gifts? One time the Greenpeace people made a giant transparency 1,000 square meters in size. Too small? I think they could make it even 2,000 square meters. And how much is needed? Three, four?....
