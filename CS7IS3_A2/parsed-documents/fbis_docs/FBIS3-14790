The president shared gave his assessment to the activities of the parliamentary commission in the state of emergency zone in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. The North Ossetian and Ingush presidents are capable of settling their differences without any mediation, he emphasised. They can solve all complicated issues by themselves.

The final word is to be said by reconciliation commissions," he emphasised.
