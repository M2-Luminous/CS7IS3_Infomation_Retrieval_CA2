FBIS3-29776 "dreas036__a94018" FBIS-EAS-94-036-A Document Type:Daily Report 23 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Program for Further Market Opening Planned OW2202045494 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 20 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2202045494 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The government plans to work out, as early as before the end of this month, a market-opening program centered on deregulation, and has also decided on including in this program a mechanism for assessing and checking results of foreign firms' actual access to the Japanese market based on numerical results recorded in various sectors. The government intends to adopt an approach of reviewing plans 1) to improve market access one by one while watching results of importing foreign-made products with competitive power based on actual results of procurement of foreign products in the government procurement sector; 2) on actual results in sales of imported cars as well as increase in the number of dealers engaged in simultaneous sales of imported and domestically-made cars; and 3) on actual results in imports of foreign-made auto parts. In adopting this approach, the government aims to respond to overseas criticism that "the Japanese Government is indifferent to results." The government also plans to clearly state in this program that the basic plan for public investment totalling 430 trillion yen [Y] in 10 years worked out in 1990 will be reviewed and the amount of investment will be increased. The total amount of the additional investment to be decided before the end of this year is estimated to reach over Y100 trillion. Following the failure of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the government has decided to work out a market-opening program centered on four major points: deregulation; promotion of imports and investment; strengthening of policy in competition; and improvement of government procurement. Concerned agencies and ministries have already started studying detailed plans. Among topics brought up for discussion are strengthening of application of the Antimonopoly Act; deregulation in land utilization and the housing sector; and simplification of procedures for importing foodstuffs and medical supplies. However, the actual situation is that there is a shortage of effective measures. The government has decided on introducing a mechanism for checking access results and on studying the plan to increase the public investment because of its judgment that it is necessary to set forth plans that can easily win understanding among foreign countries. It has been strongly criticized overseas that "despite Japan's continuous appeal for opening up its market, there have been no results whatsoever." It is observed that such dissatisfaction could be eased if Japan indicated its approach of connecting check of development in import expansion by numerial results, on the one hand, with efforts to analyze the causes and work out countermeasures, on the other. Moreover, in increasing the total of public investment, the government intends to indicate its eagerness to promote macroeconomic policy, according to which additional investment is regarded as indispensable to efforts to reduce the external trade surplus. As for actual checking of results in the government procurement sector, the government plans to publish actual procurement from foreign firms by procurement agencies; moreover, it will announce to what extent procurement has been made by applying the general bidding system, and to what extent procurement has been made by signing free contracts. Regarding the auto and auto parts sector, the government will publish figures on actual imports, and at the same time announce the number of cases in which foreign firms have joinied in the design-in process when both manufacturers and users join in consultations throughout the processes of designing and development. In addition, the government intends to select various items -- in which foreign countries have strong interest -- and check actual results of their imports. In revising the basic plan for public investment, the government intends to expand investment in those areas that are most closely connected with efforts to improve the living environment. As far as the macroeconomic policy is concerned, an idea has surfaced that income tax cuts should be carried out not only in fiscal 1995 but also in years thereafter. The government is stressing that the trade surplus can be reduced in a steady way through efforts to open up the market and expand imports by implementing both micro- and macroeconomic policies. However, it still remains ambigious as to whether it will be possible to win understanding from foreign countries by working out only these measures.
