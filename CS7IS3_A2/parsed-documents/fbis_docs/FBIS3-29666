In particular, the National Unification Board and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have greatly different views on the following issues: The importance of North-South dialogue regarding the third DPRK-U.S. talks, the form of the North- South dialogue, the announcement date for the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise, and the government's attitude regarding public relations. In the 18 February seminar to greet the 2d anniversary of the effectuation of the "North-South Basic Agreement," Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and chairman of the national unification board, stressed that "the third DPRK-U.S. talks would be held only if there is significant progress in North-South dialogue," and that "through an exchange of special envoys, in particular, North Korea should discuss the following issues, such as its return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, its resumption of ad hoc [imsi] or ordinary [tongsang] inspections by the IAEA, and the simultaneous inspections of the North and South." Before returning to Seoul after he visited the United States, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said, however, that "we cannot deny the importance of North-South dialogue, but it may be unhelpful to the settlement of the issues pending between the North and South in the light of the settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue." The two ministers have the same opinions regarding the importance of North-South dialogue. However, Foreign Minister Han has stressed that the settlement of the nuclear issue can be delayed if we attach too much importance to progress in the North-South dialogue, while Deputy Prime Minister Yi has said that a certain progress must be made in the North-South dialogue to resolve it. Regarding the resumption of the North-South dialogue, they also have a different view on the form of dialogue. Song Yong-tae, vice minister of the National Unification Board, stressed in his 17 February news interview with reporters that "the North-South dialogue must be carried out in the form of the exchange of special envoys." While he was in Canada, Foreign Minister Han said that "he would not care if the North-South dialogue is carried out in the form of the exchange of special envoys, or in the form of a meeting of the North-South Joint Nuclear Control Committee, or in the form of the North-South high-level talks, if they are intended to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue." They have also different views of the announcement date of the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise. In a Television interview on the morning of 20 February, Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sung-yong has set the concrete date for the conditional suspension of the Team Spirit exercise by saying that "the government would announce the conditional suspension of the Team Spirit exercise at the time of the IAEA inspection team members' arrival in North Korea and when the North and South resume their working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys." However, Deputy Prime Minister Yi said on 18 February that "the conditional suspension of the Team Spirit exercise will be determined depending on the result of the IAEA's inspection and the progress in the North-South dialogue for the exchange of special envoys." The attitude shown by the National Unification Board and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since North Korea has accepted the nuclear inspections is very comparative. On the morning of 16 February -- the day the fact that North Korea accepted the nuclear inspections was disclosed -- Vice Foreign Minister Hong expressed the government's position on future policy direction along with the detailed explanation of the process of nuclear negotiations. On the other hand, relevant responsible officials of the National Unification Board did not express official commentary regarding its position that day. It has been confirmed that a relevant high-level official instructed them not to do so. Although the fact that "a meeting on unification-related strategy" was held on the morning of 17 February chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Yi was disclosed by other ministries, the National Unification Board has continued its secret administrative business by saying that "it has never heard it." Depending on the progress in the settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue, the different views of the issues between the National Unification Board and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are likely to be catalysts in creating discord between the governmental ministries in charge of the issues of the unification, security, national defense, and foreign diplomacy.
