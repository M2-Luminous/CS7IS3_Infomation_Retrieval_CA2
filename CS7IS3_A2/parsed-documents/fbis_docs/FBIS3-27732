The request followed the Diet's passage of four political reform bills earlier in the day as a result of a compromise accord reached between Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party in a last-ditch meeting late Friday. The attention of the business community now focuses on how speedily the Hosokawa administration will carry out economic stimulative measures. Business leaders by and large believe the foundation has been laid for stimulating the post-bubble, stagnant economy. Hiroshi Saito, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, noted the economy is now in critical shape. "I strongly hope the government will draft a budget (for fiscal 1994) and implement pump-priming measures at the earliest possible time, including a substantial cut in income taxes," said Saito, also chairman of Nippon Steel Corp., the world's largest steel producer. The view was shared by Kohei Abe, head of the Federation of Electric Power Companies, who said he also wants the government to grapple with trade issues with the United States in a positive way ahead of a February 11 summit between Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington. Reiichi Yumikura, chairman of the Japan Chemical Fibers Association, said Hosokawa should take the leadership in reducing income taxes "retroactively and speedily." Meanwhile, an executive of a major automaker expressed the view that Diet approval of the political reform program has made it possible for the coalition government of Prime Minister Hosokawa to bolster its power base. "This in turn indicates Hosokawa may be able to exchange views frankly with Clinton on bilateral problems such as trade imbalances and the yen's ascent against the U.S. dollar," he said. Japanese automakers, electronics companies and other export-oriented manufacturers have been badly hurt by the rapid appreciation of the yen in value which makes their products abroad more expensive.
