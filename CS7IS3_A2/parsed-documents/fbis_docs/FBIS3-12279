The movement stresses that this massacre by Israeli settlers took place in collusion with Israeli troops and the intelligence service. It coincided with the yesterday's [24 February] massacre when the Israeli Army waged a battle with rockets against Hamas fugitives in Abu Dis, near Jerusalem. The movement considers this massacre and this escalation a glaring violation of the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on 13 September 1993 and the peace process. The movement holds the Israeli side and its political, military, and security leaders responsible for all the massacres, killings, and assassinations that are taking place against our Palestinian people. They are responsible for allowing settlers to carry the weapons that they aim at the sons of our people and use to commit massacres and killings. The movement views today's massacre, the collusion of Israeli troops in it, what happened in Abu Dis yesterday, and the earlier Israeli military escalation as an assassination of the peace process and sufficient justification for military escalation by all Palestinian resistance factions and for continued jihad and revolution against the nightmare of Israeli occupation. Our Palestinians will not forgive these massacres. God is great. Glory for the free mujahidin.
