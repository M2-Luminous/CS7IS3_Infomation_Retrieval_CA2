The Franco-German company (Aerospatiale: 70 percent; Deutsche Aerospace: 30 percent) has just been through a 1993 fiscal year which would have been disastrous but for two last-minute military contracts with Turkey and the Netherlands. And Mr. Bigay opens the 1994 year with license agreements and an order for five Dauphin helicopters from Samsung Aerospace, hoping he will not have to implement a new streamlining plan. In financial terms the helicopter manufacturer went into the red last year for the first time ever. The exact amount of the losses will not be known until April, but it should be close to 300 million French francs [Fr], including Fr250 million in depreciations and specific risk allowances. In 1992, Eurocopter earned Fr25 million. Its objective for 1994 is clearly to restore its financial balance. However, it will not be able to prevent sales from falling further this year. Sales amounted to Fr10.2 billion in 1993, a 10.5 percent decline. Another Fr800-million drop is expected this year, with sales falling below the Fr9.5 billion mark. Mr. Bigay's explanation is that "the world market for helicopters last year was the worst in 25 years, with 260 civilian and 285 military machines (not including two closed markets -- the U.S. and Russian armed forces). Such a low level of orders had not been witnessed since the mid-1960s, with the exception -- on the military side -- of the year 1991, weighted down by the Gulf War. Slight Reprieve The Franco-German company did manage to capture 56 percent of the civilian market and to regain its average defense share (24 percent). Its order book totaled Fr9.3 billion and 166 helicopters, including 43 large ones. Ninety-five percent of orders come from abroad, with, among others, 20 Cougars for Turkey and 17 military Super Pumas for the Netherlands -- a Fr1.4-billion contract. Thus Bonn and Paris will have only made a very limited contribution to the company's health. Still, although the recent contracts will guarantee some activity for 1994 and part of 1995, Eurocopter badly needs another large order this year -- about 20 Super Pumas worth Fr1.5 billion. The company is therefore hoping that France and Germany will agree to give it a hand should foreign orders fail to materialize in 1994. Indeed, it was only in the hypothesis that another large order was on the way that Eurocopter decided not to suppress more jobs, as it did in 1993 for 1,060 positions, cutting its total workforce down to 10,500. The Franco-German company would rather resort to short-term measures only, such as temporary unemployment; a gamble which it may need to reconsider in the second half of 1994 should market conditions keep deteriorating.
