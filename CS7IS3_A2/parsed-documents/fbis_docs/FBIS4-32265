Coupon privatisation was launched in the former Czechoslovakia in 1992 when the first wave was held. Currently the second wave is under way in the Czech Republic, while Slovakia has been preparing for it and may launch it in the autumn. It is estimated that by the time the second wave ends property worth 350 billion crowns (about $11.7 billion) will have been in private hands, the paper writes. Recently Premier Vaclav Klaus said coupon privatisation would end by the year's end after which other privatisation methods would be applied. Property worth a total of 950 billion crowns is to be privatised in the Czech Republic. Dusan Triska, one of the authors of coupon privatisation, said yesterday that the owner of "the intangible side of the project of coupon privatisation" was the Czech Government which would have agree to the possible export of the scheme. (Two other co-authors of the scheme are Premier Vaclav Klaus and the former chairman of the National Property Fund, Tomas Jezek.) Triska said that Czech experts had already played a role in the creation of the privatisation law in Bulgaria, and therefore it was very probable that the Czech model would be maximally applied there. The concrete deal would probably be concluded by Podnik vypocetni techniky (Computer Technology Centre) and a partner business company from Bulgaria, and it would be financed by the World Bank, Triska said. He said that Czech experts have already been advising the Governments of Kazakhstan, Slovenia, and Latvia on how best to apply the Czech method in their countries' conditions. Interest in Czech coupon privatisation as it has been implemented in the Czech Republic has also been shown by Algeria. Czech experts will go to Algeria to assess along with their Algerian colleagues possibilities of applying the scheme there, Czech Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik announced at a recent international economic forum in Crans-Montana, Switzerland. But Triska is quoted by MLADA FRONTA DNES as saying that the Czech model could be exported only partially because it was closely connected with concrete personalities and because it was being born in concrete political, economic and legal conditions of Czechoslovakia. That is also why Czech experts have recently recommended to the Latvian Government to make certain changes in the implementation of the Czech model.
