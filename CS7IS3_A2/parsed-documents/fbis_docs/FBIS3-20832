Nedeljkovic: "Credit Awaiting Deposits"] [Text] There is no possibility of credit without significant savings by citizens. Beobanka is the first bank to offer real estate loans, but few people can pay the high interest rates. To grant farm loans, Agrobank requires deposits or share purchases. Strong Dinar -- Expensive Credit The expected revival of credit activity is much slower than expected. Zika Urosevic, chief of the Credit Department in Agrobank, notes that "there cannot be credit without deposits. It is true that we are not lending money yet, but we will start for certain no later than one week from today. However, the question is who can get credit as long as we require deposits or share purchases." In Agrobank, for the time being they only indicate that their business policy will also make provisions for loans to farmers, but only under the previously mentioned condition: cash deposits or share purchases. For the time being, the possibility of using the former hard currency savings is not being considered. Dragoljub Vukosavljevic, president of Union Bank, points out that "the only person who can get a loan is someone who has money, but such a person does not need to borrow money. Banks have no money; thus, more active lending can be expected only after the revival of savings activity. Still, the question is how to regain savers' confidence." Many banks are waiting for their annual meetings to define their business policies and specify the requirements for credit. In Privredna Bank in Belgrade, they believe they will regain the savers' confidence because they have already paid off almost one-half of the old hard currency savings. Milovan Kvrgic, director of Privredna Bank in Belgrade, says that "there is no saving and therefore no credit without savers' confidence. Objectively observed, banks have no source of money for lending until saving is revived both in hard currency and in convertible dinars. What will probably help us is the fact that we practically never stopped paying off the old hard currency savings accounts." The Beobanka Bank has published the requirements for all types of credit. Particularly important for individuals is the possibility of real estate loans. However, these loans are available only to those who can make a deposit equal to 50 percent of the loan value with annual interest of 7 percent. Loan terms are 20 years for purchase of an apartment and 10 years for home improvements. However, the early figures show that only a few people will be able to meet the requirements of either deposit or interest rates, which amount to 1,000 dinars per month for a two-bedroom apartment of 60 square meters. The expectation entertained by potential borrowers that banks are going to offer a large spectrum of loans is not realistic. The little money the commercial banks will allocate for loans will be used very sparingly. No comparison to any previous period would be realistic. The present situation is considerably less favorable despite the fact that we have a solid dinar. Some bankers even say, with a light touch of cynicism, that the dinar is expensive and difficult to borrow mainly because it is strong.
