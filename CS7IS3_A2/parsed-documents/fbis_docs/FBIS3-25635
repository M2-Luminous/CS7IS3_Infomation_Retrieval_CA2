After many other war declarations by a number of Futungo de Belas' radical wing leaders, now it is the turn of Joao de Matos, Eduardo dos Santos' war chief, who has come out to say no to peace. Speaking to JORNAL DE ANGOLA, which serves the regime, the head of the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola tried to deceive the world, accusing UNITA of preparing for an extremely violent war regardless of the outcome of Lusaka talks. However, sources from the General Staff of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] reacted violently to such statements, describing them as a hallucination. The same sources said the main aim of the interview granted by Joao de Matos yesterday was to prepare the ground to camouflage military offensives being launched by his troops in various parts of Angola, as well as to justify other possible military operations against areas controlled by UNITA. The truth is that the main intention of the regime's radical wing is to continue fighting, although without success, until the hoped for possibility of eliminating UNITA, as by Lucio Lara stated in his recent remarks in France. The sources from the FALA General Staff call on the international community, particularly the United Nations, who are mediating the Angolan conflict, to condemn all these Machiavellian actions from the Futungo de Belas since they considerably endanger the current peace process.
