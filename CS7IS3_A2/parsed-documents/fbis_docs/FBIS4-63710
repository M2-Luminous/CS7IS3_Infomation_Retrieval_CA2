The statement said: "The results of the 4th session of the Baltic Assembly have confirmed Russia's fears that normalization and further development of relations between Russia and the three Baltic countries were not included into the plans of certain political forces in these states. "Although there are real problems concerning the situation of the Russian-speaking population in Latvia and Estonia... parliamentaries of the three countries decided to accept the so called common statement 'On Russia's pressure on the Baltic states'. It is quite evident they were not looking for constructive decisions, necessary for the negotiations with Estonia, but were led by purely political motives. "The resolution on the relations with Russian Federation went even further. Calling Russia to admit there are 'unresolved territorial questions' and to bear the responsibility for damage done to the Baltic states since 1940 and to compensate it, the parliamentaries made a dangerous step -- they are trying to transfer events of these years from historical plane to that of financial, material, etc. claims to Russian Federation, although Russia is not and will not be responsible for actions made by Stalin's regime. "The Baltic Assembly proved some Baltic politicians try to find new pretexts to base their anti-Russian policies instead of historical estimations of the past events", the statement said.
