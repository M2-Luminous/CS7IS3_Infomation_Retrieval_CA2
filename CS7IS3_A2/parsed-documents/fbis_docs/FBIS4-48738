The PANA correspondent in Bujumbura noted that in Bujumbura the capital, offices, banks and transport were functioning normally. The PRP leader had called the strike to protest against the closure of public media organs to the opposition and the proposed holding of a conference on Burundi, scheduled to take place in Nairobi, Kenya. Contacted by PANA by telephone Wednesday [25 May], the PRP leader denied that the strike had failed. He claimed that in the long run, the citizens will join his movement's cause because it was just. Asked to comment on the proposed Nairobi conference on the theme "Restoration and Maintenance of Public Order in a State of Law", Hitimana, who is a half-caste said the meeting was under intense discussions between the UN special representative in Burundi and the country's politicians. The negotiations are being conducted to determine the justification of such meeting, as well as the choice of venue. [passage omitted]
