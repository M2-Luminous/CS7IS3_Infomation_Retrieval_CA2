ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: At the request of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LDOTD), the Coast Guard is considering a change to the regulation governing the operation of the State Route 27 swing span drawbridge across Kelso Bayou, mile 0.7 at Hackberry, Cameron Parish, Louisiana. The proposed regulation would require that from about May 25 (the beginning of the shrimping season as set by the state yearly), until October 31, the bridge open on signal from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and open on 4-hours notice from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. Then from November 1, through December 22, the draw would open on signal from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to 7 a.m. open on 4-hours notice. From December 22, until about May 25, the draw would open on 24-hours notice. Presently, the bridge opens on signal from about May 25, until December 22. From December 22, until about May 25 the draw opens on 4-hours notice. Alternate routes are available. This action would provide relief to the bridge owner and still provide for the reasonable needs of navigation. DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 5, 1994.
