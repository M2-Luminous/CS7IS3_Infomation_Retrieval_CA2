The statement added: We, the pursued Fatah hawks inside and outside the occupied territories, demand that the 'Arafat leadership halt its negotiations with the Zionist enemy. Similarly, we demand all fighting Palestinian factions to unify themselves in the crucible of the revolution and armed struggle against enemy troops and the hordes of settlers, who are engaged in murder and terrorism against our Palestinian people, who are fighting the Zionist injustice and repression. Concluding their statement, the Fatah hawks said: Our people's dignity cannot be safeguarded unless we extricate our national rights by force, just as they have been usurped by force.
