In Seoul the program, known as the Korean Fighter Program (KFP), has become a political issue because of suspicions surrounding the selection of F-16's as the Korean Air Force's next-generation fighter. The Pentagon's action, which apparently violates the Seoul-Washington contract on the KFP, was made known on Sunday when the Pentagon released its fiscal 1995 budget paper. It is expected to cause problems in the security relationship between the two governments. Seoul and Washington have been disputing the question of fixing the Airborne Self-Protection Jammer (ASPJ) on the F-16 fighters to be supplied to South Korea over the next several years, and new Defense Secretary William Perry was recently found to have been involved in the row when he was deputy secretary. The Pentagon budget paper does not mention the money needed to improve the existing ASPJ model. This is seen as meaning that the Pentagon has washed its hands of the ASPJ project, seemingly because it failed to turn out an improved model. The suspension of the ASPJ project would delay delivery of the F-16 fighters, set to start in October, which would in turn pose a stumbling block to the KFP, estimated at 5.4 trillion won (6.7 billion U.S. dollars). The Pentagon promised to supply F-16 fighters equipped with an improved ASPJ model for the KFP, according to South Korean officials here. But Defense Secretary Perry is known to have recently pressed Seoul to buy ASPJ devices through commercial channels because the Pentagon cannot guarantee the quality of the ASPJ developed by ITT Corp. Seoul has urged Washington to keep its promise to fit a new model of ASPJ to the F-16 fighters for the KFP and supply the fighters for the foreign military sales program, not through commercial channels.
