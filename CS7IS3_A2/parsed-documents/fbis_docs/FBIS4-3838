In an interview with reporters after his talks with visiting Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen, Kozyrev called on the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations to work out a joint plan with Russia for ending the bloodshed in Bosnia- Herzegovina. "While NATO is elaborating a military plan, we want to make a peace plan together with them," he added. Without such a peace plan, "I think it would be a defeat of the international community," he said. The Russian foreign minister also said, "We cannot agree with the actions of those Bosnian Serbs who put civilian facilities under artillery fire." "It is quite evident that these people have taken the path that runs counter to the Serb interests -- Serbia as a single whole and Bosnian Serbs. Russia cannot describe this path other than barbarity and crime. How can one trust these people?" Kozyrev added. He believes, however, that there is still hope for a political solution. "There are other Serbs, including in Bosnia, whom I call the 'party of reason'. There is President Milosevic in Belgrade, with whom I spoke several hours in a row on the eve of April 17. His stand is very reasonable." Asked about Russia's plan on relations with NATO, the Russian minister said Moscow is working on a package of proposals which can serve as the basis for cooperation with NATO. This package is more serious than the one offered to Moscow by NATO, he said, without elaboration.
