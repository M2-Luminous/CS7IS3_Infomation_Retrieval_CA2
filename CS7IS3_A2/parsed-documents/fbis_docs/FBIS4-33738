According to BC estimates that were made available to FOLHA, interest payments on the foreign and domestic debts will surpass the $7.7 billion budget provision. The BC estimates that such payments will amount to 2.1 percent of the GDP (gross domestic product, or the goods and services produced by the country). This percentage amounts to from $9 billion to $10 billion, depending on the GDP figure. This difference is enough to make government spending surpass the income provisions of the 1994 budget. In the budget bill submitted to Congress, government spending and income are equal. Balancing government accounts is considered a foundation of the Real Plan, as it will prevent the government from printing money or contracting debts to pay its expenses. The BC estimates were made in February and, according to BC technicians, they were not updated. The budget provision for paying the interest on the debt has remained unchanged since December. PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] Deputy for Sao Paulo Barbieri, the rapporteur of the budget bill in the Chamber of Deputies, also suspects that the budget provision for repaying the debt is underestimated. In a preliminary report, Barbieri said it was "very strange" that the $7.7 billion provision made in December had not been modified to match the rise in interest since the beginning of the year. Since the end of 1993 interest rates have risen from about 17 percent annually above inflation to more than 30 percent. The domestic debt grew from $48 billion to $53.5 billion. The IMF mission that looked into the government accounts in March shared this distrust. The IMF considered that spending was underestimated and that part of the budget income was overestimated. The IMF preferred not to conclude an agreement with Brazil.
