During his visit an agreement was signed on trade and economic cooperation between our two countries. On the eve of the trip ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov interviewed Mr Delamuraz. The minister said, in particular: "I am sure that Russian-Swiss relations have a big future. The agreement we have signed is intended to start a new chapter in partnership links between the two states. Switzerland wants the transformations in Russia to succeed. Everything that contributes to strengthening the liberal order in the world is of fundamental significance, in the Swiss government's view. The trip is a public expression of the Swiss will for cooperation with the Russian Federation." The federal adviser sees the present level of trade and economic relations as "relatively modest and much lower than it could be." While the average annual volume of trade with the former USSR exceeded two billion Swiss francs, last year it was approximately 700 million, which is "clearly not enough." "Russia needs us, and we need an economically developed Russia." [Pribytkov] How did the collapse of the former USSR affect bilateral trade? [Delamuraz] It was destructive, certainly. We are currently at the stage of reestablishing our economic contacts along decentralized lines. Where we used to have one partner, we now have dozens. I think one major problem is finance and the need to create an effective and reliable banking system. [Pribytkov] Investments in Russia are still regarded by some Western businessmen as very risky. Do you agree? [Delamuraz] Indeed, capital investments in Russia are particularly risky. As we get to know one another better and establish relations of personal trust, these risks will become easier to calculate and predict. A reliable juridical system is of paramount importance in this respect. Swiss investors are notoriously cautious. But once they get down to the job they remain dedicated to it and prove themselves to be reliable partners. I hope that our relations in the investments sphere will become more intensive in the next few months and years. [Pribytkov] As is known, Switzerland has instituted credit guarantees to help countries with transitional economies. What is the future of these credits? [Delamuraz] Our assistance for Russia and the other CIS states is only now becoming effective. I might mention the recently instituted line of credit guarantees for Russia in the sum of 100 million Swiss francs. We are also studying and implementing a number of specific projects in the spheres of technical assistance and infrastructure development. This is just the initial stage. But no matter what foreign governments do, state funds are always limited, so, ultimately, economic cooperation must be driven by private entrepreneurs and investors. [Pribytkov] Russian officials are urging Western partners to lift trade restrictions. This would help the reforms even more than other forms of assistance. What do you think? [Delamuraz] I entirely agree that trade is better than aid. Trade partners are responsible for what they say. Markets have to be even more open. In our case, I think I can say that the Swiss market is wide open to all foreign goods, regardless of their provenance. [Pribytkov] What spheres of economic cooperation can be regarded as the most promising, in your view? [Delamuraz] I think there are many spheres in which our two countries could cooperate more intensively and obtain mutual benefit. The foundation of Swiss industry is made up, in particular, of small and medium-sized enterprises. As for specific sectors of industry, our companies have acquired a worldwide reputation in such spheres as machine building and the chemical, pharmaceutical, watchmaking, and food industries. Most of these sectors are distinguished by highly intensive research and know-how. Swiss financial and insurance services are highly specialized and competitive.
