After the failed attempt had been made on the policeman's life, Constable Botha managed to hit the motorist in the face with the butt of his firearm after which the man ran away. Two other occupants of the vehicle also tried to run away. "But Constable Jaco Botha, also 19, and Sgt Michael Brennen, 25, managed to arrest them," said the report. Two 9mm pistols, magazines and ammunition were recovered from the vehicle which had been robbed from its owner in Isando shortly before the incident.
