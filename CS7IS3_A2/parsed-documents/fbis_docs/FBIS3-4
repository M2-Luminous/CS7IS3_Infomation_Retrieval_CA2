FBIS3-4 "cr00000011394001" 2 March 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-029--ALGERIA ALGERIA: PRESS ABSTRACTS NO. 4 The following summaries highlight information from articles that appeared in the Algiers French- and regional Arabic-language press in January and February. Liamine Zeroual's Image Favorable A report in the Arabic-language Doha (Qatar) daily AL-SHARQ of 3 February states that the public views newly elected President Liamine Zeroual as a very shrewd and experienced military man who can return Algeria "to the days of Boumedienne." According to the report, Zeroual is seen as the man who can end the confrontation between the Islamists and the nationalists since he effectively pushed for dialogue and reconciliation when he was defense minister. Zeroual reportedly considers nationalism inseparable from Islam as part of his new national order: "Zeroual goes back to the origins of the Algerian revolution when nationalism embraced Islam during the battle for independence. In the sixties the two diverged. Nationalism embraced socialism and Islam was marginalized. When socialism failed, Islam came back forcefully." Zeroual has reportedly created a positive image through his efforts as defense minister to deal in a positive manner with both the (Islamic Salvation Front) FIS and the regime. As a result, FIS leader Rabah Kebir says his party anticipates that Zeroual will change policy, but not necessarily replace government officials. According to the report, Kebir's statement indicates that the FIS is becoming more flexible and wants to undertake serious dialogue with authorities, particularly in light of the communications that took place before and after the National Dialogue in January. Influx of Refugees in the South Provokes Concern French-language Algiers daily EL WATAN of 10 and 23 January has reported that Algerian Tuareg frustration and anger is growing in Tamanrasset because of the high number of illegal foreigners (mainly from Niger, Mali, and Ghana) who reportedly outnumber Algerians in the region. The Tuaregs hold these foreigners responsible for increasing crime rates, attacks against tourists, and drug trafficking which weakens the economy and creates a security problem in the region. Hadj Moussa Akhmokh, a prominent Tuareg authority, says a 1992 plan to improve regional security was unsuccessful and that "the situation has become worse." In December, for example, the two national firms National Company for Mining Research (SONAREM) and Center for Energy Research (CREM) were looted and several vehicles were stolen. In addition, customs officials from Tamanrasset were kidnapped by a group of individuals armed with Kalashnikovs, robbed, and taken to Niger where they were manhandled before being released. According to Hadj Akhamokh, the more recent kidnapping of 18 Tuaregs (10 Algerians and eight Malians) set a "serious" precedent and was the "last straw." Citizens planned a peaceful march to demonstrate their anger and to attract the attention of authorities until Hadj Akhamokh convinced them to postpone the march. Hadj Akhmokh stated the Tuaregs have responded to his appeal, but that they are "impatient," and are waiting for the government to take control of the situation. According to Hadj Akhamokh, smuggling is also a serious problem. He faults local police for participating in the corruption and allowing it to continue. Food shipments intended for the local population are being purchased and resold for twice the price across the border, including milk which has been unavailable in the markets for "months." According to Hadj Akhmokh, "smuggling has grown to proportions that the Tuaregs can no longer tolerate. To starve the people is to push us to revolt."

'Terrorists' Exert Pressure; Press, Lifestyle Threatened EL WATAN of 16 January reported that "terrorist threats" have promoted a climate of fear in the town of Meftah, "imposing a life style that has nothing to do with Algerian society." According to the report, Meftah and Medea have become towns which immerse themselves more and more in Islamic, even "fundamentalist," tendencies. For example, the article stated that tracts posted throughout Meftah threaten that women who do not wear the hijab and who wear Western style clothes will "have to deal with us." In addition threats have been made against beauty salons, Moorish baths, and cassette vendors. "Fundamentalists" have also attacked the press, declaring it "unsuitable reading." EL WATAN reported in three articles from 16 to 18 January that newspaper vendors and bookstores in Blida, Medea, ChIef, and El Khemis were no longer selling newspapers. According to EL WATAN of 16 January, national publications, particularly those of the independent press, have suddenly disappeared from the shelves due to "terrorist threats." One citizen reported, "Don't use my name, but I am afraid to tell you that tobacco shops and bookstores are scared to death. They are convinced that if they continue to sell newspapers there could be serious reprisals." EL WATAN of 17 and 18 January reported that vendors have denied the threats, blaming distributors for failing to deliver the newspapers. Nonetheless, security services have ordered merchants to sell newspapers or be shut down. Citizens Reportedly Buying Visas An article in the French-language daily ALGER REPUBLICAIN of 19 January recounted the frustrations of dozens of Algerians trying to obtain French visas. Given the evening curfew, many spend the night in nearby hotels or in the elevators or hallways of neighboring buildings. According to the report, lines can begin as early as 4 a.m., causing citizens to resort to purchasing a place in line for 500-1000 dirhams, depending on the position in line and the time it is purchased. In the words of one citizen, "It is a real stock exchange." The French consulate reportedly closed for two days and suspended issuing visas in an effort to set up a new system whereby visa requests would be handled through the mail.
