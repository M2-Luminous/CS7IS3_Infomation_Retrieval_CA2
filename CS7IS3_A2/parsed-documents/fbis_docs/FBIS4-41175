On Tuesday he took part in the meeting in the Belarussian Academy of Geo-Politics which was holding an international conference "Russia and Belarus - the way to the future" in Minsk. Lukyanov told Interfax that his visit to Minsk was aimed at expressing support to those forces standing for expansion of Russian-Belarussian cooperation and defending the idea of restoration of a renewed Union. "My visit has absolutely nothing to do with the coming presidential elections in Belarus," Lukyanov stressed. He said that the mechanism for restoration of the Union was created when 19 communist parties were set up in the ex- Soviet republics. Lukyanov said that the congress of the USSR peoples planned for this September was also expected to contribute to establishment of a mass movement for restoration of the Union. Lukyanov spoke in favor of participation of Russian and Belarussian parliamentarians in the hearings on the results of the implementation of the Belaya Vezh agreement which will be held in the State Duma Committee on CIS in early July.
