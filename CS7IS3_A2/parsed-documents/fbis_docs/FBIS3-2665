Bedie made the above statement when accepting credentials from new Chinese Ambassador to Ivory Coast Liu Lide [0491 4539 1795]. Bedie said: "When reviewing the past decade since Ivory Coast and China established diplomatic relations, we can only feel happy and cannot ignore the fact that diplomatic relations between the two countries have been developing remarkably." President Yang Shangkun's visit to Ivory Coast in July 1992 has broadened bilateral exchanges. Because of these contacts and the thorough understanding of each other's wishes and interests, the Ivorian and Chinese Governments have signed agreements to broaden cooperation in various fields. Bedie also highly commended Chinese-aided projects in Ivory Coast. He expressed the hope that Ivory Coast and China will "expand and consolidate bilateral cooperation." When commenting on Ivorian-Chinese trade issues, he said he hoped that Ivory Coast and China will strengthen trade relations and gradually attain a balanced foreign trade account between the two countries.
