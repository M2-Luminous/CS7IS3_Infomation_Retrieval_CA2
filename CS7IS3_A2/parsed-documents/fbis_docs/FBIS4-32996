In a communique, the association of PCC workers signals that it has put on alert all its international labor union representatives in the United States to guarantee their participation in the debates that will take place in Congress regarding the proposal to modify the law that regulates the interoceanic waterway. President Bill Clinton sent to the U.S. Congress a series of recommendations on changes to the law that regulates the Panama Canal regarding administrative and financial concerns. The goal is to allow a more efficient and harmonious transfer of the interoceanic waterway on 31 December 1999, as provided for in the treaties signed in 1977. The communique adds that the unions that represent PCC workers were not consulted nor was their opinion requested with regard to the modification proposals.
