The SET index adjusted downward to 1356.87 on active volume of BtlO.39 billion. Declines were particularly conspicuous in the banking, finance and securities and construction materials sectors. An analyst at Ekkachat Finance & Securities Co indicated that the market fall could be attributed largely to technical reasons after the index had risen sharply for almost a fortnight on news of improved corporate earnings. The analyst said investors are nervously watching the local political scene, fearing that a spill-over from the hunger strike of Chalat Worachat and the looming constitutional crisis might lead to an unforeseen situation. Foreign investors, who have been a major factor in driving up equity prices, have apparently slowed their buying spree but elected to invest in blue-chip stocks, causing the stock market to lose its steam. An analyst from GF & Securities Co. said without fundamental support for the market, the finance and securities sector witnessed the highest volume at Bt2.3 billion out of the total turnover, followed by the construction materials sector at Bt2.2 billion. An analyst from Siam City Finance & Securities Co. said that technically the SET index attempted to test the 1400 level on Monday but it could not breach the 1392 level yesterday forcing the investors to readjust their portfolios.
