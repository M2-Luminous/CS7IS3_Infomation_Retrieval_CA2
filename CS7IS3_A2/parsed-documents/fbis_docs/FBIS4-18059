That particular plant was the reason for convening the conference. One month earlier, an international group of experts visited the Chernobyl AES to study the safety of the plant's operation. Eight specialists commissioned by the IAEA studied design characteristics of the plant and certain aspects of its operation. The assistant general director of the IAEA for questions of nuclear safety, Morris Rosen, discussed the results of that work with top leaders of Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic Energy and State Atomic Supervision Agency. Speaking about the meeting a few days latter, chairman of Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic Energy M. Umanets said that international experts had expressed certain criticisms regarding the Chernobyl AES, but had not demanded that the operating units be halted. Therefore, the independent expert opinion, which had long been demanded by the public, did not object to the continued operation of the atomic plant. Having referred to the IAEA principled stand in Iraq and Korea, M. Umanets called upon the press to finally exonerate that agency. Perhaps, because he did not yet know about the letter, which would sit on the desk of the Ukrainian president in another hour or two and which would come as an absolute surprise for the leader of Ukraine's atomic department. In that letter, IAEA General Director Hans Blix told the president about the results of work of the same group of eight experts: Numerous shortcomings have been revealed in the operating units of the Chernobyl AES; the obsolete design of the first unit is particularly alarming. Safety is also affected by the difficulties in the provision of the AES's with spare parts, the departure of skilled personnel, the difficult conditions of work of the personnel, and, in addition to all of these, the state of the "Ukryttya" [Shelter] Facility is deteriorating. In view of the conclusion drawn by specialists to the effect that international safety norms are not adhered to at the Chernobyl AES, H. Blix proposed that a conference of representatives of interested countries be convened in Vienna in order to improve the situation. Commenting upon that letter, first deputy chairman of the State Committee for Atomic Energy N. Nigmatullin called it unobjective. According to him, today, the safety of Chernobyl units is not inferior to that at Russian AES's using RBMK's, for example, the Kursk plant. This was also known to IAEA experts, just like all those measures taken at the Chernobyl AES for raising its safety. Therefore, if Chernobyl reactors do require the attention of "interested" countries, this must also apply to other RBMK's -- Russian and Lithuanian. Accordingly, the attitude of the Vienna conference must be changed. Otherwise, it may harm Ukraine's image. The State Committee for Atomic Energy informed [President] L. Kravchuk about this point of view. Regarding the Chernobyl AES, in N. Nigmatullin's opinion, it is rather social and psychological and not technological problems that are largely associated with it; also political ones. N. Nigmatullin took the liberty of suggesting that the IAEA conclusions reflected the interests of certain circles in particular countries, which, in this manner, take care of their free market of energy. They simply carry on "their own game," although not always in accordance with the rules of decency. This political assumption from the lips of the leader of a nonpolitical department would not sound strange, if one recalls that the Chernobyl AES has long become an object of precisely political battles. Isn't it true that, for several years, they have been particularly adversely affecting the plant's safety? However, the IAEA does not mention that fact. It would suffice to picture an operator, who, for a long time, fails to understand what his work is all about -- is it for the good of the people or is it treason? If he is capable of alienating himself from external influence, this is by no means better, as there must be a citizen and not an introspective Yoga adept at the control panel of any potentially dangerous installation.... Speaking of operators, it might be relevant to recall that, in addition to the IAEA experts, the EC Commission also sent its group of experts for coordinating international technological assistance to work at Ukrainian AES's. They specialize in training the personnel of AES's operating in Eastern European countries. They studied problems involved in our system for training operators and Ukraine's needs in that sphere. After that, on 1 April [1994], at a meeting with Ukrainian atomic specialists, the extent of methodological and technological assistance on the part of the EC Commission to all Ukrainian AES's was discussed. Not a single word on the inexpediency of expenditure for the Chernobyl AES or on boycotting it was uttered. When the chairman at the meeting, head of the group of experts Mr. Defrenn [name as transliterated] gave the floor to IAEA representative A. Kosilov of Russia, thorough procedural actions were taken, to be on the safe side, to place A. Kosilov's speech outside the framework of the meeting (despite that, A. Kosilov also spoke about assisting the AES's in raising their safety, but on the part of the IAEA, which allocates an annual sum of about $50 million for that). Well, even abroad, opinions on the Chernobyl AES safety differ. However, there, just as in our country, there also exist extreme opinions. This was confirmed at the beginning of April by the visit to Ukraine of representatives of the U.S. Department of Power Engineering and the Subcommittee on Nuclear Regulation who studied problems of our power engineering. It seems that they found the safety of the Chernobyl units to be, perhaps, the most important problem and stated that the Chernobyl Plant needed to be closed down in the very near future. Vice Premier V. Shmarov remarked that it was first necessary to introduce new power engineering capacities to compensate for closing down the Chernobyl Plant. Taking into account Ukraine's electric energy needs, the Americans agreed with his statement without, however, giving up the idea of closing down the Chernobyl units. Incidentally, from the point of view of acquiring a free market of energy, such a position differs little from the demand that the Chernobyl AES be closed down immediately.... In short, as soon as passions around the operation of the Chernobyl AES subsided in Ukraine, they started flaring up abroad. It might be good, had there been good intentions behind it. The results of the Vienna conference also indicate that they will not be final. The question of whether the measures for raising the RBMK safety really prevail over those of its shortcomings that cannot be eliminated still remains unsolved abroad. However, there is nothing new about the fact that these reactors were not only created in conformity with the laws of nuclear, but also of "political" physics. It is not only technological decisions that may be listed among the causes of the catastrophe. However, the Chernobyl AES was "revived," first and foremost, by political decisions, when specialists found it expedient to commission new atomic units, in particular, the fifth Chernobyl power unit. Because we turned out to have too many specialists in that "political" physics. In all probability, their number has not decreased in the new parliament. It is unlikely that we will get fast and entirely independent expert opinion from abroad, as they have their own interests, which are not always common to all of mankind. Therefore, despite the decision adopted by the parliament and the time that has passed since then, it would be futile to expect calm around the operation of the Chernobyl AES. Perhaps, this will continue for as long as the plant operates.
