This view was expressed at a briefing today by Mikhail Demurin, deputy head of the press and information department of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry. He said that a reconnaissance group of generals and officers from the Russian Defense Ministry has been in Abkhazia since 14 June with the aim of organizing the deployment of a Russian contingent which would be part of the joint peacekeeping forces in the Abkhaz- Georgian conflict zone. "Analysis of the situation has shown that any further delays in the deployment of peacekeeping forces may lead to unpredictable consequences," Mikhail Demurin said.
