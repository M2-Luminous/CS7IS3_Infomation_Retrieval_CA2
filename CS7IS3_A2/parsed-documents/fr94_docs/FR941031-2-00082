FR941031-2-00082 FR941031-2-00060 Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from respondents Notations, Inc., and Kurt Erman, individually and as an officer of the corporation. The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed order. The complaint alleges that respondents misbranded certain textile fiber products by using the trade name Micro Silk, thereby implying that silk, a fiber not present in the products, was present. These acts and practices are in violation of the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act, 15 U.S.C. 70; the Commission's Rules and Regulations Under the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act, 16 CFR 303; and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง45. The proposed order requires that the company cease and desist (1) Mentioning or implying fiber content without using the generic fiber names in a manner consistent with the Act and Rules, and (2) mentioning or implying fiber content for a fiber that is not present in a textile fiber product. The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.
