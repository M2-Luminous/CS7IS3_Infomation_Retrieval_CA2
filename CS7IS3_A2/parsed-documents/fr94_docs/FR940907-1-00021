ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maryland. This revision requires the State to offer the public an opportunity to request a public hearing before issuing a permit to construct certain sources. In the Final Rules section of this Federal Register , EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial SIP revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule and the accompanying technical support document. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. DATES: Comments must be received in writing by October 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments on this action should be addressed to Thomas J. Maslany, Director, Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division (3AT00), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107. Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107; and the Maryland Department of the Environment, 2500 Broening Highway, Baltimore, Maryland, 21224.
