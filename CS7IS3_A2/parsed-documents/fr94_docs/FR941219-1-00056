FR941219-1-00056 FR941219-1-00017 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Clarence Belton, Cost Principles Team Leader, at (703) 602&hyph;2357 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 94&hyph;751. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103&hyph;355, provides authorities that streamline the acquisition process and minimize burdensome Government-unique requirements. Major changes that can be expected in the acquisition process as a result of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act implementation include changes in the areas of Commercial Item Acquisition, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Truth in Negotiations Act, and Introduction of the Federal Acquisition Computer Network. This notice announces proposed FAR revisions developed under FAR Case 94&hyph;751, Penalties on Unallowable Indirect Costs, involving Sections 2101 and 2151 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 which change the contract value threshold for assessment of penalties on unallowable costs from $100,000 to $500,000 and expand the coverage from only the Department of Defense to all executive agencies. The proposed rule applies to all executive agencies and recognizes the increase in the contract value threshold for inclusion of the contract clause. With the exception of the threshold value, the penalty provisions in the new law are the same as those implemented in the current Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement. Since there are interactions between this proposed rule and the new rule proposed under FAR case 94&hyph;752 to create a new subsection 42.703&hyph;2, the two rules should be read together to fully understand the changes. The FAR Council is interested in an exchange of ideas and opinions with respect to the regulatory implementation of the Act. For that reason, the FAR Council is conducting a series of public meetings. However, the FAR Council has not scheduled a public meeting on this rule (FAR case 94&hyph;751) because of the clarity and non-controversial nature of the rule. If the public believes such a meeting is needed with respect to this rule, a letter requesting a public meeting and outlining the nature of the requested meeting shall be submitted to and received by the FAR Secretariat (see ADDRESSES caption) on or before January 18, 1995. The FAR Council will consider such requests in determining whether a public meeting on this rule should be scheduled. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitles within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq ., because most contracts awarded to small businesses are awarded through sealed bidding on a firm-fixed price basis. The penalty provisions apply only to contracts which are not firm-fixed price. Also, the proposed rule would only apply to contracts in excess of $500,000, eliminating the impact on contracts below that threshold. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq . (FAR case 94&hyph;751), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq . List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 31, 42, and 52 Government procurement. Dated: December 13, 1994. Capt. Barry L. Cohen, SC, USN, Project Manager for the Implementation of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994.
