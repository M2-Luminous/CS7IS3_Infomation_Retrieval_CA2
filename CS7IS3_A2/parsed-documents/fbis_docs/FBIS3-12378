Press statement issued by the General Committee: The General Committee held a meeting yesterday under the chairmanship of brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of the General People's Congress [GPC]. The General Committee discussed a number of topics on its agenda and the current developments, particularly the results of the signing in Amman of the pledge and accord document as well as the serious deterioration which preceded, coincided with, and followed the signing. This deterioration has threatened, from the first moment, the implementation of the document and aimed at emptying it of its national content on which all political forces were unanimous to tackle the exacerbating situation, At the top of this are the irresponsible acts, which are contrary to the contents of the document on the political, media, military, and diplomatic levels. In light of this, the General Committee reiterated the clear principled stand of the GPC vis-a-vis the pledge and accord document as well as the responsibility of all parties, particularly the government coalition and the Political Forces Dialogue Committee, to fulfill the commitments included in the document. These commitments are represented by the urgent tackling of the situation, basic steps, and resolutions and stands that must be embarked on by the constitutional institutions within the framework of their tasks, powers, and obligations defined by the pledge and accord document as well as by the responsibilities that must be shouldered by the Political Forces Dialogue Committee to implement the document on the fixed dates. The General Committee also condemns all acts that aim at weaseling out of this responsibility as well as the deception which hides nonnational objectives and which reveals intentions not to implement the accord. The General Committee also denounces the reckless acts regrettably carried out by the leaders who are dominating the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] to escalate anew the existing crisis, to kill innocent citizens and the sons of the Armed Forces and security, as what happened in the Abyan Governorate, and to embark on unjust acts that threaten the homeland today and in the future, its national sovereignty, security, and stability. These acts expose the hidden and rancorous intentions against the people, their unity, their freedom, and democracy. These acts have been blatantly exposed on the internal and external levels. The General Committee reiterated the need to work wisely and with responsibility to foil these acts and to champion the principled constants in which the people believe and to which all sons of the homeland are committed. The General Committee reiterated the need to work in particular toward protecting the pledge and accord document and mobilizing popular and official efforts to implement this accord, which came to reinforce the victory of unity and democracy and to deepen the option of true democracy which was highlighted by our lofty and steadfast people through their free will on 27 April last year being the source of the work of the branches of power and the maker of all gains and achievements. The General Committee greeted the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan -- king, government, and people -- for the great efforts it made to contain and tackle the crisis in our country and to sign the pledge and accord document being an important national achievement that will entrench the march of unity and stability in the homeland. The General Committee also expressed its appreciation for all ongoing efforts made by the sisterly and friendly states in this direction. The General Committee appealed to all members of the GPC and all citizens in all governorates to exercise full vigilance toward everthing that aims at encroaching on the homeland's unity, security, and stability and at threatening the existence of the state and its constitutional institutions. The General Committee appealed to all to remain united to protect and safeguard constitutional legitimacy and to support the implementation of the pledge and accord document each in his position. The GPC will continue its work and struggle with all the country's good people and their political, social, and popular forces to safeguard unity and Yemen's existence and future through work, production, freedom, and democracy.
