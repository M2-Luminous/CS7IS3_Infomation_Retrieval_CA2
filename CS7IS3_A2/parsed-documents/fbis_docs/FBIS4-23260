Not only has he had a virtual civil war in Brazzaville with the hostile opposition but now has apparently upset some of the young men who fought the opposition militias on the president's side. In January, President Lissouba made some promises, he hasn't kept them and yesterday there was gunfire around the president's residence. From Brazzaville, Antoine Muyumbala telexed this report: Members of the Presidential Guard fired shots into the air yesterday afternoon to disperse a crowd of young supporters of President Lissouba who were marching toward his official residence to demand that they be recruited into the regular Army. To continue their protest, these young men fired guns all night long into Brazzaville's southern district of Diata. The districts of Diata Mfilou are controlled by Lissouba supporters while the zones of Bacongo and Makelekele are in the hands of the opposition. There was also some fire in the opposition districts last night. Brazzaville was calm this morning. For some months now, young presidential supporters have been asking to be included into the Army following Pascal Lissouba's promise in January to recruit members of all private militias into the Army.
