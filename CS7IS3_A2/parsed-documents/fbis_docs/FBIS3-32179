In a news conference with reporters, the foreign minister said the officer could not be arrested or forced to make statements because he has total immunity from criminal jurisdiction in Salvadoran territory, in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Lopez has been accredited with the Salvadoran Government as a U.S. Embassy military attache since 4 July 1992, registration number 267/92. However, continued the foreign minister, the Vienna Convention states that the Maj. Lopez's immunity has in El Salvador does not exempt him from his own country's jurisdiction. In this sense, said Salaverria, the Foreign Ministry has from the outset received assurances from the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador that Maj. Lopez would be subject to a court martial in his own country. "Ever since this regrettable incident occurred, this Foreign Ministry was informed by the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador about the case and at the same time was promised that Maj. Lopez would be subject to U.S. laws," explained the minister. At the same time, he said the Foreign Ministry has asked the U.S. Embassy for "a report on emigration procedures surrounding Maj. Lopez's departure from the country, as well as for the date when the legal process will begin, information on the court that will hear the case, and details of penalties established by U.S. laws for crimes like this, in the event that he is found guilty." [passage omitted] For his part, Dr. Mauricio Gutierrez Castro, president of the Supreme Court of Justice [CSJ], said that an investigation will be undertaken into whether the Foreign Ministry committed a crime in this case. Upon his return from Brazil, where he participated in a meeting of the OAS legal committee, Gutierrez Castro explained that the Foreign Ministry's actions must be investigated by the judge charged with investigating the crime. "If what is stated in a U.S. Embassy communique, which explains that the Foreign Ministry gave permission, is true, we could be dealing with a crime committed by a state branch," stressed the Supreme Court justice. He explained that the officer has diplomatic immunity, in accordance with which the Embassy should notify the Foreign Ministry of the fact, and the Foreign Ministry, for its part, should then notify the judge in charge of the case so that the CSJ could invoke treaties regarding diplomatic immunity. "This accomplished, Mr. Lopez could have left the country through the corresponding legal borders, thus observing the laws of the Republic," asserted the president of the CSJ. Furthermore, Dr. Gutierrez said that over the last few years the country has been "excessively" generous in granting immunity, even to people who are connected with embassies or international organizations but who should really not enjoy that privilege. Gutierrez Castro said that it is the duty of the executive branch to submit a protest to the U.S. Government and urged candidates in the upcoming elections to defend national sovereignty.
