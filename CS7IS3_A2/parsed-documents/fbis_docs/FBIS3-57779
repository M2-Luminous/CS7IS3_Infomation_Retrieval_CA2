[Kinkel] My greatest concern continues to be the terrible killing, raping, and pointless devastation in former Yugoslavia. And, among numerous other conflicts in this world, I am worried by the areas of conflict in the former Soviet Union. [Koch] Can you still get a good night's sleep when you think of the Russian fascist Zhirinovskiy? [Kinkel] The way Zhirinovskiy behaves and makes comments leaves me with an unpleasant feeling. His behavior toward our consular official in Sofia is not acceptable. But we cannot ignore the fact that, judging by the number of people who voted for him, he evidently has support in Russia. He must be dealt with on a political level. This is primarily the task of the reformist forces in Russia, which we are still counting on. Just isolating him does not help. My decision not to let Zhirinovskiy enter Germany for an 18-day propaganda tour was necessary and correct. This, however, does not rule out a different decision in the future once a real political debate with Zhirinovskiy has been secured. I personally would not shy away from a discussion with him. [Koch] The situation in Somalia is getting more and more dangerous. Should we not withdraw our troops as quickly as possible? [Kinkel] We must not steal away from responsibility prematurely because of some isolated incidents. We have promised the United Nations that we will stay until 31 March. We will stand by our decision. In the future, we will have to carefully check whether, when, and how we are going to take part in such UN missions. The UN mission, and our mission, did not go terribly well. We will have to learn our lessons from that. But our troops have done an excellent humanitarian job. [Koch] Are you afraid that the FDP [Free Democratic Party of Germany] might go under in the 1994 elections? [Kinkel] No. I am convinced that we will stand our ground successfully. It must be our aim to achieve the best possible result in the Bundestag elections so that we will again be needed for forming a government. [Koch] Do you know yet by whom? [Kinkel] I am against coalition statements at the wrong time. We will decide before each of the 18 elections whether we will make such a statement, when we will do it, and what we are going to say. What happens after the Bundestag election is up to the voters. [Koch] Will Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher remain the FDP's candidate for president? [Kinkel] We nominated Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher as FDP candidate with an overwhelming majority. She is not a pawn who can be exchanged at will.
