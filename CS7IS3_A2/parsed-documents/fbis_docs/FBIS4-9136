The Yugoslav economists, the Foreign Ministry's note reads, believe that for the complete revival of economic productive departments one needs a minimum of 18 years, something that from a social viewpoint is inconceivable. In these conditions, one hopes for Serbian-Romanian cooperation, mainly in the areas of metallurgy, machine building, electrical engineering, electronics, chemicals, and the pharmaceuticals industry. By starting with these actions as soon as sanctions are lifted, the exchange might reach a volume of 1 billion dollars by 1995. In this way, the revival of the Yugoslav economy could be completed by the year 2000 and the Romanian economy could make up for the losses suffered as a result of the dismantling of the CEMA market and loosening of relations with the CIS. The aforementioned note also mentions that the Romanian side expressed agreement with the cooperation projects presented by the Serbian guests. However, it insisted that they should take place only when sanctions are lifted, because currently the UN Committee 724 sometimes shows a totally unjustified rigidity toward any commercial operation with Yugoslavia. At the meeting of the two countries' presidents, when the sides examined the results of the talks, the Serbian side launched the idea of building a free trade zone along the Bega Canal [which crosses Timisoara], as soon as international political conditions permit it. Considering that the idea of creating certain free economic zones is a long-standing wish of President Iliescu's, it was regarded with great interest and will be implemented as soon as possible.
