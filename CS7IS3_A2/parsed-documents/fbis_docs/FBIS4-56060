Fikret Abdic has gone so far with his collaboration with Serbia and Milosevic that he has reached -- course, well away from the eyes of the people of the Cazin Krajina -- agreement on the training of Kladusa young men in the famous barracks of the army of the so-called Yugoslavia in Nis, where the special units of the Serbian aggressor army are trained. This was stated by the Information Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Instead of being in the units of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the young men from Velika Kladusa are learning together with Perisic's and Mladic's special units all the techniques of killing the Bosniaks. This has caused disgust and open disagreements of ordinary people in Velika Kladusa with Babo [Fikret Abdic]. According to initial reports, Abdic has sent a group of policemen of the self-proclaimed Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia for training in Nis. Some men refused to go to Nis. The most disobedient were liquidated. Their murder was concealed with claims that they were killed in clashes with the 5th Army Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The agreement on training is only part of a much wider agreement between Fikret Abdic and the chetniks. They agreed that Abdic's paramilitary should attack the left and the chetniks, via Grabez, the right bank of the Una River. This was stated by the Information Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
