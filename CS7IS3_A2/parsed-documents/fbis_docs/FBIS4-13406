FBIS4-13406 "drnes076_l_94003" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 ISRAEL `Hundreds of Hamas Activists' Said Detained `Hundreds of Hamas Activists' Said Detained TA1904155494 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English 1500 GMT 19 Apr 94 TA1904155494 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el English BFN [Excerpt] In a wide-scale operation in the territories, security forces have rounded up hundreds of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] activists and operatives. A number of weapons were also confiscated in the sweep, which took place last night. Alan Ben-'Ami reports: [Begin Ben-'Ami recording] The authorities are being tight-lipped about exactly how many people have been arrested and who they are. But figures obtained from various sources, including Palestinians in the territories, indicate that as many as 400 or so people were detained in the round up. A terse statement by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] spokesman also said that weapons and ammunition were uncovered during the raids on towns, villages, and refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The massive crack-down is being viewed as a severe blow to Hamas and its operations, at least temporarily. But security sources point out that there are gunmen from the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam gangs still at large, and they can be expected to mount attacks of one sort or another, despite this wide-spread move against Hamas members and operatives at various levels. Certainly, this is the biggest operation against Hamas in the territories since Israel deported more than 400 to Lebanon in December 1992. An international outcry resulted and all the deported being allowed to eventually return, and some of the were among the men picked up in this new crack-down. Most of the people arrested are said to be in their late teens or early twenties, and to include a number who were directly involved with planned terrorist attacks. Hamas has openly boasted that its members were planning a total of five attacks against Israelis, with two more still to come, following the deadly bombs in 'Afula and Hadera and the ax attack on a bus in Jerusalem. Seven Israelis have died and more than 80 been injured in those attacks. A number of prominent Hamas personalities, including Taysir Tamimi and Jamal al-Natshah from Hebron, and Yasir Mansur from Nabulus are amongst those arrested. The big wave of arrests follows raids last week in which about 70 Hamas activists and operatives were picked up. Security sources say more arrests can be expected in the days ahead. [end recording] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says the arrests of those responsible for acts of terrorism will continue. Rabin appeared today before the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, where he also said he supports a greater withdrawal from the Golan heights than that being recommended by the Army. David Ze'ev reports: [Begin recording] [Ze'ev] As he left the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was asked about the arrests of Hamas activists. [Rabin] Let us put it this way: We will fight those who continue terror with all the means that are available to us. The only limitation is the limitation of the law.
