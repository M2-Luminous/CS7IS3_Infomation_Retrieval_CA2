The 81.3-percent election turnout was unexpectedly high. Austria will belong to the EU as of 1995. The referendum, which was necessary in view of the "overall change" to the Constitution that admission would entail, saw 66.4 percent vote in favor of membership of the EU and only 33.6 percent against. In absolute terms, there were 3,095,260 votes for and 1,566,799 votes against. With this green light given by the Austrian population and the yes given by the European Parliament on 5 May, there are only mini-hurdles now in the way of membership: The national parliaments of the "original EU" countries must now give their blessing to the applicants. However, this will hardly impact on the 1 January admission date. Speaking to DIE PRESSE, President Klestil described the result as a "victory for all Austrian patriots." Now, future European policy will also have to be conducted on the basis of consensus. The president did not conceal the fact that he also respected those who voted no -- "because they went and voted." In addition, he said: "What I said before the referendum -- namely, that it has nothing to do with politicians or parties, let alone warnings -- also applies today." Visibly moved, the politician who has already been described as the "father of EU admission," Foreign Minister Mock, spoke of an "overwhelming success." Beaming, he said that "the Austrians have shown that they are much better than they themselves believe." At a joint news conference later in the evening, Chancellor Vranitzky and Vice Chancellor Busek both stressed that they are in any event thinking about continuing with the coalition after the October elections for "European reasons." The results in the laender were between 56.4 percent in favor in Tyrol and 74.6 percent in favor in Burgenland. The vote in Vienna was 65.8 percent in favor. The first exit polls, but also information about trends in last week's opinion polls, made it possible to conclude that the content and form of the rhetoric used by opponents also boosted support for admission. Above all it led to an increase in the turnout which overwhelmingly benefited the number of "yes" votes.
