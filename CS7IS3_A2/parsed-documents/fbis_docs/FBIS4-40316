The oblast administration appealed to the residents of the Trans-Baykal settlement of Yasnogorsk to maintain law and order. An explosive situation has taken shape in the settlement where the largest power station in Russia, the Kharanor state regional electric power station [GRES] is being constructed. The construction workers for the "Chitaenergostroy" [Chita power construction] joint-stock society have not received their wages for several months. In spite of this, on the decision of the federal bodies of authority, the Kharanor GRES is scheduled to go on stream this year, nevertheless the financing of this facility has practically been stopped. The residents of Yasnogorsk have repeatedly addressed a demand to the government of the Russian Federation and to the management of the joint-stock society of Russia's unified power system that overdue wages should be paid, but their voice has not been heard. The construction workers' hunger strike which was held in the run up to this did not help either. In this connection, it has been decided to stage a mass action of protest at the Kharanor GRES. A strike committee has been set up here. The power construction workers intend to start an indefinite strike, starting 25 June. And today the strike committee is planning to hold a rally in the settlement, permission for which has been obtained from the local bodies of authority. But at the same time it would appear from the information coming in from the construction site of the GRES that it is not to be ruled out that part of the workforce will stage unlawful actions. In particular, the residents of Yasnogorsk have repeatedly stated that they will block traffic on the railway connecting the Trans-Siberian railway with China, using bulldozers, and other heavy equipment. In the radio appeal to the power construction workers, the oblast administation which has fully supported the demands of the residents of Yasnogorsk regarding the payment of overdue wages, has at the same time asked the residents of the settlement to refrain from hasty actions. In their turn the bodies of authority of the Trans-Baykal region, as was stated in the appeal, are taking every measure not to allow a social explosion at the Kharanor GRES, to get the power station commissioned on time. In particular, the administration has sent detailed information about the situation in Yasnogorsk and its proposals for extricating the construction site from crisis to the president and government of the Russian Federation.
