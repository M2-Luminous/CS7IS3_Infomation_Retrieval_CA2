FR941004-2-00017 FR941004-2-00007 Since the calculated preliminary margin for butt-weld pipe fittings from Israel is below 25 percent and there have been no antidumping orders in the United States or elsewhere pertaining to butt-weld pipe fittings from Israel, the requirements of section 733(e) have not been met. Therefore, we have determined that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to imports of butt-weld pipe fittings from Israel. Verification As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify information used in making our final determination. Suspension of Liquidation In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Israel, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated dumping margins, as shown below. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows: ␣ 1Manufacturer/producer/exporter 1Margin percent Carmiel 7.33 All others 7.33 Adjustment of Deposit Rate for Countervailing Duties Article VI, paragraph 5 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade provides that ``[no] product *␣*␣* shall be subject to both antidumping and countervailing duties to compensate for the same situation for dumping or export subsidization.'' This provision is implemented by section 772(d)(1)(D) or the Act. Since antidumping duties cannot be assessed on the portion of the margin attributable to export subsidies, there is no basis to require a cash deposit or bond for that amount. Accordingly, the level of export subsidies as determined in the Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from Israel, FR 59 28340, June 1, 1994) which was 0.25 percent ad valorem, will be subtracted from the respective margins for cash deposit or bonding purposes. This results in a deposit rate of 7.08 percent for Carmiel and all other exporters of carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Israel. ITC Notification In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry within 75 days after our final determination.
