The first two airliners will arrive this May. The possibility of leasing several more Boeings and an Airbus AZ 10-300 is also being considered. International Aeroflot, operating under the conditions of a real market and tough competition, has been forced to concern itself with the effectiveness of its flights, and therefore is choosing foreign planes. At a meeting that Dmitriy Barilov, director of Aeroflot-Russian International Airlines, and Sergey Frantsev, deputy acting director of the airline's production and commercial department, had yesterday with Carry Pawluk, Boeing's regional director for sales in Northern and Eastern Europe, the procedures for leasing four Boeing 767-300 ER airliners were discussed. Thus, except for a few details, the talks between Aeroflot and Boeing on acquiring airliners of that type (see KOMMERSANT for 27 January) have been virtually completed. The new Boeings will be purchased by the Irish JPA company and then leased to Aeroflot for five years. Details of the agreement with JPA have not yet been made public, but according to KOMMERSANT's information, the cost of leasing will be approximately $300 million (not counting interest). The Russian side will receive first two aircraft this May. As Mr. Frantsev stated, in terms of flight range, economy and number of passengers, Aeroflot's basic intercontinental plane, the Il-62M, is inferior to the Boeing 767-300 ER (see table). At the same time, operation of the new Russian Il-96-300 airliner is too costly. The five Airbus A310-300s in Aeroflot's possession are best suited to transcontinental flights. That is what led to the decision to lease the Boeing 767-300 ERs, which have been flown by the leading foreign airlines since 1989. As KOMMERSANT has learned, Kazakhstan's international airlines will soon follow International Aeroflot's example. And Aeroflot is presently considering the possibility of leasing another group of Boeings (most likely it will be Boeing 747-400s, the process of whose certification in Russia, as KOMMERSANT reported on 1 February, is already under way) and AZ10-300s. Aeroflot's decision is distressing news for the Russian aviation industry--for all practical purposes, it means the beginning of direct competition with the leading foreign aircraft manufacturers in our own domestic market. The new Il-96-300, Il-114 and Tu-204 airliners have not yet been brought up to the required level of economy and flight readiness. Moreover, Russian and CIS airlines flying domestic routes do not presently have the money to purchase new Russian aircraft. On the other hand, the airlines flying international routes are operating under the real conditions of stiff competition in the world air transportation market, which is what led to the choice of the most economical foreign-made airliners.
