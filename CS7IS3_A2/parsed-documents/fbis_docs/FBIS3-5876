The government and the ruling coalition parties are to decide on a "full-fledged" tax reform by the year-end while mindful of the effects of already-decided income tax cuts worth some 6 trillion yen for fiscal 1994, starting April 1, Fujii told a regular news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. "That's how it should be done," Fujii said, rejecting calls for an immediate decision on a permanent income tax cut as a measure to boost domestic demand to help reduce Japan's trade imbalance. In a press meeting in Tokyo on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said keeping tax cuts to a single year is not enough to stimulate the economy. Fujii has been stressing that Japan will decide by the year-end on permanent tax reform with a "balanced system in income, assets, and consumption" to cope with the aging society. Asked about views being expressed within the ruling coalition about the need to show some direction in the tax plan together with a "voluntary" market-access package to be decided by the end of the month, Fujii said, "that's the coalition parties' problem." On the market-access package, Fujii said, "I haven't heard of any clear talks" of compiling it in two stages -- this month and before the summit of the Group of Seven major nations in Italy in July. "But realistically speaking," he said, "I think it will come that way, although I will have to say no to any reference as a two-stage plan." The package will be decided by the end of the month, but details, including those in priority fields, will be discussed later, Fujii said. Christopher, at a news conference after meeting Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, said Thursday that the United States would assess the possibility of reviving the trade framework talks after reviewing the package. Meanwhile, Fujii said he has no plan yet to ask for a bilateral meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen when finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meet in Hawaii on March 18 to 19.
