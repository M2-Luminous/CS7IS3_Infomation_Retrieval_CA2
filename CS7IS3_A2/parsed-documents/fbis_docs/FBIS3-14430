In a statement to Jordan Television, Dr. al-'Anani said he agrees with the PLO on the need for coordination before and after any event or political development. Dr. al-'Anani was commenting on a statement by the PLO office at the United Nations. The statement expressed astonishment at Jordan's position on inserting the Jerusalem issue in Security Council Resolution 904. The information minister asserted that the Jerusalem issue was only mentioned in the resolution's preamble and not in the operative articles, which much weakens it. He said inserting the Jerusalem issue in this way in the resolution made it difficult to omit the word Jerusalem, and led to the U.S. abstention. It gave the United States a future pretext to abstain or even veto any resolutions on the basis that it has demonstrated its position in Resolution 904. The minister said inserting the Jerusalem issue raised the voices of Israelis and the leaders of U.S. Jews, who say Jerusalem is Israel's unified capital. He stressed Jordan's consistent position on Jerusalem, namely, Jerusalem is an indivisible part of the occupied Arab territories, as stipulated in Resolution 242, which provides for regaining all occupied Arab territories in return for peace.
