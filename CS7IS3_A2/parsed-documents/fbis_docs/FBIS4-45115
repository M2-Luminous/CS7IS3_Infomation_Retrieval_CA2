The brunt of the Muslim attack was launched on the southern part of the Teslic battlefront and on the Kozilo area, which came under a cannonade of artillery shells charged with poison gas, Bosnian Serb army sources said on Wednesday. The Serbs were forced to respond fiercefully [as received] and neutralize the Muslim shelling in order to protect their positions and the people of Teslic and the adjacent villages. Serb forces have prevented two Muslim terrorist actions in the south-eastern Teslic front. The Serb army sources said that Muslim forces at about 5 a.m. (local time) on Wednesday opened heavy anti-aircraft gunfire on Serb defence positions in Lukici, eight kilometres west of the Serb town of Brcko, in northern Bosnia. From the northern Bosnian Croat enclave of Orasje, Bosnian Croat forces and Croatia's regular troops on Tuesday night opened strong infantry fire on Serb positions seven kilometres away from the area, leaving one Serb soldier lightly wounded.
