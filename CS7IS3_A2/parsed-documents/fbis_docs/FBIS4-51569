At an audience on Friday, 29 April, with a French delegation led by Francois Fillon, minister for higher education and research, the two government leaders also underlined that in the event of the failure of the roundtable meeting, the government should submit a draft law outlawing the Khmer Rouge for the National Assembly's adoption. In a message addressed to His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk on 27 April, Khieu Samphan asked for "a neutral place" due to the country's security problem and "an appropriate date." "The Khmer Rouge are not able, no matter what, to occupy a region totally," reaffirmed the Cambodian prime ministers, adding that the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] has mapped out "a complete plan" to defend security and the country. Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen appealed to foreign investors not to worry about security problem and pointed out that the RGC has legislations to guarantee their interests in Cambodia.
