FR941117-0-00051 FR941117-0-00009 1871.604&hyph;2 Determination of ``Finalists''. (a) All acceptable offers will be evaluated against the specifications and the value characteristics. Based on this evaluation, the team will identify the finalists from among the offers submitted. Finalists will include all offers having a reasonable chance of being selected for final award, as prescribed in 1815.613&hyph;71(b)(4)(i) for competitive range. Generally, finalists will include the offer having the best price (or lowest most probable cost) and the offer having the highest qualitative merit, plus those determined to have the best combination of price and merit. Offers not qualifying as finalists will be excluded from the balance of the evaluation process. (b) Whenever possible, the buying team will conduct parallel negotiations of complete contracts with all finalists as discussed in 1871.605. This approach, which provide for the negotiation of definitive contracts prior to selection, serves to maintain the competitive environment among offerors throughout the acquisition cycle. (c) In some cases, the buying team may choose to conduct discussions with the finalists as opposed to conducting parallel negotiations of complete contracts. This may be appropriate when: (1) Certain aspects of offers are unclear and clarifying the offers could determine that a finalist actually has no reasonable chance of being selected for final award; or (2) the finalists are so numerous that negotiating complete contracts with all finalists is not practical considering the time and resources available. Discussions shall be conducted in accordance with 1871.604&hyph;3. (d) The buying team may choose to conduct parallel negotiations with all acceptable offerors without a determination of finalists. This could particularly apply where few offers were received. (e) The selection official may elect to make selection in lieu of determining finalists, provided it can be clearly demonstrated that (1) selection of an initial offer(s) will result in the best value for the Government, considering both price and non-price qualitative criteria; and (2) discussions with other acceptable offerors are not anticipated to change the outcome of the initial evaluation relative to the best value offer(s). (f) Documentation. If finalists are identified as discussed in paragraph (a) of this section, the documentation expected and required to result from this phase of evaluation is approximately one-quarter of a page for each finalist. The documentation shall succinctly describe how the value characteristics in the RFO were provided by the offeror and cost/price considerations that caused the offer to qualify as a finalist. The evaluator(s) shall not be required to justify why other offers provided less qualitative merit. It is expected that, should the decision be challenged, the documented reason for selection, when compared with the non-selected offer, shall clearly demonstrate the difference that resulted in non-selection. It is expected and recommended that all informal worksheets used in the evaluation process be included in the contract file for use in any debriefings requested. When selection of the successful offeror(s) is made, the buying team shall document the selection in accordance with 1871.604&hyph;4(c). (g) The names of offerors determined to be finalists, selected for parallel negotiations, or selected for negotiations or final contract award will be electronically transmitted to the offerors. This will serve as notification to those offerors that were not selected for further evaluation (see 1871.505). 1871.604&hyph;3 Discussions with ``Finalists''. (a) The procurement team member shall lead discussions with each finalist. The discussions are intended to assist the buying team in fully understanding each finalist's offer and to assure that the meanings and points of emphasis of the RFO have been adequately conveyed to the finalists so that all are competing equally on the basis intended. Care must be exercised to ensure these discussions adhere, to the extent applicable, to the guidelines set forth in 1815.613&hyph;71(b)(5) for the applicable contract type. Technical transfusion, technical leveling, and auction techniques are prohibited. It is expected that these discussions will be conducted on an informal basis with each finalist.
