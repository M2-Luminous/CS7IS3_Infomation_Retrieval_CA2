Resources would be distributed, and prices fixed by the state in a unified manner. In the past few years, the issue of Liaoning's irrational management system as well as unreasonable prices of oil products has become more conspicuous with each day. Dispersed resources of oil products, overlapping in management, failure in price control, and chaos in the market have become more and more serious, thus providing the soil for speculators, profiteers, and law and discipline violators to take the opportunity to reap staggering profits and engage in corrupt practice. Therefore, it is necessary to take effective measures to reform the current circulation system of crude oil and refined oil, to strengthen the macro-management of the production and circulation of crude oil and refined oil, to rationalize the prices of oil products, to rectify the order of circulation, to reduce circulation links, and to establish, step by step, a standardized, vigorous, and orderly circulation system of crude oil and refined oil which meets the demands of a socialist market economy. The major content of this reform is to achieve reasonable distribution of resources, letting the refineries belonging to the Petrochemical General Company process land crude oil and imported crude oil in a unified manner. For the marketing of refined oil, distribution will be made under state guidance to change the duplicate and decentralized management. The prices will be fixed by the state. The state's control of the producer prices, wholesale prices, and retail prices of crude oil and refined oil not only ensures the profits of the producers and consumers but also keeps the prices stable. Categorization of taxes and rate of taxation will be unified. Unified tax categories and tax rates will be applied to all the coastal areas, inland areas, special zones, and development zones as well as state-owned, collective, "three types of foreign-funded," and individual enterprises which deal in crude oil and refined oil. Governments at all levels should not give them preferential treatment by reducing or exempting their taxes or fix their tax quotas. Sale channels should be made reasonable, and intermediate links should be reduced. Provincial, city, and county petroleum companies should be the main channels of selling refined oil, and the resources of refined oil should be distributed by the petroleum companies at all levels in a unified manner according to plans. All refineries should sell petroleum only to petroleum companies. Current refined oil wholesale organizations should be screened and reorganized, and retail gas stations (spots) should be rectified. Party, government, and army organs at all levels are not permitted to engage themselves in the wholesale and retail sale of crude oil and refined oil. The wholesale organizations which have been reorganized will be brought into the main sales channels. Gas stations, which prove qualified to engage in the business after joint investigation and rectification, should phase in the system of sales on a commission basis. They should replenish their stock from the local petroleum companies and sell according to the retail price set. Those who do not sell at the set price, pass the bad off as the good, give short measure, and evade taxes will have their oil supplies stopped and their status as sales agents canceled.
