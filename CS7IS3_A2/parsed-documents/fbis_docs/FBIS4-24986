Officials from the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed today that the total harvesting area for summer oil-bearing crops this year amounted to 5.3 million hectares, an increase of 330,000 hectares over last year. Output of oil-bearing crops would register a greater increase, he said. By now, the provinces of Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi and Sichuan have all reported increases in harvests of such crops. The increase, along with the imports of edible oil, would greatly ease supplies soon, the official said. The official said that China's summer grain will also reap a good harvest despite a marked decrease in sown areas. But the official warned that it was too early to be sure of a good summer grain output, because while the southwest is busy harvesting, the north is still waiting. The official therefore urged all localities to concentrate on the final work with the crops and to watch for the weather in harvesting time so as to ensure an excellent output.
