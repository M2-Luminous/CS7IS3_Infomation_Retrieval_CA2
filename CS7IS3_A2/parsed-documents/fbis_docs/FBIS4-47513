N. Pryakhin, candidate of technical sciences, All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Nuclear Electric Stations; UDC 621.311.25:621.39] [Abstract] The U.S.-developed RETACT (Real-time Advanced Core and Thermohydraulic) program was used to study processes of interphase interaction of gas-liquid flow in the circulation loop and the core of an installation with a water-modulated VVER-1000 reactor in accidents involving coolant loss. The researchers examined accidents with uncompensated flows and partial malfunction of the emergency core-cooling system. The calculation assumed the failure of one of three emergency low-pressure feed pump, as well as the failure of the passive sector of the emergency core-cooling system. The researchers concluded that, with uncompensated flows of loop one and the operation of the emergency core-cooling system, water seals form in the ``cold'' lines of the circulation loop. The behavior of individual loops is unsymmetrical from the standpoint of the formation of water seals. The magnitude of flow determines the formation of the water seals and the variation in the hydrostatic head of the coolant in them. The formation of the water seals leads to a worsening of the thermohydraulic state of the core and, consequently, to it overheating (and triggering of the emergency core-cooling system). A pipe of at least 50 mm in diameter must be used to drain the water seals. Figures 11, references 6: 4 Russian, 2 Western.
