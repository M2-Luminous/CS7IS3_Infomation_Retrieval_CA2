The president said that he continues to hope that his repeated appeals will find a sincere response and that peace will prevail in Yemen, especially in these blessed days in which Muslims are standing before God praying that He may grant them guidance, wisdom, security, and peace. Following is the text of the president's appeal: Like all other Arabs I have followed with great sadness and profound regret the fierce fighting in fraternal Yemen, which has been going on for nearly two weeks. This fighting is lethal to the sons of Yemen, is destroying the country's resources, and pitting the units of its armed forces against each other in a violent confrontation that cannot serve the Yemeni people's interests and objectives. It is heart-rending to watch this bloody fighting that bodes an extensive civil war that will ruin the resources of an Arab homeland that sorely needs stability and security. The homeland needs to devote its energies to improving the life of its people. It is especially sorrowful that this civil strife should come at a time when the Arab nation is attempting to heal the numerous wounds caused by the consequences of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the Gulf war. We were hoping that a new climate would arise in the Arab world, paving the way for a broad inter-Arab reconciliation, restoring inter-Arab solidarity, and reviving the hope of collective Arab action that will end the nation's current divisions. This is necessary if we want to face that challenges that will confront our Arab world at the beginning of the 21st century. The civil strife in Yemen came abruptly, opening new wounds that would have been avoidable had the two parties begun a dialogue and agreed to reach an understanding on how to keep the armed forces outside the conflict. We have done our utmost to prevent a clash between the two sides. Our only motive was to safeguard the supreme Arab interests. We stressed the importance of avoiding armed clashes between the two sides and urged that their armed forces be separated so that war would not erupt. We expressed willingness to assist the two sides in settling their disputes without recourse to military force. We did this because we know that war never settles any dispute in a decisive or sound way. It was never our aim to show bias to either party. Our objective was to safeguard the interests of a fraternal people whose blood was mixed with the blood of Egyptians who defended the Yemeni people's right to live and make progress. Our objective was to save Yemeni unity from the risks of armed conflict and civil war that could finish off this unity and lead Yemen to fragmentation and rupture. Our objective was to save the resources of an Arab people from being wasted in fratricide, exhausting Yemen's resources and resulting in nothing but partition, bitterness, and severe loss for all parties. It was our hope that our repeated appeals would find a sincere response from all parties, so that peace and security could prevail throughout Yemen during these blessed days when Muslim pilgrims stand on Mount 'Arafat to pray to God Almighty to grant them guidance, reason, peace, and security. Now that the collision between troops from the two sides has entered a critical stage that portends a long war of attrition, I appeal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, on this blessed day when pilgrims stand on Mount 'Arafat and in the name of the constitutional legitimacy binding him, to rise above differences. In the name of the unified Yemeni people who aspire to security and stability, in the name of the Yemeni unity that could be ruined by the war, and in the name of every Arab who looks forward to a wiser and more prudent Arab world, I appeal to him to end this fratricide and save Yemeni blood from being shed in vain in a war that is hard to justify. I appeal to him to order an immediate halt to the fighting, in order to save Yemen, its fraternal people, and the goal of unity, which is the aspiration of every Yemeni. The destiny of the homeland must be placed above any other consideration, because the homeland is the core and the basis. Individuals may come and go, but a homeland means immortality and survival. This is the hour when Yemen needs everyone to rise above their wounds. I pray to God Almighty to inspire us with reason and prudence, to lead us onto the right path, and to guide us as to what is best for our nation, for He is the best master and supporter.
