The Khmer Rouge have taken Treng, which was the logistical base of the royal army. It is a threat to [the provincial capital] Battambang. It is difficult to foresee what the Khmer Rouge will do. Will they try to take Battambang? Or would they rather set up a state adjacent to Thailand stretching from the Preah Vihear temple through Oddar Meanchey to Bantey Meanchey and the northern shores of the Tonle Sap lake? That way they will have [an area rich in] timber, gemstones, rice and fish. The advantage is that they are very friendly with the Thais, especially the military. Once that is consolidated they will try to capture Battambang and Angkor Wat [temples]. Angkor is more than Preah Vihear. Angkor is a symbol of the country, its national grandeur. It will have an extraordinary psychological impact. It is like having control of 15 provinces. What made you propose a roundtable with the Khmer Rouge? When I saw that things were going badly in Pailin, I quickly proposed a new peace plan, I invited Khieu Samphan to come stay in the palace. But he said that the palace now has ceased to be neutral. Now I propose a cease-fire with the Khmer Rouge. But I wonder whether it is not a bit too late because the Khmer Rouge must be saying `we must take advantage of the demoralisation of the [government] soldiers.' I know that they wanted to join our government in order to sabotage our work and to try to destroy our fortress from inside. But, faced with a fast moving war, the monarchy is crumbling. At least we will have a chance to delay a total defeat and loss of Cambodia for some years if we let them share power. How strong is the Khmer Rouge? A leader of the government here, I won't name him, says the Khmer Rouge numbers 3,000-4,000 maximum and the Khmer Rouge problem is a minor problem. But the presence of Khmer Rouge in the country is like a leopard's spots. They are in Kompong Cham, Kompong Speu, Kampot and even in Sihanoukville--they are everywhere. Even near Phnom Penh they have sanctuaries. I think the Khmer Rouge has at least 20,000 men. And what is the state of the royal army? I know that the Cambodian army is very large. There are months when they are not paid. The soldiers have nothing to eat, they suffer from malaria, they have poor supply lines. We have a military organisation that is totally unique. In other countries there is a pyramid organisation of armies. At the bottom in large numbers are soldiers, and above them in decreasing numbers are corporals, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, majors, and colonels. At the top are generals--only a few in number. Here in Cambodia we have an inverse pyramid. The other day I saw Michael Costello, Australian deputy foreign minister. He told me that Second Prime Minister Hun Sen admitted to him it was difficult to find soldiers. When he goes to inspect the army he only finds officers. What can the West do? Costello told me, `If the situation is desperate, instead of letting your royal regime crumble we will consider the possibility of giving something in terms of weaponry.' But he did not promise anything. He spoke in his personal capacity and asked for my reaction. I would appreciate very much [the West's] military aid, but we should set up elite units to fight the Khmer Rouge, because weapons--like bread--distributed to old units will disappear. It is better to create new units rather than select soldiers from the existing units. But that too is difficult. When one creates an elite unit it has to be with volunteers. The volunteers will ask: fight the Khmer Rouge for what? To maintain a corrupt regime? To widen the gap between the privileged and the poor? How are relations with Vietnam? The Vietnamese move border markers deeper into our territory, dig canals inside our territory, creating a new border line. Digging canals has been an old tactic, but now the border markers are walking, they are walking towards the west ... they know we cannot take care of two fronts simultaneously. It is terrible. What role would you like to play? More and more people are asking me, even from the parliament, to rebuild the Sangkum Reastre Niyum [an all-party platform Sihanouk had built in the 1960's]. But it is too late. Ranariddh told me yesterday Funcinpec [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] is ready to follow you, if you rebuild the Sangkum. But I am 72 and sick. If I were 40 or even 50 years of age, I could have taken in hand all these things. I could have carried out reforms and even brought the Khmer Rouge in. What I can do now is prevent the Khmer Rouge from being branded outlaws. [We will have problems] if the Khmer Rouge creates a stretch of territory in the north that will be open to free movement by the Thais. Thus, the Thais and the Khmer Rouge will gain, but it is Cambodia which will die. On the east the border posts are walking. It's like in Macbeth, it's the forest that walks trying to fell us, bring death to the Kingdom of Cambodia. Whether it is kingdom or republic does not matter. I assure you. You can write I am ready to have a republic as long as Cambodia is saved. For me it is Cambodia and not the monarchy.
