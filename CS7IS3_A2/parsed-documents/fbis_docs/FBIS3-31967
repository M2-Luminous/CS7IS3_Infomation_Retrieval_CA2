The objective of these negotiations is to conclude a supplemental agreement on some aspects of the convention and a protocol for the peaceful settlement of possible controversies. The sources said that resigning its aspiration to be granted the use of an esplanade -- which joins Sector 7 of the northern dock and the terminal of the railway to Tacna, on the bay of Arica -- will be considered a clear gesture that Lima has the political will to resolve the "impasse." This would be especially significant because the request -- which was made at the last moment -- is regarded as a maneuver by some Peruvian sectors to cause the failure of the two governments' efforts to resolve the pending issues of the 1929 Treaty. Under such circumstances, the announcement that President Alberto Fujimori will visit Santiago for the presidential changeover becomes even more significant. The Foreign Ministry has received a very favorable reaction to this announcement. Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma yesterday met with Peruvian Ambassador Alfonso Rivero, with whom the issue was addressed for more than one hour at the minister's office. After the meeting, Rivero made no comment and Silva Cimma said only that the dialogue was positive and that he remains optimistic that Congress will approve the Lima Convention. The minister thus sought to minimize reports on the suspension of the bilateral talks that were being held to clarify some points of the Lima Convention. The talks were stalemated because Peru requested, at the last moment, exchanging the compensation that Chile promised to pay for the land used in "El Chinchorro" without the owner's permission, for the use of the esplanade. Ministry sources said that rather than a legal-diplomatic problem between Chile and Peru, a domestic Peruvian political problem was the result. Some people maintain that the situation entails a problem of nationalism because Fujimori, Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD) President Jaime Yoshiyama, and Victor Joy Way, the CCD Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, are all third-generation Peruvians -- the first two are of Japanese and the third of Chinese descent. Consequently, strong nationalist sectors believe the fact that they are willing to approve agreements with Chile shows ignorance of Peruvian historical roots. Some sources have said that another noteworthy fact is that President Fujimori is not at his political best at the moment. His meager victory at the constitutional referendum did not help him to insist on the approval of the Lima convention by the CCD. This year he will confront elections within Congress and he will have to decide whether to run for reelection in 1995. Observers believe that Peruvian Government opposition forces are using the issue of the resolution of historical disagreements with Chile as an easy weapon against Fujimori. Because this criticism does not touch in-depth matters, it can be concluded that the opposition is not willing to give Fujimori the opportunity to boast that he managed to end the pending points of the 1929 Treaty. The Chilean negotiators' refusal to give Peru an unbroken territory in Arica was positively regarded by Carlos Valcarce, RN [National Renewal] deputy for Arica. He said there cannot be any exchange. For 64 years, Chile and Peru could not agree on how to implement the terms of Article 5 of the 1929 Treaty, involving different interpretations given to the assertion that Chile will build a dock, a customs office, and a terminal on the railroad to Tacna "for the use" of Peru. On 11 May 1993, the two governments signed the so-called Lima Convention, in which Peru expressed its approval of these facilities that were built in Arica, and the two countries established the legal framework in which they will work. This agreement, a free transit convention, and four exchange notes concluded the pending issues of the 1929 Treaty. Under the terms of the Lima Convention, Chile grants Peru -- permanently -- the use of the northern side of the dock, which is to the north of the bay of Arica, the customs office built there, and the railroad terminal on the line to Tacna. The convention rules that ownership of the facilities shall be registered with Arica's Real Estate Registry as Chilean state property, yet noting the right to use it permanently. Peru will authorize a private company to operate the facilities. This will be a corporation based on Peruvian capital. In an exchange note, Chile promised to make a monetary compensation to Peru in lieu of the "El Chinchorro" areas that were used without the owner's consent. "El Chinchorro" is a 145,500 square meter area owned by Peru and located north of Arica. These agreements were negotiated on bases proposed by then Peruvian Foreign Minister Augusto Blacker Miller and were endorsed by his successor Oscar de la Puente. Among the proposals was Blacker Miller's novel formula to grant the operation of the facilities to a private enterprise, without touching "El Chinchorro," a highly sensitive issue for Peru, or splitting Arica's territorial continuity, which Chile will not allow. The Lima Convention should have been rapidly approved by Congress, but the opposition to Fujimori and traditionalist and regionalist Peruvian sectors protested. The strongest voice was that of United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who said that the convention can be improved. Some experts believe the problem emerged because the Chilean Government stated that all agreements can be improved, and by the decision to reach an agreement to "clarify, specify, and supplement" the Lima Convention. After making clear that the Lima Convention would not be modified, Chile made concessions to Peru seeking to help Fujimori present such a historical understanding. The Peruvian side -- without explanation and disrespecting the basis of the negotiation -- asked for the use of the esplanade, which gave rise to the problem of breaking Arica's territorial continuity. It should be recalled that the efforts made in the mid-1980's to settle the pending issues of the 1929 Treaty did not yield any results precisely because the Act of Lima provided for the use of the esplanade by Peru, a matter that was categorically rejected by Chile. Peru's promise to sell "El Chinchorro" was as strongly rejected in the neighboring country. [passage omitted]
