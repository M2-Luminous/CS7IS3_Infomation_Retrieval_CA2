Referring to sources from Skopje, the Albanian Television reported that the Albanian deputies requested on May 13, that the document of the citizenship be presented during the census because the Interior Ministry is not able to provide them; Albanians who work abroad be treated as citizens of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and also be included in the general number of the population, not in special categories. The Albanian deputies requested also that several Albanian people be employed at the Statistical Enterprise and a formulary sample should remain at the families who have been registered. The amendments of the Albanians deputies did not find support and caused uncontrolled reactions by the Macedonian deputies. According to the Macedonian deputies, these amendments request the legalization of the Albanians who have come from Kosova, Serbia, and Albania. The Macedonian deputies supported indirectly the thesis that the Albanians of Macedonia have Macedonian citizenship and should be declared as Macedonians. The parliament stopped its proceedings because of the tense atmosphere created by partial and dissuading discussion.
