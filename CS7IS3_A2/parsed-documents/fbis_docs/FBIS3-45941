He said his visit is at the invitation of Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir who showed a strong interest in Xinjiang during his official visit to China in June last year. Dawamat is scheduled to call on the prime minister and the supreme head of state Sultan Shah Azlan who also visited Xinjiang in 1991.
