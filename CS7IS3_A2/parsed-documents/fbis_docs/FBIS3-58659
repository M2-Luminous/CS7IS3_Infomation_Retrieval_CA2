Fully 84 percent of the 1,043 individuals who answered the questionnaire were either satisfied or very satisfied with their care, and even slightly more felt that doctors, nurses, and other personnel treated them well or very well. Patients in the private health care sector believed they were better treated than those in the public sector did. Very few patients had much comment upon the professional skills of the medical personnel. Even so, it appeared that they placed greater confidence in doctors and other health care workers in the private sector than in the public sector. Nor did patients complain about the information they received. Over 80 percent believed that they had received adequate information from doctors and nurses. The general opinion seemed to be that nurses were a little better than doctors in giving out information expected of them. And once again, the new survey showed a slightly better percentage for the private sector than for the public sector. And yet, the large majority felt that health care services should be financed entirely (24 percent) or partially (72 percent) through taxes. Only 23 percent of those queried felt that health care was expensive or very expensive. Should more health care services be subject to fees, the consensus was that families with children should receive special access to care. The survey was undertaken in eight areas: Bjorneborg, Helsinki, Jakobstad, Joensuu, Jyvaskyla, Rovaniemi, Salo, and Tammerfors. Unfortunately, local results were not yet available when the Consumer Association announced the results yesterday. The survey left many unanswered questions. It will likely be repeated next year in order to get a better idea of the recession's effect on health care standards. For example, in Jakobstad, the questionnaire was divided between Jakobstad's hospital and Ostanlid's hospital. "We do not know whether the patients were actually satisfied at Ostanlid, which is threatened with closure, or whether they gave the care there very high marks in order to show that they wished to keep the hospital," said Karl-Gustav Sodergard, chairman of Finland's Patient Association. The patients' message to the policymakers overwhelmingly concerned the standard of care. The unanimous opinion: Do not cut costs to the extent that the quality of care will suffer.
