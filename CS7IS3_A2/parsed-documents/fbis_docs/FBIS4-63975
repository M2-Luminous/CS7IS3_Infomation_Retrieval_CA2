During his meeting with employees of the institute he said it has become possible to split the solution of the Crimean issue into four stages: The first three envisage the division of the Black Sea Fleet, the determining of the sites for its bases, and the solution of the social and economic problems facing the peninsula. In the fourth and final stage, political arrangements should be worked out for settling all the problems around Crimea. "I always raise this question: Are we with Russia or under Russia?" Leonid Kravchuk asserted. Touching on today's political situation in Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk said that in political life, unfortunately, there is a repetition of something that occurred in 1990.
