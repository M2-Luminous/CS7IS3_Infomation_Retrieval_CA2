Formation of a New-Type Political Party Begins"] [Text] Yesterday Igor Suvorov, president of the joint-stock company Russian Stock Exchange [RSE], held a press conference. According to the RSE president, the upcoming termination of the circulation of the voucher as a state security has provoked special activity by the State Property Committee [Goskomimushchestvo], in the person of Anatoliy Chubays who, while the privatization program has virtually collapsed, is trying to regain the initiative from the Economy Ministry and usurp the power to regulate the securities market through the infrastructure created by Goskomimushchestvo. The seminar for stock market makers, to be convened on 23 and 24 April by the Securities and Stock Exchange Commission under the Russian Federation president, in Suvorov's opinion, is in fact the beginning of the formation of a new type of political party. It is sponsored by the state itself as represented by the ministries and departments which have discredited themselves in the sphere of privatization. The statement also noted that Mr. Chubays is trying to resolve the problem of the enterprise directors corps not on an economic basis but by regimenting its activity and assuming the function of regulating investment flows. According to the RSE president, the approach that is being imposed objectively leads to crime because it envisions a multi-stage scenario as a result of which the capital market will move from an organized to a cash basis [ot organizovannogo k nalichnomy], which corresponds to the interests of shadow structures.
