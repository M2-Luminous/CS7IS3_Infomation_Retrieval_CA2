What is significant is that the two leaders and the two leaderships were able to have a cordial exchange of views which bespeak the longstanding cordial relations which have existed between the leaders and peoples of our two nations. Sr. Gen. Than Shwe and President Nouhak Phoumsavan had a friendly and fruitful discussion on bilateral and international matters of common interest in a cordial atmosphere. In the same spirit, the high-level officials of the two friendly nations were able to hold discussions on matters of common interest and sign agreements of related matters. The fruitful talks led to the signing of the following agreements: 1. Agreement between the Government of the Union of Myanmar [Burma] and the Government of the LPDR on the fixed International Boundary between the two countries in the Mekong River. 2. Agreement on the establishment of a Joint Commission for Bilateral Cooperation between the Government of the Union of Myanmar and the Government of the LPDR. 3. Agreement on Tourism Cooperation between the Government of the Union of Myanmar and the Government of the LPDR. Moreover, the senior general, Madame Than Shwe, and the delegation were able to absorb the historical and cultural aspects of Lao life which are common to both sides, for we had to suffer unfortunate circumstances although we are both independent sovereign nations. The grace and charm of the Lao artistes who performed traditional dances for the benefit of the guests also reflect similarities between the cultures of our two nations. We share much of the Buddhist heritage and the senior general and Madame Than Shwe as well as members of the entourage were able to visit pagodas and pay obeisance to the senior Lao sangha [Buddhist monk], present offertories and share merits. It is heartening to summarize that the two sides were able to highly evaluate the success of the state visit which serves as firm basis for the enhancement of the friendly and good-neighborly relations and cooperation between the two countries in the future, thus contributing to the promotion of peace, stability, and cooperation for the development of the region.
