FBIS4-26470 "drchi121_a_94010" FBIS-CHI-94-121 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS General Further Decline of Dollar Predicted Further Decline of Dollar Predicted May Fall to 90 Yen HK2306025294 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 23 Jun 94 p 33 HK2306025294 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS English BFN [By Donald Last] [Text] The greenback is likely to plumb new depths against the Japanese yen and, having broken through the pyschological barrier of 100 yen, could fall to 90-95 in the the near future say analysts and traders. Tuesday's break in the dollar to a post-war low against the yen of 99.95 cast a chill in Tokyo. "I thought 100 yen was the mother of all defensive positions" for the dollar, Chris Calderwood, Barclays de Zoete Wedd's economist in Tokyo, said. "If you cannot defend that, you cannot defend anything." Though global bond markets were steadier yesterday, the bond and forex markets remain febrile. In the forex, the U.S. dollar recovered to 100.80 against the yen and just above 1.60 German marks. In the bond markets, the U.S. Treasury benchmark 30-year bond firmed slightly and the yield fell from 7.50 per cent to 7.46 percent in Tokyo and European trading. Markets were hoping for some signs from U.S. Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan in his Humphrey Hawkins testimony before Congress yesterday but he deliberately eschewed any mention of the ailing dollar. He simply noted that further increases in pressure on manufacturing capacity risked emerging inflation. The U.S. factory operating rate is now 83 per cent, not far from the 85 percent which many economists consider inflationary. Apart from the Bank of Japan selling yen against dollars yesterday, the other central banks, and especially the U.S. Federal Reserve, were conspicuous by their absence. This is in strong contrast to early-May when they interevened to buy dollars en masse. "Having gone to a new post-war low the foreign exchange markets will now probe the downside to search out central bank policy on interest rates and the dollar," Ian McKinnon, Citibank's chief economist in London, said. The central banks have said that a stronger yen is bad for world trade because it threatens to prolong the Japanese recession and "the markets want to see some heavy-duty intervention, some action to support words", he said. The dollar's fresh weakness against the yen has sparked worries that the Federal Reserve may be forced into further rate hikes which in turn would hit global bond and stockmarkets. "I believe the Federal Reserve will use the next policymaking Open Market Committee meeting July 5 to 6 to raise Fed funds another quarter point and then up them again in August," said Mitsubishi Finance International's head of research in London, Brendan Brown, who estimates second quarter U.S. gross domestic product is running at 4 to 5 percent annualised. The coming Naples Summit (July 8-9) of the major industrialised Group of Seven (G7) club would seem to call for central bank actions to calm markets down, S G Warburg said in a forex report. "It would be embarrassing to say the least for G7 leaders to welcome a global recovery with the dollar in free fall and bond/stockmarkets melting." If no interest rate action is taken by the Fed "the dollar can hardly be expected to stabilise, let alone change course", Warburgs said. Pressure will also be on the Bank of Japan to cut rates to take the pressure off the yen and help preserve Japan's economic recovery. Market participants believe the Bank of Japan will have to cut its 1 and 3/4 percent discount rate if the yen hits 95 against the dollar.
