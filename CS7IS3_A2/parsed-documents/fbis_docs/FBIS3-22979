Apart from a rising tendency in inter-group clashes, there is growing evidence of criminality in militant ranks. Extortions from the public are on the rise as also is the harassment of women. The militant's gun, as had been the case in Punjab, is becoming the new symbol of power as well as access to easy money. Again, like in Punjab, the tactic is now to recruit youth at gunpoint. The creation of a large number of pro-Pakistani militant groups indicates a growing tendency of internecine rivalry, mutual suspicion, and suspicion also on the part of Pakistan. "Pakistan is suspicious of the Kashmiri militants. That explains the growth of militant groups and the influx of mercenaries," says a senior intelligence official. With most Pandits having fled the Valley, militants have turned to making the local Muslims as their target whether on the suspicion of being police informers, settling personal scores or simple criminalisation. For example, over 1,700 Kashmiri Muslims have been killed since 1990 in contrast to about 350 Pandits killed in the same period. About 4,000 private houses have been set afire, over 1,300 schools and government buildings burned, about 1,100 persons have been abducted and another 1,450 odd shops gutted apart from a total 2,175 innocents killed by the militants. Till the end of 1992 alone, there were 81 incidents of extortions and robbing of innocent persons and over 100 incidents of abductions and killings of civilians in the same period. More significantly, like in Punjab, public response to bandh calls by militants has also been on the decrease. This trend has been on the rise after the Hazratbal problem was resolved peacefully and the cleansing operations carried out in Sopore, Baramulla and Anantnag, all erstwhile nerve centres of the militants. For example, last month the residents of Bijbehara, which had witnessed nearly 50 deaths in BSF (Border Security Force) firing in last October, the local residents observed a week-long bandh in protest against the militant activities. In Kupwara, another militant stronghold, the imam of the local mosque prevented militants from addressing a congregation. The most commonly practised tactic adopted by the Kashmiri militants has been "long-distance stand-off attacks."
