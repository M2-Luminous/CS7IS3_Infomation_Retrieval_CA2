Lopez was accompanied by Deputy Carlos Riveros and Senator Fernando Pfannl. The visitors wanted to clarify the incident on 5 April when NOTICIAS photographer Ismael Villalba was held for one hour after he committed "the sin" of photographing a conversation between Lopez and soldier Crispulo Sanchez. A captain whose last name is Galeano and other two officers were also arrested as a consequence of this incident. "The colonel told us there had been a misunderstanding in the case of the reporter and explained that the Armed Forces does not intend to restrict freedom of the press," the deputy said. Regarding the arrest of the captain and the other officers, the colonel said they were arrested for not carrying out the already famous "order from above." The deputy, however, could not say who gave that order. "It seems that the order was that I could not speak with the soldier either despite the colonel's remark that the soldier was at my disposal. Those were the two reasons for the arrest of Galeano and his comrades," the deputy said.
