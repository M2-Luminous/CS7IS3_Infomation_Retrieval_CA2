Belarusian Premier's spokesman Vladimir Zametalin told this to Interfax and said that the sides had decided to fix single fuel prices, exchange their currencies on a one to one basis, and recognize the National Bank of Belarusia as the chief bank of this sovereign state. Each of the two countries will have a budget of its own; however, some joint programs, including those on military matters and efforts to eliminate the effects of the Chernobyl disaster, will be funded "from a joint treasury", Zametalin stressed. He also noted that "unjustified delay regarding monetary integration accords has elevated this problem to a parliamentarian level." Meanwhile speakers at the hearings on the problems and prospects of relations with Russia held in the parliament's lower house by the committees for CIS affairs, contacts with compatriots, and economic policy noted that Moscow and Minsk still differed on monetary integration. For one thing, they have not agreed on what rate the Belarusian ruble be exchanged to the Russian ruble. Nor is there unanimity on levelling up the prices of Belarusian and Russian commodities and on combining budgets. The basic difference, as was pointed out at the hearings, is that on the status of the Belarusian National Bank. The Russian side suggests that by 31 December 1994 the Belarusian National Bank be transformed into a branch of Russia's bank with the transfer of all assets and liabilities to it. It also proposes that Russian laws be applied to banking and currency exchange on the territory of Belarusia. However, Belarusian experts deem it necessary to retain the national bank's right to control a combined monetary system in Belarusia and disapprove efforts to subordinate the Belarusian bank to the bank of Russia. The Vice-Chairman of Russia's Central Bank Dmitriy Tulin believes that "the monetary system now being created will lack vitality and stability, if Belarusia's bank does not become a branch of Russia's bank." He stressed that although in theory any degree of responsibility could be agreed, such agreement would hardly prove workable. Tulin doubted that the number of participants in a new monetary union should be extended before Russia and Belarusia combine their monetary systems. The Deputy Economics Minister Sergey Ignatiyev, for his part, emphasized that "a treaty cannot be equal in principle," and "a single currency must have one master." The document, in his view, should stipulate that the Belarusian side sacrifices part of its sovereignty on fiscal matters and has to give in to Russia's demands. The Deputy Foreign Economic Relations Minister of Russia Georgiy Gabonya declared that his department favoured monetary integration; however, without political unity there is no sufficient guarantee that the accords will be implemented. A monetary integration accord, in his opinion, will lead to "the creation of a common fence to the rest of the world", which will necessitate single import-export duties and quotas, and single rules for trade with third countries.
