This tradition is also manifested clearly with its dynamism in renovation and socioeconomic stabilization and development. This city holds an important position and provides great shares to implementing the two strategic duties of national construction under the socialist direction and national protection. On behalf of the party Political Bureau, I welcome the delegate comrades and convey the trust of the leading party and state organs in the HCMCPC and people. The HCMCPC political report presented by Comrade Secretary Vo Tran Chi correctly and straightforwardly evaluates achievements and progress as well as shortcomings in implementing the seventh national party congress [SNPC] resolution and the HCMCPC fifth congress resolution. It also analyzes and forecasts major opportunities and challenges and outlines major duties and measures for the coming period to satisfactorily execute the SNPC resolution. Comrade Nguyen Van Linh, adviser to the party Central Committee, has delivered a speech contributing his views on the lines and measures to stabilize and develop the socioeconomy and strengthen national defense and security. I would like to address four issues to contribute further to your debate. I. The Position and Responsibility of Ho Chi Minh City in the New Period of National Development. 1. Throughout the national revolution process led by the party over harsh and dangerous stages, the HCMCPC and people have always contributed deservingly to the common national cause. In 30 years of two consecutive resistance wars for national independence and unification, the Saigon residents faced a widespread mechanism and force of brutal oppression directly on enemy territory. Overcoming great losses and sacrifice, grassroots party establishments in this city have ceaselessly consolidated and developed. Under the HCMCPC leadership, our people's political fighting movement and Armed Forces in Saigon and Gia Dinh have always been an exemplar of the ironed-walled South Vietnam. The entire party and people are thankful to the people here for their stalwart fighting which greatly contributed to our total victory to liberate Saigon and South Vietnam and unite the nation. We share the feeling of "happiness with tears" as music composer Xuan Hong wrote in his popular song. We also cannot forget that soon after, the socioeconomic situation in this city plunged into a crisis with numerous difficulties. Life was so hard that the laboring people were forced to partly substitute barley corn for rice for their meals. From city leaders to grassroots cadres, our party and state organs had to spend most of their time and energy finding rice, vegetables, meat, and fish for the people's meals. In that situation, the HCMCPC and residents not only proved their spirit for enduring difficulty and hardship, but they also developed dynamism and creativeness to improve the situation. This city contributed practical experiences with new ideas and actions at quite an early stage, creating a foundation for our party to review and outline the renovation line. Always being among the localities which lead the way in the process of transforming to the market economy under state management, Ho Chi Minh City has actively contributed to forming new structures, developed its bridging role in international relations, and helped stabilize and develop the economic situation in South Vietnam and in the entire nation. At present, with only 6.4 percent of the national population, Ho Chi Minh City (including all economic units in this area) shares about 16 percent of the gross national income, creates nearly one- third of the national industrial products and postal and transportation volume, reaches more than half of the national export volume, sells one-fourth of all retail goods, contributes one-fourth of the budget revenue, attracts nearly half of direct foreign investment, and trains more than half of all college students. These figures prove the important role and position of Ho Chi Minh City in the country. 2. In the past three years, the city economy has enjoyed a development rate higher than the national average. It has mainly overfulfilled key targets set forth by the Ho Chi Minh City fifth party congress. Earlier, its retail price index was higher than the national index. In 1993, the city reduced its inflation rate below the national rate (1.6 percent compared with 5.2 percent). The recorded achievements together with geographical, socioeconomic, and international relations advantages have created better conditions for this city to develop in the new stage. In reality, the new period actually started in the city two years ago, creating momentum for faster and firmer development steps in the coming period. However, there are many challenging issues in this city at a higher and complicated level such as: a lack of discipline and order in socioeconomic activities, poor management of state property, the prevalent practice of corruption and waste, the difficulty in maintaining political stability and social order and safety, the increase of social evils and poisonous and harmful cultural products, and so forth. In our city, great opportunities go in hand with harsh challenges in terms of economy, politics, and society. 3. Our country is entering a new development stage, the stage of industrialization and modernization, when the speed of economic growth rate will be greatly accelerated and the social equity and social progress will be better implemented. Henceforth, Ho Chi Minh City will have a more important position and bear heavier responsibility. The core content of industrialization and modernization is the fundamental and comprehensive transformation from a manual and backward industry to a modern and advanced industry which utilizes technological and scientific progress to reach higher labor efficiency and attain better social advancements. It is indisputable that in the industrialization and modernization process, Ho Chi Minh City in particular and the southern economic region (including Dong Nai and Ba Ria-Vung Tau provinces) in general, have the most advantages, the most important locations, and higher development levels than other localities. Our party Central Committee and government always consider this region a driving force in the industrialization and modernization process, a force playing a decisive role in national development and in the effort not to let our economy be left further behind those of other countries. Ho Chi Minh City, therefore, should bear the tremendous responsibility and task of being a vanguard locality, and should strive for faster and more steadfast advancements in all economic, cultural, social, security, and national defense fields. It is an life-long demand, a great honor, and a heavy responsibility for Ho Chi Minh City to maintain the undertaking to construct and protect our fatherland. II. The City Can Only Develop Strongly and in the Right Direction When It Forms an Alliance and Cooperates Closely With Other Regions and Localities Under the Unified Leadership of the Central Level. 1. In the context of national strategy and state planning, Ho Chi Minh City, with its strength and advantages, should develop its role as an industrial center by having an ever increasing technological level, a trade-finance-services center, a head of the transportation system, and a culture-science-technology center for the southern region and the country as a whole. To fulfill that role, the economic structure of the city should be developed in the direction of increasing the proportion of industry and services. It does not mean that we should adopt any types of industry or services, but only those with high technology which do not cause pollution. In other words, we should strive to increase the scientific and technological contents of the city's produces and services, and move production activities with low technology and high manual labor to outlying suburbs and other areas. The reason is that we need to develop the city's advantages, which other localities lack, and at the same time we need to try to maintain a reasonable city population and avoid a high population density that would lead to complicated problems in living conditions, public transport, environmental protection, and above all, social vices. The industrial sector of the city currently still has high proportions of production activities in food grains, food staples, chemicals, fertilizer, rubber, timber processing, paper, construction material, ceramic and glass products (these products comprised 62.9 percent of production output value in 1990 and 63.5 percent in 1993). In the meantime, areas such as machinery production and electronics constitute much smaller proportions, and were decreasing (9.9 percent in 1990 to 9.2 percent in 1993). Though the situation is complicated and cannot be explained by a single reason, it shows us clearly that in entering a new development stage, industrial development needs careful planning to channel all the advantages of the city, using them in effecting logical and efficient changes to the economic structure. The city must have an increasing ability to accept modern and advanced technologies so that it can transfer them later to other localities. In the development of trades and business, employment is now a high priority issue. But if we follow the direction of developing trades and professions which mainly employ manual labor, then the demographic population growth rate will be higher and the employment problem will become more tense. In 1993, the demographic population growth rate was 1.67 percent, higher than the natural growth rate, which was 1.58 percent. In the last few years, the population of the city has increased by approximately 150,000 to 160,000 people each year -- about the population of a district -- half of them (in fact, it could be more) were from other localities. The problem cannot be solved by administrative measures. It can only be solved by the combined measures of reforming the economic structure of the city and improving transport and communications, and most of the living conditions of the areas around the city. It requires the close alliance and cooperation of the city and the ministries, sectors, and other localities. It requires the elimination of departmentalism and sectionalism, which alienate localities from the central level. From now on, the setting up of business and production establishments in a locality will be considered completely in terms of the long-term socioeconomic benefit for that locality, not in terms of whether the capital contributors and business managers are from that locality or not. Organizations and individuals from Ho Chi Minh City are entitled to invest in production establishments in other localities, and vice versa. Capital and expertise cannot be limited by boundaries between localities or authority levels. We need to motivate all available sources of capital and we also need to foster and utilize skills. (With investment projects that produce fast economic benefits such as hotel, services, and so forth, we let foreign investors contribute most of the capital for joint ventures, because the motivation of domestic capital in our country is still made difficult due to rampant departmentalism, localism, and sectionalism; or is even restriced by the small scale of an organization). 2. In addition to the transformation of the economic structure in the direction of increasing the proportion of industry, the city must further develop its roles as the finance-trade-service center, the spearhead of the national transportation network and international external relations, and also the center for culture, science, and technology. The number of visitors to the city and the merchandise, capital, and technologies going through the city are enormous. The city should see them as advantages, because activities in these areas, which we generally describe as services, will constantly increase in proportionate to economic growth. To be able to fulfill these requirements, the city authorities should concentrate all available resources on the construction of the socioeconomic infrastructure. Foreign sources can also be included, but state fund should be the main source. The electricity and communications networks have been strengthened, but the work done so far is still inadequate. The water supply and drainage systems; the transport system; facilities for education, public health, scientific research, technology, and so forth require greater investment. It is the responsibility of the state authorities to solve these issues. In the development of business and production activities, we rely on development investment drawn from all economic sectors, including from the people and from direct foreign investment. The state is not the main investor in business and production fields; it only supports these activities by providing investment credit or contributing shares in essential establishments. At present individual businessmen and the general public have not yet invested eagerly in production. They tend to choose to do business in trade, services, real estates, and so forth. The main reason for this situation is that our policies, laws, and structures have not been able to create trust among people. We also lack guidance and support, and sometimes we even hinder development efforts or are confused and sluggish in forming and developing the capital market. Once we overcome these weaknesses the development investment in the city will see a new boom. So far, whenever we have mentioned the leading role of the state- run economic sector, we have referred only to state-owned business establishments. Now we need to correct this misconception and realize that the state economic sector comprises not only the state- run business establishments but also other resources and assets, the finance and state bank systems, and national reserves. If we could utilize and manage these resources effectively in combination with our legal institutions, the state would be perfectly capable of guiding all economic activities in the directions it chooses. We need to see this clearly in order to understand and implement uniformly the multisectoral economic policy, to positively reorganize management structure in state business establishments, and to be confident in developing other economic sectors. III. Culture and Society Are Core Elements of Development. This is our party's viewpoint, which accords well with international convention and is also the strength of the city. The development in the quality of education, health protection services (including physical education and sports), cultural and art activities, as well as social and charitable activities has been thus far carried out with outstanding results, that serve as precious experiences in the "socialization" work that we should fulfill with the people's support. Our main efforts at present should be to combine "development with suppression": we need to develop cultural, educational, health, and social activities, and at the same time strive to suppress social vices -- namely, prostitution and drug abuse, which are directly connected with the risk of spreading HIV/AIDS, and represent a degraded, pernicious culture. The expansion of the market economy and external relations require us to protect our society more vigorously against those vices -- from the small family unit to schools, agencies, enterprises, and mass organizations. Resolute legal and administrative measures should be carried out in parallel with education and motivation work that focus on building cultured individuals, families, and society. All cadres and party members must strive to build cultured lives for themselves and for their families, and must consider the effort a necessary part of the duty of being a model for society. IV. The Organizational Mechanism and Cadres Are Decisive Elements 1. In all areas we already have policies, directions, and measures. The essential elements that decide the results are the organizational mechanism and cadres. The further we have proceeded on our renovation, the more apparent we have found the inadequacies in knowledge, ability, and moral standards among the organizational mechanism and cadres in all sectors and echelons. Therefore, it is obvious that we need to combine economic reform with administrative reform. Within the administrative reform there are three most important parts we need to focus on to improve our ability to develop a market economy within the effective management of the state on the path of socialism: -- Fundamentally reform the financial-monetary system in accordance with a market economy. -- Continue the rectification of the efficiency of state business enterprises to improve them. -- Reorganize the cadre mechanism. 2. The adjustment of the state mechanism to stop its awkwardness, bureaucracy, and corruption must start with its structure. While discussing the anticorruption line, the party Political Bureau clearly defined that corruption is the result of many causes, of which the fundamental cause is our structure and policies. Our current policies have too many gaps and loopholes, which are a feeding ground for corruption and bribery. What does corruption live on? Mainly state property and money. Who are corrupt? Most of them are the party and state cadres. There are many issues relating to corruption and authoritarianism. The prominent ones are: -- The current state mechanism is still confused between the role of state administration management and the role of state property ownership, and it has not ended its intervention in the business management of the state enterprises. Therefore, we must clearly distinguish these roles, set up a structure to separate the state property management from the state administration management, and establish a system of ownership in state enterprises to ensure that the property in these state enterprises has a real owner. Then, we must gradually eliminate the system of managing organizations and rearrange the state mechanism to reduce the number of specialized ministries and departments. -- We must build a structure with clearly defined responsibilities in the management of state property and in the use of public funds, reform the capital funding and the use of state capital, and improve the collection of tax and budget revenue (including fees, fines, and so forth). These tasks require us to reform and improve our system of accounting, editing, public finance, and the control and supervision of public funds to prevent arbitrary spending of state property. -- We must fundamentally reform the administration procedure, clearly define what authority can introduce administration regulations (including fees), reduce matters requiring state permission, eliminate complicated procedures, and publicly announce procedures and regulations that government officials must conform to in receiving and solving public inquiries. We also have to organize public campaigns to encourage the public to contribute their view for the improvement of our administration procedure. And we must immediately conduct an investigation into and deal with stage organs and officials violating the working procedure. -- We must enhance the supervision and control role of public elected organs (the National Assembly and people's committees) and establish a structure to ensure public supervision of the performance of state organs and officials. We must proceed with the setting up of administrative tribunals to settle disputes between citizens with state organs and officials.s Reforming the structure to counter authoritarianism and corruption must be linked up with public education and participation. A corrupt official both violates the law and damages his morality and character. He not only destroys himself, but also stains his family. In fighting corruption, we need the punishment of the law, the condemnation of society, and prevention by colleagues and family. The aforementioned are tasks that cannot be delayed. But they must not be conducted in a simplistic and hasty way. The government has its own program for executing those tasks on a national scale. Recently, this city has positively performed some tasks (such as the administrative reform). It is necessary to draw experience for future reference. 3. The cadre-related issue has a very significant meaning for the party leadership and state management in this city. Ho Chi Minh City enjoys favorable conditions for attracting cadres from variable sources, especially the concentration of outstanding cadres in many fields. The problem here is how to create mutual trust, unity, and respect at work. We have to give priority to common benefits and work results without discrimination regarding the origin of the cadre. This is the first important factor in developing the ability of cadres and attracting more talented people to create the city strength. The increase of training and refresher training for cadres need to go together with the evaluation and check through actual work to select for promote the cadre according to their morality, ability, work efficiency, and management ability. In Ho Chi Minh City, the cadre-related work has a decisive meaning. Therefore, it is necessary to have a high unanimity in perception and line in this work before making it a party resolution, which will serve as a foundation for the evaluation and selection of cadres, thus strengthening the city party committee and government to turn the city into a regional and national center in many fields, including the field of cadre-related work. Dear delegate comrades. My meetings with delegates of different generations in this conference have made feelings and experiences arise in me that I obtained while I worked here, especially for 14 years after the liberation of this city. I profoundly acknowledge and always remember the people here with their revolutionary enthusiasm and love, the dynamism and close comraderie cooperation among cadres in different sectors and levels, and the attentive leadership and guidance of well-eperienced key cadres. These were elements helping me to develop and accomplish various duties in different positions during my work here. Together with other cadres from this city now working at the central organs, we always follow every developing step of this city with all our sentiment and knowledge. We consider our responsibility for this home city an obligation, honor, and pleasure. With a sincere and respectful feeling, I wish the conference to have successful and earnest discussions and high unanimity in perception and action to lead our city in moving more quickly and more firmly in the new developing period. I hope that the party committee and people, with their past achievements, will heighten their determination to meet the requirements of everyday life and excellently accomplish the duty entrusted upon them by the party and state, deserving the love and trust of the people in the entire nation.
