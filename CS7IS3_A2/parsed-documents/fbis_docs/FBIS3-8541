It was announced that passenger trains would be stopped at 0300 on 11 March. The nationwide strike by railroad workers will continue today into the evening, but Solidarity ["S"] does not rule out the possibility that it may last longer than that in some junctions unless the General Administration [DG] of the Polish State Railroads [PKP] stops "repressions and violations of unionists' rights." It is not known whether the PKP will go on strike all over Poland because the DG is trying to "resist the illegal" action. According to "S", however, the activities of the DG will encounter the opposition of many employees (such as engine drivers--the permission to "pass red lights" and so the "strike impact" will be stronger). The DG PKP reported that it had forwarded a letter to the regional prosecutor's office, in which it wrote about the intention of the railroad S to violate the law. The Gdansk Region of "S" and mines were on strike yesterday; some of them were on strike for 18 to 24 hours. However, the scale of the miners' strikes is evaluated by "S" differently than by the boards of the coal partnerships. The PKP Will Not Throw People Out DG PKP Press Spokesperson Anna Raczkowska stated on the evening of 10 March that she had received the first official report about the PKP strike on Thursday [10 March], when "in Silesia it had already begun 90 minutes earlier!" The DG PKP decided that this strike was illegal and sent information to that effect to the prosecutor's office. The strike will probably not be joined by the northern and central districts. According to the DG, losses resulting from the 10-hour strike will amount to 50 or 60 billion zlotys; approximately 3,300 passenger trains will be stopped, and approximately 1.5 million people will have difficulty getting, among other places, to work. PKP Director General Aleksander Janiszewski forwarded information "on the intention of violating the law" by the National Railroads Section of "S" to the prosecutor's office. He claims that "the section's chairman, Mr. Krzysztof Maminski, from 5 to 9 March" in the mass media "publicly encouraged people to organize a strike in the PKP on 11 March," which was contrary to the provisions of the Law on Resolving Collective Bargaining. "It is not true that we are implementing militarization of the railways, that we are cutting off telephone communications. We simply do not want fax machines to be used for the purposes of an illegal strike," he declared. The director said that special regulations were issued for 11 March, which would limit the possibilities of entering the offices of employees who work different shifts; attempts to exchange some of the employees were made, so that those who do not want to strike would be able to work. The PKP will also employ the principle, in line with which trains may pass "on a special order"--that is, the same that "S" calls "passing the red lights." "The enterprise should be governed by the administration, not by the trade unions." The strikers will not be in any way punished, aside from the fact that they will not get remuneration for the period of the strike. Each of them will receive the scheduled wage increase. "S" argues that the DG did not allow its members to issue information about the strike; in line with the law, this should be done five days ahead of time. It did not allow them to post information leaflets and thus arouse the interest of the people. According to the Board of the Gdansk Region, approximately 140 enterprises took part in the one-hour strike; among them were the following shipyards: Gdynia Shipyard, Navy Shipyard in Gdynia, Gdansk Shipyard, as well as Siarkopol. It is estimated that 70 percent of the work force took part in the protest. In line with the results of a quick opinion poll conducted by RZECZPOSPOLITA among directors of the enterprises, the scope of the strike was smaller than expected: In the Gdansk Shipyard, for instance, 25 percent of the work force was supposed to go on strike. The strike did not cause any losses at the port; neither departures nor arrivals of any ships were scheduled for that time. "S" stated that yesterday's strike was a complete success. Presidents of the coal partnerships say that work at most of the mines was peaceful and uninterrupted. "S" reports that 50 mines were on strike from 0600 to 0800; the partnerships' presidents say that, in the overwhelming majority of mines, there were only rallies, lasting 15 minutes or so (according to the presidents, they were held in only some mines--for example, in the Gliwice partnerships, in three out of seven mines); after the rallies, the work force resumed work. The union emphasizes that the purpose of the "S" action is to resolve the problems of the work forces, not to hold strikes as such. The Silesian-Dabrowa branch of "S" reported that 18- or 24-hour strikes were staged in 19 mines (out of 70), including four zinc and lead mines, as well as in eight mines of the Bytom partnership (those miners began their strike on Wednesday night). The directors of the mines say that in only two mines were the majority of workers on strike; in the remaining mines, only a dozen or so percent of the work force participated. In eight mines of the Vistula partnership, some of the workers staged an eight-hour strike. "S" speaks of the mines as a whole, whereas the president of the partnership lists them individually: In three mines, approximately 30 percent of the work force was on strike; in "Silesia," 50 percent; and in "Brzesc," the majority. "S" explains that the rallies may have been short, but mines fulfilled the quota of a two-hour protest by organizing strikes during all shifts.
