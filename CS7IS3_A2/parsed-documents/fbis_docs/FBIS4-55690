In this context, Miroslav Novak, director of communications at the Czech Energy Enterprises [CEZ] power company, which is the investor for the JETE project, told a CESKY DENIK reporter that the final budgeted costs, even with the implementation of the U.S. safety system from the Westinghouse company, should in no way exceed the sum of Kc70 billion. The Czech Government's state guarantees for the delivery of automatic control systems and nuclear fuel for the first two JETE blocks amount to Kc12.2 billion. This involves, first and foremost, a loan from Citibank, with a guarantee from the U.S. EXIM bank and the Belgian ON'D. The state guarantees made it possible to obtain a longer-term dollar credit with a date of maturity of 14 years given the lower interest of up to 5 percent. The other costs, apart from the loan from Investicni banka [Investment Bank] amounting to Kc1.1 billion, which is already more than half exhausted, come from CEZ's own resources.
