This has prevented any acceleration in the export of nongas commodities. In this regard, the government and the private sector should embark on anticipatory measures to curb Indonesia's current decline in nongas exports. This was stated by Rudy Lengkong, the head of the National Export Development Board, BPEN, during a hearing of the Parliamentary Commission VII [Roman seven] headed by Lukman R. Boer on 22 June. Agricultural products and manufactured goods are among the 17 export items in decline. According to Rudy Lengkong, an impromptu analysis conducted by the Department of Industry indicated that the decline in the nongas export commodities was due to weaker demand for such commodities. In general, Indonesia was not the only country suffering such a decline. For example, the Netherlands also noted an 18.44 percent decline in its exports. Italy's export volume also dropped 24.15 percent in global markets, while France's exports noted a 15.43 percent downswing. These countries are in fact Indonesia's major export venues in West Europe. Apart from this, the emergence of new competitors for Indonesia in international markets has also contributed to the country's decline in its exports. China and Vietnam are currently making efforts to find markets for their products, particularly manufactured goods which are relatively similar to those offered by Indonesia. Meanwhile, Indonesia's traditional competitors -- Thailand, Malaysia and some others -- are also strong contenders. The decline in prices was also one of the factors for the drop in Indonesia's nongas exports. Rudy Lengkong said: "The weaker demand in several markets due to recession, which was followed by a deluge of export commodities, caused the decline in prices for several nongas commodities -- including textiles, textiles products, and rubber." Another factor which has also contributed to the continuing decline of Indonesia's exports of nongas commodities is the Indonesian entrepreneurs' inability in setting up foreign trade networks in regions with market potential, which could guarantee a continuous and secure market access. Strangely, China and India are the only countries which have foreign trade networks at an international level. [Passage omitted]
