The Defense Department sent 75 U.S. military personnel and 20 top-of-the line fighters, bombers and other military aircraft to Asian Aerospace '94, a five-day international aircraft exhibition that ended yesterday, according to THE WASHINGTON POST. The aircraft the Pentagon dispatched to Singapore included the three F/A-18s, an Air Force F-15C strike plane and four U.S. Army helicopters, totalling 13 types of fighter planes. The industry officials consider the strong U.S. military presence at the Singapore exhibition as a major boost the their [as received] sales efforts in Asian arms market. An official from the industry described the participation of U.S. flight crews as an invaluable promotional tool because it showed to foreign governments that in buying U.S. aircraft they also were engaging in a relationship with the United States military. The U.S. participation in the exhibition is a sign that Clinton government may reverse previous administration practice of tighter controls on U.S. weapons exports, the newspaper said. U.S. arms control officials said the Clinton administration wants to boost American arms exports to make up for declining production at home. The result is that the Clinton administration is undermining its own efforts to curb weapons exports, the U.S. Arms Control Association said in a statement. "In publicly reversing its own policy, the administration sends the wrong signal to other suppliers and undercuts the prospects for controlling weapons proliferation," the association said. "This is another indication that the administration is giving a higher priority to economic concerns than security concerns," it added. THE WASHINGTON POST pointed out that the United States already sells for more weapons abroad than any other nations. U.S. defense firms secured 32.4 billion dollars in overseas sales agreements during fiscal 1993, according to figures compiled by arms control groups. U.S. arms exports in 1992 accounted for nearly half of all arms sales worldwide by all countries combined, the newspaper said.
