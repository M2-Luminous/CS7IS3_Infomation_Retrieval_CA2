FR940114-0-00014 FR940114-0-00004 C. Notice and Comment Section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b), requires in most instances that a notice of proposed rulemaking be published in the Federal Register and that opportunity for comment be provided when an agency promulgates new regulations. Section 553(b) sets forth an exception, however, for rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice. The instant amendments provide expedited procedures for the approval of certain contract market rules. The Commission has determined that these amendments, which will reduce the burden on the exchanges, relate to Commission procedure and practice and therefore that notice and comment is not required. Section 553(b) also sets forth an exception to the requirement of notice and opportunity for public comment when the Commission for good cause finds such notice and public comment are unnecessary or contrary to the public interest. The Commission finds that notice and public comment on the rule changes announced herein are unnecessary because the changes are procedural in nature and do not establish any new obligations under the Act. List of Subjects in 17 CFR Parts 1 and 5 Commodity futures, Contract market rules, Consumer protection, Rule review procedures, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
