The MOF has imposed strict review criteria and limited the establishment of new overseas branches in order to give priority to the restructuring of financial institutions carrying bad loans. It approved new branches in China and Hong Kong, clearly reflecting a trend to place importance on Asia where a higher growth rate is expected than in Europe and the United States. Banks, as a matter of principle, must obtain preliminary approval of the MOF when establishing branch offices or banks overseas. An application covering country, city, and other data is submitted to the MOF, which then issues a preliminary approval to be followed by work on the details such as when the overseas operations will commence. Once preliminary approval is granted, it takes six months to one year to actually commence operations. Recent preliminary approvals covered branches in Shanghai for Sumitomo Trust Bank, Hokuriku Bank, Iyo Bank, and Shinwa Bank; in Dalian for Fukuoka City Bank; and in Hong Kong for Aomori Bank. Fukuoka City Bank states, "We wish to make Dalian the center for our operations in China," and will proceed with detailed planning once a feasibility study is completed. Among regional banks, the Juroku Bank and Nishi-Nippon Bank already have branches in Shanghai and the Yamaguchi Bank has a branch in Dalian. It can be said that the boom in opening banks in China has spread from city banks to regional banks. On the other hand, opening of branches in Hong Kong by city banks, long-term credit banks and trust banks has been completed and it appears that the future will witness the opening of branches by regional banks and second regional banks. Preliminary approvals issued for overseas branches of banks on a yearly basis included 86 in fiscal year 1989 and 80 in fiscal year 1990 at high levels, but fell sharply to 28 in fiscal year 1991 and 31 in fiscal year 1992. In fiscal year 1993, there were 16 approvals in the first half and six in the second half for a total of 22. As part of second half fiscal year 1993 applications, some long-term credit banks and others had asked for approval of branches in Hanoi, but they have been held in abeyance. The MOF has assumed a cautious attitude in regard to opening of new overseas branches and banks have begun to restrain applications for new branches.
