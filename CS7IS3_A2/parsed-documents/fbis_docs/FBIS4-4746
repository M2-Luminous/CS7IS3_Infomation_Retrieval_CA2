Political sources said the chances for an early start to deliberations on fiscal 1994 budget bills at the House of Representatives Budget Committee are slim, predicting an impasse to last through next week. Hosokawa rejected the demand by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to summon his former aide, who was in charge of Hosokawa's finances when he borrowed 100 million yen from Sagawa Kyubin Co., a scandal-tainted trucking firm. Top LDP officials refused to take part in the Budget Committee debate unless the seven-party coalition promised to bring the witness before the Diet. The LDP also decided to boycott discussions at all committees if the coalition opens the Budget Committee meeting without the LDP. LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori told Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura the LDP also demands that Hosokawa provides more information about the loan, which the opposition claims was an undeclared political donation. After being briefed by Takemura on the meeting with Mori, Hosokawa told reporters that he has no intention to agree to a Diet testimony by his former aide. Hosokawa has said he repaid the loan, which he says was used for personal affairs, with interest by 1991. Diet discussions over a full state budget for fiscal 1994, which began Friday, have been suspended due to the stalemate.
