Next year the country will get 30 million guilders in financial aid, twice the amount from last year. The priority for the aid will be the democratization process, education, "marginalized" youth and employment. This was stated in a document sent to Parliament yesterday by Foreign Minister Kooijmans, Development Cooperation Minister Pronk, and Economic Affairs State Secretary Van Rooy. The Netherlands will normalize its relations with South Africa when a new government has been formed on the basis of the parliamentary elections of 26, 27, and 28 April. The ministers' document covers political relations, economic relations, development cooperation, and cultural relations with South Africa. The ministers stressed that the precise form would depend above all on developments in the near future. They have full confidence that a normal relation could be built up with the country because the Netherlands "has historical and cultural links [with South Africa] and has built up good contacts with future leaders by its active attitude in the fight against apartheid." The Netherlands will also enter a development relationship with South Africa. To date, aid was passed only through private organizations. The cabinet said that it would be necessary before the end of the year to consult the new South African Government about the policies. South Africa is classed as a country in transition, and consequently will receive no large-scale or long-term aid. Netherlands companies will be encouraged to invest in the "South African economy, which in principle is very promising." Among the options are the exchange of trade and investment delegations and -- "when the time is ripe" -- more flexible policies on export credit insurance.
