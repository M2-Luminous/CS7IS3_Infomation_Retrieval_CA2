About 4,000 people participated in the rally, including representatives of several of the city's enterprises. The leaders of the association did not participate in the rally, but Kirov's general director, Petr Semenenko, said that they were sympathetic toward the demands of the trade unions and considered them just. The trade unions' demands are known: for the government to develop an economic policy that would stimulate production. We have a unique situation today: We have raw material, we have production capacities, we have people, but nobody is working because the government policy makes it disadvantageous to work. In any case the militia was invited to the rally and there were no excesses. The question now is as follows: Will the government take the demands developed by the city's trade union aktiv and supported by the rally seriously enough or will it ignore them? If the government perceives the rally not as a demonstration of force but as an ordinary political measure, we will arrive at the situation that developed in Russia in 1905.
