Do you agree with the calls made by certain Western politicians and by Ankara that one should also proceed along the same path to settle the problems in other disputed enclaves in Bosnia? [Smilkovic] I used to explain to my students that the NATO pact was a military factor in the tragic balance of fear during the years of the cold war. Now the eastern bloc has disappeared, together with its bastion -- the Warsaw Pact, thus making NATO superfluous. Accordingly, NATO is now seeking a new role, so as to prove that it is still needed. It was scared by the end of the civil war in the Balkans, so it launched a campaign with its most terrible weapons against the Serbs to make it impossible for them to conclude a peace treaty. Knowing that the Serbs are a proud and brave nation, it issued an ultimatum to them to pull out of Sarajevo and leave their compatriots defenseless. NATO knew that the Serbs cannot accept such a solution, just as they rejected it in 1941 and rose to arms to help their allies -- Great Britain, France, America, and Russia. Yet again, in this century, Russia is saving Europe from its own evil by returning to the labyrinths of the Balkans to establish order by force. On behalf of Russia, President Yeltsin appealed to the Serbs in Bosnia to withdraw their heavy weapons from the territory of Sarajevo and allow Russian blue helmets to take over peacekeeping in this region. Europe has been saved from being plunged into a new war without borders. It will be bad it they attempt to act in a similar way in future, if other states, especially Turkey, join in the conflict. The warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina must be given the chance of achieving peace themselves by peaceful means. When, in the past, others separated them [the warring parties], as certain of our former allies are attempting to do now, peace was always pushed further away. It does not become democratic Europe to establish a new world order by air strikes. Those who speak on behalf of the old Europe should know that "blood is the wrong food for men." [passage omitted] [Kulinski] Is the idea still alive that the Macedonians are "southern Serbs?" [Smilkovic] Ideas do not die; they are realized, disappear into history, or are forgotten. As regards the expression "southern Serbs," it was not invented. From the time of their arrival in the Balkan peninsula, most of the Serbs lived in compact groups in the southern part of the peninsula. Their centuries-long sense of statehood and spirituality are tied up with these territories, monasteries, schools, hospitals, and graveyards. Although they are now destroyed and neglected, they continue to serve as a living proof, Apart from this, it is well-known that, in medieval times, Skopje was the capital of the most powerful Serbian rulers. As regards the Macedonians, in the Serbian perception, they are a separate fraternal Slavonic nation that lives in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], where Serbs, Bulgarians, and other nationalities also live. In former Yugoslavia, this fact was suppressed and never mentioned. The Serbs also disregarded it in the socialist period, so as to demonstrate greater broad- mindedness toward the other peoples, especially the Macedonians. Unfortunately, some questions relating to the position of the Serbs in Macedonia are still not resolved, and for this reason various sides are misusing them in their everyday politics. What is worst of all, the same thing is also being done by those who are working from outside to poison the relations between the peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage omitted] [Kulinski] The Bulgarians in Serbia are also suffering privations at the present. There is apprehension that political pressure is being applied to them to make the Bulgarian population forget their national identity. How well-founded are these claims? [Smilkovic] The population is finding it difficult to live in Montenegro as well as Serbia. All share this same fate, including the Bulgarian national minority. The sanctions were imposed against the citizens of Yugoslavia, irrespective of their national affiliation. The Bulgarian minority is finding it a little easier to bear the sanctions than the others, partly because of the humanitarian aid that is sent directly from Bulgaria, and partly due to the other benefits that living close to the border in such circumstances provides. There are no grounds for concern whether the Bulgarians in the FRY can preserve their national identity. They enjoy all the rights that the other citizens possess, and have every opportunity to express their Bulgarian nationality in education, culture, and other field of life. The best example is Dimitrovgrad Municipality: There one in every three citizens has a job. Although 52 percent of the population of the municipality are Bulgarians, there are very few non-Bulgarians occupying municipal posts or directorships of enterprises. Although there are about 25,000 Bulgarians in Yugoslavia, you can find them in the highest posts in the economic sector and state administration. In Serbia, each deputy represents on average 50,000 electors, yet a Bulgarian is a deputy in the Serbian Skupshtina, even though the Bulgarians only have one-third of the necessary votes. The Bulgarians in Serbia are clever people and are against living in the ghetto that individual chauvinist nationalists want to drive them into. The length to which their so- called "champions" are prepared to go is simply ludicrous. I recently read somewhere that they [Bulgarians in Serbia] are deprived of their own language even in the churches in Serbia. If one follows this logic, the Serbs are threatened as well, because the language used in religion is Church Slavonic. It is not good to claim, in these bad times that the Serbian people are experiencing, that the Bulgarian minority is threatened in the Serbian state. I have yet to read in the press here that Bulgarians living as a minority in any other land have greater rights than in Serbia and are more satisfied with their lives. I will not raise any other issues, because I do not want to create difficulties for our Bulgarian brothers; it is quite enough that others are making difficulties for them. [Kulinski] How do you assess relations between Sofia and Belgrade? [Smilkovic] Our relations are good, but not what they could and should be between two neighboring states and peoples. There is a widespread view and feeling among the people of Yugoslavia, especially in Serbia, that compared with similar situations that have arisen during this century -- this is already the third blockade of Serbia, relations between Bulgarians and Serbs have never been better. The statements by Bulgarian leaders and citizens protesting against the air strikes on the Serbian positions in Sarajevo and calling for peace talks to end the war had a good reception. The rally in Sofia was regarded in both the Yugoslav republics as the voice of reason, as a warning to the gods of war. The links between our two peoples are very deep, because we have been living side by side from time immemorial. They cannot be severed by any blockades. Since cooperation and dialogue has not been broken off among the people, it should not cease between our leaderships either. The country of Yugoslavia is open to any kind of democratic dialogue and cooperation, and I am here to help in ensuring that our cooperation is intensive and fruitful. [passage omitted]
