U.S. President Bill Clinton's letters to Athens and Ankara make it clear that pressure will increase for an overall solution to the uncertainties in the area, according to the interests of Washington. Corresponding pressure is also unfolding from large European countries that are strongly interested in developments in the Balkans. In this climate, Turkey returns to the Balkans with its military as a regulating factor, 80 years after the Balkan wars of 1912-13, which resulted in Turkey's expulsion from European territory. Within the above climate, Athens appears to insist against Greek military intervention in the crisis of the former Yugoslavia. That decision was correct when it was first made by the entire political leadership, because it declared that all Balkan countries should stay away from a military engagement. As a result, that decision limited the Balkan countries to diplomatic efforts, in which Athens maintains a significant advantage over Turkey and the other neighboring countries. However, there is already a huge change in the facts: Ankara secured the dispatch of Turkish peacekeepers to the crisis point. Therefore, Turkey has reinforced its greater political role in the region. The change of developments since the initial decision against Greece's engagement in the crisis should lead to the reexamination of the whole problem. That is because Turkey is now present in the crisis. Following this, do we still believe that Greece should be absent? [passage omitted] These facts lead to the conclusion that, despite the popularity of the decision for no military engagement and despite the unpopularity of a decision to send Greek peacekeepers, the whole problem should be reexamined from the beginning in light of new developments. [passage omitted] That is because things have now reached a critical point: The role that Greece will play in the greater area in the coming years is now at stake. What is at stake is the position Greece will take as new arrangements in the Balkans are decided and imposed. What is at stake is the special weight that Greece will have in the area in relation to Turkey and also in relation to the other countries of the region. From an initial examination, for Greece to stay in the proceedings and not on the sidelines, it should not be absent from the peacekeeping force at a time when Turkey will be present. Because if Greece does not participate with its military now, who will take Athens' view into account later at the diplomatic front? And how will Greece avoid decisions for arrangements without its presence and against its interests?
