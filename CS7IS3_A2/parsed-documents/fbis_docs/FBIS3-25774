It repealed a 1986 ban on oil exports and oil shipments and other economic sanctions imposed in 1987 to help remove apartheid. Norway said developments in South Africa and plans for elections in April this year had made sanctions obsolete. Another contributing factor was the United Nations General Assembly resolution last October in which member nations were urged to follow African national Congress leader Nelson Mandela's request to end sanctions. Norway was one of the first countries to impose sanctions against South Africa and to give aid to the African National Congress.
