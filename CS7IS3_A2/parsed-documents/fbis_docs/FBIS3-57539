The next stage -- the first in the new year -- in the elimination of armored hardware has begun at the tank-repair plant in Borisov. It will last through 24 February. It is planned to cut up 92 tanks and approximately 50 infantry fighting vehicles for scrap metal and to re-equip them for use in the national economy. The work is being monitored by a group of NATO military inspectors.
