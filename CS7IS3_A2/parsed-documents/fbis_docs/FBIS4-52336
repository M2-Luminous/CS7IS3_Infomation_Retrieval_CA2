On 11 March the Ministry of Finance [MOF], at its bank department chief-sponsored "Seminar on Enhancing Liquidity of Loans," presented detailed plans for use by city bank officials to facilitate the disposal of real estate used as collateral for bad loans. The detailed plans involve the disposal of bad loans through establishment by financial institutions of wholly owned subsidiaries to specialize in placement of sole bids for collateralized real estate. According to an attendee at the seminar, the MOF is expected to approve the first "sole-bidder subsidiary" as early as May. Under the MOF plan, this "sole-bidder subsidiary" would use the sole-bidder system of the courts, hold and administer the acquired real estate for a specified period and then resell the property. In addition to enhancing the liquidity of collateralized real estate, the real estate purchased by the subsidiary can be redeveloped to prevent a further drop in value of the collateralized real estate. The ultimate advantage of establishing a sole-bidder subsidiary by financial institutions is that any collateral property placed on auction will be sold. According to a source at a city bank, "There's a major advantage in being able to dispose of collateralized real estate on bad loans where claims are legally complex." Properties purchased by subsidiaries will be removed from the balance sheets of parent companies and will result in progress in the disposition of bad loans. However, it appears that many financial institutions assume a cautious posture on the question of actually establishing a sole-bidder subsidiary, saying, "We will examine the idea carefully upon issuance of the MOF circular. An official of a trust bank expresses doubt, saying, "The process has definite appeal, but disposal through auctions is too time-consuming." There's also the view that, "if it takes one or two years to dispose of bad loans which we hope to sell at an early date, there's the risk of upsetting our plans." Even if the MOF circular is issued, establishment of subsidiaries will require a preparatory period and the view is that subsidiaries will not begin to operate until after summer. Sources point out that "there is little potential for successful bids by subsidiaries on property already out for auction, thus making it impossible to dispose of property in time for the September midyear accounting reports." Moreover, the subsidiaries will be allowed to bid for collateralized real estate of parent banks for a period of only five years and the subsidiaries will be limited to a lifespan of 10 years. There's also the problem of limitations in the scope of activities allowed. In contrast to the MOF plan to approve activities to facilitate disposal of real property, such as the purchase of contiguous land, improvement of parcels, and completion of construction in progress, the Fair Trade Commission seeks to impose restrictions on the MOF plan in view of the "need to limit activities of the subsidiaries to clearly distinguish them from regular real estate businesses." If the subsidiaries are allowed to redevelop real estate which they purchased through the sole-bidder process, it would facilitate the disposal of such properties. If they are not allowed to redevelop properties, then the result may well be that "the subsidiaries will not be able to sell properties and will incur holding costs since they were properties that no one wanted to begin with." The question is whether the subsidiaries going to become major players following the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company? The financial institutions are in the process of considering the MOF-proposed special-purpose company (SPC) format for the purpose of establishing liquidity in loans on which interest payments have been eliminated or reduced, but it appears that all these concepts merely expand the "options" for bad debt disposal without ensuring any meaningful progress.
