The new realities of the modern world have resulted in the emergence of new opportunities for the states of the Asia-Pacific region relative to Russia in view of: its role in possible elimination of tension on the Korean Peninsula; negotiations between Moscow and Tokyo over the future of four islands in the Kuril archipelago that would have been unimaginable literally just a few years ago; the clear interest by South Korea, Japan and, to some extent, China in relations with Siberia and the Russian Far East, which they believe with their investments could become a new source of economic growth in Asia; and reduction of Russia's armed forces and military presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Analysis indicates that on the whole Russia's role as the subject and object of policy in the region has shifted from a leading role to one on a par with Australia, Taiwan or South Korea. This was the inevitable result, of the one hand, of the disintegration of the USSR and, on the other, of policy by the Russian MFA that is not adequate to the newly emerging conditions of the international situation. In addition, the states in the region remain somewhat cautious with regard to Russia's political future. Much greater concern currently exists due to the fact that one now finds a paradoxical situation in the Asia-Pacific region as a result of lessening East-West confrontation: disarmament by the great powers is prompting efforts by the smaller states to arm, negatively affecting security in the region. What is the reason for this paradoxical situation, in which not a single state in the region has taken advantage of the peace dividend to reduce its defense expenditures? One must define several of the most significant factors. The first is economic conflicts within the Asia-Pacific region. The unequal economic development of states in the region contributes to a certain degree to tensions based on envy -- North Korea, Cambodia and the Philippines have found themselves left out of economic prosperity. Distrust and hostility in relations between the United States and Japan have tremendous destructive potential, due to American dissatisfaction over the closed nature of the Japanese market, the Japanese economic invasion of the United States, and tax evasion or failure to pay taxes by Japanese companies operating in the United States. It has been asserted that over the long term a possible emotional gap could tear apart the Washington-Tokyo alliance and replace it with keen competition which would undoubtedly impact other Asian countries and the region's security as well. There is a fairly great likelihood that economic and consequently political disputes will arise between the states that comprise the "Asian economic realm," the North American free trade zone (NAFTA) and the European Union. Even now East Asia accounts for 62 percent of world automotive production, 82 percent of telecommunications manufacturing and 81 percent of computer equipment production. According to a projection by the Japanese Center for Economic Research made in February 1992, by the year 2010 the "Asian economic realm," extending from eastern Russia to Myanmar and including both Australia and New Zealand, is expected to be producing as many goods and services as North and South America combined. Asia's overall GNP will be $11.8 trillion, in comparison with $11.2 trillion for North and South America and $11.4 trillion for Western Europe. In 2010 prices Japan alone will have a GNP of $16 trillion, or 84 percent of the U.S. GNP. In this situation it is very likely that there will be sharp competition, particularly between East Asia and NAFTA, and that could significantly affect stability in the region. Another group of disputes stem from the struggle for political leadership in Asia and the various concomitant manifestations of various peoples' national consciousness. We are beginning to see the prospect of a Greater China being formed through a merger of the PRC's economically developed coastal provinces with the economies of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. Eventually Greater China could become the main force capable of opposing the Japanese economic battering ram. In South Korea there are some politicians and business people who dream of a "Greater Korea." They believe that after reunification Korea could become one of the most important economic zones in the world, with the one million ethnic Koreans in China and the approximately 300,000 in Russia added to Korea's population of 70 million. They also include the surrounding Chinese and Russian population, coming up with the possibility of creating a demographic base of 200 million people and, consequently, a new center for the Asian economy. The question is how fast Korean unification can proceed. Considering Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, it is possible that the agreement reached by North and South Korea in December 1991 regarding nuclear-free status for the Korean Peninsula, economic exchanges, rapprochement and unification might not be implemented. On the other hand, politicians literally break out in a cold sweat at the thought of a unified Korea with nuclear weapons. Furthermore, much remains unclear about how North Korea will behave after Kim Il-Song is gone. A certain degree of unclarity exists concerning China's political outlook in the post-Deng Xiaoping era. Specifically, analysts are considering the possibility of political instability and disorder in China, as a result of which a flood of refugees could pour into the Southeast Asian countries. However, there are clear signals that although there are fairly serious disagreements and a certain degree of ideological instability within the Chinese Communist Party -- China's ruling party -- Chinese communists are united against the threat of disorder, anarchy and spontaneous disintegration of their country. However, the Chinese leadership understands the needs for accelerated reforms in the economy, as successes in that area would undoubtedly be a factor in the stability of Chinese society. Therefore one may assume with a fair degree of certainty that though there might be some retrenchment after Deng Xiaoping due to a stronger position for the conservative political wing of the Chinese leadership, it is likely that this would be followed by stronger reformist tendencies. One significant factor is the current state and outlook for development of Russo-Chinese relations. Here no struggle for leadership is at issue. Geopolitical interests -- mutual efforts to ensure the security of borders, a need to ensure favorable external conditions so that reforms can be implemented, Beijing's interest in Russian economy and military capability, reduction of the two sides' armed forces and armaments, stronger confidence-building measures, Russia's interest in developing economic and military relations with China, and, finally, a certain mutual attraction in the search for a counterweight against the West's political offensive -- all prompt Russia and China to seek means of rapprochement. One significant obstacle to the development of relations could be a possible upsurge in Chinese nationalism and the pro-Western slant which, in the opinion of the Chinese, exists in Russia's policy. A significant negative role could also be played by the personality factor when members of the "Cultural Revolution" generation come to power in China. However, both sides are interested in developing economic cooperation. That interest is reinforced by mutual pragmatism, as a result of which certain differences on various issues would not likely be allowed to stand in the way. Much remains unclear regarding Sino-American relations. China, in its effort to assume an appropriate place in the new world political structure, has unofficially accepted a mission as leader of the developing countries. In the opinion of Chinese political scientists, the disintegration of the USSR is a fait accompli and the USSR will never be reborn. Meanwhile, according to them, the United States, which remains the sole superpower in the world, is losing influence. China is outraged by the fact that since the collapse of the USSR the United States feels that it has a right to intervene in the internal affairs of other countries and impose its own values. China believes that the new world order should be based on fair political and economic principles in order to prevent a widening of the gap between a wealthy North and an impoverished South. Nevertheless, China definitely does not intend to get into an open confrontation with the United States. It remains interested in developing relations with the leading Western countries because it needs new technology and investment. In the opinion of Chinese political scientists, the fact that in the future global disputes may develop along West-West lines (between the United States, Western Europe and Japan) could give Beijing greater room for political and diplomatic maneuvering. It is quite possible that as disputes between the various sides become more numerous their relations will be typified by ever-increasing harshness. It is also possible that the United States, in its usual forceful manner, might attempt to force China to behave in a way that is advantageous to the United States. How successful the Americans are in doing so would largely depend on Russia's position.
