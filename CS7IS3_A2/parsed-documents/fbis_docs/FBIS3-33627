This statement was made on 10 February by the UN expert on drug affairs and agricultural development, Iban de Rementeria, who said the change in the antidrug strategy announced on 9 February by U.S. President Bill Clinton represents a "complete change in U.S. antidrug policy." De Rementeria said: "Since 1904 the United States has maintained that drugs are a foreign problem. This is the first time they have admitted it is a domestic problem. This is a step forward because they admit that it is a health and educational problem and not just a police issue." The UN official believes this change of attitude regarding the drug problem was promoted by the failure of the U.S. administration's antidrug policy, which during the past few years cost more than $10 billion per year. "Drug consumption in the United States has really not dropped. During the past six years the number of consumers has remained more or less the same," he said as he commented that it is estimated there are 10 million cocaine and marijuana addicts in the United States. In referring to Clinton's new strategy, de Rementeria said: "We must not have illusions because we remain alone in this field." From his viewpoint, the importance of reducing or substituting coca crops has become a secondary issue. De Rementeria added: "I do not see how we can plan an alternative development program with the current international agricultural policies if the GATT Uruguay Round has institutionalized subsidies in developed countries and this condemns agriculture in the Third World to failure."
