According to a statement by the information service, Colonel Engelen, the chief of staff of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] command for the northeast, who mediated in the organization of the meeting, today sent the following letter to Major General Novica Simic, the commander of the eastern Bosnian corps of the republic of Srpska army: ``1. Although General Hazim Sadic, commander of the 2d Corps of the Bosnian Army, wants to meet you as soon as possible, his government has ordered him to cancel his earlier acceptance of the meeting. This will be dealt with at the highest level. "2. This is why we suggest that the meeting scheduled for 1300 on 7 May be postponed until further notice." The information service statement, also forwarded to TANJUG, says that "this latest refusal to negotiate on the part of the extremist Muslim leaders in Sarajevo clearly shows that they are in favor of the war option, that they want to procrastinate with the negotiations as long as possible, and that they will not give up on the planned and prepared offensive against the town of Brcko and Serbian Posavina." As Gen. Simic told TANJUG today, the talks were to focus on a cease-fire on the Brcko battlefield, exchange of prisoners, the unhindered passage of civilians, and the establishment of the so-called hot line.
