FBIS4-52478 "dreas091_a_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Kato: U.S. Criticism of Tax Plans `Strange' Kato: U.S. Criticism of Tax Plans `Strange' OW1005095594 Tokyo KYODO in English 0940 GMT 10 May 94 OW1005095594 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- The head of the government tax commission, Kan Kato, blasted Tuesday [10 May] as "strange" U.S. criticism of Japanese plans to cut income taxes and raise consumption taxes. It is "simplistic" to argue that writing a later consumption tax hike into the same legislation that cuts income taxes will hurt the economy and erase the boost the tax cut should bring, Kato told a regular news conference after a meeting of the commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister. "The American way of thinking is strange," said Kato, a professor emeritus of economics at Keio University. U.S. officials have complained about the idea of linking tax cuts and hikes, saying the knowledge of a coming tax hike would psychologically cancel the effect of the cut. But Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen recently indicated the United States would endorse a linked tax plan if the two measures were separated by a "substantial time." Washington wants Tokyo to cut taxes first to boost domestic demand and thus curb Japan's huge trade surplus. But fiscal conservatives led by the powerful Finance Ministry insist that the offsetting financing be locked in before the government cuts taxes. Earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata vowed to the tax commission that he will continue his predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa's tax overhaul agenda, including "permanent income tax cuts." He asked the commission to flesh out its detailed tax overhaul report next month as planned, "based on the pillar of lessening personal income taxes and fulfilling taxation on consumption." Hata renewed Hosokawa's vow of submitting the tax reform plan, based on the options proposed by the panel, to parliament by the end of next month and enacting the legislation this year, with "the cooperation and understanding of the various parties." To meet the panel's deadline, Kato said, the members must consolidate the thrust of their proposals by the end of this month to allow time for public hearings throughout the country before compiling the final June report. Hata asked the panel to "treat the request of former Prime Minister Hosokawa as my request." Hosokawa had also said Japan's net tax burden must grow to meet the coming needs of the nation's graying society. But Kato said a net tax increase has not emerged as a consensus view in the panel, although some members favor an overall increase in taxation for social welfare spending. Kato also confirmed that some members argue for a multi-rate consumption tax, that would tax such necessities as food at a lower rate than other items. But he said it has not emerged as a formal panel option, as reported Tuesday in the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN.
