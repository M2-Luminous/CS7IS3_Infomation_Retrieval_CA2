The demonstration, which will include more than 4,000 people, will be staged on 9 June, Raymundo del Toro, of the Cuban-American Peace Committee, reported by telephone from New Jersey. Del Toro told this agency that they expect the participation of clergymen, friends of Cuba, and Cubans residing in this country, who will also send letters to the Capitol and call the White House to demand an end to the economic measures. The participants, he added, will pay for their own transportation to Washington to support Rangel's bill, which has been debated in several committees of the House of Representatives since 17 March as a free trade initiative. The fate of Rangel's initiative, which is supported by more than 30 congressmen, is expected to be known by 9 June, Del Toro pointed out. The demonstration, he said, is promoted by various organizations such as the Cuban Information Project, the so-called International Peace for Cuba [Internacional Paz para Cuba], the Pastors for Peace Motorcade, the House of the Americas, and the Cuban American Committee of Washington, among others. In the United States there are currently more than 62 organizations affiliated with a national network of solidarity with Cuba, which has organized several actions to oppose the blockade that has cost the island $40 billion since 1962. The growing movement of solidarity with Cuba has resulted in three motorcades carrying humanitarian aid, construction brigades, and actions to defy a ban on travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens, among other activities.
