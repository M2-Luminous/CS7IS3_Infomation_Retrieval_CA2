"The root cause of corruption is corporate donations," he told a news conference. "I believe it is necessary to limit the flow of corporate and organizational funds to a political party and forbid one to individual lawmakers." The SDP is the largest grouping within the seven-party coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. His remarks indicate the SDP cannot accept a call from the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to ease the planned ban on corporate donations to individual legislators. The coalition and the LDP are likely to begin formal negotiations on possible modifications to government-sponsored political reform bills, which cleared the House of Representatives in November but were rejected by the House of Councillors on Friday [21 January]. The package, aimed at rooting out rampant political graft, features introduction of single-seat constituencies with proportional representation in lower house elections and stricter curbs on campaign funding. The coalition and the LDP have been far apart on the balance between single-seat districts and proportional representation as well as the ban on corporate and organizational donations to individual politicians. Murayama also ruled out the possibility that Hosokawa will dissolve the lower house for a snap general election if he fails in his promise to realize reform before the current Diet session ends January 29. "If the lower house is dissolved amid this serious economic slump, it will create a political vacuum," the SDP chairman said, adding the matter should be taken into consideration at least after the formulation of the national budget for fiscal 1994, starting April 1. Meanwhile, a group of 19 out of 20 SDP upper house legislators who voted against the government package or abstained from the voting last week said Tuesday they had formed a group intent on leading parliamentary debate to place priority on enacting antigraft provisions rather than on proposals to revamp Japan's electoral system. The group said they will not send a representative to a 20-member consultative panel comprising legislators from both houses, a panel that may produce a compromise version of the reform package. Seventeen SDP members voted against the bills and three others abstained from voting at an upper house plenary session Friday.
