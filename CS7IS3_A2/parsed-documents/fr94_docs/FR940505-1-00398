FR940505-1-00398 FR940505-1-00012 (3) Standards. (i) Gasoline Transfer Into Stationary Storage Tanks (Phase I). An owner/operator shall not transfer, permit the transfer or provide equipment for the transfer of gasoline into from any tank truck, trailer or railroad car into any stationary storage tank with a capacity of 950 liters (251 gallons) or more unless all of the following conditions are met: (A) Such tank is equipped with a permanent submerged fill tube. (B) Such tank is equipped with a CARB certified vapor recovery system at, or above 95 percent control efficiency, which is maintained and operated according to the manufacturers specifications. (C) All vapor return lines are connected between the tank truck, trailer or railroad tank car, and the stationary storage tank and all associated hoses, fittings, and couplings are maintained in a vapor tight condition. (D) The hatch on any tank truck, trailer, or railroad tank car shall not be opened for more than three minutes for each visual inspection, provided that: ( 1 ) Transfer or pumping has been stopped for at least 3 minutes prior to opening; and ( 2 ) The hatch is closed before transfer or pumping is resumed. (E) Underground tank lines are gravity drained, and above-ground tanks are equipped with dry breaks such that upon line disconnect the liquid leak rate does not exceed 3 drops per minute. (F) As of [Insert date of publication of the final rule], an owner/operator shall not install a coaxial Phase I vapor recovery system at a gasoline dispensing facility unless the Phase I system was certified after January 1, 1994. In addition, an owner/operator shall not install a Phase I vapor recovery system unless that system incorporates certified poppetted drybreaks or spring-loaded vapor check valves on the vapor return coupler of the system. (G) As of one year after [Insert date of publication of the final rule], all open vent pipes on stationary tanks at gasoline dispensing facilities shall be equipped with a pressure-vacuum relief valve. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable CARB executive order, pressure relief shall be set at 3 inches water column and vacuum relief shall be set at 8 inches water column. For the purposes of this paragraph (j), vent pipes of gasoline storage tanks may be manifolded to a single valve when the storage tanks are manifolded according to the applicable CARB executive order. (H) As of [Insert date of publication of the final rule], any time a gasoline storage tank or associated piping is replaced or installed this spill box must be equiped with an intregal vapor-tight drain valve to return spilled gasoline to the storage tank. (I) Equipment subject to this paragraph (j) is operated and maintained, according to all of the following requirements: ( 1 ) All fill tubes are equipped with vapor-tight covers, including gaskets; ( 2 ) All dry breaks are equipped with vapor-tight seals and dust covers; ( 3 ) Fixed or Spring-Loaded coaxial fill tubes are operated so that there is no obstruction of vapor passage from the storage tank back to the tank truck, trailer, or railroad tank car; ( 4 ) The fill tube assembly, including fill tube, fittings and gaskets, is maintained to prevent vapor leakage from any portion of the vapor recovery system; ( 5 ) All storage tank vapor return lines without dry breaks are equipped with vapor-tight covers, including gaskets. (ii) Gasoline Transfer Into Vehicle Fuel Tanks (Phase II). An owner/operator shall not transfer, or permit the transfer, or provide equipment for the transfer of gasoline from a stationary storage tank into any motor vehicle fuel tank of greater than 19 liters (5 gallons) capacity unless all of the following conditions are met: (A) The dispensing unit used to transfer the gasoline from the stationary storage tank to the motor vehicle fuel tank is equipped with a CARB certified vapor recovery system. (B) The vapor recovery system and associated components are operated and maintained in a vapor-tight and liquid-tight manner in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications and the applicable CARB certification. (C) As of [Insert date of publication of the final rule], an owner/operator shall not install any balance system vapor recovery nozzle unless a vapor check valve is located in the nozzle. In addition, a balance system shall not be operated with more than one check valve per nozzle and hose assembly. (D) As of one year after [Insert date of publication of the final rule], the nominal inside diameter of the connection between the riser and dispenser cabinet shall not be less than 0.75 inches. If flexible tubing is used for this connection, the material shall be listed for use with gasoline and shall be capable of maintaining electrical continuity between the riser and dispenser. (E) As of one year after [Insert date of publication of the final rule], an owner/operator shall not sell, offer for sale, or install a bellows-equipped vapor recovery nozzle unless it is equipped with a certified insertion interlock mechanism. (F) As of one year after [Insert date of publication of the final rule], an owner/operator shall not install or operate a vapor recovery nozzle unless it is equipped with a coaxial hose. (G) As of one year after [Insert date of publication of the final rule], all liquid removal devices required by CARB executive orders shall be maintained to achieve a minimum liquid removal rate of five milliliters per gallon transferred. This standard shall apply at dispensing rates exceeding five gallons per minute, unless a higher removal rate is specified by the Executive Order. (H) As of [Insert date of publication of the final rule], any gasoline storage or dispensing facility that commences alterations or repairs shall comply with the equipment standards of paragraphs (j)(3)(ii) (C) through (G) of this section. (I) Equipment subject to this section shall be operated and maintained with none of the following defects: ( 1 ) Absence or disconnection of any component required to be used in the CARB executive order(s) that certified the system.
