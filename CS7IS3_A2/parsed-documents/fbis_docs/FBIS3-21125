Looks Into Westinghouse Participation in Power Plant Design 94FE0279B Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 9 Dec 93 p 10 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0279B Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Text] On 8 December the Japan Atomic Power Company revealed that it is considering having the U.S. company Westinghouse participate in the detailed design and equipment manufacturing for its Tsuruga NPP III and NPP IV (output: 1,420,000 kW each) planned for construction at Tsuruga City in Fukui Prefecture. Japan Atomic Power is taking positive action to ease U.S.-Japan trade friction in the electric power industry by importing gas turbines, etc., from the U.S. Participation by Westinghouse in this project, which has a projected total construction cost of one trillion yen, should alleviate some of the trade friction. Tsuruga NPPs III and IV will use a modified PWR reactor with increased output and better safety devices. The reactor is based on the modified reactor developed jointly by five electric power companies including Kansai Electric Power, Kyushu Electric Power, Japan Atomic Power, etc., and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Westinghouse, and the national government. Because of its past involvement, Japan Atomic Power is considering asking Westinghouse to participate. However, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is scheduled to be the main contractor, and Yutaka Kurihara (executive director, Japan Atomic Power) says, ``Westinghouse will not receive half the work load.'' The U.S. company General Electric and Hitachi, Ltd., have each received one-third of the orders for the Kashiwazaki Kariwa NPPs VI and VII (output: 1,350,000 kW each) being build by Tokyo Electric Power. It appears that Japan Atomic Power has learned from this example in considering the participation of a U.S. company. On site coordination has not been completed for Tsuruga NPPs III and IV, so the date construction will begin is still undecided. Because construction will take at least 4.5 years, these NPPs will begin operation after the turn of the century.
