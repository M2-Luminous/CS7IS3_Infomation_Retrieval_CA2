FR941207-1-00017 FR941207-1-00006 The land-managing agencies and tribes estimate a total of 3,100,000 ha (7,666,000 acres) of suitable Mexican spotted owl habitat within the United States. These estimates of habitat availability for nesting and roosting activity are derived from median figures where estimates were given as an acreage range and include capable habitat estimates where available. The approximate proportion of Mexican spotted owl habitat in the Southwest is: Forest Service, 68 percent; Tribal, 14 percent; BLM, 10 percent; NPS, 4 percent; the States of Arizona and New Mexico, 2 percent; and private lands, 2 percent. The percentage of habitat for each category of ownership is considered fairly accurate. However, the total acreage of owl habitat is likely overestimated. The error is a consequence of inadequate information on land status and questions about the types of vegetative communities that provide owl habitat. Several agencies expressed uncertainty about the accuracy of their habitat estimates. The Service estimates that there is approximately 2,425,000 ha (5,988,000 acres) of owl habitat suitable for nesting and roosting. This estimate excludes most of the ponderosa pine community type because this vegetation type is not significantly used by nesting and roosting Mexican spotted owls. However, the Forest Service does consider ponderosa pine forest to be suitable habitat when it has the correct structural attributes (K.W. Fletcher, Forest Service Southwest Region, pers. comm., 1992), but the forest stand maps and inventory databases do not separate suitable from unsuitable stands in ponderosa pine. Forest Service Mexican spotted owl inventory data place approximately 50 MTs in ponderosa pine habitat, which would add about 40,000 ha (100,000 acres) to the suitable habitat base in Arizona and New Mexico (Forest Service, in litt. 1992). Definition of Critical Habitat The Service is required to base critical habitat proposals upon the best scientific and commercial data available and after taking into consideration the economic impact, and any other relevant impact, of specifying any particular area as critical habitat. The Service may exclude areas from critical habitat designation when the benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of including the areas within critical habitat, provided the exclusion will not result in the extinction of the species (Section 4(b)(2) of the Act). Critical habitat is defined in Section 3(5)(A) of the Act as: ``(i) the specific areas within the geographic area occupied by a species .␣.␣. on which are found those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation of the species, and (II) that may require special management considerations or protection; and (ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed .␣.␣. upon a determination by the Secretary that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.'' The term ``conservation,'' as defined in Section 3(3) of the Act, means ``.␣.␣. to use and the use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring any endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this Act are no longer necessary,'' i.e., the species is recovered and can be removed from the list of endangered and threatened species. Role in Species Conservation Proposed designation of critical habitat includes areas subject to commercial timber harvest, the primary threat to the species. The Service considers the protections that result from the listing of the species as threatened, such as the jeopardy prohibition under section 7 and the prohibition of take under section 9 of the Act, to be adequate protection in areas where other, localized threats may be present. The use of the term ``conservation'' in the definition of critical habitat indicates that its designation should identify lands that may be needed for a species' eventual recovery and delisting. However, when critical habitat is proposed or designated at the time a species is listed, the Service frequently does not know precisely what may be needed for recovery. In this regard, critical habitat serves to preserve options for a species' eventual recovery. The Service is continuing to work with the Recovery Team to determine those areas and management approaches considered necessary for the recovery and conservation of the species.
