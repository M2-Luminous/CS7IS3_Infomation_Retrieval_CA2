According to the report broadcast on Thursday [23 June], genuine visas from the embassy are available on the street from middle men for prices ranging from 4,000 to 10,000 marks. Contrary to regulations, the applicant does not even have to go to the embassy to get the entry stamp. The corruptibility of embassy staff in Iran and in other countries was on the records of German courts and authorities, it was said. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said that his department had no evidence of visa trading of this kind. If the television program had suggestions or evidence that proved the involvement of the German Embassy in this sort of dealing, then it was their duty to inform the Foreign Ministry to enable them to clear up the matter.
