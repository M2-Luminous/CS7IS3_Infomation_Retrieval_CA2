FR940728-1-00029 FR940728-1-00010 In the alternative, EPA has the option to wait until after the moderate area attainment date, December 31, 1994, and then proceed under section 188(b)(2) of the Act. This provision requires EPA to determine by June 30, 1995 whether the PPA attained the PM 10 standard by December 31, 1994. If the Agency finds that the PPA is not in attainment after that date, the area is reclassified by operation of law as a serious area. If the PPA is reclassified under the section 188(b)(2) procedure, the State would have to submit the serious area attainment demonstration within 18 months after reclassification. See section 189(b)(2). 9 9 It should be noted that when a moderate area is reclassified under either section 188(b)(1) or (b)(2), the State is required, within 18 months after reclassification, to submit provisions to assure that best available control measures (BACM) for the control of PM 10 shall be implemented no later than four years after reclassification. For additional specific requirements relating to all serious PM 10 areas, and to those serious areas seeking an extension of the attainment date, see section 189 of the Act. EPA believes that there are advantages to pursuing reclassification under section 188(b)(2) and that the circumstances here justify such an approach. Under section 188(b)(1), the State would initially develop its BACM determination in the absence of an attainment demonstration with the potential result that the chosen measures would not ultimately attain the PM 10 standards by the applicable attainment date. Such a result, however, would not be revealed until several years later, when the air quality modeling analysis is conducted for the attainment demonstration. If, at that point, additional measures are found to be necessary for the area to attain the PM 10 NAAQS, new measures would have to be developed, adopted and submitted to EPA. In contrast, under section 188(b)(2), all the required elements of the serious area plan must be submitted to EPA within 18 months of reclassification. Thus, under section 188(b)(2), the process of attaining the PM 10 standards is expedited. Furthermore, it should be noted that the State originally concluded that the PPA could not practicably attain the PM 10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994 when it developed its November 1991 plan submission. Despite procedural delays and plan updates culminating in the 1993 and 1994 SIP submittals, this conclusion has not changed. Therefore, the State has been on notice for almost three years that reclassification was likely. Moreover, the moderate attainment date is now only several months away. EPA's current view is that under these circumstances, a delay of four years for the submission of a serious area attainment demonstration is unwarranted. Rather, the Agency believes that it is more appropriate to accelerate, to the maximum extent possible, the submission of a complete plan to attain the PM 10 NAAQS. For the reasons set forth above, it is EPA's current intention to proceed under section 188(b)(2) as soon after December 31, 1994 as the Agency has the air quality data and other relevant information to determine whether the PPA has attained the NAAQS. In spite of the above analysis, however, EPA recognizes that there may be valid reasons to be advanced in favor of EPA's invoking its discretionary authority to reclassify the PPA at this time pursuant to section 188(b)(1). As a result, EPA is in this notice proposing to reclassify the PPA as a serious nonattainment area. However, in the absence of a compelling justification from the public during the comment period, EPA does not intend to take final action on this proposal. 10 If EPA does not take final action on this proposal, the Agency will proceed under section 188(b)(2) after December 31, 1994. 10 If EPA does take final action on this proposal, the change in classification will appear in 40 CFR 81.303. 6. PM 10 Precursors The control requirements which are applicable to major stationary sources of PM 10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM 10 precursors, unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels in excess of the NAAQS in that area. See section 189(e) of the Act. An analysis of air quality and emissions data for the PPA nonattainment area indicates that exceedances of the NAAQS are attributable chiefly to direct particulate matter emissions from re-entrained dust from paved roads and exhaust from gasoline and diesel powered vehicles. Sources of particulate matter precursor emissions of ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate contribute only 3 percent to the total annual emissions of PM 10 . Consequently, EPA is proposing to find that major sources of precursors of PM 10 do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels in excess of the NAAQS. The consequence of this finding is to exclude these sources from the applicability of PM 10 moderate nonattainment area control requirements. Further discussion of the analyses and supporting rationale for EPA's finding are contained in the TSD accompanying this notice. Note that while EPA is making a general finding for this area, today's finding is based on the current character of the area including, for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. EPA intends to issue future guidance addressing such potential changes in the significance of precursor emissions in an area. It should be noted, however, that if the PPA is reclassified as a serious PM 10 nonattainment area, the State will be required to determine in its BACM analysis whether PM 10 precursors contribute significantly 11 to ambient concentrations of PM 10 . 11 A source category in a serious PM 10 nonattainment area will be presumed to be significant if its contribution to a violation of the 24 hour PM 10 NAAQS exceeds 5 μg/m3 or if its contribution to a violation of the annual NAAQS exceeds 1 μg/m3 (Memorandum from Joseph W. Paisie, Chief, SO 2 /Particulate Matters Programs Branch, ``PM&hyph;10 Serious Area Guidance: Final Staff Work Product'' (September 24, 1993). For the moderate area RACM analysis, there is no presumptive level of significance; the determination is made on a case by case basis. See 57 FR 13539. 7. Enforceability Issues The particular control measures contained in the SIP revision for the PPA are addressed above under the section entitled ``RACM (including RACT).'' These control measures apply to the types of PM 10 emission sources identified in that discussion including, for example, dust on paved roadways, construction and demolition activities, unpaved roads, farming operations, uncovered haul trucks, prescribed burning, process industries, and nonmetallic mineral mining and processing. All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by EPA and the State. See sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A) and 57 FR 13556. The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions are stated in a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. See 57 FR 13541. The TSD for this notice contains detailed information on enforceability requirements including applicability, enforceable emission limitations, the source types subject to the rules, test methods and compliance schedules as appropriate, averaging times for compliance test methods, and reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Only enforceability issues meriting particular attention are addressed in this notice. Rule 310 contains a section which EPA believes threatens the enforceability of the rule. Section 221 of the rule lists the reasonably available control measures that a source can use in reducing PM 10 emissions. These measures are all consistent with EPA recommended measures with the exception of section 221.9, which authorizes ``Other means approved by the Control Officer.'' This provision of the rule enables the Control Officer to approve alternative measures that may not meet the enforceability and other approvability criteria established by EPA.
