The actual building of these highways is expected to take about twenty years. Industry Minister Gerard Longuet is expected to have an announcement on the subject at the next Council of Ministers. On 22 February, at the conclusion of an interministerial committee meeting on advance preparations for the vast information highway project, the prime minister formally launched implementation of an industrial project that will take 15 to 20 years to complete. It will be one of the most ambitious undertakings of the decade to come, as its realization will require great perseverance on the part of all the governments that will be called on to support it beyond the year 2000. Edouard Balladur took the first step by naming Gerard Thery, former director general of telecommunications (today France Telecom), to head a study mission. Thery's mission is to propose, by the end of April 1994, a timetable along with a juridical, financial, and technical framework covering everything involved in the building of information highways. The task first of all involves studying, forecasting, and organizing the harmonization of telecommunications and audiovisual media, and conducting experiments on images broadcast on France Telecom's telephone network and distribution of telephone communications on cable networks. The experiments to be conducted will oblige cable operators, at least initially and for as long as the monopoly lasts, to connect up with the France Telecom network. Several Necessities The launching of such a project responds to a variety of necessities: First, international economic necessities. Since Bill Clinton came into office, the United States has embarked on a vast regulatory reform that has stimulated and focused the country's industrial apparatus as a whole. Telephone companies, cable operators, and computer companies are merging and investing massively to prepare for the information superhighways that will pave the way for an interactive, multimedia world. The advance the United States has in this domain compels all developed countries to take action, to avoid being left behind. Second, European necessities. Following up on the report of the Commission of the European Communities, which in 1992 noted the inadequacy of new telephone service offerings and disparities in rates throughout Europe, the Council of Ministers of the European Union decreed a plan to liberalize the telephone sector starting 1 January 1998. As of that date, and despite the presence of monopolies in the telecommunications sector, private operators will be able to lease capacities on publicly owned infrastructure and use them or market them as they best see fit. Liberalization is expected to be complete before the year 2000. In its recent white paper on growth, the Brussels Commission also confirmed the great potential of multimedia markets expected to see strong growth between now and the year 2000--10 percent per year for audiovisual and 8 percent per year for telephone services. At that rate of growth, they would boost Europe's GDP by 10 percent by the end of the century. Third, national necessities. The theme of information highways may even play an important political role. The closer the country gets to the next presidential election, the more useful it will be for the current prime minister to have at his disposal, instead of a respectable but uninspiring record of accomplishment, a far-reaching politico-industrial project capable of reducing unemployment and galvanizing public support. Such an ambitious endeavor will also have the advantage of satisfying the big industrial groups athirst for public-sector contracts. Finally, development of electronic highways will force the government to rethink the audiovisual system in its entirety. The growth and development--separate, for the moment--of cable and pay television, and France Telecom's defensive strategy in this sector are questions the executive branch sooner or later will have to address. Mr. Balladur's government does not seem at all reluctant to put strong pressure on France Telecom, whose monopoly on international telephone traffic originating in France is already threatened by private operators and whose lock on domestic traffic is being challenged by mobile telephone operators already allowed to use cable network infrastructure to route personal communications. Finally, observers are concerned to see Deutsche Telekom forging multimedia alliances with Astra and Bertelsmann. The regulatory and financial recommendations that Gerard Thery makes in his report this May will probably be of critical importance for all operators in the sector.
