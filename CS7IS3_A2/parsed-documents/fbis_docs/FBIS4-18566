But how many articles will you end up modifying after that? [Miglio] Quite a few. Indeed I believe that by 1997 or 1998 we will have a totally new Constitution. Or at least it will be set right on other issues as well, ones which are not currently under discussion like basic rights. The basis for this change lies in holding the majority, and that majority now exists. [Correspondent] The program it all hinges on is federalism. Your project provides for the majority of power in public administration to be handed over to the so-called macroregions. Can you explain how? [Miglio] I would be inclined to go along with what the Bicameral Reform Commission established, namely: Only a few areas of jurisdiction will remain the province of a central authority, which will be called federal. In our view that could cover such areas as defense, foreign policy, the currency, credit, the higher realms of justice. The balance, which is an enormous amount, will be the province of the macroregions, or the regions with special statutes. We can do this thanks to Article 138, which opens up a breach in the Constitution. You must recall that the only thing we cannot do is enshrined in Article 139: "The nation's republican status cannot be subject to constitutional reform." So even those who wrote the Constitution intended everything else to be possible. [Correspondent] Possible in what way? [Miglio] The first package of reforms, which is what I think people are talking about, will take about 90 days. It concerns the major bodies, the major power centers: the government, parliament, the president of the republic. These will all be changed and we will be able to have a state that works. Then further work will be needed, a few years, I believe, to change other institutions like the Higher Council of the Magistracy, or the role of the Constitutional Court. [Correspondent] So you see continuous change?. [Miglio] Yes, we are living through an ongoing constituent phase. I have always maintained that change cannot be implemented in one fell swoop. To change the setup in the major centers of power will take this 90 day period followed, in accordance with Article 138 in the Constitution, by two further deliberations in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, with an interval of no less than three months between. Let's say about six months to prepare the groundwork for the big change. A number of adjustments will follow. For example, the three cantons which I have proposed are groupings based on existing regions. We may need to hold referenda, because certain regions or provinces may prefer to join one canton rather than another. Take Umbria, for instance. It is already split; whom will it want to go with? The citizens will be the ones to decide. [Correspondent] You mentioned modifying some inviolable rights... [Miglio] Yes, by which I mean that those articles of the Constitution which have caused nothing but trouble must be changed. For example, I am not so sure punishment should aim to re-educate the guilty. When it is objectively obvious that a person cannot be re-educated, that he is a habitual delinquent, then there is no point in thinking in terms of re-education. I would like to stress that this is a personal opinion of mine. [Correspondent] So, in your view, modifications of that nature are easy to implement? [Miglio] Absolutely, and I would like to point out that all we need is 50 plus one percent of parliamentarians to change the Constitution. But to make the great leap over to federalism we will be calling a popular referendum. There will be a great battle for the future. I believe public opinion will support this majority; persuasion to cooperate will emerge [as published].
