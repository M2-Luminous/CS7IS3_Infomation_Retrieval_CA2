Under the accord at the bilateral aviation talks held in New Zealand, Japan Airlines (JAL) and Air New Zealand will operate the flights together three times a week, the official at the Transport Ministry said. Air New Zealand will also make separate flights of its own on the route three times a week. JAL will give over to Air New Zealand the route between Nagoya and New Zealand, being jointly operated by JAL and Air New Zealand, late next month. JAL decided that it would be better to change to a route from the new Kansai airport, to open this fall, since most of its passengers who use the flights from Nagoya are from the Kansai region. JAL is thinking of introducing a route from Kansai to either Christchurch or Auckland, while Air New Zealand is considering a route to either of those destinations with a stopover at Brisbane, Australia, the official said.
