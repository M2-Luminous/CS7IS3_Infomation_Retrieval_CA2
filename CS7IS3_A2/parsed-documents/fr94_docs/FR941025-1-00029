FR941025-1-00029 FR941025-1-00006 Consumers may also benefit from decreases in relative prices of children's sleepwear because of increased penetration of the sleepwear market by imported goods. Costs of testing and uncertainty about the applicability of the children's sleepwear standards may have restrained imports of sleepwear to the United States in recent years. Imported garments account for only nine percent of all children's sleepwear sold in 1992, whereas imported garments constituted 52 percent of all sales of adult sleepwear. The exemptions from the children's sleepwear standards made by the amendments proposed below are expected to increase imports of lower- and mid-priced garments, resulting in greater competition within the sleepwear industry, and lower prices to consumers (14). If consumers elect to dress their children in tight-fitting sleepwear garments which are exempted from the requirements of the children's sleepwear standards by the amendments proposed below in place of loose-fitting non-sleepwear garments, the number of burn deaths and injuries associated with non-sleepwear garments worn by children when sleeping may decrease (8), (12), (14). Additionally, domestic manufacturers who decide to produce garments exempted by the proposed amendments may also enjoy greater sales. The ability of domestic manufacturers to produce children's sleepwear garments from cotton rather than man-made fabrics customarily used in the production of complying children's sleepwear may lead to reduced prices of children's sleepwear (14). 2. Potential Costs of the Proposed Amendments The potential cost of the exemptions to the children's sleepwear standards made by the proposed amendment is the possibility of increased societal costs of future burn deaths or injuries associated with the exempted garments (14). However, the Commission has reason to believe that few if any additional burn deaths or injuries to children will result from the proposed amendments. On the basis of epidemiological data, the Commission expects that exempting sleepwear garments in infant sizes from the requirements of the sleepwear standards will not result in increased risk of burn injuries to children younger than six months of age. Infants younger than six months old are not capable of moving by themselves, and for that reason are not likely to come within range of ignition sources when an adult is not present (11), (12). As noted above, the household environment in which children wear sleepwear has changed since the first sleepwear standard was issued in 1971. The number of adults who smoke cigarettes has declined by about 20 million since 1974, resulting in the presence of fewer matches and lighters in the nation's households. Ignition hazards presented by ranges and space heaters have also decreased (6), (14).
