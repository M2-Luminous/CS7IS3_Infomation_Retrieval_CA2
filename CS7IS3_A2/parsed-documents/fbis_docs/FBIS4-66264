On the matter of infringement of the juvenile's legal rights in marriage and family life, it is our opinion that the public security organs and the judicial departments should put more force on cracking down quickly and severely on the criminal activities that seriously harm the young people. Party and government departments throughout the region and the mass organizations should emphasize educating the parents of underage children about the law, so that they are more aware of the laws. Legal, administrative, and economic measures should be applied in accordance to the law when parents fail to fulfill their responsibilities. This is to make sure that the legal rights of the young are not violated. Families, schools, and society should work together to take up the responsibility and form a multi-channel, multi-level, all-encompassing protective network. On the questions of child-labor and using children to peddle goods, it is our opinion that to solve those problems we must first focus on family protection. CLY organizations at all levels and the education department must work very closely together to continue to "persuade the middle and elementary students to go back to school" and actively implement "Project Hope" to bring many school children back to the school grounds. We suggest that Xinjiang's People's Congress take the lead and work with the education and judicial and relevant departments to conduct a special study once a year on the issues of child-labor and child-merchants. On the issue of juvenile crimes, first, we must comply with the autonomous region's "Juvenile Protection Act" and other appropriate laws and regulations to give the young more protection. Second, we must focus on the young people's moral education and strengthen the school's political ideology work. Families, schools, and society should show concern for the young people and share the responsibility of nurturing and educating the next generation. Third, we must do a good comprehensive job with regard to maintaining public security and active prevention of juvenile crimes. Lastly, we suggest that the autonomous region build a youth convalescence center or drug rehabilitation center. On the issue of the cultural market, first, the building of youth activities centers should be included in the social development plans. Second, the public security, industrial and commercial, cultural, and CYL and other departments should join together to sort out the cultural markets and implement regular administration. Third, "wipe out pornography" and "crack down on crimes" should continue, but more important is that we should encourage the young people and children's cultural creativity. Fourth, we should continue to work on prohibiting children from entering certain premises by posting signs.
