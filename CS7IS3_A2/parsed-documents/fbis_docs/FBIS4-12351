Chidambaram, Chairman, Department of Atomic Energy said here today. While China has (?two) operational nuclear power plants and Pakistan only one, India has nine operational nuclear power plants and generates about 1720 MW of power which is approximately three per cent of the total power generation of the country, Dr. Chidambaram said in an exclusive interview. He said that the country had developed expertise in all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle and had created indigenous capabilities in designing construction and operation of nuclear power plants, reprocessing of spent fuel, and manufacture of the necessary sophisticated equipment. Capabilities had been created right from exploration and mining atomic minerals; preparation of high purity nuclear materials, such as uranium, thorium, zirconium etc.; production of fuel elements for reactors; production of heavy water and health and safety instrumentation of nuclear waste management, he said. Dr. Chidambaram said that the prime objective of the atomic energy programme was development, control and use of atomic energy solely for peaceful purposes. These included generation of electricity and development of nuclear applications in research, agriculture, industry, medicine, and other areas. To achieve this objective, efforts were initiated to build a versatile infrastructure for research facilities, trained scientific and technical manpower, raw material processing centres and the know-how and capability to manufacture nuclear components and electronic equipment to support the atomic energy programme with a view to making India truly self-reliant, he said. As a result of these efforts, Dr. Chidambaram observed that India had broken the super power monopoly in this field and the country was today in a position to export research reactors and heavy water, subject to international safeguards. "Today, nine units of nuclear power plants are in operation in the country with a total capacity of 1720 MW. The work in respect of Rajasthan Atomic Power Projects Ill and IV, and a unit of Kaiga Atomic Power Project in Karnataka, each unit of 220 MW, would be commissioned soon", Dr. Chidambaram informed. He said that the Tarapur Atomic Power Station, Rajasthan Atomic Power Station, Madras Atomic Power Station, Narora Atomic Power Station and Unit I of Kakrapar Atomic Power Project were presently operational. The second 220 MW unit of Kakrapar Atomic Power Project is expected to achieve criticality shortly, he added. Dr. Chidambaram admitted that India's nuclear programme target of generating 10,000 MW of power by the end of this century had been slowed down due to a financial crunch. However, he said that such a crisis was being faced by all public sector units and the country's nuclear programme was no exception. The Nuclear Power Corporation was striving to increase its internal resource generation. Today our nuclear power stations could generate an internal surplus of about Rs. [rupees] 100 crore, but with the addition of Rajasthan and Karnataka units our internal resource generation would touch almost Rs. 400 crore by 1997-98, he said. Dr. Chidamabaram was of the view that at some stage going public would be necessary, and that there was tremendous scope for joint ventures in this field. Referring to low operating performance of nuclear power plants, which is lower than international standards, Dr. Chidambaram said that difficulties were being faced in integrating the nuclear power stations with the grid resulting in low operating performance. These problems were, however, being sorted out. Referring to the safety aspect of nuclear power plants, Dr. Chidambaram said that the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, an independent body, oversaw and regulated all activities to enforce safety-related aspects of atomic power plants. "The guidelines followed are in conformity with international standards, such as those prescribed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection," he asserted. Dr. Chidambaram said that safety was incorporated in all phases of a nuclear power project or activities starting right from the selection of site. Safety, well engineered into the system as per current international standards, was pursued in fabrication of equipment, construction phases and maintained during operation phase, with review by multi-tier committees at different levels. Plans for emergency preparedness had also been implemented, he said. Recently, the standing committee on energy of the Lok Sabha in its fourth report on "Nuclear Plan Safety and Spent Fuel Management" which was placed in Parliament last month, has held that the commitment of the Department of Atomic Energy to safety was total. The committee found that care for protection of environment was imbibed in the form of regular procedures for site design and operations of all plants. It observed that the Department of Atomic Energy adhered to site safety features, including protection against earth quakes and associated phenomena, extreme meteorological phenomena such as cyclones, floods etc. and man-induced events such as aircraft crash, fire, explosions, and toxic chemical handling. The committee findings revealed that nuclear industry in the country had established a satisfactory safety record. There have been no fatalities caused by radiation, nor any sigificant occupational radiation injuries of any kind detrimental to the public or the environment, at any of the Indian nuclear facilities. The committee noted that India accorded top priority to management of radioactive wastes right from the beginning of the Indian nuclear programme.
