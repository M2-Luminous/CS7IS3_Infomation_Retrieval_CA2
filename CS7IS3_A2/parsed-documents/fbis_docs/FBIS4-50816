In today's world, the general office of the CPC Central Committee says in a circular publicized today, technology is developing rapidly and international competition in this field is growing ever more fierce. "Under such circumstances," the circular says, "we will find ourselves in a passive condition if we hesitate to arm our party members and cadres with modern science and technology or improve the scientific and cultural level of the Chinese nation." In studies, the circular says, special attention should be paid to the thesis "economic construction should rely on science and technology and scientific and technological work should serve economic construction" promulgated by Deng Xiaoping so as to shift the focus of economic construction and social development to technological advances and the improvement of the skills of workers.
