Sinilo, Fryazino, Moscow Oblast; UDC 62 1.396.96:621.391.26] [Abstract] This article examines three possible approaches to the suppression of speckle noise in radar images: incoherent integration, nonlinear image filtering, and homomorphic processing. Merely increasing the number of uncorrelated measurements, the first method, is a radical method. At least four-to five-fold incoherent integration is necessary for satisfactory perception of a radar image. The other two methods may be used successfully only for certain types of radar ima ge processing. Three types of smoothing by filtering are examined. The filtering methods are intended to suppress the large scatters characteristic of high resolution radar image speckle noise. A table contrasts the results obtained using various filtering methods on an image of the surface of Venus. Nonlinear filtering reduces the level of speckle noise, and image distortions have a noise-like character. Homomorphic processisng also reduces the level of speckle noise, but the image is distorted by smoothing. Figures 7; table 1; references 5: 1 Russian, 4 Western.
