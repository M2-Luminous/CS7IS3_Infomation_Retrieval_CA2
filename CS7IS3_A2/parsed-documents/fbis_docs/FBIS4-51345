These measures are not only major measures involving wide areas, but are basic reforms adopted in response to deep contradictions in the fiscal and tax structures. The promulgation of these measures indicates that the reform of our country's fiscal and tax structures has entered a strategically decisive stage. Its success or failure will not only affect whether fiscal and tax reforms can push through the various obstacles and reach a new stage, but will also affect whether or not the goal of building a socialist market economy system can be smoothly realized. Thus, people are paying very great attention to the results realized by these fiscal and tax measures and the various problems they may encounter. This article intends to provide a rough analysis of these issues. 1. Background To, and Contents of the Measures Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, through a series of major efforts, our country's fiscal and tax structural reforms have achieved obvious results. On the one hand, reform, opening up and economic development have been promoted, and, on the other hand, the state's fiscal power has been strengthened. However, because of the limitations of subjective and objective conditions, the reforms have so far been unable to achieve essential change in the fiscal and tax mechanisms, and basic contradictions still exist between the existing systems and the goal of building a socialist market economy structure. These have obstructed the establishment of a new macroregulatory and control system necessary for the establishment of a market economy. They have obstructed the formation of a unified and open domestic market, obstructed the transformation of enterprise operational mechanisms, and obstructed the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. Thus, how to speed the building of a socialist market economy structure, increase the power of fiscal and tax reform, and quickly realize pioneering advances in fiscal and tax reform, have become a crucial question in current reform and development and urgently require resolution. In response to this situation, the central authorities are determined to actively promote reform of the fiscal and tax structures and implemented the following three reforms in early 1994: 1) The existing local financial administration contract system is to be changed into a revenue sharing system between the central financial administration and local financial administrations. The main element of this is that, on the basis of rationally dividing the jurisdictional range of the central and local governments, by dividing the revenue range between the central financial administration and the local financial administration based on tax types and dividing expenditure ranges in accordance with jurisdiction ranges, a system by which the central authorities transfer expenditure to local authorities will be established. 2) The taxation system will be reformed. This includes reform of the enterprise income tax system and reform of the circulation tax system. The major element of reform of the enterprise income tax system is the unification of income tax rates for domestically funded enterprises. While fixing pre-tax deductions and expenses standards and unifying the tax base, through reference to existing enterprise tax burden levels and in order to facilitate a future merger with the income tax rates applied to foreign-funded enterprises, tax burdens were reduced and a rational, unified proportional tax rate was implemented. The main element in the reform of the circulation tax system is the establishment of a unified circulation tax system which has an value-added tax as its main part, and to change the current practice where there are uncoordinated operational taxes, value-added taxes, and product taxes. Apart from continuing to implement an operational tax in the commodity operational sphere, in all other areas, an overall value-added tax is being levied. At the same time, the product tax has been changed to a consumption tax, and this has been coordinated with the value-added tax to carry out special regulation of some consumer products. The post-unification circulation tax will be suited to both domestically funded and foreign-funded enterprises, and it will be possible to abolish the unified industrial and commercial tax levied on foreign-invested enterprises. In addition, in order to accord with the developments and changes of tax sources, some new taxes will be introduced, including the value-added land tax, the securities trading tax, the inheritance tax, and so on. 3) Taking as a principle the separation of the state's function as the owner of assets and the government's function as a social manager, the system of distributing state and state-owned enterprise profits has been reformed. The main element is that after the unification of domestically funded enterprises' income tax, the system of implementing unified income tax and profit contracts for state-owned enterprises will no longer be practiced. On the basis of abolishing the levying on state enterprises of key energy and communications construction project fund charges and budget regulatory fund charges and allowing enterprises to include interest on new and accumulated credit in their costs, the system of enterprises repaying credit before paying taxes will no longer be practiced, and repayments of enterprises' credits will be made using funds left after tax has been paid. As for after-tax profits, the state, as the owner, will have the right to decide how they should be used. Specific measures will be decided based on the actual situation of the enterprises. 2. The Effects and Significance of These Measures These fiscal and tax measures can be said to be essential breakthroughs in fiscal and tax reform ideology, and they show that we are escaping from the fetters of the traditional idea of "handing down power and allowing the retention of profits" and are truly travelling a road of transforming mechanisms and innovating systems. This has very great significance both in terms of fiscal and tax reform itself and in the overall situation of economic reform. These various measures were all adopted in response to deep-seated problems in the existing financial system and tax system and to the major contradictions between these systems and the establishment of a market economy structure. Thus, it can be predicted that when the measures are implemented, that is, when they are able to overcome or alleviate the various defects produced by the old system, which obstruct the establishment of a market economy structure, these new fiscal and tax reform measures will have very positive effects in terms of overcoming fiscal difficulties, strengthening the macroeconomic regulatory and control function of the financial administration, establishing and perfecting macroeconomic and regulatory and control systems, promoting transformation of enterprise mechanisms, promoting the formation of an open and unified national market, and promoting the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. 1. Reforming the system of local financial contracts. While in the new structural plans, it is necessary to maintain some of the specific practices of the old system, such as base figures, and, in some respects, it is necessary to adopt revenue and expenditure ranges based on enterprises' administrative relationships, the revenue-sharing reform inevitably involves a comprehensive negation of the contract system. This will certainly overcome or alleviate in an overall way the various defects brought by the contract system and which are disadvantageous to the development of the market economy. The contradictions between the contract system and the development of a market economy are seen in many aspects, but mainly in the following three: First, the contract system greatly weakens financial macroeconomic regulatory and control powers, and directly restricts the establishment of a macroeconomic regulatory and control system. This is because the contract system restricts the fiscal revenue of the central authorities, resulting in the growth in central financial income being unable to keep pace with the development of the national economy and to keep pace with the growth of overall finances. According to statistics, since overall contracts were implemented in 1988, of new income each year, the central financial administration only obtained a small proportion, and local financial administrations obtained over 90 percent of this new income. This unnatural situation where the scale of central financial income has gradually shrunk has not only resulted in the central financial administration losing the financial power necessary for macroeconomic regulation and control, but has also weakened its capacity to regulate financial strength among regions. This has exacerbated inequalities between regions in terms of financial and economic development. In addition, as the majority of local financial administrations have also implemented financial contracts level by level, contracts not only firmly fixed the income of the central financial administration, but also dispersed local financial strengths, resulting in a highly dispersed situation for national financial resources. In terms of the utilization of state financial resources, the central administration has lost the capacity to gather and distribute financial resources. This has exacerbated the difficulties of the financial administration and has resulted in state financial deficits continuing to climb year after year. It has also continually exacerbated inflationary pressures. Second, the tendency towards local protectionism has been strengthened, the deployment of resources has been harmfully affected, and the normal development of the market has been disturbed. The financial contract system adopted the method of dividing the revenue and expenditure ranges on the basis of the jurisdictional relationships of enterprises and institutional units, and enterprises' income situations were tightly tied to the financial interests of the localities. Thus, localities, proceeding from the desire to increase financial income, inevitably deploy the resources they control in a way which is in accord with the target of maximizing their own financial income. In addition, in order to protect their own local resources and enterprise sales interests, they may implement market blockades, and so on. This not only results in duplicate construction and structural convergence between regions, but also greatly obstructs the formation of a unified domestic market. Third, as the income of enterprises and the financial revenue situation of localities are bound together excessively tightly, this results in excessive interference by localities in enterprise operations. This is not advantageous to the reform of separating government and enterprise functions and obstructs the transformation of enterprise mechanisms. After replacing the contract system with the revenue-sharing system, some of these problems will be completely eliminated, while some others, while not being completely solved, will be greatly alleviated: 1) The phenomenon of separate market regimes will be greatly reduced, and the formation of a unified, open national market will be promoted. This is because an important element of the revenue-sharing system is the division of fiscal revenue ranges between the central authorities and the localities based on tax types, and the division of existing tax types into three types -- central taxes, local taxes and taxes shared by the central and local authorities. In respect to shared taxes, the practice has been adopted whereby, after the central authorities levy the tax, a part of it is refunded to the local authorities. In this way, while some remnants of jurisdictional divisions are maintained in terms of enterprise income tax, in overall terms, the old situation of a division of income based on administrative jurisdictional relationships has been broken down and the local authorities, regardless of whether enterprises are under their jurisdiction, still obtain their due revenue from the central authorities. Thus, engaging in duplicate construction and economic blockades by regions, which are intended to safeguard the interests of enterprises under their jurisdiction, will lose any real significance. 2) The overall financial situation will be greatly enlivened, the enthusiasm of both the central and the local authorities will be stimulated, and the financial administration's regulatory and control capacity will be revived and strengthened. Another aspect of the revenue-sharing system is to strengthen the capacity of the central financial administration to arrange revenue, and it expands the volume and range of expenditure which the central financial administration shifts to the local financial administrations. Also, diverse but standardized expenditure transfer forms can be adopted. This is beneficial to further expanding the scale of financial resources which the local financial administrations has autonomy in deciding how to expend, and to expanding the autonomy of local financial administrations. In addition, it creates a dual financial source balancing mechanism whereby local financial administrations rely on both their own financial resources and those financial resources refunded by the central financial administration. This changes the old irrational, passive situation where the central financial administration relied on funds supplied by the local financial administrations in order to balance revenue and expenditure. This raises the central financial administration's capacity to support local financial administrations, and strengthens the regulatory and control function of the central financial administration. In particular, the diversity and the standardization of the forms by which the central authorities refund income to the local authorities raises even higher the regulatory and control capacity which the central financial administration can exercise over the use of local financial resources. 2. Reforming the tax system. After implementing a unified income tax for domestically funded enterprises and establishing a unified circulation tax system which has a value-added tax as its main part, there will be a fair tax burden. This will be beneficial to equal competition between enterprises and will strengthen the regulatory role of taxation. This is because: 1) Implementing a unified income tax system for domestically funded enterprises will eliminate the existing unfair phenomenon brought about by the existing enterprise income tax system, whereby different economic components have different tax burdens. In particular, this will allow state-owned enterprises to compete equally, in terms of their tax burdens, with other nonstate-owned enterprises. 2) The implementation of a circulation tax system, which has a value-added tax for general regulation and a consumption tax for supplementary regulation, will strengthen the flexibility of the regulatory role of circulation tax, strengthen the focus, and will of course strengthen the regulatory role of the circulation tax. 3. In the distribution relationship between the state and state-owned enterprises, we will realize reform by which income tax is levied in accordance with the law and no longer practice the method of using contracts, whereby income tax and profits are tied together. This will ensure that profits and taxes are streamed separately. This will provide conditions, on the distribution level, for the comprehensive separation of government and enterprise functions and will also overcome defects produced by the contract system, where the regulatory role of taxation was strangled, and allow the revival of this regulatory role. In addition, on the basis of abolishing state-owned enterprises' profit regulatory tax and ending the levying of energy and communications key project construction fund charges and budget regulation fund charges, reform by which the repayment of credit prior to taxation is changed into repayment of credit from retained profits after payment of tax will eliminate the defect where enterprises, in their credit funds use, just ate from the big pot constituted by the central financial administration. This will allow the strengthening of enterprise budgets and will be beneficial to the formation of self-restraint mechanisms in enterprises. Thus, banks will see a consequent increase in credit risks and this will promote the development of specialized banks in the direction of enterprise operations. In brief, as long as we firmly grasp the spiritual essence of these fiscal and tax reforms, firmly and unwaveringly implement and carry through these reform measures, and achieve the transition from the old to the new tax system, the basic results anticipated for the reforms will certainly be realized. 3. Problems Which May Occur and Countermeasures The results which have been achieved in the three major fiscal and tax reform measures implemented in 1994 can be affirmed. However, it must also be recognized that due to subjective and objective reasons, in the implementation of these measures, it is inevitable that problems of one sort or another will arise. Seen from the existing economic structure and the interests structure in our country, in the implementation of the three major reforms, if we do not do things well the following problems will occur: 1. The three major reform measures will involve the readjustment of interests in many respects. It is impossible that such reforms will not touch on the vested interests of every side. Thus, in the implementation of the various measures, it is inevitable that various obstacles will be encountered. In order to carry out the reforms smoothly, we must, in a way which seeks truth from facts at the same time as upholding the goals and principles of reform, do all that is possible to take into consideration the vested interests of all sides to dissolve these obstacles. Actually, during these reforms, the central authorities have already given full attention to this point. In respect to the revenue-sharing system, the central authorities have, in setting base figures, in the division of tax types, and in setting revenue distribution proportions, given very great consideration to the localities. In terms of tax system reform, not only have they upheld the principle of stressing mechanism transformation and not generally increasing the tax burden of enterprises, but they have also adopted various measures aimed at reducing the tax burden of enterprises. At the same time as simplifying and merging enterprise income tax rates and reducing nominal tax rates, the central authorities have also abolished the state enterprise profit regulatory tax and have abolished energy and communications key project construction fund and budgetary regulatory fund charges, and so on. In addition, with respect to enterprises with low profit levels, the authorities have shown concern by setting special transitional income tax rates, and for two years, these enterprises will be subject to the temporary income tax rates of 27 percent or 18 percent. In terms of the reform of the profit distribution relationship between the state and state enterprises, at the same time as changing the system of credit repayment from pre-tax to post-tax repayment, the central authorities have also adopted a series of flexible measures and implemented a policy of treating new and old credit differently. Old credit can be handled in the old way and the new credit can be handled in the new way. At the same time, a number of other measures have been adopted by which depreciation rates have been raised and long-term credit interest payments can be included in costs to strengthen enterprises' capacity to repay loans. It should be said that, during reforms, very great concern has been shown for the vested interests of all sides. However, regardless of conditions, reform must involve the readjustment of vested interests, otherwise there would be no reform. Thus, in these reforms, which are aimed at transforming mechanisms, the concern for vested interests must be limited to the degree that such concerns does not harm the transformation of mechanisms. If this limit is exceeded, then there is a danger that reform will exist in name only. 2. Revenue-sharing reform cannot be put into place in one step. In the short-term, we might see poor results, and if things are not done properly there is the danger that we may see a resurgence of the defects of the old system in various respects. The revenue-sharing system reform involves a basic transformation of the financial operational mechanism. A complete, standardized revenue-sharing system model will include reforms in at least five aspects: 1) The scientific delineation of the scope of functions between the central financial administration and the local financial administration. 2) The division, on the basis of tax type, of the range of financial income of the central and the local financial administrations. 3) The appraisal and fixing, using standardized methods, of the expenditure needs of the local financial administrations and of the financial income they should receive. 4) A system where the majority of financial resources are centered in the central financial administration and expenditures transferred to the localities. 5) Separation of the budgets of the central and local governments and the establishment of separate tax levying and management organs. These five elements constitute an organic whole. If one element is missing or if any element is not implemented in accordance with the standardized requirements, this will result in it being difficult to bring into play the overall effects of the revenue-sharing system. It may even result in a situation where, under a formal revenue-sharing system, various defects of the old system resurge. It can be seen that the spirit of the revenue-sharing system lies in clarifying, standardizing, and legislating rights, responsibilities, and interests. Because of the limits of current conditions, at the beginning of the reforms we must adopt flexible measures and extend the use of some old measures. Thus, in the operation of the new structure, it is inevitable that some nonstandard elements will emerge and that these will restrict bringing into full play the effects of the revenue-sharing system. This is particularly so given that administrative reforms in our country are still in progress and that there still has not been any scientific and concrete divisions set down in terms of the respective jurisdictional ranges of the central and local governments. Factoral methods and standards methods suited to the assessing and fixing of the revenue and expenditure figures for local financial administrations in our country still await research. Thus, the revenue-sharing system which is being implemented cannot yet be built on a base which rationally divides the jurisdictions of the central and local financial administrations. If this is not handled well, there is a danger that we will see a resurgence of the defects of the old financial system where the rights and responsibilities of the central and local financial administrations were not clear and the distribution relationships was not stable. In order to guard against this, after the first step of the reforms are implemented, we cannot halt. We must firmly grasp reforms related to the revenue-sharing system, actively create conditions, and, without losing the opportunity, push the revenue-sharing system toward its target of standardization. First, we must speed the pace of administrative structure reform, complete as swiftly as possible reform involving the separation of the two functions of the government, and, on this basis, scientifically and concretely divide the functional range of the central and local governments to provide the basis for the overall standardization of the revenue-sharing system. Second, we must further deepen reform of the tax system to provide conditions for the perfection of the revenue-sharing system. In 1994, we have implemented reforms involving a unified income tax for domestically funded enterprises and a unified circulation tax system which has a value- added tax as its main part. However, these reforms cannot overcome the defects of the existing tax system whereby local tax types are too few, their scale too small, and they cannot accord with the need to separate tax types under the revenue-sharing system. Thus, after the implementation of the new income tax and circulation tax systems, we should continually develop new tax sources and develop new tax types, particularly local tax types, to provide full taxation system conditions for accelerating the perfection of the revenue-sharing system. Finally, we must actively develop research on standards methods and factoral methods which are suited to our country for setting local financial administration revenue and expenditure figures. In the financial structure, the question of on what to rely on in setting revenue figures for local financial administrations is a crucial question which will determine whether the results of the financial structure reform will be good or bad. For a long time now, we have used a base figure method. Although this method is simple and easy to implement, it has many defects, as it is actually a method which accepts the status quo. Therefore, we must not ignore reform of the base figures, and, as quickly as possible, we should use standards methods and factoral methods to replace the base figure method. In addition, we must accelerate the pace of reforms by which central and local budgets are separated and separate tax levying and management organs are established to facilitate the positive effects of strengthened graded financial administrations brought about by the revenue-sharing system. 3. In overall terms, the reform of the tax system will not increase the burden on enterprises and will not bring about inflation. However, this does not mean than we can lower our guard. In a situation where prices have basically been made subject to the market, taxation changes are a very sensitive element in pricing. If they are not handled well, there is the danger that structural inflation will occur. Let us now look at the two major taxation reform measures. The reform of the enterprise income tax system is, whether looked at in an overall way or in specific instances, a reform which will, except for a few cases, reduce the burden on enterprises. This is because the reform, at the same time as merging rates, reduces the tax rate and implements transitional tax rates of 27 percent and 18 percent for enterprises which have low profit levels. Concurrently, it abolished the profit regulatory tax for large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and abolishes tasks in terms of energy and communications key project construction fund payments and budget regulatory fund payments. In addition to state-run enterprises, the tax burden of nonstate enterprises will also see a reduction. Even income tax for private enterprises will see a reduction from 35 percent to 33 percent. As for circulating tax reform, overall it will not increase the burden on enterprises. According to estimates based on surveys by relevant departments, the average circulating tax burden on industrial enterprises will be basically the same before and after the reforms. Of course, the circulating tax reform is not purely a reform which expands the levying of value-added tax, but is also a reform to simplify and merge tax types. For example, there were originally 13 grades for domestically funded enterprises' value-added tax, ranging from 8 percent to 45 percent. There were also 21 grades of product tax, ranging from 3 percent to 60 percent. By simplifying these multiple tax rates into two rates of 17 percent and 13 percent and applying these as product taxes on every product, there will undoubtedly be some which will see their rate go up and others which will see their rate go down. According to a preliminary survey of 282 industrial products, 73, or 26 percent of those surveyed, saw an increased burden, while 209 products, or 74 percent, saw a decreased burden. That is to say, for the majority of industries and products, not only will they not see increased burdens as a result of the circulation tax reforms, they will actually see a reduction. As far as enterprises are concerned, except for those enterprises which manufacture a unitary product, even if some of the products they produce see an increase in their burdens, this will be offset by the reduced burden on other products, and the enterprise will not see an increase in its tax burden. Thus, seen in overall terms, these tax system reforms certainly will not increase the tax burden on enterprises and they will certainly not, as some people are concerned will happen, give rise to inflation in terms of the overall level of prices. However, in a situation where there is a change from an intra-price tax to an extra-price tax, and a readjustment of circulation tax rates where some rise and some fall, it is inevitable that there will be some changes in the market price structure and in the structure of commodity prices. Thus, in a process where there is an overall and large transformation of circulation tax rates, it is quite normal that there will be a structural increase in prices. Obtaining, in exchange, a fair tax burden and tax mechanism and conditions where enterprises are pushed toward equal competition in the market is both worthwhile and necessary. We must view this phenomenon correctly. What needs to be given attention is that in the transformation from the old tax system to the new, if price administration is not well coordinated, it will be impossible to properly readjust the old tax containing prices, and there is a danger that there will be artificial price rises. In this respect, there is a need for price controls to manage well the readjustment of prices during the transition from the old tax system to the new tax system. Those industries and products which see a reduced tax burden should lower their prices accordingly. Only individual industries and products which see an increased tax burden should be allowed to raise prices accordingly. We must firmly stop those who, after their tax burden has been reduced, not only do not reduce prices, but use the opportunity of the tax system reform to raise prices. To counter this, we must quickly promulgate relevant price policies and regulations for the transition period and fix methods for price continuity during the transformation to new system. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the promulgation of the new tax regulations to remove people's misunderstandings about the new tax system. 4. After the reform by which the method of pre-tax credit repayment is turned into post-tax repayment is introduced, because flexible measures including old repayment arrangements for old credit and new repayments arrangements for new credit have been adopted, this reform measure is generally safe. However, as far as those enterprises which have accumulated large liabilities over time or are not very efficient are concerned, there may be some difficulties. These types of enterprises are not only limited in terms of their credit repayment capabilities and the fact they will find it difficult to discard their debt millstones, they will also lose their capacity to obtain new loans as a result. This is because, while these enterprises can pay off old debts using pre-tax profits, because their debts are huge, it will take a long time to clear them. Not only will they be unable to get new loans, even if they do, they will be unable to repay them. If good arrangements are not made for these enterprises, they will sink into operational difficulties. With respect to these enterprises, we should adopt more powerful measures to rescue them. However, we must differentiate between the way in which we deal with these enterprises, and we should not adopt uniform measures. For example, with respect to those enterprises which have poor operations, have experienced losses for consecutive years and cannot repay their debts, we should firmly implement bankruptcy measures. With respect to those enterprises whose products have markets and whose operations can be improved, we should provide appropriate support. Dealing with old debts as state investment might we considered so that they can speedily free themselves from their old debt difficulties, and they could be required to improve their results within a defined period. With respect to small and medium-sized state-run enterprises, we should, in the light of the property rights reform, resolve their problems through contracts, leases, sales, or mergers. In sum, the debt problems of these enterprises can only be resolved through reform of enterprise mechanisms. We certainly cannot follow the traditional road of eating from the same big pot.
