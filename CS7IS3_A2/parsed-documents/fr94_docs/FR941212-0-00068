FR941212-0-00068 FR941212-0-00018 (7) Northern shrimp exemption. The Northern shrimp fishery has been found to meet the exemption qualification requirements specified in paragraph (a)(10) of this section. Therefore, vessels subject to the mesh restrictions specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section may fish for, harvest, possess, or land northern shrimp with nets of mesh smaller than the minimum size specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section in the Northern Shrimp Exemption Area, if the vessel complies with the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(7)(i) through (iii) of this section. The Northern Shrimp Exemption Area is defined by straight lines connecting the following points in the order stated: Northern Shrimp Exemption Area 1Point 1Latitude 1Longitude SM1 41 ○35 ’ N. 70 ○00 ’ W.

Northward along the irregular U.S.-Canada maritime boundary to the shoreline. (i) Possession limit . A vessel may not fish for, possess on board or land multispecies finfish. (ii) Finfish Excluder Device . A vessel must have a properly configured and installed finfish excluder device in any net with mesh smaller than the minimum size specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. The finfish excluder device must be configured and installed consistent with the following specifications (see Figure 2 to part 651) for an example of a properly configured and installed finfish excluder device): (A) A finfish excluder device is a rigid or semi-rigid grate consisting of parallel bars of not more than 1-inch (2.54-cm) spacing that excludes all fish and other objects, except those that are small enough to pass between its bars into the codend of the trawl. (B) The finfish excluder device must be secured in the trawl, forward of the codend, in such a manner that it precludes the passage of fish or other objects into the codend without the fish or objects having first passed between the bars of the grate. (C) A fish outlet or hole must be provided to allow fish or other objects that are too large to pass between the bars of the grate to pass out of the net. The aftermost edge of this outlet must be at least as wide as the grate at the point of attachment. The fish outlet must extend forward from the grate toward the mouth of the net. (D) A funnel of net material is allowed in the lengthening piece of the net forward of the grate to direct catch towards the grate. (iii) A vessel may only fish for or harvest northern shrimp during the northern shrimp season, as established by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC). The northern shrimp season is December 1 through May 30, or as modified by the ASMFC. (8) Stellwagen Bank/Jeffreys Ledge (SB/JL) juvenile protection area . The minimum mesh size of all mobile net gear in the following area shall be 6 inches (15.24 cm) square mesh in the last 50 bars of the codend and extension piece for vessels 45 ft (13.7 m) and less, and in the last 100 bars of the codend and extension piece for vessels greater than 45 ft (13.7 m), except as provided for in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. (i) The SB/JL juvenile protection area is defined by straight lines connecting the following points in the order stated: Stellwagen Bank Juvenile Protection Area 1Point 1Latitude 1Longitude 1Approximate loran coordinates SB1 42 ○34.0 ’ N. 70 ○23.5 ’ W. 13737 ␣␣44295 SB2 42 ○28.8 ’ N. 70 ○39.0 ’ W. 13861 ␣␣44295 SB3 42 ○18.6 ’ N. 70 ○22.5 ’ W. 13810 ␣␣44209 SB4 42 ○05.5 ’ N. 70 ○23.3 ’ W. 13880 ␣␣44135 SB5 42 ○11.0 ’ N. 70 ○04.0 ’ W. 13737 ␣␣44135 SB1 42 ○34.0 ’ N. 70 ○23.5 ’ W. 13737 ␣␣44295
