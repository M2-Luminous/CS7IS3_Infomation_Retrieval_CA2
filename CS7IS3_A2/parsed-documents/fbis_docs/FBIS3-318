He was speaking in Johannesburg to our correspondent Carlos Pacheco. [Pacheco] The Portuguese Government has plans for the repatriation of Portuguese nationals should things worsen in South Africa. Minister Durao Barroso gave no details, but confirmed that planning is in progress to enable us to respond to a worst-case scenario. However Durao Barroso is confident of a positive evolution in South Africa and does not believe that repatriation will be necessary. The foreign minister also denied rumors that Portuguese nationals are returning home in massive numbers, stating that the figures supplied by the Portuguese Embassy show nothing out of the ordinary. [Begin Barroso recording] If in the past, in extreme conditions, we were able to receive our compatriots [post-1974 return from the African colonies], now we would certainly be able to receive them much better. But this is not our goal, nor is it, I believe, the goal of most of the Portuguese who have settled here. [end recording]
