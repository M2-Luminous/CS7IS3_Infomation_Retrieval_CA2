We call on you to disavow the falsehoods imposed on you by the gang of apostasy and secession. The members of this gang are pushing you into the crematorium of war against your brothers in the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy. They mean only to protect themselves, their sick delusions, and their suspicious schemes designed to return the homeland to the situation that prevailed prior to 22 May 1990. We urge you to reject the orders of the gang of apostasy and secession. This gang illegally gives orders to the Armed Forces' officers and soldiers. We call on you to carry out your national duty by joining the ranks of the forces of unity and democracy which are defending both Constitutional legitimacy and the interests of both the homeland and people, exactly as was done by thousands of your comrades in arms in various positions. O dear brothers, we appeal to you to ask yourselves about what you are fighting for, and for what objectives you are aiming the weapons at your brethren. If you are really fighting for Yemeni unity, your natural position is within the ranks of the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy, the forces of both the people and homeland. You should aim your guns where they should be aimed: At the secessionist clique in the Socialist Party's leadership that betrayed the cause of unity, rebelled against democracy and constitutional legitimacy, and launched this war between brothers in arms for the sake of its dominating secessionist aspirations. Why are you aiming your weapons at your brothers who are defending unity and democracy? Why are you killing men, bereaving the women of their husbands, and bereaving the children of their parents? Why are you exposing yourselves to death and creating disasters for your families and kinsfolk? Why are you setting fire to the homeland's achievements and deepening the people's wounds? Why are you demolishing the schools and hospitals and destroying the institutions which serve the people? Are you doing all this for a handful of rebellious secessionists? O brothers in arms, return to your senses and fear God regarding yourselves, your kinsfolk, and your people's sons. Quickly join the ranks of the Armed Forces, which are defending unity and constitutional legitimacy. The secessionist clique has no chance of victory, now that most governorates are controlled by the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy. O dear brothers, quickly save yourselves from the dark fate which will be soon the lot of the secessionist clique led by traitor al-Bid. Be as the people expect you to be. Be rightfully and honestly the soldiers of God, the protectors of the homeland, the providers of security to the people, and the builders of life. Always be the defenders of unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy.
