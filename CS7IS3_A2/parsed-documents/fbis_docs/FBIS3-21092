Since then the tension has eased and the new French-German agreement has therefore made it possible to break the deadlock and with other relevant European member states arrive at a comprehensive agreement on both the tenor and the cost of the two new ESA manned system programs. Those are the Columbus (with the attached APM pressurized module, the Eureca satellite, the external platform type supplements, aiming instrument, remote manipulator arm and two Mir 94-95 flights) and MSTP (with manned CTV ballistic capsule, automatic ATV orbital tower and ARC test flight, external remote manipulator and EVA spacesuit). By 31 March both those programs, moreover, are supposed to be merged into a single program, by combining the Columbus and MSTP programs, hitherto directed respectively by Sweden's Frederik Engstroem and Germany's Jorg Feustel-Buechl, into a single entity under a single authority (to be defined). The polar platform (formerly in Columbus) was already reassigned (more logically) to the ESA observation program. An agreement was also reached on the budget of the two programs, with 270.4 million units of account [UA] (FF1,780 million) for Columbus and UA207 million (FF1,363 million) for the MSTP, that is, a total budget of more than FF3 billion for European manned programs in 1994-1995. In mid-January the member states, however, did not vote on those new programs whose committal texts (declarations) should be approved and submitted for the signature of the participants on 31 January. By then, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden will be ready to participate in both activities with, in addition, the United Kingdom for Columbus and also Switzerland and Canada for MSTP. The only obstacle to be eliminated before the end of the month involves adjusting Spain's and Italy's contributions (because of the devaluation of their currencies they are forced to pay more to the ESA). A compromise is expected to be found by 31 January to adjust their quota and finally make it possible to commit to the Columbus and MSTP programs by the end of 1995.
