The tank and rocket shells severely damaged civilian objects in these two neighbouring towns, the sources said. Moslems started shelling the two towns several weeks ago. Continuing to violate the Geneva Accord on a cessation of hostilities which was reached on June 8, the Moslems heavily attacked also some other Serb towns, villages and positions in the wider area of Doboj. Southeast of Doboj, on Mt. Ozren, Moslems opened mortar fire on the Serb villages of Boljanic, Karanovac and Petrovo on the left bank of the River Spreca. There were no casualties, but the shell explosions caused severe material damage to buildings. On the Vozuca front, Moslems are firing at and shelling Serb positions and villages along all lines of separation. A Moslem troop build-up has also been observed. Moslems are also attacking Serb positions east and west of Doboj, but Serbs are abiding by the Geneva Accord and open fire only when the lives of their troops and civilians are threatened, the Bosnian Serb military sources said.
