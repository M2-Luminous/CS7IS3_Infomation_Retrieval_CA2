The Presidential and Executive Councils of the united Iraqi National Congress, INC, held their sixth joint meeting in the INC headquarters in the city of Salah-al-Din from 1-6 February 1994. The meeting was inaugurated by a Koranic recitation. The chairman of the Executive Council then read a report on the INC's activities during 1993 and the agenda of the meeting was approved. The agenda includes a review of recent developments inside Iraq and on the regional and international levels with regard to the Iraqi issue. The conferees studied the report presented by the chairman of the Executive Council. In light of this, the following committees were formed to discuss matters in detail: The Arab and Islamic Relations Committee; the International Affairs Committee; the Financial Committee; the Administration and Organizational Committee; and the 1994 Plan Committee. The Arab and Islamic Relations Committee discussed ways to promote the INC's relations with the neighborly states, the Arab states, and the Islamic world to serve the cause of the Iraqi people and to confront dictatorship in Iraq. The committee made many recommendations in this regard. The International Affairs Committee dealt with developments in the issue in terms of international organizations and foreign countries. The committee recommended that the INC exert efforts to ensure the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712, which call for providing food and medicine to the Iraqi people to alleviate their suffering provided that the dictatorial regime is deprived of the flow of funds. The conferees studied the new international efforts to implement the UN resolutions, particularly UN Security Council Resolution 688, which call for ending repression and coercion against the Iraqi people. The conferees underscored the need to protect human rights and called for an expansion of the no-fly zone to cover the whole of Iraq and establish a safehaven in the south. They also noted that the international community is becoming firmer vis-a-vis the dictatorial regime of Saddam Husayn and is supporting trends to set up a national democratic alternative in Iraq that respects the will of the Arab and Kurdish people to choose the form of their future government in Iraq. The Financial, Administrative, and Organizational Committees studied financial, administrative, and organizational affairs. The committees' reports tackled financial, administrative, and organizational matters. The conferees discussed these issues and made the appropriate decisions. The conferees also made the necessary decisions and took measures to activate the constitutional consultative council. The committee charged with charting the 1994 plan stressed the need to continue the conference's program and working plans to confront the dictatorial regime and establish a democratic alternative. The plan touches on the principal issues in the struggle against dictatorship, especially the political aspect. It is aimed at implementing the conference's political statement by: emphasizing the democratic, national alternative that we seek to achieve; by entrenching the democratic experience in Kurdistan; by showing concern for the unity of Iraq, which is being threatened by the course followed by the dictatorial regime and by the regime's continuation; by emphasizing the importance of strengthening Arab-Kurdish brotherhood and guaranteeing administrative and cultural national rights to the Turkomans and Assyrians; and by seeking to create a democratic, pluralistic, federal Iraq that strengthens the country's unity. The plan also emphasizes the need to employ regional and international sympathy for our people to help enact the international resolutions and serve the struggle against dictatorship. The plan also emphasizes our reliance on our people's administration to establish an alternative of their choice. The plan is also aimed at strengthening the conference's initiatives on the Arab, Islamic, and international levels to win greater attention from the world in support of the Iraqi cause. On the subject of human rights, we stress the need to draft a comprehensive plan to activate and implement UN Security Council Resolution 688. This includes the dispatch of UN observers to monitor human rights violations in Iraq, the stationing of UN guards in all parts of Iraq, the confrontation of all acts of suppression practiced by the regime, and the end of the domestic embargo imposed on liberated Kurdistan and other areas in the south. Iraqi Kurdistan must be exempted from the international embargo in order to alleviate the people's suffering and to help ensure the success of democracy in the region. We must do everything possible to stop the regime from continuing the policy of drying up the marshlands and displacing its Arab Shiite inhabitants. We also demand that Saddam and his gang be brought before an international court in accordance with the bill of indictment, which was prepared by the INC and presented to the United Nations and other international organizations. In the field of the media, the plan stresses the need to adopt a policy, both inside and outside, to implement the political directives of the conference, develop media agencies, and provide the necessary funds and supplies for them. The conferees also decided to consider all the papers presented by the specialized committees, after they are approved, as part of the 1994 plan. The joint meeting of the two councils was briefed on certain aspects and results of the field action. The competent agencies in the conference have chartered the plan for the field action for 1994. The problems, programs, and action plan were discussed with a sense of great responsibility. Constructive and practical decisions and recommendations were reached in a democratic fashion, which confirms the existence of common convictions in all areas. The conferees were apprised of the outcome of the meeting held in Ankara by the foreign ministers of Syria, Iran, and Turkey. They welcomed the ministers' statement the the internal siege clamped on Iraqi Kurdistan and southern Iraq must be lifted, and that electrical services must be restored to Dahuk. They also welcomed the ministers' reiteration that Iraqi people must be allowed to determine their future by free will. In the same vein, the conferees would like to assert that the continued survival of Saddam Husayn's regime poses a real threat to the country's unity. We Iraqis, are the most concerned for the unity of our people and homeland, the conferees noted. The conferees underlined their eagerness and constant efforts to establish a democratic Iraq that would promote regional security and stability, contribute to the establishment of good relations with neighboring countries, and foster the economic growth of the peoples of the region. The conferees hailed the third anniversary of the glorious popular uprising of March 1991, which expressed the people's will against dictatorship and constituted a popular referendum demanding the ousting of the regime. They glorified the martyrs of the uprising and the anniversary of the heroic feats forged by the uprising's heroes. They also pledged to the martyrs to continue the struggle until the achievement of their objective of toppling dictatorship. While condemning the regime's repressive and criminal practices, the joint meeting of the INC's Presidential Council and Executive Council commends the steadfastness and sacrifices of the glorious Iraqi people. In the same vein, they hail the Kurdish people's resistance, as demonstrated in their efforts to safeguard their democratic experiment, as well as the gains they have made for the whole of Iraq. The conferees also commend our people's steadfastness and resistance in southern and central Iraq and the rest of Iraq. They urge military personnel and Ba'thists to abandon the tyrant, to join the people's ranks in struggle, and to step up this struggle on all levels in order to topple dictatorship and set up a patriotic and democratic regime. And say: Work righteousness: Soon will God observe your work, and His Apostle, and the believers.
