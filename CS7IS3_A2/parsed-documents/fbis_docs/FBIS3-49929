FBIS3-49929 "dreeu009__a94026" FBIS-EEU-94-009-A Document Type:Daily Report 13 January 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Government Rejects Union Demand on Agreement AU1201081594 Prague CTK in English 1851 GMT 11 Jan 94 AU1201081594 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, Jan 11 (CTK) -- At its meeting today, the government refused all the four grounds given by trade union representatives for their Monday's [10 January] decision not to sign the General Agreement negotiated by the tripartite (composed of labor, employers, and the government). At yesterday's meeting of the Czech-Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS), labor representatives decided that they would not sign the proposal for the General Agreement, calling it a basically political declaration which did not guarantee the fulfillment of unions' demands. The General Agreement concerns work conditions and relationships, wage issues, business conditions, employment, and social policy, and is the basic instrument for maintaining social peace. The trade unions disagree with the cessation of unions' presence in public service, demand regulation of higher collective agreements, reject wage regulation (in force since January 1993), and demand that a way be found for handing over the tripartite positions to the parliament. The ministers refused the union representatives' attitude as "being of the sort which tries to force the government to solve several things which do not relate to the General Agreement at all," Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik said. "The nature of the possible union organizations in state institutions must be rather different," Kocarnik said on the presence of unions in public service. "We categorically disagree with union representatives on wage regulation," said Kocarnik, adding that in his view the existing wage regulation did not prevent the prosperous enterprises from increasing wages.
