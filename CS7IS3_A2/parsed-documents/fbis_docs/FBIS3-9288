Under a recent agreement between the Serb and Muslim side, a corridor linking the Muslim-controlled suburbs of Butmir and Dobrinja will also open today. First, buses with civilians on board set off from Ilidza for Lukavica and Pale this morning. A bus left for Belgrade. For the first time since the airport was handed over to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] control, people from Serb Sarajevo were able to use the Lukavica-Ilidza road. There have been no traffic problems so far. The Serb fighters bridge (formerly Brotherhood and Unity bridge), which links Grbavica with the Muslim part of Sarajevo, has not yet been opened to civilians because the Muslim side is demanding that Serb authorities in the Novo Sarajevo municipality remove the Srpska republic's state symbols from the Serb side of the border crossing. The bridge and the Sarajevo-Visoko corridor via Vogosca are, however, expected to open to traffic later today.
