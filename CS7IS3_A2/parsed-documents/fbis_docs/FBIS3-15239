They will be airlifted there as soon as the corresponding decision is adopted by the country's top authorities, a source in the Russian paratroopers' headquarters told ITAR-TASS on Friday. The source added that Russian paratroopers had been surprised by a statement of French General Jean Cot that only American, British or French servicemen are capable to operate rapidly and professionally in Bosnia. He reminded that a very high training level had been demostrated by Russian paratroopers during their last month rush from Croatia to Bosnia to guarantee the withdrawal of the Serb big guns. The operation was a success despite limited time and extreme weather conditions. "It is a pity that the French general failed to notice this though he could watch Russian paratroopers in action with his own eyes", the source said.
