In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday, Shokhin said that a draft decree on the reorganisation of the government has been seen only by two people -- President Boris Yeltsin himself and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. "Neither I, nor other deputy prime ministers to whom I have spoken have not been involved in the work on a new structure of the government." He pointed out that "this is not the best variant of reorganisation when deputy prime ministers are excluded from preparatory work." Shoknin said that according to newspapers the number of federal ministers will be reduced and some state committees will be reorganised into ministries or other federal services. Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said earlier today that the upcoming cabinet reshuffle will considerably reduce the number of ministers in the Federal Government. He said that "the number of ministers will be reduced sharply. There will be not more than 30 of them" in the government. He vowed that "the reduction will not hamper the government's work, but rather make it more efficient." Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Shumeyko said that "a decree on the reorganisation of the government will be signed by the president either today or tomorrow." Speaking about his future, Shokhin said that if "the foreign economic bloc of the government 'dissolves' in the economic one, I will have to go to the State Duma" where he hopes to head its Foreign Affairs Committee, provided it will also handle foreign economic issues and CIS problems. "Though I have some other variants as well," he added. He admitted that if Boris Fedorov is chosen to handle foreign economic issues in the government "it will be easier for me to express my politicised point of view on what he will be doing from the parliament rostrum."
