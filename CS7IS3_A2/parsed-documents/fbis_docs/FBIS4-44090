Representing Israel, Minister Shulamit Aloni welcomed the agreement, adding that it opens the way for Israeli scientists to participate in European research groups. Jerry Lewis reports: [Begin recording] [Lewis] Initially for three years, about 300,000 pounds per annum will be made available to route joint research projects to encourage the exchange of British and Israeli scientists. Mr. Waldegrave: [Waldegrave] Well, it's the first time Britain has ever had an agreement exactly like this with any country, where we put the money from the government side in Britain together with the money from the Israeli Government side, plus a generous matching of that from some philanthropic sources -- the Rothschild Foundation and others -- to provide a fund for the development of scientific contacts between the two countries. [Lewis] He added: It will begin to focus on collaborative research [word indistinct] technology, with an emphasis on fields relevant to medicine, electro-optics, lasers, [word indistinct] biology, and high-performance materials. He welcomed the cooperation, noting Israel had very good scientists, and predicted such cooperation would extend shortly to other fields in what he termed a wide-shared agenda that was a clear product of the peace dividend. Shulamit Aloni emphasized the value to Israeli scientists: [Aloni] For us it's important because it's an open way to the EC research group as well, and it's important because no country nowadays can go to the future without partners from other countries. [Lewis] Facing the 21st century, she added, Israel did not have the resources other than minds, and it was important for Israel to develop joint projects, such as this in science and technology, with a hope for benefits and contacts in Europe as well.
