FR940727-1-00062 FR940727-1-00016 Section 51&hyph;6.2 has been amended in paragraph (f) to correct an undetected typographical error in the 1991 amendments. Section 51&hyph;6.8 on deletions from the Procurement List has been amended by adding a paragraph making it clear that the Committee can delete a commodity or service from the Procurement List without a request from a central nonprofit agency. A new paragraph has been added to §51&hyph;6.12 on specification changes to indicate that nonprofit agencies are to recommend changes that will improve the commodity or service being provided, reduce costs, or improve overall value to the Government. The paragraph also requires contracting activities to respond promptly to the recommendations. Section 51&hyph;6.13 has been amended to clarify its language and to indicate that other colors, sizes, or variations of commodities on the Procurement List which have not been previously procured are considered to be on the Procurement List as well. Section 51&hyph;8.3, consisting of definitions applicable only to part 51&hyph;8 on Committee actions under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), has been amended by removing the definition of the Committee, which also appears in the general definitions for the Committee's regulations at §51&hyph;1.3, and by changing the title ``Chairman'' to ``Chairperson'' as the title of the Committee's presiding officer. The same change to ``Chairperson'' has also been made in §§51&hyph;8.7, 51&hyph;8.10, 51&hyph;8.11, and 51&hyph;9.405. Changes have been made to §§51&hyph;8.1 and 51&hyph;8.4 and to paragraph (a) of §51&hyph;8.5 to make clear the distinction between material which the Committee is required to make available for public inspection and material which the Committee provides in response to a FOIA request. The provision in §51&hyph;8.14 for a minimum amount for FOIA processing costs below which no fee will be charged has been qualified to indicate that the minimum will apply to each Committee response to a FOIA request where it is necessary to make more than one response to a request. The Committee bills FOIA requesters separately for each response, which requires a decision each time as to whether the cost of collection would exceed the amount billed. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this proposed revision of the Committee regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the revisions basically update and clarify program policies and procedures and do not essentially change the impact of the regulations on small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply to this proposed regulatory revision because it contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements as defined in that Act and its regulations. Executive Order No. 12866 The Committee has been exempted from the regulatory review requirements of the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Additionally, the proposed revision to the Committee's regulations is not a significant regulatory action as defined in the Executive Order.
