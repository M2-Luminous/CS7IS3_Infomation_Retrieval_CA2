Leaders of three out of the seven parties in the coalition met again in the Diet, following the one on Monday. They were the heads of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the new party Sakigake and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). The head of a pro-SDP group in the House of Councillors, the Democratic Reform Party (DRP), joined the session. SDP Chairman Tomiich Murayama, Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura and DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi, DRP leader Eiichi Nakamura agreed in the meeting that they will never give the mandate on the choice of Hosokawa's successor to a lower-level forum made up of secretaries general, coalition officials said. Heads of four other parties -- Shinseito, Komeito, the Japan New Party (JNP), and the United Social Democratic Party (USDP) -- again boycotted the top leaders' session proposed by the SDP's Murayama, arguing that the matter should first be discussed at the secretary general-level forum. They are Tsutomu Hata of Shinseito, Koshiro Ishida of Komeito, Hosokawa of the JNP, and Satsuki Eda of the USDP. The SDP, Sakigake and DSP are wary that Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa may take the leading role in the secretary general-level discussions over the choice of the successor. After the three party leaders gave their blessings to Murayama's proposal to reserve the mandate to pick the new premier for themselves, the SDP-led camp conveyed its stand to the Shinseito-led forum, adding fuel to the intra-coalition hostilities. Murayama, Takemura, Ouchi and Nakamura also agreed to band again whenever necessary, while monitoring how the Shinseito-led caucus would respond to their claim for the mandate, coalition officials said. The Shinseito-led caucus has been insisting upon its authority to pick the coalition's next prime ministerial candidate on the strength of a statement by Hosokawa that he wants the caucus to take charge of decision-making on the "remaining" matters, they said. However, Murayama rejected their interpretation, saying, "the premier's remark merely implied that he wants the caucus to take care of the remaining small businesses (until a next premier is picked)." "In selecting the prime minister of a country, the meeting of the deputy chiefs of the parties should not be given the mandate to pick the premier," Murayama told the other three leaders from Sakigake, the DSP and the DRP. Takemura told the top leaders meeting, "although I agree to make efforts to maintain the current combination, I want them (the Shiseito-led caucus) to feel repentant and amend the attitudes they have taken over the past eight months." A Komeito official said of the rising intra-coalition standoff, "now it is impossible to mend fences." "We cannot help altering a combination of political parties that comprise the ruling coalition government," he said. Shinseito head Hata, who is the foreign minister, denied reports that the coalition is on the brink of collapse. Hata told a news conference Tuesday, "it's true that various emotions are entangled." "But if we go back to the starting point of why we established the coalition, I think we can restore it." JNP leader Hosokawa indicated there will be a recombination of parties in the eight-month-old ruling coalition, telling some party legislators "the coalition needs to accept a new group." A separate standoff is beginning to undercut the solidarity of the No. 1 opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), party sources said. While the backers of former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe are waging a campaign to have him selected as the LDP's candidate for premiership, LDP President Yohei Kono announced his intention to run for premiership himself. The LDP, the single largest party in the House of Representatives with a 219-legislator parliamentary strength, now stands a chance of sweeping back to power on the strength of the growing intra-coalition animosity, political sources said. The majority in the 511-member lower chamber is 256. Watanabe backers said they have solicited the support from more than 40 LDP legislators by Tuesday. If Watanabe wants to sweep to power as the head of a new coalition government, he needs to muster support of about 100 LDP legislators, on top of the allegiance of the combined 156-member strength of his own LDP faction, Shinseito, Komeito and the JNP, which are deemed to be ready to lend their support to Watanabe, the sources said.
