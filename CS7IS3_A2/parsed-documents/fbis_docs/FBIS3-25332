This "revelation" was made this past week by Mr. Sam Nujoma at Okahao in the Omusati region when he addressed inhabitants during the opening of the new Rurtel telecommunications project. At the official launch of the project he deviated from his speech and said that SWAPO [South-West African People's Organization] is prepared "to cross the Orange River with weapons to bury the minority government in Pretoria." He then used the occasion as a platform to collect donations for the ANC and to request Namibians to donate money, goats, sheep, cattle, fowls, clothes, necklaces, earrings, peanuts, and mahangu [expansion unknown] for the ANC, to ensure the fall of the "settlers" [preceding word in English]. According to him Friday's [4 February] activities coincided with the end of SWAPO's solidarity week with the "suppressed and suffering" people of South Africa. The solidarity week was announced in Windhoek by President Nujoma on the 27 January and ended on Friday. Mr. Nujoma disqualified the SWAPO government as an impartial observer of South Africa's transitional process. "SWAPO cannot be neutral," he said. "We are right behind the suppressed people of South Africa, under the ANC leadership." According to Mr. Nujoma, SWAPO has achieved its goal. "It has committed itself to fighting alongside other African nationalists for the liberation of their respective countries." He said that South Africa is presently being suppressed by "settlers". "We will fight against them. We will even cross the Orange River with weapons to fight the Boers. We can do it." The president apparently reconsidered a few moments later and added: "It is not necessary anymore to cross the Orange River with weapons to end apartheid. It is just expected of us to give whatever we have to the ANC because elections will be held on the 26, 27, and 28 April. We, mostly SWAPO members, have a duty to perform and I want everyone present to give something. If you do not have money, give a fowl, give a mahangu, give peanuts. Ngandjeras do grow peanuts for a living. Women, go and fetch all the peanuts in your grain elevators and give it to the ANC. Give a goat, give a sheep, give cattle. I know that the chief of the Ongandjera has already donated a cow. I know people have been affected by the drought. Cattle have died and goats also, but if you don't have anything else bring your necklaces, earrings, watches, and rings. The fowl, the goat, the sheep -- bring it directly here. The ANC representative should not leave empty-handed. We want to see the Boers in South Africa fall." The ANC local representative sharing the platform with Mr. Nujoma applauded.
