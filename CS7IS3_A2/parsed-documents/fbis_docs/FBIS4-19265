The Conservative Party national conference got off to a slow start yesterday with a leader who made a personal statement about why she has had enough: "After the election last fall I was both tired and sorry for myself," she said. The limit had been reached for reconciling political work and small children. That is why she cound not go on. This introduction did not exactly generate enthusiasm and on several occasions the Conservative Party leader voiced bitterness toward the press which she said had tried to create personal conflicts in the run-up to the national conference by raising the question of the prime ministerial candidate in the party which "they write is not alive -- and hardly has any right to life," as she put it. Kullmann Five made it clear that it is the Conservative Party's Storting group and central executive which will appoint the party's next prime ministerial candidate -- when they think the time is ripe. "It does not seem to be overripe at present," she said, adding that her role will not be that of a trophy on the wall or a snake in the grass. She said that she fully supports incoming leader Jan Petersen. The applause from the national conference audience increased when she began to talk about the future, and it was a leader in the mood for a fight who tackled the question of the the shift in the balance of power through an increase in the share of state ownership and controls over industry, banking, and the economy. "The state's economic power is too great, and is growing all the time. In addition job after job in this system is being filled by people with the `right' party membership card," she said. "The struggle against the welfare state is not over when the authorities want to keep a register of stuffed animals in private homes, introduce a small boat register, or end the arrangement by which a small extension to a house can be started with less involvement of bureaucracy," Five said. Otherwise the EU [European Union] question was the most central element in the speeches to the national conference. No one was particularly surprised that Kullmann Five recommended a Conservative "yes" to the results of the negotiations. The "yes" arguments were well known, but she had her claws out for the Center Party and the Socialist Left Party. "The only thing we now about their alternative is that there must be at least as much fog as at Fornebu airport today," she told a national conference for which some people had been delayed because of fog. "Per Olaf Lundteigen and Paul Chaffey have also revealed that they would really like to see the EU dissolved. This means that it is not only an alternative but also an alternative Europe involving change for the worse which they want. My 'yes' to the EU is therefore a `no' to something much worse -- to Lundteigen's alternative and Kristin Halvorsen's Norway as an experiment in Europe -- outside the EU. The alternative is that `might is right' and in that sort of world `might' has never lain with the small countries." The debate after Kullmann Five's opening speech revealed no major disagreements either about the past or the Conservatives' future course. There were no stubborn calls for self-examination. The vast majority were concerned about the future. As was Sonja Irene Sjoli from Akershus. But she thought that the Conservative Party has a problems with its image. "The Conservative Party has gained the reputation that we are a flock of materialistic, egotistic money people who only think about ourselves, about competitiveness and tax relief. A party for the elite and successful, a mother of pearl league. We know that this is not true, but as long as other people believe it we also have a problem as a party," she said. Even if major rally failed to materialize on this opening day and is unlikely to appear throughout the rest of this national conference weekend, this does not mean that pessimism and gloom rule. National conferences often serve to strengthen a party's own morale. "There will be other times. We will return the stronger," parliamentary leader Anders Talleraas said. And the others think so too. But how? they ask.
