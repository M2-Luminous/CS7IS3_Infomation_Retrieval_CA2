It discussed the UN Security Council resolution passed at dawn today on the massacre in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. During the session, Dr. al-Majali submitted a report on the contacts His Majesty King Husayn had with his brothers, the Arab leaders, to stress the need for the UN Security Council resolution to contain a clear stipulation on Jerusalem. This is because omitting the paragraph on Jerusalem, as some pressures sought, would have negatively affected the position and status of the holy city. Following the session, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state and information minister, answered questions posed by reporters. He said: [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] The government, represented by the Council of Ministers, today studied the Security Council resolution passed yesterday in the wake of the bloody massacre which occurred in Hebron in Ramadan, corresponding to 25 February, this year. The government found out that this resolution contained positive points, the most important of which are, first, condemning the massacre; second, providing protection and security to the Palestinian people; and third, focusing on the need to protect citizens in accordance with the Fourth Geneva Convention, issued in 1949, including occupied Jerusalem. The resolution also contained a call for resuming the peace negotiations and stressed the need to continue this process and immediately implement the Gaza-Jericho First agreement without delay. These are the main points which the Council of Ministers studied. Moreover, his excellency the prime minister submitted to the Council of Ministers a report on the contacts His Majesty King Husayn had with his brothers, the Arab leaders, to stress the need for this resolution to contain a clear provision on Jerusalem. This is because omitting this sentence from the resolution, in compliance with some pressures in this direction, would have negatively affected the status of this holy city which occupies a prominent position among the Arabs and Muslims. Therefore, and following a lengthy discussion of this point, the Council of Ministers agreed that the resolution, in general, contains positive points that deserve appreciation. [Unidentified reporter] Your Excellency the Minister: In light of the vote on the Jerusalem issue, how do you view the need for Jordanian and Arab moves on this issue? [Al-'Anani] It is very clear that the declared Israeli position on Jerusalem and maintaining that Jerusalem will remain Israel's unified capital, according to some statements made by Israeli officials, is something which we reject in part and parcel. We also regard Jerusalem as an occupied city that has a sacred status which no party, such as Israel, should undermine, or should threaten through any challenge, occupation, or acceptance of the status quo. In our assessment, therefore, the U.S. position was taken because the United States had either to reject and veto the resolution or abstain. The Americans preferred to abstain. However, from now on, we should work together to confront the Israeli schemes in Jerusalem, especially since there are some reports which say that evacuating the settlements in the places from which the Israeli Army may withdraw could entail the transfer of some settlers to Jerusalem. Hence, action is greatly desired on all levels, as are contacts with various bodies and states. The Jordanian Government supports, backs, and is ready to make, every required effort to explain Jerusalem's status and importance and the fact that Jerusalem is an occupied land. [Reporter] Your Excellency: Do you view the Security Council resolution as sufficient to resume Arab-Israeli negotiations? [Al-'Anani] Yes, I believe that the resolution is sufficient to resume Arab-Israeli negotiations. Such a decision, however, should be made as a result of Arab agreement and coordination because the decision to halt or freeze the negotiations immediately after the terrible Hebron massacre was made through an Arab decision of this kind. [end recording] The Council of Ministers also listened to a report by Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs, on His Highness Crown Prince Hasan's visit to Croatia and Bosnia- Herzegovina. He stressed that the visit was very successful and that Jordan seeks a just and comprehensive peace in that region. Jordan also supports the agreement reached by the Bosnian Muslims and Croats to establish a federation, which the Serbs may join, in order to safeguard the aspired peace in that region, al-Hasan added. In his report, the minister of state for foreign affairs stressed that His Highness Crown Prince Hasan found during his meetings with the leaders of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and UN officials appreciation for Jordan's role and humanitarian aid, and also for the effective and fine contribution by the Jordanian Armed Forces as part of the UN troops.
