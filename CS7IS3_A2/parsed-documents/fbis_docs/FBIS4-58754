According to a letter annexed to the Cairo accord on the launch of self-rule signed Wednesday, he will use the title "Chairman (Ra'is in Arabic) of the Palestinian Authority" to run Gaza and Jericho. The Palestinians have referred to 'Arafat as president of Palestine since a session of their parliament-in-exile in Algiers in 1988. But the letter, a copy of which AFP received here on Thursday [5 May], allows the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman to use the Arabic title "Ra'is" which also means president. Also in the letter from Arafat addressed to Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, a co-signatory of the accord, the PLO agrees to inform the Israeli government of the names of the Palestinian Authority. In Israel, the head of the government press office Uri Dromi on Thursday quoted Rabin as telling 'Arafat in Cairo to stop globe-trotting and "get prepared for serious things."
