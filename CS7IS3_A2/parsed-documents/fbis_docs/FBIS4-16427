However, according to Boris Yeltsin, the idea of the Euro-Asian Union was not discussed at the CIS summit on Friday since Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev was not present at the session because he was unwell and no concrete information on this problem was available. According to Kazakh Vice-President Erik Esanbayev [name as received], who led the Kazakh delegation to the CIS summit, the idea of the formation of the Euro-Asian Union was suggested by life itself. "At present, we are watching the response to the idea made by politicians and the mass media," Esanbayev said, adding that a comprehensive programme for the formation of the Euro-Asian Union will be submitted by Kazakhstan at the next CIS summit. Chairman of the Tajik Parliament, Emomali Rakhmonov, believes that the idea of the formation of the Euro-Asian union is a "good" one, but "the possibilities of the CIS have not been fully used up yet, which was confirmed once again by signatures of the Commonwealth presidents put under adopted documents," he said. Uzbek President Islam Karimov shares the opinion of the Tajik parliament chairman, saying that "the idea of the Euro-Asian Union does not have any serious foundation whatsoever." He pointed that it is necessary to persistently carry through the idea of strengthening the CIS, primarily by enhancing economic integration and creating an economic union. "Therefore, it would not be correct to leave the matter of strengthening the CIS half-finished and put forward a new initiative," Karimov said. Asked whether agreements reached by heads of the CIS have been efficiently fulfilled since the day of the CIS formation, Yeltsin said that a decision was adopted on Friday to check whether the discipline of carrying out these agreement was observed.
