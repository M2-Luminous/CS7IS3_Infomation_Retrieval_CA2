Savimbi has accustomed us to bombastic statements designed to impress public opinion, and his actions after such statements are totally at odds with them. Naturally we cannot agree with many of his opinions on the present political situation in Angola and also with regard to Portugal. At any rate his speech did not impress us, and did not even have any bearing on the negotiations, because we are less concerned with words than with deeds and with the stances adopted by UNITA both at the Lusaka negotiations and very especially on the battleground. [Unidentified correspondent] Dr. Aldomiro da Conceicao. Regarding Lusaka, Dr. Savimbi has expressed confidence and the belief that a lasting peace agreement will be struck soon. Do you share Dr Savimbi's optimism? [Conceicao] We have always described ourselves as being moderately optimistic. We have some hope that Lusaka may indeed bring a peace agreement to Angola.
