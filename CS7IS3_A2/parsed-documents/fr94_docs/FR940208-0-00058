ACTION: Final rule; amendment. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is amending part 261, appendix IX to reflect changes in ownership and name for the General Cable Company, Muncie, Indiana, and to delete exclusions that have been terminated. Exclusions for the following facilities have been deleted: The Envirite Corporation, Thomaston, Connecticut; Pamcor C, Incorporated, Las Piedras, Puerto Rico; Texas Instruments, Incorporated, Dallas, Texas; Tricil Corporation, Nashville, Tennessee; Tricil Corporation, Hilliard, Ohio; Tricil Corporation, Muskegon, Michigan; and the William L.

For technical information contact Mr. Jim Kent, Office of Solid Waste (5304), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 260&hyph;6946. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In this document EPA is amending appendix IX to part 261 to reflect changes in the status of exclusions for certain facilities. The petition process under §§260.20 and 260.22 allows facilities to demonstrate that a specific waste from a particular generating facility should not be regulated as a hazardous waste. Based on waste specific information provided by petitioner, EPA granted exclusions to the following facilities: General Cable Company, Muncie, Indiana (51 FR 37723, October 24, 1986); Envirite Corporation, Thomaston, Connecticut (51 FR 41323, November 14, 1986), Pamcor C, Incorporated, Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (51 FR 37019, October 17 1986); Texas Instruments, Incorporated, Dallas, Texas (50 FR 34667, August 27, 1985); Tricil, Nashville, Tennessee (51 FR 41494, November 17, 1986); Tricil, Hilliard, Ohio (51 FR 41494, November 17, 1986); Tricil, Muskegon, Michigan (51 FR 41494, November 17, 1986); William Bonnell Company, Carthage, Tennessee (51 FR 37019, October 17, 1986). On May 17, 1993, the Agency was notified that ownership of the General Cable Company, Muncie, Indiana, had been transferred to Indiana Steel & Wire Corporation (IS&W). In this notification, IS&W noted that no changes had been made in the management of EPA Hazardous Wastes Nos. F006 and K062 excluded by the Agency and that all conditions of the exclusion continue to be met. Today's notice documents this change by updating appendix IX to incorporate this change in name. EPA is also deleting seven exclusions from appendix IX because these facilities have notified EPA that they have permanently changed their processes or otherwise ceased operations that generate the excluded waste. The specific facilities, and the date on which generation of the excluded waste ceased, are given below. Envirite Corporation, Thomaston, Connecticut, May 31, 1990; Pamcor C. Incorporated, Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, October 1, 1992; Texas Instruments, Incorporated, Dallas, Texas, December 22, 1988; Tricil, Nashville, Tennessee, January 1, 1990; Tricil, Hilliard, Ohio, June 30, 1991; Tricil, Muskegon, Michigan, September 1, 1992; William Bonnell Company, Carthage, Tennessee, August 7, 1991. All of the above generators have confirmed in writing that they no longer generate the delisted waste at their facilities. On October 15, 1993, the Agency notified these facilities of the proposed action and solicited their comments. No comments were received disputing the Agency's intended action. Therefore, this notice documents this by deleting these exclusions from part 261, appendix IX. These facilities would need to submit new delisting petitions if they wish to generate excluded waste at any time in the future. These changes to appendix IX of part 261 are effective February 8, 1994. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 amended section 3010 of RCRA to allow rules to become effective in less than six-months when the regulated community does not need the six-month period to come into compliance. As described above, all affected facilities have ceased generation of the delisted waste. Therefore, a six-month delay in the effective date is not necessary in this case. This provides a basis for making these amendments effective immediately upon publication under the Administrative Procedures Act, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5531(d).
