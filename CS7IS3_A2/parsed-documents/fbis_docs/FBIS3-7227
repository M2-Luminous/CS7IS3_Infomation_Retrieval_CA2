According to the program, it plans to purchase $4.3 billion worth of U.S.-made auto parts in fiscal 1997 (up 80 percent from fiscal 1992). On expansion of import of finished automobiles, it said that "we are ready to accept auto manufacturers' request to expand purchase of their automobiles and we can ask domestic dealers--which also deal in foreign-made automobiles--to increase their sales efforts for imported cars." Following the failure in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks in February, each of the major auto manufacturers has started considering working out its own plan for purchases of U.S.-made automobiles and parts. Nissan is the fist manufacturer to officially announce its own purchase scheme. "The new program" is a revised version of "the international cooperation program" announced in 1989 and 1991, and it is mainly composed of: 1) an automobile production plan in the United States, Mexico, and European nations, and a parts purchase plan; 2) an auto parts import plan; and 3) a plan to cooperate with foreign auto manufacturers in promoting importing finished automobiles. As for the U.S.-made automobiles and parts, Nissan, by taking advantage of its plan to produce new model of "Sentra" (known as "Sunny" in Japan] at U.S. Nissan Motor Manufacturing Company (NMMC), plans to increase the amount of purchases of U.S.-made parts needed for assembly and repairs to approximately $3.4 billion in fiscal 1997 ($1.95 billion spent in fiscal 1992) on the assumption that the NMMC is fully operational and produces approximately 450,000 Sentras. Moreover, Nissan plans to import over $9 million of worth U.S.-made parts and materials in fiscal 1997 ($4.4 million in fiscal 1992) on the assumption that Nissan produces approximately 1.8 million autos a year in Japan. When (then) President Bush visited Japan in January 1992, Nissan set $3.7 billion ($2.9 billion for purchases in the United States and $800 million for import) as its U.S. automobile parts purchase goal for fiscal 1994. In this connection, the actual amount of purchases of U.S.-made parts in fiscal 1993 is likely to reach $3.3 billion. Meanwhile, Nissan intends not to get itself directly involved in campaign for the promotion of sales of imported automobiles. However, at the request of foreign manufacturers, it plans to ask its "keiretsu" dealers to handle foreign-made automobiles. Such Nissan-affiliated dealers in Kanto and Kansai districts as Tokyo Nissan Sales Dealer have announced their plans to deal in U.S. Ford- made automobiles from 1994. In the announcement of its new program, Nissan said that "we have judged that private-sector efforts will lead to preventing international trade friction," thus indicating a stand of drawing a line between its own program and a package of market-opening measures being worked out by the government. Moreover, Nissan stressed "there may be a change in the target figures described in the program if assumed preconditions are not met."
