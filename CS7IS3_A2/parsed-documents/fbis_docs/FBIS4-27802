Security Council resolution which called for a cease-fire in Yemen's month-old civil war, and strongly urged all parties concerned to comply with the resolution. In a Foreign Ministry statement read by spokesman Terusuke Terada, the Japanese Government expressed "deep regret" that large- scale armed conflicts in Yemen, which broke out on May 4, have caused a number of civilian casualties and damaged Yemen's nation- building efforts to which Japan has greatly contributed. Japan has supported the unity and democratization of Yemen and a peaceful settlement of the problems through dialogue among all those concerned, it said. Tokyo supports the U.N. Resolution 924 adopted Wednesday and welcomes Yemen's declaration confirming its acceptance and its readiness to implement the resolution, the statement said. Japan strongly hopes that all those concerned will earnestly comply with the resolution, it said. The socialist South Yemen and conservative North Yemen merged on May 22, 1990. But civil war erupted in early May after months of increasing tension, with southerners accusing the north of trying to dominate the republic.
