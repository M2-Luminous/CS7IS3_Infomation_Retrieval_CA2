Gylys' diplomatic "skills" at one time. He did not escape the attention of the Seimas [parliament] as well. Although the minister remained in office, he stated arrogantly as usual that the operation "fall" [opposition's no-confidence vote] directed against him had failed, and that he had to withdraw from active political life. Judging by certain signs, the key workload has been transferred to Deputy Minister A. Januska, while the minister has confined himself to protocol visits. (For example, he is planning to go to a conference of European Union associate members, although it is not yet clear what he intends to do there -- probably, to show himself and look at others.) However, only the minister himself can perform certain diplomatic functions. For example, to convey a protest to an ambassador of a neighboring country, particularly if one of its trains, loaded with enough armored vehicles to accommodate a battalion, crosses the Lithuanian border. Not only did Russia fail to inform anyone of such a military transit, but the vehicles (this time empty) were accompanied by armed Russian soldiers. Under normal diplomatic circumstances such actions are called armed provocations. Upon learning such facts, the government immediately summons the ambassador of the provocating state to the Foreign Ministry and expresses a harsh protest, regardless of the time of day or night. How did the Lithuanian foreign minister behave under such circumstances? The train with armored vehicles crossed the Lithuanian border on Saturday [19 February]. The Foreign Ministry managed to summon the Russian ambassador only on Tuesday. Instead of expressing a harsh protest, P. Gylys requested (!) that Russia observe the rules of transit in the future. According to our foreign minister, this Russian provocation was only an "unpleasant incident." The minister even managed to find some "positive tendencies" -- it turns out that servicemen are leaving Kaliningrad Oblast rather than entering it, as though there was a shortage of soldiers in Uznemune [reference to Lithuanian territory lying between the Nemunas river and Kaliningrad Oblast]. One may only guess what P. Gylys lacked on Tuesday -- the courage to lodge a protest with Russia or a simple knowledge of diplomatic rules. The minister may have simply forgotten how the chief diplomat of an independent state should behave in such cases....
