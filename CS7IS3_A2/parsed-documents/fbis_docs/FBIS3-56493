Mykola Horyn proposed an approach to this issue not from a political, but from a technical and economic aspect, for nuclear weapons have not only to be stored, but properly serviced too. "These weapons have to be tested. But will Lvov and other oblast councils give permission for underground nuclear explosion tests to be conducted on their territories?" Mykola Horyn posed the question.
