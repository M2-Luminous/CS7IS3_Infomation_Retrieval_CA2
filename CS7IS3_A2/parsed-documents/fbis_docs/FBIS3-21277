He called for a firm resolve to prevail in that dialogue for reaching an agreement which would be consistent with the national interest and responsive to the aspirations of the Moroccan people. Yata, who was speaking at a press conference that was held yesterday in Rabat, said, "The circumstances are right for such an agreement to be reached provided we start our quest with the premise that there are no pending issues which are impervious to solutions." He pointed out that a solution was always possible when the will to find it precedes the effort that is made to find it. The secretary general of the Party of Progress and Socialism pointed out that the general national consensus was that bringing about total change was extremely necessary. He added that the present government had no credibility and that its weakness was evident in the discussion, which is taking place at the present time, about this year's state budget. Not only was its term not extended for an additional month, it seemed also that it might be overtaken by the month of Ramadan, the month of fasting. Yata pointed out that it was the failure to deal with the situation politically that brought the country to this impasse. He said that the forces of change represented the only way for bringing about the radical change that was required. He called for the reorganization of the Unified Front of the Moroccan Opposition Forces, and he asked that the reorganization be conducted without partisan fanaticism, in a spirit of understanding and responsibility. Yata spoke about Morocco. He said that while the country was stable, it was everyone's national duty to concede that the masses in cities and villages were very worried because of the large number of unemployed youth in those cities and villages. Yata confirmed that what can be found deep inside Moroccan society must be taken into account. He pointed out that the outcome [of the current situation] could be unpleasant and that it might be similar to the bloody events which happened in Fes and Tangier on 14 December 1990. He warned that the current situation could lead to the same events. Yata mentioned that his party does not want to take Morocco backwards, but that it is rather the opinion of his party that an effort be made to move beyond the present situation and set the process of change in motion. No one disputes that this process is necessary. Yata said there was nothing new in the statement on democracy that was issued by the three parties of the democratic bloc, the Istiqlal Party, the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, and the Organization of Democratic Popular Action, and he pointed out that there was a set of ideas that these parties had compiled in a document. That statement on democracy was issued on the 50th anniversary of the day on which the document calling for the independence of Morocco was presented. Yata added that as he read that statement, he got no sense of any escalation or justification for the boycott on the part of the three parties. He confirmed that there were ideas he agreed with and others that were debatable, and he said that he would like to discuss those ideas with yesterday's allies.
