FR940414-1-00064 FR940414-1-00010 EPA is proposing to establish NSPS as zero discharge, equivalent to the BAT requirements for existing sources. Zero discharge represents best available and best demonstrated technology for the pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging subcategory as a whole. The economic impact analysis for existing sources shows that this regulatory approach (termed Option 3 in the discussion above) would be economically achievable for the industry. EPA believes that new sources will be able to comply at costs that are similar to or less than the costs for existing sources, because new sources can apply control technologies (including dedicated lines and pressurized hoses for equipment cleaning) more efficiently than sources that need to retrofit for those technologies. EPA's analysis concludes that a zero discharge requirement for new source direct dischargers would be economically achievable and would not be a barrier to entry. EPA is proposing to set pretreatment standards for new sources (which cover indirect dischargers) equivalent to the NSPS standards (which cover direct dischargers), i.e., at zero discharge for all PFPR waste streams. For the reasons stated above with respect to the NSPS standards, EPA finds that the PSNS regulations would be economically achievable and not a barrier to entry. Although EPA has proposed to exempt the non-interior waste streams of the small sanitizers from this zero discharge requirement for existing pretreatment facilities (PSES), EPA is not proposing to include this same exemption for the new source pretreatment facilities (PSNS). The rationale for finding that the exemption for those sanitizer waste streams is appropriate for existing sources is based on EPA's findings that the impacts on existing small entities would be significantly reduced by the exemption while the associated additional loading of toxic pollutants would be small. With respect to new source pretreaters, EPA does not have sufficient information to conclude that the size and economic conditions of those new sources, the impacts on those new sources, and the associated loadings of toxic pollutants, would justify a similar exemption for the non-interior waste streams for sanitizer facilities. EPA solicits comments on these conclusions. In addition, EPA has proposed to set a zero discharge requirement for NSPS, also without any exemption for sanitizers' waste streams, based on the proposal to set BAT at zero discharge for all waste streams and the finding that NSPS should be set at a level at least as stringent as BAT. EPA has stated elsewhere in today's preamble that, based on comments and new information, it would consider varying the final rule to exempt the sanitizers' non-interior waste streams in the BAT regulations as well as in the PSES standards. Even if EPA were to do so, it would be likely that NSPS would still be set at zero discharge without any exemption for sanitizers, for the reasons discussed above as to why EPA is not proposing to include an exemption for sanitizers in the PSNS regulations. B. Repackaging of Agricultural Pesticides Performed by Refilling Establishments (Subcategory E) EPA is proposing to establish NSPS and PSNS as equivalent to the zero discharge BAT requirements for existing sources. Since EPA has determined that zero discharge requirements for existing sources are economically achievable EPA also concludes that NSPS and PSNS regulations would be economically achievable and would not be a barrier to entry for new sources. XIV. Economic Considerations A. Introduction EPA's economic impact assessment is set forth in the report titled ``Economic Impact Analysis of Proposed Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Pesticide Formulating, Packaging, and Repackaging Industry'' (hereinafter ``EIA''). This report estimates the economic effect of compliance with the proposed regulation in terms of facility closures, conversions of production lines to alternate activities, and compliance costs as a percentage of facility revenues. Firm-level impacts, local community impacts, international trade effects, effects on new pesticide formulating, packaging, and repackaging (PFPR) facilities, and estimates of the cost savings of pollution prevention techniques are also presented. A Regulatory Flexibility Analysis detailing the small business impacts for this industry is also included in the EIA. In addition, EPA conducted an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the regulatory options. The report, ``Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Proposed Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards of Performance for the Pesticide Formulating/Packaging/Repackaging Industry'' is included in the record of this rule-making. As previously discussed, projection of economic impacts relies heavily on the responses to the questionnaire distributed to PFPR facilities by EPA under the authority of Section 308 of the Clean Water Act. EPA sent the questionnaire, requesting both technical and economic information, to 707 facilities, representing 3,241 facilities in the population. (See Section V.A.2 for details.) Data from the questionnaires are used to project economic impacts for PFPR facilities using one or more of the 272 pesticide active ingredients (PAIs) or classes of PAIs that were the focus of the survey. As previously mentioned, based on results from the survey, quantitative estimates of PFPR activities were computed for the entire U.S. population of PFPR facilities using the original 272 PAIs considered for regulation. The remainder of the discussion of economic impacts will report only these national stratified estimates, unless otherwise indicated. EPA also performed analyses and developed population-level estimates encompassing the additional PAIs not on the original list of 272 PAIs studied for regulation. The results from these analyses are reported in Preamble Section XIV.L., Assessment of Economic Impacts Including Additional PAIs Not on the Original List of 272 PAIs Studied for Regulation. Except in that section of the Preamble, the economic impact estimates presented in this section pertain only to the use of the 272 PAIs originally studied for regulation. In section XIV.L., the discussion of impact estimates includes the additional (non-272) PAIs to distinguish the findings that encompass the additional PAIs from those presented elsewhere that pertain to the original list of 272 PAIs studied for regulation. The list of 272 PAIs on which this detailed analysis is based matches the list of PAIs considered for regulation in the recent effluent guidelines rulemaking for the pesticide manufacturing industry. (See Section V.A for the derivation of the list of the 272 PAIs.) However, EPA believes that the financial characteristics of the facilities surveyed on the basis of using one or more of the 272 PAIs are representative of the entire PFPR industry, regardless of the particular active ingredients that a facility formulates, packages, or repackages. Based on the responses to the survey, an estimated 2,439 population facilities remained in the PFPR business as of 1990 (the year the Section 308 Economic Survey was conducted). An estimated 1,806 facilities both operate in the PFPR business and use water in their PFPR operations. Six hundred fifty-two of these facilities also discharge PFPR wastewater either directly to bodies of water or to POTWs. These water discharging facilities may be subject to cost increases as a result of today's proposed effluent limitations guidelines and standards. Based on the questionnaire, the 598 facilities for which costs of complying with PSES were estimated all discharge to POTWs. PSES regulations are proposed for two subcategories based on technical and economic differences exhibited between the subcategories: Subcategory C applies to wastewaters containing any pesticide active ingredients (PAIs) except for sodium hypochlorite. Within Subcategory C, a subgroup of chemicals is defined for certain PAIs which are used as sanitizers. 1 The PAIs are listed on Table 8 of the regulation. 1 The term ``sanitizer'' is being defined for the purpose of this effluent guideline regulation and is not intended to classify sanitizers as no longer being pesticides, other than for the purposes of distinguishing their requirements under this regulation. Also, some PAIs other than those PAIs listed in Table 8 of the regulation may be used as sanitizers. The second subcategory, Subcategory E, applies to the wastewater streams generated by refilling establishments that repackage agricultural chemicals and whose principal business is retail sales. The economic basis for creating the subcategories is discussed in the methodology section below. Many other factors including differences in raw materials, geographic locations, plant age, etc. are considered when the Agency subcategorizes an industry. These other factors are discussed in detail in Section 4 of the Technical Development Document. B. Economic Impact Methodology
