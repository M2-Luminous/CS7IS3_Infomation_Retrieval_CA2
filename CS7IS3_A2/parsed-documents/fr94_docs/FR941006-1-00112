Table 3 shows that over 495 of these cases were classified as having ``moderate outcomes,'' and 29 cases were classified as ``major outcomes.'' Again, except for 1992, AAPCC data do not indicate how many of the moderate and major outcomes involved children under 6 years of age. However, for 1992, the single major outcome, and 91 percent (52/57) of the moderate outcomes, involved children under 6 years of age.
