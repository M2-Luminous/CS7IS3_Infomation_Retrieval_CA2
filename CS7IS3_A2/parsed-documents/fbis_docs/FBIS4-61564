The Russian-Tajik joint communique released by the Russian Foreign Ministry said the two leaders had stressed the importance of the first round of the talks between the Tajik government and the Tajik opposition. These talks on national reconciliation bring hope for a peace settlement of the conflict, the statement underlined. Yeltsin supported the position of the Tajik leadership seeking continuation of the dialogue in order to establish a democratic Tajikistan. This requires firm agreements on putting an end to hostilities, on restoration and strengthening of mutual confidence and on free return of all refugees to their native land. The communique emphasized that the parties had been deeply concerned over the tense situation on the Tajik-Afghan border and in Afghanistan and over the continuing armed provocations from Afghan territory which threatened security in the whole region. The parties urged the Afghan military-political groups to seek peace and accord in the country and to create atmosphere of cooperation between the region's countries. Yeltsin and Rakhmonov pointed out the important stabilizing role played by the joint peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan. They said joint efforts on defense of the southern borders and primarily of the Tajik-Afghan section conformed with the interests of all CIS states. When discussing economic cooperation between Russia and Tajikistan, Rakhmonov asked the Russian leadership to speed up consideration of the issue on merging of the two countries' monetary systems. He confirmed that Tajikistan was carrying out its obligations on establishment of a single financial space. It was decided that the Tajik and the Russian governments would continue to work on the issue. Russia said it was ready to continue economic and humanitarian aid to Tajikistan and to enhance cooperation between the two countries in order to develop their economic potential and to meet social needs of the Tajik population.
