The launch of a ``Start'' communicaitons satellite demonstrated the Topol's unique resources in the peaceful uses of outer space. A heavy-duty communications satellite is to be launched soon, Zhuravlyov said. Within the framework of Russian defence-industry conversion to civilian uses, experts consider the possibility of using the test site facilities for participation in commercial launchings, in which many countries show interest. If only initial funding, which will subsequently bring in revenue quickly, is essential for implementing conversion programmes. The allocation of funds for the needs of the state test site of the SMF has been now reduced to the minimum, Zhuravlyov lamented.
