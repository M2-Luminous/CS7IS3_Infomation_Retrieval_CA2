The year's GDP growth rate breaks down into four percent for the primary industry, 20.4 percent for the secondary industry, and 9.3 percent for the tertiary industry. The rural economy saw overall growth last year, with the output of grain and oil bearing crops hitting an all-time high.

Township and village enterprises reported continued vigorous growth, and their development accelerated in the central and western regions of the country, he said. The nation's industry produced a total added value of 1,414 billion yuan, up 21.1 percent over the previous year. This growth rate breaks down into 22.2 percent for heavy industry and 19.9 percent for light industry. The output of major products continued to grow last year. During the year China produced 1.141 billion tons of coal, 144 million tons of crude oil, 820 billion kwh of electricity, and 88.68 million tons of steel. In 1993 total investment in fixed assets nationwide was 1182.9 billion yuan, 147.9 percent of the planned figure and up 50.6 percent over the previous year. Allowing for price rises, the growth rate was 22 percent, he said. There were big increases in investment for transport and telecommunications sectors, he said. Economic, trade and technological exchanges with foreign countries continued to expand last year, he said. The country's imports and exports reached 195.8 billion U.S. dollars in value, up 18.2 percent over 1992. Exports were worth 91.8 billion U.S. dollars, up eight percent, and imports 104 billion U.S. dollars, up 29 percent. Use of foreign funds increased substantially last year, Chen said.

Of this amount, 25.76 billion U.S. dollars was in the form of direct investment from foreign businesses, 1.3 times the previous year's. Foreign loans actually used amounted to 10.8 billion U.S. dollars, up 36.5 percent. "The pattern of investment by foreign businesses improved, with increased investment in long- and medium-term projects," he said.
