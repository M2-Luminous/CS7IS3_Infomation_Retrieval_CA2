Korean Puppets' 'Nuclear' Clamour For?" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today throws light on what the South Korean puppets are really seeking in raising a hue and cry over "the nuclear issue" of the North, following outside forces. The analyst says: Clear is the purpose of the South Korean puppets in getting frantic in their "nuclear" clamour, tailing behind foreign forces. They seek to isolate the North in the international arena, find a pretext for another war against the North, stifle it with the help of outside forces and gratify their design to "unify the country by invading the North." They also seek to divert the attention of the people elsewhere and dull the people's discontent with them by the "nuclear" clamor, thus saving the ever-worsening crisis of their rule. Their "nuclear" clamour is, in the final analysis, an intolerable criminal act to prop up the power by leaving the nation to the mercy of big powers. Their "nuclear" clamour is designed to facilitate their nuclear arms development and impede the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The nuclear armament of the South Korean puppet clique, along with Japan's, has entered a grave stage, creating quite a stir in the world. It is nobody's secret that South Korea is developing nuclear weapons. Reporting about the development of nuclear weapons by South Korea, newspapers of the United States, Britain and other countries said plutonium stockpiled by South Korea amounted to ten tons and it would reach about 24 tons around the year 2000. The Kim Yong-sam group, however, has balked the DPRK- U.S. talks, fooling world public opinion over the "nuclear issue" of the North, which reminds us of a thief crying "stop thief!" This is aimed at obstructing a solution to the nuclear issue at the DPRK- U.S. talks to keep South Korea under the U.S. "nuclear umbrella" and accelerate the nuclear arms development under it. But, the South Korean puppets have nothing to get in the "nuclear" clamour. They must clearly understand that their treacherous acts in playing the role of a shock brigade in the "nuclear" clamour of the imperialist reactionaries and fooling the nation will bring themselves to destruction.
