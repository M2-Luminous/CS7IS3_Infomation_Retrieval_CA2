Medved, Kiev; UDC 614.717:628.16]-072.7] [Abstract] The advantages and characteristic features of the use of biotesting for assessing the water quality are outlined, and the concept of hygienic significance which denotes toxicity to humans is introduced. For illustration, the effect of imported pesticides on Daphnia magna is investigated using draft GOST guidelines. The GOST approach is compared to the EPA and other procedures, and the acute toxic effect of the Maveric pesticide on Daphnia magna is summarized. The differences in the methods under study are discussed. The comparative analysis makes it possible to speculate that the methodological approaches to water quality assessment with the help of biotesting need further improvement but the findings are still insufficient for drawing definitive conclusions about the role of biotesting within the system of standard sanitary water quality control.
