FR940630-1-00045 FR940630-1-00011 8. Section 23.925 is amended by revising the introductory text to read as follows: §23.925 Propeller clearance. Unless smaller clearances are substantiated, propeller clearances, with the airplane at the most adverse combination of weight and center of gravity, and with the propeller in the most adverse pitch position, may not be less than the following: * * * * * §23.929 [Amended] 9. Section 23.929 is amended by removing the word ``power'' and adding, in its place, the word ``thrust.'' 10. Section 23.933 is amended by removing the word ``forward'' where ever it appears in paragraph (a)(3); by revising the reference in paragraph (b)(2) that reads ``(a)(1)'' to read ``(b)(1)''; and by revising paragraph (a)(1) to read as follows: §23.933 Reversing systems. (a) *␣*␣* (1) Each system intended for ground operation only must be designed so that, during any reversal in flight, the engine will produce no more than flight idle thrust. In addition, it must be shown by analysis or test, or both, that_ (i) Each operable reverser can be restored to the forward thrust position; or (ii) The airplane is capable of continued safe flight and landing under any possible position of the thrust reverser. * * * * * 11. Section 23.955 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) to read as follows: §23.955 Fuel flow. (a) *␣*␣* (1) The quantity of fuel in the tank may not exceed the amount established as the unusable fuel supply for that tank under §23.959(a) plus that necessary to show compliance with this section. (2) If there is a fuel flowmeter, it must be blocked during the flow test and the fuel must flow through the meter or its bypass. (3) If there is a flowmeter without a bypass, it must not have any probable failure mode that would restrict fuel flow below the level required in this fuel demonstration. (4) The fuel flow must include that flow needed for vapor return flow, jet pump drive flow, and for all other purposes for which fuel is used. * * * * * 12. Section 23.959 is amended by designating the text of the section as paragraph (a), and by adding a new paragraph (b) to read as follows: §23.959 Unusable fuel supply. * * * * * (b) The effect on the unusable fuel quantity as a result of a failure of any pump shall be determined. 13. Section 23.963 is amended by revising the reference in paragraph (e) that reads ``§23.959'' to read ``§23.959(a)'' and by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: §23.963 Fuel tanks: general. * * * * * (b) Each flexible fuel tank liner must be shown to be suitable for the particular application. * * * * * 14. Section 23.965 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(3)(i) to read as follows: §23.965 Fuel tank tests. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (3) *␣*␣* (i) If no frequency of vibration resulting from any r.p.m. within the normal operating range of engine or propeller speeds is critical, the test frequency of vibration is the number of cycles per minute obtained by multiplying the maximum continuous propeller speed in r.p.m. by 0.9 for propeller-driven airplanes, except that for non-propeller driven airplanes the test frequency of vibration is 2,000 cycles per minute. * * * * * 15. Section 23.973(f) is revised to read as follows: §23.973 Fuel tank filler connection. * * * * * (f) For airplanes with turbine engines, the inside diameter of the fuel filler opening must be no smaller than 2.95 inches. 16. Section 23.975(a)(5) is revised to read as follows: §23.975 Fuel tank vents and carburetor vapor vents. (a) *␣*␣* (5) There may be no point in any vent line where moisture can accumulate with the airplane in either the ground or level flight attitudes, unless drainage is provided. Any drain valve installed in the vent lines must discharge clear of the airplane and be accessible for drainage; * * * * * 17. Section 23.979(b) is revised to read as follows: §23.979 Pressure fueling systems. * * * * * (b) An automatic shutoff means must be provided to prevent the quantity of fuel in each tank from exceeding the maximum quantity approved for that tank. This means must_
