What they have criticized above all is that the constitutionally necessary tax-free status of minimum incomes has not been considered and the fact that the Nuremberg Federal Office of Labor's budget is too low. Waigel stressed that the government will firmly adhere to consolidating the budget over the next few years. The overall minimum expenditure that has been agreed for 1994 will be remain. Despite increasing signs of economic recovery, there is no basis for relaxing fiscal policy. CSU politicians have once again rejected an increase in taxes and dues. Johann Eekhoff, state secretary in the federal Economic Ministry, has reported that one can expect a increase in Germany's real economic growth of between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent. An increase of about 3 percent should be possible in the years 1995 to 1998.
