Speaking at the organization's annual meeting, its president He Luli said that during the past two years the association has helped conduct economic and trade activities in various forms and through different channels, thus greatly promoting economic and trade co-operation between Beijing and the rest of the world. The association, currently composed of 20 members of the city's industrial, commercial, trade and service companies, aims to tighten economic and trade connections between the members and their overseas counterparts. It also has 12 overseas advisers in Hong Kong, the United States, Britain, Thailand, the Netherlands, and other countries and regions. During the past two years the association has received over 2,300 overseas economic, scientific, technical and financial personnel as well as 26 economic and trade inspection teams. The visits have helped conclude agreements on joint-venture projects involving hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars, the president said. At a 1992 exchange fair sponsored by the association more than 130 overseas Chinese entrepreneurs from 15 countries and regions, including the U.S., Japan, Britain, Indonesia and Hong Kong and Macao, signed more than 130 contracts, agreements and letters of intent with Beijing's large and medium state-owned enterprises, involving direct overseas investment of over 35 million U.S dollars. The association, exploiting its vast network of connections overseas, has so far helped more than 80 enterprises in the city build up ties with their counterparts abroad. It also invites overseas experts and scholars to chair seminars and give lectures on quality management and commercial law for the city's economic and trade professionals. He Luli held that such exchanges have helped push Chinese companies and products onto the world market and improved their competitiveness. The president said that this year the association is going to invite more overseas advisers and renowned personages to Beijing for business exchanges and trade talks. Meanwhile, it will designate team members to carry out business activities in Europe, Southeast Asia and other parts of the world.
