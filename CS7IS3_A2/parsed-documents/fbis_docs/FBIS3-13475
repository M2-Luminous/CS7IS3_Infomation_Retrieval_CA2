This contradictory stand once again shows the U.S. double-standard in its approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The results of the official investigation clearly point to the direct or indirect involvement of the Israeli Army, if not the government and its prime minister, in this act of killing and terrorism. Thus, the talk about peace and the resumption of the peace process in accordance with the previous bases is just an attempt to mark time and to cushion the great shock brought about by the massacre of the worshipers in the blessed al-Ibrahimi Mosque on the Palestinian, Arab, Islamic, and international levels. By procrastinating and obstructing the passage of a UN resolution condemning the massacre and adopting a mechanism to prevent its recurrence, the United States has exposed its desperate attempt to waste time and cover up for the crime and its perpetrators. It is an attempt by the United States to shirk its responsibility toward what happened. Its shy stands on settlements and settlers, and the question of supplying them with money and weapons are well known. It is not strange that the principal perpetrator of the crime is a U.S. citizen who was brought up in Brooklyn and was nurtured on terrorism and racism there like many other Jewish terrorists. It goes without saying that the stand adopted by Russia, which is the second cosponsor of the peace conference, and the efforts it has exerted, irrespective of their motives and objectives, deserve praise. The same applies to the European stand, which deserves to be emulated by Washington in an effort by the international community and international legitimacy to restore Palestinian rights and land to their legitimate owners and end the injustice, trials, and terrorism from which the Palestinian people have been suffering for so long.
