Here is the entire interview. BMD team: "Sir, your 11 June 1994 interview with Nate Thayer will please many compatriots and displease and offend other Cambodians, who dread your return to power. What will you do to reassure the honorable Cambodian personalities currently in power that it is not your intention to return to power? Norodom Sihanouk: "I wish to reassure our current leaders in fact on my so-called "possible return to power." My age, health, and personal interest will not push me into [words indistinct] (?power) which brings me only deception, unpleasantness, extreme fatigue, and great dangers. I only answered a specific question from Nate Thayer who spoke to me about the case in which Cambodia (?and its) people were desperate and in mortal danger. In such a case, I was asked by Nate Thayer, would I let Cambodia and the Cambodian people die without trying to save them. To be frank, I answered no. I would prefer to die while trying to help save my fatherland and my people rather than to die on my hospital bed in Beijing. So, I gave Nate Thayer some details of my "political program" in case I was called upon by our current leaders (N.A. and the RGC) [National Assembly and the Royal Government of Cambodia] to ensure the rescue of Cambodia for one or two years. Well, "the Cambodian ship" will not sink anytime soon, despite serious damage. Therefore, we do not at all need a rescuer... [ellipsis as received] even one named Sihanouk. The only plan I have "in mind" seriously is not my return (not wished and not desirable) to power, but rather a new 35-mm film entitled "an apostle of non-violence" for which I will write the scenario and dialogues. This was inspired by the admirable action of Samdech Preah Khousananda and a venerable Khmer (?monk) killed by the Khmer Rouge during the third Thammyeatra [peace march by Buddhist monks]. So, I hope that our current leaders (whom I support and will always affectionately support) will not give too much importance to my so-called "plan" in case I was forced to "return to power." There is only one possibility in a thousand that such a case will present itself.
