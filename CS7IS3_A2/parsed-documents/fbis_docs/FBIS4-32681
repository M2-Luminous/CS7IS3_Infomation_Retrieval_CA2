Grlickov: "Money: Indication of Changes"] [Text] Bank liquidity has deteriorated suddenly because the banks have half the funds (70 million dinars) in giro accounts than in their previous "fatter condition" because of the measures taken by the central bank. Since the greatest debate at present is about furnishing money for the purchase of agricultural products, the impression has been created that bank liquidity is dropping because of the outflow from accounts for those purposes. Now, this could be a partial explanation. The season for the principal purchases in agriculture (wheat) has not yet arrived, and the job of "covering" seasonal fruit and vegetables is coming to a close. (Union Bank had a share of 30 percent in financing transactions that bring considerable export results.) Bank liquidity is dropping, above all as a consequence of money withdrawn from circulation because foreign exchange has been purchased with the reserves of the National Bank. The slowness with which that foreign exchange is effectuated (providing imports) is another question; this can mainly be attributed to the sanctions and less to speculative operations related to the outflow of capital abroad. The fundamental commitment in the Avramovic program of supplying the money in circulation from real sources, that is, with coverage by foreign exchange, gold, and goods -- is not for the moment in jeopardy. But this policy of sound money, as Governor Dragoslav Avramovic said himself in the meeting with people from the Yugoslav-Swiss Bank, has its limits. First of all, we cannot assume that the state will be able to supply foreign exchange indefinitely to cover budget deficits, which include purchases from agriculture. That is why the governor is insisting that the budget deficit be eliminated entirely as of 24 July, so that expenditures are covered entirely by taxes (a broader coverage of taxpayers at a somewhat lower tax rate). At the same time, the state could borrow on the capital market, but absolutely not from the National Bank in the form of credit supplied from primary issue. This ought to be done through the sale of government bonds, whose sales on the market should be sign to the central bank as to the extent that the budget deficits can be covered with real funds. The tax system is the second vital area whose importance to the success of the program the governor is stressing. The most acute problem is the tying of taxes to wages and salaries, which is resulting in the phenomenon of "double payrolls": the one on which the taxes are charged and the other, which is paid in cash. It is the system that is driving the state to increase wages and salaries, since total tax collections depend on that. It is still uncertain whether primary note issue will be used to cover wheat purchases, which, according to some calculations, will require 320 million dinars in July and August. The model proposed by the Federal Government precludes primary note issue; the banks would have to supply 80 percent and the purchasers 20 percent. The banks would provide most of the funds from federal or republic deposits, and they would use the legal reserves to a lesser extent. Statements to the effect that there will not be any adverse monetary effects are based on the assumption that the federal state and the republics have deposits in the banks from real sources, while use of the legal reserves (the remaining 5 percent which the banks set aside against sight deposits) is not considered an inflationary source, or it is assumed that the effect on this basis will be canceled out in some way, say, by withdrawal of money from circulation through the purchase of foreign exchange. One particular problem is that payments based on purchases in agriculture would follow a protracted schedule: 30 percent would be paid immediately, while 70 percent would go into savings accounts in time deposits for 30 or 60 days. It would have been better to use securities, commercial commodity bills or notes, as elements for speeding up financial markets. The greatest doubts about realization of the Avramovic program center on the fact that the banks seem not to be able to count on repayment of outstanding credits (about 1,070 billion dinars as of end-May) as a source for making new loans. Governor Avramovic does not deny the existence of that problem, nor did he earlier, but he mentions that he himself does not know what the figures are on the extent of uncollectibility (money has gone, for instance, to pay wages and salaries), nor how much was loaned out for longer terms than allowed by sight deposits -- but for the first time he mentioned as a problem the inefficiency of the system, which arises in connection with the approval of loans and use of money from the banks. To be sure, he does not say this explicitly, but indirectly, giving as an example the deteriorated situation in the German economy following unification of the Western and Eastern parts. The question is whether the otherwise desirable increase of wages and salaries of those who are productively employed will be sufficient shock absorbers to offset the adverse consequences of possible social unrest. In any case, primary note issue must be precluded as a way out, since the limits within which it could be given real coverage are very narrow.
