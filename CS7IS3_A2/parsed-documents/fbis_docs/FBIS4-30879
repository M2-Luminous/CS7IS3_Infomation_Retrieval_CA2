However, it is certain that a government change will take place: The hitherto determining government party will go into opposition and the MSZP, which has so far been in opposition will come to government -- alone or with a coalition partner. "What happened here?" Analysts and politicians are asking this and will be doing so for a long time. Although -- presumably -- the majority of society is more interested in the question "what will happen," it is not at all insignificant to give a correct answer to the first question. The practical answer to the second question depends to a large extent on whether the politicians -- winners and losers alike -- draw the right conclusions from the final results of the elections. In my view, it is a big mistake to say that the "people" -- although it is probably more precise to say that the majority of electors -- made its decision in an ideological war, namely that it chose the left wing or socialism, perhaps liberalism, as opposed to the right wing, the national group, conservatism, or Christianity. At most, half of the electors can be characterized by these ideological definitions. With suitable generosity, the 30 percent who voted for the losers can be listed among these, and some 10 percent each from the camps of the winners, people who supported their parties even in bad times. However, the change of government was decided by the other 50 percent. They decided it in such a way that they did not concurrently become socialists or left-wing liberals, rather, they had simply had enough of the failures -- or what was seen as such -- of the government, the deteriorating living standards -- or what was perceived as such -- and politicians spending their time on debates that are uninteresting for them. These citizens were not interested in either rational or emotional explanations: reference to the "forty years" or the past in the reprisal forces, the national or the Christian slogans. Is this due to the people being wise, as it is said by those who, even months ago, scared people with the right-wing extremists' coming to power, assuming that it is possible to deceive them with national demagogy, anti-Semitism, and other wild ideas. Or is it because they are stupid, stupefied, and can be misled, as is resentfully believed by some of the current losers who used to be talk loudly about the people's wisdom. I very much doubt that the "people" are able to change their character and abilities so quickly. Something else must be the reason. I suspect practical considerations behind the decision. The past four years have not met their expectations. However, if I think about the results of public opinion polls, I can also say that at least one side of their decision was made in the few months following the change of the regime. However, at that time -- let us remember -- their wishes were projected into the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]. It is a different matter why this party did not manage to keep its sympathizers and why they have moved on, searching for an alternative to the government -- it is the Fidesz that will first have to find the answer to this. What is important for me now is that about half of the electors did not choose between the alternative world views or the political alternatives, they did not join any political camps. Whether this is wise or stupid behavior, it should be discussed by the politicians and intellectuals divided according to trends -- or I could say, the camps. However, politicians -- if they wish to be successful -- have to face facts whether they are winners or losers. The reason is that it is not certain that the migration has ended: It is possible that it will very soon -- perhaps again within months -- be restarted. This is the nature of practical decisions linked to situations. Precisely because ideological or value affiliations play little role in these decisions, they are not linked to traditions and not even to personal trust in the leaders chosen by the people themselves. The correctness of the decision is measured by the results: If they do not prove forthcoming then the decision can be changed without hesitation. Therefore, it would be a mistake to believe that the electors have finally or at least lastingly found their places in the political camps. In this sense, the process of the development of party affiliations has not ended. Therefore, the most we can say is that the parties that see themselves on the left have won because the electors voted on them, but it would be very risky to say that these electors are on the left. It is not at all certain that the future governmental activities determined by the goals and scope of the winning party (or parties) coincide with the desires of the "migrating voters," and if they do not, whether this party (or parties) can bind these people to themselves. It is possible -- in fact, likely -- that even if these people do place themselves on the right to left or socialist-liberal to conservative scale, or on any ideological or world view scale, then this is not identical with the notions the parties themselves have. Naturally, we have no reason to assume that the process of developing party affiliations will not progress -- after all, about half of the electors have managed to find their places in four years and they are indeed linked to various parties on the basis of interests, sentiments, trust, and even values, and not only promises. It would be more difficult for them to change their affiliations, the spectacular success or failure of their parties would be needed for their "enlightenment" on the road to Damascus. Their number might even increase. However, it is difficult to imagine that ideological motives would be needed for the majority of the very practically thinking 50 percent to do this. Another version seems to be more credible: If experience justifies their choice, then confidence is formed, and binding to the party, its value system, and ideology also emerge. And then traditions, political families, and stable voting camps are also formed. If I am correct then this has only happened to a certain extent up to now. The new government and the politicians who come to power will have to be aware of this. What kind of decisions they make in the knowledge of this is precisely where their great responsibility lies. Decisions whose single aim is to keep the mass support -- which might cost the country dearly -- or decisions that are demanded by the country's best interest according to the circumstances, their best abilities, and conscience. Now, to be consciously naive, I add that the opposition also has a responsibility. It might happen in such a way that it would be very easy to take revenge. However, they will have to assess the value and cost of things. I do not believe that a new era is beginning with the change of government. However, when something new begins, optimism is compulsory. Therefore, I hope that the majority of our politicians have learned something from the experience of the past four years -- wherever they were or will be in parliament -- and at least they will not make the same mistakes too often.
