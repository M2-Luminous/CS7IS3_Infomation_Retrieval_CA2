The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that the Kurdish drivers of the two trucks admitted that they crossed the border from Iran and intended to drive the two trucks to areas under the control of the Iraqi Government and deliver them to an Iraqi party known to them. Officials of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], led by Jalal Talabani, said on Saturday that during the night 17-18 April the Kurdish police impounded the two trucks, which were carrying 19 tons of sodium phosphate, which is used in the production of chemical weapons, and mustard gas, and that "the consignment was exported from the PRC and passed through a country neighboring Iraq." The Kurdish sources said that the two trucks were seized in the area of Darbandikhan, which is only a few kilometers from the Iraqi-Iranian border. They declined to give more details because "the interrogation of the two drivers is not over yet." Under the second Gulf war cease-fire terms, Iraq is not allowed to produce, import, or use chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons, or long-range missiles or materials used in the manufacture of such missiles.
