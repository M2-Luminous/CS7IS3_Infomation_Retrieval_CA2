The People's Alliance Designs an Institution of Direct Democracy"] [Text] Leaders of the People's Alliance held a press conference in the State Duma yesterday on budget and economic policy matters. Journalists were also presented with a draft federal law, On People's Legislative Initiative. This draft should "for the first time give Russia's citizens the right to submit a particular law to parliament by raising signatures." This draft federal law has been moved in the State Duma by People's Alliance member Muravyev, who in a note of explanation cites the experience of such an institution of "direct democracy" in many countries, for instance, Switzerland, Italy, and Brazil. Characteristically, the proposed draft grants the right of legislative initiative to groups of no less than 1 million citizens. This deprives the draft of much of its relevance but shows an evolution in public relations methods characteristic of a competitive political environment where there is not always room for formations like the People's Alliance. Perhaps the most substantive part of the press conference was a statement by Sergey Glazyev, State Duma Economic Policy Committee chairman, who expressed his attitude to the budget approved on the first reading and the results of the vote. In Sergey Glazyev's opinion the government did not introduce any significant changes into the budget, limiting itself to local adjustments, such as: increasing the budget deficit, raising privatization revenues by a trillion, and so forth. Glazyev sees the budget policy underlying the approved draft as consisting in the distribution of resources between the fuel and energy and the agro-industrial complexes. At the same time it fails to take into account the priorities of supporting science-intensive industry and promoting conversion which were set forth in the presidential message. There is still a glaring contradiction between the government forecast which was used as a basis for the estimate and the actual decline in industry, which twice exceeds the estimates made at the budget formulation stage. The Economic Policy Committee chairman describes the volumes of recession themselves as an all-time record for Russia (25 percent in the first half) since the Civil War. Glazyev believes that as a result of the current policy a real threat is emerging to Russia's economic sovereignty. "Even if we decided that we do not need a science-intensive industry, the budget does not provide for any production mothballing funds anyway," Sergey Glazyev stated. This "oversight" in its turn leads to unprepared stoppages of enterprises, which increases the number of industrial accidents. There are still no changes in the investment sphere: equipment obsolescence is on average approximately 60 percent. Sergey Glazyev supposes that "it is time to start closing the gaps." He drew the audience's attention to those expenditures on which he thinks financing should be increased (defense orders, communications, investment projects, education and culture) and also revenues raising, which could lead to problems. In particular this refers to revenues from the state property in state ownership, the abolition of concessions in foreign economic activity, and improving import control (Sergey Glazyev estimates the volume of smuggling, on which tariffs could be charged, at $5 billion). Also, taking a short-term view, the Duma economist proposed suspending the privatization of the Russian joint stock company Gazprom, whose annual revenues come to $7 billion. Assessing the results of the voting on the draft budget in the first reading, Sergey Glazyev justly pointed to a lack of constructive opposition in parliament ("some pretend that they pursue liberalization, and others that they do not approve of this line"), which results in the invariability of the existing policy. Glazyev's statement at the press conference was followed by a presentation from Veniamin Sokolov, author of an alternative draft budget. Mr. Sokolov expressed his extreme dissatisfaction with the fall in the rate of inflation because each percentage point is paid for with 5 percent of production. Having made some reasonable propositions about the problems of monetary circulation in Russia, Veniamin Sokolov stated that he could ensure a doubling of budget revenues as early as the end of this year if a tax reform and a corresponding credit and money policy were conducted.
