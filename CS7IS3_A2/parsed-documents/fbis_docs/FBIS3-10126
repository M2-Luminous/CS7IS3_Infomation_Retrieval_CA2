Consequently, the bank has proposed a plan whereby producers would store their crops in silos specially prepared by BANADES. A Certificate of Deposit, with a Guarantee Certificate in favor of BANADES attached, would be issued in the producer's name. Because the producer requires some time to market his crop, BANADES will take the Guarantee Certificate and issue Finance Certificates that would be offered to private banks at competitive rates. Private banks will buy the Finance Certificate. The BANADES loan portfolio thus would become healthy and money would be available either to finance the industrial plants willing to buy the production or to help producers find their own ways of marketing their crops, in or outside the country while the new production cycle is in progress.
