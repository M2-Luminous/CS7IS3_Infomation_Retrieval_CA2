A new accounting system adopted by the State Statistical Bureau to "more accurately reflect hidden losses" showed that 49.6 percent of the firms were operating in the red, with total losses in the first three months reaching 15.7 billion yuan (HK$13.94 billion). The number of loss-making enterprises last year under the old accounting system was 33 percent. But the new tax system had resulted in many of the previously profitable enterprises now showing losses, said State Statistical Bureau spokesman Ye Zhen. Industrial production from the state sector only rose by 2.2 percent in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year, while overall industrial production increased by 16 percent to 533 billion yuan. The poor economic performance of the state sector had led to a significant decline in profits and a dramatic increase in debt defaults, Mr Ye said. Analysts said the new figures showed just how badly the state sector was suffering during the Government's attempts to institute market orientated reforms. A Western economic analyst said: "State run enterprises are clearly failing to keep up with the pace of economic reform. I think the Government will now be forced to slow down those reforms until the enterprises are better equipped to deal with the situation. "The fundamental problem remains the lack of any real social security system to take care of laid off workers and, until that is put in place, very little can be achieved." Despite the dramatic slowdown of growth in the state sector, the economy as a whole continued to maintain the double digit growth of the previous two years. The gross domestic product for the first three months reached 862 billion yuan, a 12.7 percent increase over the same period last year. Mr Ye pointed out, however, that once seasonal factors such as the relatively high proportion industrial production to agricultural production were taken into account, actual growth could have already slowed down to the Government's target of about nine to 10 percent. Inflation, however, remains a major headache for the Government, and Mr Ye said controlling price rises would be the primary responsibility for officials at all levels this year. The national retail price index rose by 20.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year, while prices in the 35 major towns and cities increased by 24.6 percent. The highest level of inflation was recorded in Haikou the capital of Hainan Island, where prices shot up by 34 percent in the first quarter. Nanjing and Urumqi also recorded inflation of above 30 percent, while prices in Beijing and Shanghai increased by 24.1 percent and 23.3 percent respectively. Urban inflation was primarily driven by rapid increases in the prices of daily necessities and as such local governments would conduct regular checks on the prices of food and services to en sure that inflation was kept at a tolerable level, Mr Ye said. He was quick to point out, however, that both urban and rural incomes were increasing at a faster rate than inflation. The average monthly income of urban residents increased by 35.5 percent in the first quarter, or 9.3 percent when inflation was taken into account, while rural income shot up by 31.1 percent in the first three months an increase of 13.1 percent in real terms. This was the first time in three years that increases in rural income had outpaced urban income in real terms but Mr Ye said regional disparities in the level of income continued to increase. "Because of high price rises in the cities, particularly increases in food prices, a few low income households have been unable to make ends meet and are experiencing difficulties in their lives," he said.
