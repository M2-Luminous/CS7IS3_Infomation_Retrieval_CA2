L. 92&hyph;463 as amended) notice is hereby given that a meeting of the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Panel of the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities will be held at 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20506, in room 730, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., on Friday, May 6, 1994. The purpose of the meeting is to review applications for Certificates of Indemnity submitted to the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities for exhibitions beginning after July 1, 1994. Because the proposed meeting will consider financial and commercial data and because it is important to keep values of objects, methods of transportation and security measures confidential, pursuant to the authority granted me by the Chairman's Delegation of Authority to Close Advisory Committee Meetings, dated July 19, 1993, I have determined that the meeting would fall within exemptions (4) and (9) of 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and that it is essential to close the meeting to protect the free exchange of views and to avoid interference with the operations of the Committee. It is suggested that those desiring more specific information contact the Advisory Committee Management Officer, David Fisher, 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20506, or call 202/606&hyph;8322.
