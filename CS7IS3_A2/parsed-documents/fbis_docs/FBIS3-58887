The resolution was proposed by the center-right and Greens and was passed with 109 in favor, 90 against and 13 abstentions. The text of the resolution sharply criticised the "strategy and lack of success for the part of the United Nations and European Union negotiators, who constantly sought to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina on an ethnic basis, despite the fact that it was a member state of the United Nations". The Socialist group, which holds the majority in the Strasbourg Assembly, voted against the resolution which also called for the re-opening of the Tuzla airport, in central Bosnia, and for an `active' intervention for the part of international forces to protect the `security zones' drawn up by the United Nations and to end the strangle-hold on Sarajevo. According to the backers of today's resolution, United Nations peace-keeping forces (UNPROFOR) should be modified "into a force capable of making peace, given that it has failed in its effort to keep peace." Owen yesterday voiced his pessimism over the latest EU-UN plan for Bosnia, remarking how now even the Muslins were using the peace talks as a tool to buy time and reconquer territory.
