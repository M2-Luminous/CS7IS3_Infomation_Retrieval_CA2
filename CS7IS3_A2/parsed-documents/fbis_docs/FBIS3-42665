As a result, VEB clients will be given an opportunity to get back their foreign exchange funds without moral loss or waste of time, while the banks will be able to perceptibly increase their volume of outside funds. This is why the number of banks offering such services keeps growing. For example, yesterday the VEB signed an official contract with the National Credit Bank which gives the latter's clients preferential right to the return of funds from the VEB. Despite about 10 banks now actively providing the service of transferring the funds of private individuals from the VEB, only two of them, the Savings Bank and National Credit, have official contracts with the VEB. The existence of a contract means that requests by private individuals to have funds transferred from the VEB to accounts at the Savings Bank or National Credit will be met on a priority basis. This operation is effected on the basis of a general sequence for banks that do not have such agreements (in particular, one of these banks is the Moscow branch of the Tveruniversalbank, which has been carrying out a vigorous campaign for the transfer of funds of VEB clients since the fall of 1993). A client of the National Credit Bank must open an account at the bank and draw up the requisite petition in order to receive his funds from the VEB. National Credit guarantees the transfer of funds within six days; in the process, the owner of the funds is charged 1 percent of the amount as a commission to benefit the VEB. Foreign exchange funds may be placed in a current account or on deposit. The amount received may be withdrawn from a current account in cash, in full or in part (in this case, the commission comes to 1.5 percent), transferred to an account at another bank (a transfer within the CIS will cost a client $5, transfer abroad--$10). The bank will credit between 6.5 and 9.5 percent annually to the balance in the account. The profit of clients from the placement of foreign exchange funds transferred from the VEB to deposits ranges between 7 and 16 percent. In addition to traditional opportunities, clients of the National Credit Bank may purchase OLBI-Cards with funds received from the VEB. The minimum amount necessary to receive the card comes to $300 (annual interest on the deposit accrues at an annual rate of 9.5 percent), plus $14 which is the price put on the card itself. When cash is withdrawn with an OLBI-Card, a 5 percent commission is charged. When goods are purchased, the owner of the card gets a 10 percent discount. [Boxed item] Commentary At present there are more than 3,000 petitions to transfer funds to other banks in the general card file of the VEB, and the number of petitions keeps growing. On average, transfers of funds on 400 petitions are effected during one banking day. However, despite an increase in the number of banks that offer their clients the service of transferring funds from the VEB, most depositors still prefer to get cash funds right away rather than use to this end accounts opened at other banks. In particular, a permanent waiting line of former VEB clients who wish to receive cash funds before the department of current accounts of the bank testifies to this. The opportunity for signing up to receive cash funds ahead of time does not improve the situation much because only about 250 clients of the VEB may sign up daily.
