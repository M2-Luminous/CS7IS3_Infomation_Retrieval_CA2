The pilot has two minutes to take off for this air patrol exercise. We will talk with Lieutenant Colonel Sandino Fernandez, deputy chief of the base, in the meantime. This type of unit consumes a lot of fuel, lubricants, and electricity. How do you manage to maintain a high degree of combat training and readiness with only one-third of the energy resources? [Fernandez] First, many of the problems that we used to solve through consuming energy are now solved through our comrades' ingenuity and intelligence. We have developed flight simulators that cost pennies to operate to maintain training levels comparable to years ago. [Gonzalez] I want to tell our listeners that the MiG-29 motor is already running and that Major Chamizo is aboard. [Fernandez] The simulators save having to conduct flights, which cost between $6,000 and $7,000. They make it possible to train the pilots -- although without the psychological impact of a real flight -- on the ground for pennies. It costs about one or two cents in terms of electricity, even with the new electric fees. [Gonzalez] The air patrol is taking off. It has been one minute and 50 seconds since the alert call came in. Of course, our pilots conduct real flight exercises to maintain their proficiency. Several related tasks are conducted in every exercise to conserve resources. [Fernandez] We have developed devices, modeled on the bicycle gear, that allow us to forego the use of trucks, trucks used to charge batteries, and trucks used to cool the air on the airplanes. We have mounted air tanks and air conditioning equipment on bicycles and tricycles. This allows us to prepare the equipment without using fuel. We have also managed to reduce electric consumption to a minimum. We use electricity only in those instances when it is necessary.
