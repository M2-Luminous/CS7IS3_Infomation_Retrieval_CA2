This paper will discuss the results of treating industrial wastewater, sludge and other waste substances with this process. 1. Introduction The treatment of residential wastes, including wastewater and sludge, is of grave social concern in light of global environmental problems. The catalytic wet oxidation process, which is intended to decompose these wastes with great efficiency, employs air (oxygen) and specific mixtures of catalysts at high temperature and high pressure. Unlike conventional treatment methods, the process in question is a new technique which is based on a quite different physic-chemical treatment for decomposing pollutants. In this process, highly concentrated pollutants, such as nitrogen compounds (including ammonia), COD and BOD components and sludge, are treated with very high efficiency in a single step without any dilution. The pollutants are oxidized, decomposed and converted into harmless N[.sub]2[/], CO[.sub]2[/], H[.sub]2[/]O, etc. As a result, no sludge requiring secondary treatment is generated, and the exhaust gas contains neither NOx nor SOx. What is more, surplus heat energy can be recovered in various ways depending on the treatment scale, while liquid clarification, deodorization, disinfection and other desirable effects can be obtained. The process can be applied to various types of systems: individual-treatment systems, with complete oxidative decomposition of pollutants; and combined-treatment systems, in which organic substances are first partially oxidized (low-molecular-weight substance processing) by catalytic action and then undergo further anaerobic digestion processes, to name two. The catalytic wet oxidation process can be widely applied to the treatment of various types of wastewater and sludge: industrial wastewater, sludge generated in the activated sludge processing of night soil, industrial wastewater and sewage water, residential wastes, and many others. 2. The Catalytic Wet Oxidation Process 2-1. Features of the Process This process has the following outstanding features not found in conventional treatment techniques such as, the noncatalytic wet oxidation process (called the Zimmerman Process). (1) Compared to the conventional Zimmerman Process and similar wet oxidation processes, this process excess at removing highly concentrated CODcr and other components which contain persistent organic matter. (2) This process can decompose various kinds of nitrogen compounds which may exist in the wastewater and convert them into nitrogen gas. The conventional processes cannot treat ammonia and other nitrogen components. (3) Along with the very efficient treatment of pollutants, wastewater can be clarified, deodorized, disinfected, and then completely recycled. The exhaust gas contains neither NOx nor SOx and is odorless. (4) Three to five hours after the system is started up, the process becomes stable. From then on the system will maintain a stable level of treatment without being affected by changes in raw water quality. (5) The treatment system is compact in design and requires a relatively small installation space. (6) Highly concentrated sludge, COD and BOD components, ammonia and other nitrogen compounds can be efficiently decomposed in a single stage process. Depending on the selected process conditions, persistent organic and inorganic matter can also be converted into easily decomposed or low-molecular-weight substances, which can then be treated by further biological processing (anaerobic and aerobic treatments). This process has proved applicable not only to various kinds of industrial and residential wastewater but also to sludge discharged during the activated sludge treatment process of night soil, industrial wastewater and sewage water. 2-2. Processing Sequence Figure 1 shows the processing sequence. The wastewater and sludge to be treated is first made homogeneous, preferably in the storage tank. Then it is pressurized and fed to the heat exchanger. Air is used as the source of oxygen. It is pressurized to nearly the same level as the feed water and mixed with the water just before it enters the heat exchanger. Figure 1. Flow Chart of the Catalytic Wet Oxidation Process The heat exchanger is usually a multi-tube type. A double-tube type is employed when a great many suspended solids are contained in the feed water or when scale builds up in the tube over time. The fixed bed of the reactor is charged with the required amount of catalyst, which triggers the decomposition of pollutants. The mixture of unprocessed feed water and compressed air is preheated in an exchange of heat with the high-temperature gases and treated fluids coming out of the reactor in the gaseous/liquid phase flow. The mixture is thereby heated to the required temperature for starting the reaction. When the system first starts operation, a furnace is used to heat the feed fluid. When the target reaction temperature has been reached, the external thermal source is shut down. From that point on, the raw feed water is heated solely by the oxidized mixture flowing out of the system. This exchange of heat creates a self-sustaining temperature high enough to support the reaction. 2-3. Reaction Heat Figure 2 shows the relationship between the level of organics in the wastewater and the amount of heat required for reaction.[.sup]1[/] In the wet oxidation process, autogenous combustion can be achieved in the range where the CODcr components in the wastewater (or sludge) exceed 10 g/l. In this process, the reaction heat derived from the decomposition of the COD components as well as the heat generated by the breakdown of the ammonia in the wastewater (or sludge) contribute to effective heat recovery. Figure 2. Amount of Organics in the Wastewater; Heat Requirements[.sup]1[/] (comparison of wet oxidation and 2-4. Reaction Conditions The reaction conditions -- temperature, pressure, oxygen demand, pre-reaction pH value, etc. -- will vary with the components and their concentration in the wastewater or sludge, as well as with the target water quality level. The oxygen demand is the amount of oxygen that is required to completely oxidize and decompose the pollutants in the wastewater or sludge. Such pollutants can be fully decomposed with a volume of oxygen that is 1.05-1.2 times the theoretical oxygen demand. This figure is based on the decomposition reaction of each component, shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. Decomposition Reaction Formulae of Various Components in the Catalytic Wet Oxidation Process The catalysts used in this process have proved to have a long service life in the high-temperature, high-pressure liquid phase of the process. The catalytic elements use titania, zirconia or the like (as either a one-element or two-element system) as the carrier and they also contain a mixture of precious or base metals (two or more metals) which comprise several percent of the element. As shown in Photo 1, these catalytic elements are spherical or honeycomb in shape. The amount of catalyst to be added to a specific system depends on the results expected from the treatment. Photo 1. Catalysts (left: honeycomb catalyst, right: spherical catalyst) 2-5. The Decomposition of Pollutants Wastewater or sludge is introduced into the reactor, which has been charged with the catalyst, at a specified temperature and pressure. The pollutants in the water or sludge are decomposed in the reactions shown in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 4, COD components are decomposed into carbon dioxide and water after passing through an intermediate stage as a low-molecular-weight carboxylic acid.[.sup]2[/] The waste gas discharged from the reactor contains neither NOx nor SOx and is odorless. Figure 4. Mechanism of the Decomposition Reaction of COD Components 3. The Treatment of Industrial Wastewater 3-1. The Treatment of Wastewater (Gas Liquor) From Coke Ovens Table 1 shows the gas liquor treatment performance of a test plant with several reactors, each of which is 300mm in inner diameter and 6,500mm in height. (This plant was constructed in 1979 with an initial wastewater treatment capacity of 6 m[.sup]3[/]/day. Still in operation, the plant's treatment capacity can be boosted to 60 m[.sup]3[/]/day when the wastewater is relatively low in pollution. See Photo 2 [not reproduced]) Highly concentrated COD and ammonia components are decomposed to a level of 10 mg/l or less after a 24-minute reaction (SV = 2.5 Hr[.sup]-1[/]). Phenol and cyanide are decomposed to levels below the minimum limits of detection, and all suspended solids can be thoroughly removed. Meanwhile, NOx and SOx concentrations in the exhaust gas are reduced to levels below the minimum limits of determination (0.5 and 2.0 Mg/Nm[.sup]3[/] respectively), with no signs of growth. It is assumed that the reaction mechanism, especially the catalytic COD reaction mechanism, provides a complex, sequentially competing reaction which produces low-molecular-weight carbonic acid as an intermediate product. The reaction rate formulae which match the experimental results are: -d(X NH[.sub]3[/]/dt = K[.sub]1[/] x (C NH[.sub]3[/]) x (P O[.sub]2[/]) -d(X COD)/dt = K[.sub]2[/] x (C COD)[.sup]2[/] x (P O[.sub]2[/]) The reaction rate constants of the COD and ammonia components correlate with the reaction temperature (150-280�C) of the processing gas liquor (initial pH 10.5 in reaction) as follows: log K[.sub]1[/] NH[.sub]3[/] = 22.72 - 9119/T log K[.sub]2[/] COD = 4.72 - 2020/T As a result of the noncatalytic treatment of gas liquor, no decomposition of ammonia is seen and the COD decomposition rate is less than one hundredth that of catalytically treated gas liquor. Even if the reaction time is prolonged two- to sixfold, the residual COD value of about 1,000 mg/l remains nearly unchanged in the effluent. It has been confirmed that the catalyst developed for this process is highly stable in actual use. An 11,000-hour catalyst service life test, processing gas liquor from a coke oven, showed that the catalytic activity was unchanged. The test conditions and results are given in Figure 5. When the reaction time is changed from 20 minutes to 35 minutes with the other conditions remaining the same, no ammonia is detected in the treated water and the COD value drops to below 10 mg/l. Figure 5. Continuous Activity Test Results: Gas Liquor Figure 6 shows the results of case studies of material balance and heat balance after the treatment of gas liquor at a rate of 40 m[.sup]3[/]/hr.

The Treatment of Wastewater Containing Highly Concentrated Cyanide[.sup]3[/] The treatment of wastewater containing highly concentrated cyanide will be reported in detail in another session dealing with ``Desalination and Water Treatment in Harmony with the Environment.'' 3-3. The Treatment of Other Types of Industrial Wastewater Table 2 shows the results of treating other types of industrial wastewater. <graphic> </graphic> 4. The Treatment of Sludge [.sup]4,5,6[/] and Residential Wastes 4-1. The Treatment of Sludge (1) The treatment system Figure 7 shows a proposed new sewage and sludge treatment system. Conventional sewage treatment systems that process activated sludge need to retain the sludge for six to eight hours for processing. The proposed new system allows a shorter aeration time in order to effectively remove soluble BOD and COD components. In the proposed system, most of the earth and sand, extraneous large solids and suspended solids are removed in the first stage of settling and straining. Then an activated sludge process is used, requiring about two hours of aeration time. The suspended solids and surplus sludge which remain after the first stage of settling, straining and the final settling constitute about 2-6 percent of the total liquid. This liquid is then treated by the catalytic wet oxidation process. Figure 7. New Sewage and Sludge Treatment System The process can be used in two different types of systems: individual-treatment systems and combined-treatment systems which include an anaerobic digestion process (see Figure 6). In the latter type of system, the sludge is made soluble and the persistent organic matter is converted to easily decomposed low-molecular-weight organic substances. The resulting fluid is fed as needed to a separation membrane to let particles with less than a certain molecular weight permeate through the membrane. The fluid that comes through this membrane then undergoes an anaerobic digestion process in order to recover the methane gas it can produce. The sludge generated during this process is circulated to the catalytic wet oxidation process for re-treatment. The inorganic matter (ash content) is removed from the system. A research and development project was launched in 1991 with the cooperation of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), the Water Re-use Promotion Center (WRPC), Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. and other participant corporations. (2) The results of treating sludge[.sup]4,5[/] In this test, sewage sludge was used to prepare a concentration-adjusted sample of sludge water. The results of the test, using 4 percent sewage sludge water at 270�C and 8.43 MPa of pressure, are shown in Table 3. In the noncatalytic process, the amounts of the components do not change remarkably, even after one hour of reaction time. It is clear from this data that the catalyst plays a very effective role in this new treatment process. It should be noted that in the noncatalytic process the amount of NH[.sub]3[/]-N is increased. This is because the organic nitrogen components in the raw water are converted to NH[.sub]3[/]-N during processing. In the catalytic process, T-N, NH[.sub]3[/]-N, COD[.sub]Mn[/], COD[.sub]Cr[/], BOD, TOD and TOC can all be almost completely removed in one hour of reaction time. To remove the scale which can build up in the system, periodic chemical flushing is carried out. See references 4 and 5 the results of the anaerobic digestion processing sludge water which has been partially oxidized by the catalyst. 4-2. The Treatment of Residential Wastes With the tremendous changes in lifestyle today, the volume of residential wastes has steadily increased. The treatment of those wastes is now a serious social issue for many reasons including the rising cost of collecting wastes, the shortage of incineration facilities, and the reduction in the number of landfills, to name just a few. To solve these problems, a research and development project was launched in 1991 with the cooperation of the MITI, the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, the WRPC, Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. and other corporations. This project is designed to develop two systems to recover new energy from solid wastes and wastewater which have a high potential for recoverable energy. One system is a high-efficiency transfer system for solid wastes and wastewater, and the other is an energy recovery system which combines a physic-chemical waste treatment process (the process discussed in this paper) and a biological treatment process in an effective way. This technological development program is specifically intended to carry out the following steps: pulverize kitchen garbage and combustible wastes (paper and plastics), turn the particles into sludge, make the sludge soluble in the noncatalytic section of the catalytic wet oxidation system, convert the resulting fluid to low-molecular-weight substances in the catalytic section, and recover the methane gas produced by these materials through the anaerobic digestion process. 5. Conclusion This catalytic wet oxidation process can be used to completely decompose the highly concentrated pollutants which are seen in various kinds of industrial wastewater and night soil. It is also more effective than ever before in treating sewage sludge, which contains a large quantity of solid organic matter, without having to dehydrate and dry the sludge. Depending on the selection of reaction conditions, this process can be used alone or combined with other processes. In the individual-treatment application, pollutants can be fully decomposed into harmless substances. In combined applications, solid organic matter is first made soluble and then converted into low-molecular-weight substances (easily decomposed organics) through a partial oxidation treatment. Finally a biological treatment of the material (anaerobic digestion treatment, for example) is carried out. The catalytic wet oxidation process causes a substantial improvement in performance in comparison to conventional processes such as heat treatment or the Zimmerman Process. In addition to the treatment of sewage sludge, residential wastes that have been pulverized, converted to sludge and mixed with highly concentrated wastewater, may also be treated with this process. The authors hope that this process will be applied in many fields and contribute to solving today's environmental problems.
