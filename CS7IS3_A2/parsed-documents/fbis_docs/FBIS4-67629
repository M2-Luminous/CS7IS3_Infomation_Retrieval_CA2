These show that in January there were 174 new reports of AIDS cases bringing the cumulative total to 8,842 cases. In order to provide a wider range of information about AIDS and HIV in the United Kingdom, the Communicable Disease Report has recently introduced a new schedule for publication of surveillance data. This is designed to focus on different aspects of the data throughout the year. So that a wider audience can also benefit from this improved presentation, the monthly and quarterly routine Press Notices will in future be replaced by new quarterly formats. These will provide considerable additional information over that presented formerly. This is the last in the current series of Monthly and Quarterly AIDS and IV figures. The new format will begin in April. [passage on editorial notes omitted] Further data on AIDS is available in the PHLS Communicable Disease Report, which can be subscribed to by contacting Editor CDR, PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, 61, Colindale Avenue, London NW9 5EQ.
