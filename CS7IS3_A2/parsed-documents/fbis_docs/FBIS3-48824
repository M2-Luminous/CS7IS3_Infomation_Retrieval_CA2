In the same way, it is as well not to forget that New Delhi's Republic Day pageantry is an annual affair. There is a guest of honour every year, and not all guests leave a significant imprint once the dust of the ceremony has settled. If Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's presence lent a new dimension to Wednesday's celebrations, it was because the honour bestowed on him symbolises India's own changing economic perceptions. Now nearing its end, Mr. Goh's visit to India is meaningful because it is part of an integrated package and not just another diplomatic ritual. The timing is revealing. A Singapore Prime Minister's visit would not have had the same impact even two years ago. Not only does India appear to be psychologically prepared to make the most of what Singapore has to offer, but many of the institutional changes needed to take advantage of the connection are already in place. However, the success that clearly marks the tour may prompt two questions. First, why was this rapport so long delayed? Secondly, will it result in a permanent qualitative and quantitative change so that Singapore leads ASEAN and the world in helping India to open up? The usual short answer to the first question is that economics was hostage to politics all these years. This simplification may not be untrue, but it is not the whole truth. The confluence of stars (to borrow Mr. Goh's phrase) demands certain objective conditions that were not present earlier. It has taken time and effort to develop the large industrial base, a huge pool of scientists and engineers, and a 200-million-strong middle class that have made India attractive to investors. Similarly, Singapore has built up gradually the reserves that are now available for investment, and taken the strategic decision to sprout a second wing. What is just as important is the fact that these are complementary attributes in a potentially strategic situation. The agreements signed during the last few days would seem to bear this out. Seldom does an official visit produce so much in so short a time. But this is only a beginning. Important though they are, the agreements alone will not generate wealth. They will only help to create the right conditions for resourceful Singaporeans and Indians to give a boost to trade or set up joint ventures. The information-sharing arrangement between the Trade Development Board and six Indian organisations is a case in point. It will be exactly as rewarding as the use to which the information is put is productive. Ultimately, the relationship will be what the private sectors in the two countries make of it. Singapore brings special expertise to the partnership. Not just capital or access to technology, but an international outlook, and well-honed skills in labour relations, property development and banking. Singapore's unique achievement in attracting twice as many tourists as there are citizens should be of interest to a country that has some of the world's most spectacular natural sights and human artefacts, but not the infrastructure for enough visitors to enjoy them. India might also find it worthwhile to decentralise authority further so that project clearance is not held up, and to open up new areas, such as real estate, to foreign investment. Reforms in both fields would have a tremendous impact on domestic enterprise as well, and help to eradicate corruption rooted in too many complex restrictions. New Delhi might tackle some of these issues in next month's budget. Meanwhile, both countries would benefit from a better flow of information. India is not "Little India" writ large. Neither is Singapore only the shopping in Orchard Road. The sooner these tired stereotypes dissolve, the better it will be for pragmatic interaction.
