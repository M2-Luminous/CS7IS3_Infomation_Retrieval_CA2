Estonia cannot agree to new terms, but is still ready to negotiate with Russia with a view to benevolently surmount all difficulties. However, the Estonian republic regards President Boris Yeltsin's order #174 of April 5, providing for creation of new military bases not only in CIS member-countries but also in the Latvian republic, as Russia's departure from its earlier commitments, as well as from international agreements and principles. With this in view, the Estonian Foreign Ministry and Estonia's representatives abroad are instructed to do their utmost in persuading foreign leaders to recall Russia that it should unconditionally adhere to its international commitments and to pull out promptly and in the proper order its troops from Latvia and Estonia, which has been repeatedly called for by numerous international documents. Unfortunately, certain political circles in Moscow are quite likely to use this situation to engineer provocations against Estonia and Latvia. But such attempts are doomed to failure. Estonia will resolutely counteract pressure from Russia. The Estonian people will go ahead with creating new values on its straight way back to Europe".
