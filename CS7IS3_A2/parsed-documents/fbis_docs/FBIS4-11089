According to the measures, from now on, no additions, new construction, offices on ground floors, or other businesses with complex equipment are to be built. The new codes will allow new projects in the zone, as well as construction, restoration, maintenance, and other activities in existing buildings, however, taking risk factors into consideration. The new codes are to be strictly adhered to by state and residential sectors, and are meant to lessen the effects of weather in the area. During this first phase, the areas included run from the Almendares River to the bay tunnel; and from Malecon Avenue to Linea Street. Regarding new construction in that area, projects must be approved and must meet urban planning and control requirements. In other words, the bottom levels of buildings must not have elements obstructing the free flow of water, in addition of preserving the environment and character of the Malecon. With reference to the regulations affecting Playa and Habana del Este, work continues to determine what regulations are to be applied in those coastal municipalities.
