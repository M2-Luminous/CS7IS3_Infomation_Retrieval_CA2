The press service of the president of Azerbaijan said in a statement on Tuesday that "the sides directly involved in the conflict should by their practical activities and statements promote the creation of a political atmosphere for a further development of the negotiating process which has just begun." Also on Tuesday Azerbaijan refused to sign a cease-fire protocol in Moscow and its defence minister left for Baku for additional consultations. But the press service of the leader of Azerbaijan said the "republic stands for a just and peaceful settlement of the conflict, as well as for constructive Russian proposals." "Azerbaijan proceeds from the fact that the mentioned efforts and proposals should be implemented in the framework of generally-recognised norms and principles of international law, first and foremost, in the context of ensuring the sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of frontiers of the Republic of Azerbaijan," according to the statement.
