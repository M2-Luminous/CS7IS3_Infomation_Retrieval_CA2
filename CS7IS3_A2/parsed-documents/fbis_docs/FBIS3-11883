[Cavallo] This pressure are gradually decreasing. I believe the government is becoming increasingly consistent. It has learned to work more as a team, to show more solidarity. [LA NACION] Yet the impression remains that someone is interested in pitting you against the president, more to affect your image than to destabilize your policies. [Cavallo] Not from within the government. The problem in Argentina is that press informers and journalists are used as instruments in the political struggle. [passage omitted] [LA NACION] Do you believe a political struggle is at the root of the problem? [Cavallo] Undoubtedly, I repeat: I am not attacking the media. I have a very good opinion of CLARIN and LA NACION newspapers. I mention them because they are undoubtedly the prestigious and independent media. But I ask myself: Why is the press used to lie? [LA NACION] And what is your answer? [Cavallo] It stirs up the system. It makes the solution of any problem and the balance of conflictive interests more difficult. It can be compared with inflation within the economy. It disturbs everything. I am aware this type of conflict exists in any nation. When the system of communications enables citizens to be informed in a sincere way, it resembles a stabilized economy. It is more honest. [passage omitted] [LA NACION] If the president is reelected, will you be his economy minister? [Cavallo] I cannot answer that. Only the president can answer that. I have demonstrated my vocation to work with him. [LA NACION] And then? [Cavallo] I can say that unless the president fires me, I will not abandon him. Those who believe I may leave, slamming the door, or threaten to leave are mistaken. This is at odds with my personal behavior. I feel extremely responsible as Menem's economy minister and I will not jeopardize the success of my task over petty or insignificant personal differences that I may have to endure. [LA NACION] How is Brazil's proposal applicable to the integration of the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and the entry into NAFTA? [Cavallo] It is a very intelligent proposal. If we merely stick with Mercosur and do not join larger free trade zones or negotiate broader free trade agreements, we will be at a disadvantage, for example, with Mexico. Brazil's proposal has a significant practical meaning: We can negotiate free trade agreements using the methods agreed upon with other countries. [LA NACION] Would this include a strategy to join NAFTA if we are unilaterally eligible? [Cavallo] We must always agree on methods of negotiation with our Mercosur partners. At least, I imagine each country will inform its partners. [LA NACION] What will be Argentina's strategy toward NAFTA? [Cavallo] I will not comment on this issue. I may have my opinion, but the government must decide. It requires negotiation and an exchange of information with the other Mercosur partners. [LA NACION] How do you view [Brazilian Finance] Minister [Fernando Henrique] Cardoso's economic program? [Cavallo] I concur with it. I believe it represents the best way for Brazil to achieve, in the short term, a certain degree of stability of its economy and fully regain its growth rate. [LA NACION] Cardoso proposed zero inflation by the end of the year. Is this possible? [Cavallo] Of course it is possible. In December 1991, after just eight months of implementing its economic program, Argentina achieved a 0.4-percent inflation rate, that's nearly zero inflation. If Argentina achieved this, why not Brazil? It must also be borne in mind that Brazil has achieved significant progress in fiscal matters. [Passage omitted] [LA NACION] Will the UCR [Radical Civic Union] continue to be the main opposition force? [Cavallo] I believe the UCR will continue to be the main opposition party despite its crisis. The UCR's great problem is that, following its wise stance on the constitutional reform issue, it must explain its change of position. I believe the UCR will overcome this situation. I believe Argentina will basically be a bipartisan country with rotating governments. One of the parties, namely the Justicialist Party [PJ] of the future, will have a more social-Christian, a more liberal approach in economic matters. The other party, namely the UCR, will have a more social-democratic approach. [LA NACION] What will be the term for this rotation? [Cavallo] Well, Argentina has struck lucky. The UCR, which is truly conservative and has great resistance to change, will again govern our country when changes are no longer necessary because we will already have the appropriate rules and be functioning well in political, economic, and social fields. So, there is nothing better than a conservative stance like that of the UCR to keep things functioning well. Right now a courageous party like the PJ, with someone like Menem -- who has a straightforward relationship with the people -- is required. Yet when great changes are no longer required, just marginal touch-ups, it will probably be time for a more conservative force with greater reluctance toward changes and risks -- like the UCR. [passage omitted] [LA NACION] There is talk of impending measures to reduce costs and encourage exports. What is the plan? [Cavallo] We announced the most significant measures at the very beginning and complemented them in early 1991. Since then, we merely implemented the announced policies. By 1 March, most agricultural, livestock, industrial, mining, and construction sectors and part of the tourism sector will have received their full tax deductions on payrolls. Within the next few days we will announce details of the car imports system for the next five years. This system was devised in 1991. It will run for eight years, until 1999 when the general rules and regulations will be implemented. We announced the import quotas for 1991, 1992, and 1993. We will now announce the quotas as of this year. We must accurately determine the repercussions of those car companies that did not balance their imports -- under the special 2- percent tariff -- with their exports of finished vehicles or parts, within the first three years as specified. [LA NACION] The problems are there. What will be done about them? [Cavallo] There will be a deficit in compensation accumulated until mid-1993. This problem has been stopped because we authorize the car companies to import under the 2-percent tariff only on the basis of their real exports for the preceding month. The problem lies in reconciling excessive imports under the 2-percent tariff against accumulated exports which, in principle, the companies are allowed to use in their calculation until the end of the year.
