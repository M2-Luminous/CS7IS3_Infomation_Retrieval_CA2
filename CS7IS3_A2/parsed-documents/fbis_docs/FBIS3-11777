This was the conclusion of the sugarcane harvest assessment meeting held on 25 March in Santiago de Cuba in the presence of Sugar Industry Minister Nelson Torres; Jose A. Naranjo, head of the commander in chief's Coordination and Support Staff; and Esteban Lazo and Juan Carlos Robinson, respectively first secretaries of the Communist Party of Cuba in Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo Provinces. At this meeting, it was proposed that the easternmost provinces exchange moral and material support to ensure that the current goals are met -- particularly supporting Granma, which will be reporting to the National Assembly of the People's Government in July and therefore has to meet all its goals. The eastern region was proclaimed the best in Cuba in the last 20 days; and within this area, Guantanamo is in first place, for fulfilling seven of the 14 emulation parameters. At this meeting at the Heredia Theater, the Salvador Rosales Mill from Songo-La Maya Municipality received the Union of Young Communists' Setting the Pace banner for surpassing its grinding potential for the past 40 days.
