In remarks, carried by the Qatari News Agency, during a visit today to the martyrs cemetery in the Hammam al-Shatt District near the Tunisian capital to mark the blessed 'Id al-Adha, 'Arafat said what has been achieved thus far is something like a newborn that needs all the care and attention it can get until it is able to hoist the Palestinian flag over Jerusalem. Our Palestinian people are an integral part of the Arab nation, 'Arafat stated. Brother Abu-'Ammar thanked the Tunisian Republic for the support it has given to the Palestinian people and cause and for playing host to their leaders.
