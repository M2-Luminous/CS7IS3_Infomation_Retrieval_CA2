The meeting was held immediately after another signing ceremony during which business and organisation heads affixed their names to the Treaty on Social Accord. Chernomyrdin stressed that the treaty is a historically important document which creates the conditions for the stabilisation of Russia's political and economic life. Russia is paying a steep price for reforms, the premier noted, and gave a detailed account of the economic situation in the country. The prime minister declared that the government's number one task was to keep spending within the parameters of the budget. A series of presidential decrees and governmental resolutions have already been prepared with the goal of improving the economic situation and strengthening the Policy of Social Accord. These steps are designed to "redirect the restructuring of the economy in favor of the domestic producer", he said. The premier reffered, in particular, to the lowering of several tax rates this year, to the cancellation of taxes on investments, to the significant lowering of customs duties on oil, gas, aluminum, pulp and the other main components of the Russian export, as well as the cancellation of quotas and mandatory licensing for exports. This summer will already witness the lowering of the amount companies are required to put into the social security fund, which is one form of taxes. As the government implements its plan to sharply improve the efficiency of the tax-collecting agencies, it hopes to be able to reduce the over-all tax load by 10 to 20 per cent next year. According to Chernomyrdin, the government envisions requiring banks to report the opening of an account by a firm, and also taking additional measures on debt circulation, including the possibility of extinguising the debts of unviable enterprises by confiscating their property. The premier especially pointed out the necessity of strengthening executive discipline on every level. "Without discipline we will not be able to do anything in this country", he emphasized. He said that regulatory measures would be adopted to decrease the salary gap in various sectors of the economy, including in the government.
