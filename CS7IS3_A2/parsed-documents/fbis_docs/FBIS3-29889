Imports rose 7.6 percent in the first 49 days of this year from the same period last year, while exports grew 6.7 percent, the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry said on Tuesday. Imports reached 11.6 billion U.S. dollars and exports 8.9 billion dollars between Jan. 1 and Feb. 18, widening the trade deficit early in the year from 2.42 billion dollars last year to 2.68 billion dollars in 1994. A Ministry official said, "in 1993, the increase rate of exports was higher than that of imports throughout the year, improving the balance of payments a little. But this year, with imports increasing so rapidly, it is expected to be difficult for the government to improve the balance of payments." The increase rate of import licences (IL) issued to importers reached 10.3 percent and 8.9 percent last November and December, respectively, compared to export letters of credit (LC) arriving here amounting to 8.7 percent and 5.4 percent in the same months. The government issued 10.05 billion dollars worth of import licenses in the first 49 days of this year, up 26 percent from a year ago and foreshadowing a rapid increase in imports. Conversely, export businesses here received 6.87 billion dollars worth of letters of credit during the same period, up only 12.9 percent from last year. A Ministry official said: "Imports of both capital goods and consumer goods have been showing rapid growth since the beginning of this year. Imports of capital goods including machinery are expected to increase even further in the coming months because domestic enterprises are planning large-scale facility investment in the early period of this year. There is no actual way to control the increase in imports now. To improve the balance of payments this year, we have no other choice but to focus on studying ways to expand exports."
