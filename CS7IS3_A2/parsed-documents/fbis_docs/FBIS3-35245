We would like our talks to lead to implementation on the ground so that ordinary Palestinians may come to feel real change. We have wrapped up discussions on a significant portion of the issues bearing on the transfer of civilian powers to the national Palestinian authority. The water issue remains to be addressed. We have finished with the issues of archaeology, regional planning, and wire and wireless communications. An agreement on relevant papers will be worked out next Monday here in Cairo. We also had exhaustive discussions concerning the release of Palestinian detainees. After the Red Cross team's visit to Taba, we now have all the relevant papers and figures. I believe that next Monday will see us achieve further progress. We also agreed in principle on launching a Palestinian television station and radio station on the medium wave. Regarding the Security Committee, it looked at a draft report on the composition of Palestinian police and security arrangements in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho region. I believe that progress was also made there. However, there are numerous points that need to be cleared by the political leaders. We will wait until next week to see progress made there. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, have you begun drafting the points on which agreement was reached so that they may be presented to your respective political leaders? [Sha'th] We are now formulating everything. There is no time left for discussions in a vacuum. All our negotiations address papers, item by item. [Mu'addi] Do you see the outstanding issues being resolved next week? [Sha'th] As much as I would like this to happen, it is hard for me to predict that much. As I have said, the Israeli side looks at certain matters as being mere symbols of sovereignty, while, in fact, they are highly significant symbols of national Palestinian identity and the national Palestinian authority. Things like passports, postage stamps, an international telephone code, and other such issues are essential to the Palestinian character and entity, even though these do not, as yet, imply the existence of a Palestinian state, because the Palestinian state has still to come into being. [Mu'addi] Do you expect an agreement on all issues to be finalized by 'Id al-Fitr [on or about 13 March]? [Sha'th] That is what I hope will happen. It would then be glad news for our people that will make the 'Id doubly happy. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the chief Palestinian negotiator in Taba, Thank you so much. [Sha'th] Thank you.
