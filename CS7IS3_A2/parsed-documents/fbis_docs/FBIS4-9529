She announced that if the strike wave did not stop by noon on 27 April, the OPZZ Presidium would make a decision about what the union will do in the prevailing situation. Spychalska believes that the demands put forward by Solidarity during the strikes are "in general compatible with those put to the government by the OPZZ." She has doubts about the "road chosen by Solidarity." "I cannot imagine the OPZZ choosing a paralysis of the country as its objective," she added, asked by the PAP journalist to comment on the strike action. On Tuesday, Spychalska took part in a precongress meeting with OPZZ members in Olsztyn. According to Spychalska there are more and more flashpoints between the government and the OPZZ. The greatest controversies are aroused by the government draft labor code and the trade union acts, which, she said, "push the unions into a corner." Speaking about this, she did not rule out the possibility of the OPZZ leaving the coalition. According to the OPZZ chairwoman, after four years of Solidarity in power, the situation in Poland is "critical," while that union was striving for "confrontation and overthrowing the government," disregarding the results of the last elections.
