[Article is accompanied by two photographs, one showing, among other persons, Nastase and Alafouzos, with the caption: "Adrian Nastase held talks lasting an hour and a half with the Greek shipping tycoon Ioannis Alafouzos. In those days they used to be friends;" the other photograph shows Alafouzos shaking hands with Chebeleu, with the caption: "Traian Chebeleu, all honey, amiably shaking hands with Ioannis Alafouzos, whom, after a short while, he would be denigrating!"] The photographs were taken in 1990, at the official opening of the Ermis company in Bucharest, when Adrian Nastase and Traian Chebeleu chatted with Greek shipping tycoon Ioannis Alafouzos. The difference between 1990 and 1994 is that in 1990 Iannis Alafouzos was one of the supporters of the Mitsotakis government, which was very close to President Ion Iliescu's heart. The moment the Greek shipping tycoon switched sides and began to support Andreas Papandreou, the most bitter adversary of Konstandinos Mitsotakis, both Adrian Nastase and Traian Chebeleu changed their tune. According to last-minute data in the possession of EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, one of the intelligence services -- definitely not the SRI [Romanian Intelligence Service] -- has elaborated a report that established that the KGB is massively involved in the famed case of the attempted sale of the Romanian strategic fleet, also known as the Petromin-Forum Maritime affair. As we already mentioned, the photographs date back to 1990. About that year, in issue No. 533 of our daily, soccer player Danut Lupu stated that he had to return to Greece because of the pressure that had been exerted on him by the [Romanian] Ministry of Foreign Affairs, led at the time by Adrian Nastase. He explained having been pressured by the fact that "shipping tycoon Vardinoianis, owner of the Greek Panathinaikos soccer club, had large business operations in Romania." The aforementioned intelligence service report proves the incontestible links between the Greek shipping tycoon Vardinoianis and the Moscow intelligence services, especially the KGB, on the orders of which he initiated a massive operation intended to purchase the 96 vessels belonging to Petromin. Those 96 vessels represented an essential component of our national security system. The sum of $125 million with which the Greek shipping tycoon Stelianos Katounis was to buy the Petromin fleet comes, according to the cited report, from KGB funds, via shipping tycoon Vardinoianis. We would like to remind our readers that the following persons were ardent supporters of striking a deal with the Greeks in the famous attempted sale of the Romanian strategic fleet: Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu; Paul Teodoru, former minister of transportation, currently counselor of the prime minister; Lieutenant General Marin Pancea, former presidential counselor and former secretary of the Country's Supreme Defense Council. According to information revealed by other dailies, the whole affair was closely supervised by presidential counselor Colonel General Vasile Ionel.
