This is an opinion expressed by Longin Pastusiak, deputy chairman of the Sejm Foreign Affairs Commission, who returned from Washington a few days ago. According to the professor, the Partnership for Peace program can be treated as the last stop before NATO. [Begin Pastusiak recording] The program does not provide guarantees of security for us. Consequently, Article 5, the key article of the North Atlantic Treaty, which declares that aggression against a NATO member state means aggression against the entire NATO organization, will not apply to Poland. However, the states that will be included in the Partnership for Peace program will be covered by Article 4, which envisages that, in a situation of conflict or when Poland's security is threatened, the NATO countries would hold a meeting and carry out consultations. Such consultations might lead to military action, but it is not said clearly. [end recording]
