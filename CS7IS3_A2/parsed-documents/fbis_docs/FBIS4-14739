He told Interfax that Ukraine had a 50,000-strong contingent of land troops in Crimea. "Crimea is overly stuffed with land forces," he said. "Given this, only the Russian Black Sea Fleet should stay to protect Crimea, Ukraine and Russia," he said. He is convinced that "Russia is strong enough to maintain a modern, reliable and combat-ready Black Sea Fleet." Kuznetsov emphasized that the Crimean leaders were not planning to create military formations of their own, because they were simply redundant. "Besides that, we simply cannot afford them," he said. "There are official bodies, such as the Crimean security service and interior ministry, which will maintain order and combat crime," said Kuznetsov.
