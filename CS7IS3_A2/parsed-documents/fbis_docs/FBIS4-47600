Less That 1 Percent of the GRoss Domestic Product Is Being Allocated for Science''] [Text] On Tuesday a joint meeting with the participation of Yegor Gaydar, leader of the Russia's Choice bloc, Nikolay Vorontsov, head of the Duma Committee for Education, Science, and Culture, and Russian Federation Minister of Science Boris Saltykov, which was devoted to the search for means of reforming the organization and financing of scientific research, was held at the Ogareva, 5 Center. In the USSR the expenditures on design development and scientific research came to 6 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) with 100 percent state financing. Now it will be impossible to maintain such a structure. And last year the real budget of science came to only 0.78 percent of the GDP with 100 percent state financing. In the opinion of Nikolay Vorontsov, such a budget became a regional leader, but is absolutely unacceptable for a country with such a level of development as Russia. ``In any event Russia should preserve its basic science, which is national property and creates the prerequisites for the economic revival of the country,'' the duma committee chairman believes. In such countries as the United States, the FRG, and Great Britain the spending on basic science comes to 2.5-3 percent of the GDP with relatively low state coverage--40-50 percent. The large countries of the third world, which aspire to leadership in their regions (Brazil, India), are allocating for science up to 1 percent of the GDP with a very high (up to 90 percent) level of state financing. While the Pacific Ocean model (the ``dragons''--Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan) is characterized by high expenditures on science (on the order of 2.5 percent of the GDP) with low (20-30 percent) state participation. The question is, What model should Russia follow? In the opinion of the conference participants, now, inasmuch as private business, which would be capable of financing the spending on applied research at the level of 2.5 percent of the GDP, does not yet exist in the country, Russia cannot venture to orient itself toward developed western countries. The necessary minimum spending on science is 15 trillion rubles (or 2 percent of the GDP). In accordance with the Summary Financial Balance for 1994 only 11.8 trillion rubles have been allocated. It turns out that the per capita spending on science in the Russian Federation is significantly less than the average world spending and a factor of 10 less than in the leading industrial countries.
