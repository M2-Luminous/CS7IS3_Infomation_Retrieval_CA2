Although his resignation came as no surprise, the timing threatens further turmoil within an already demoralised Tory Party. Last night Right-wing Conservative MPs were mobilising to try to block the appointment of Mr David Hunt, the Employment Secretary, who is on the Left and a committed pro-European. A head of steam was also building up behind backbench calls for Mr Michael Heseltine, the President of the Board of Trade, to take on the high-profile role. Mr Heseltine has made it clear to friends he does not want the chairman's job. But more and more MPs are telling Tory whips that they believe he alone has the flair and dynamism to pull the party back from its worst ever defeat in last week's European elections. According To Government insiders, Mr Major has not yet made up his mind on a successor, and there are at least four or five candidates. Other front-runners include Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish Secretary, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the Agriculture Minister; Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the Health Secretary; Mr Jonathan Aitken, currently outside the Cabinet as Minister for Defence Procurement; and Mr Tony Newton, the Leader of the Commons. Sir Norman will carry on as chairman until a successor is appointed in a reshuffle expected in mid to late July. Although he was not a member of the Cabinet, it is traditional for the party chairman in the second half of a Parliament to be a senior minister. It had been known for some time that Sir Norman wanted to quit Conservative Central Office to concentrate on his business career, but the timing of the announcement caused surprise at Westminster. It was seen as a deliberate attempt to distance his resignation from the reshuffle, and show that he is stepping down of his own free will rather than being dropped. However, his departure will put pressure on Mr Major to speed up the Government changes. Earlier this week he ruled out a reshuffle in the immediate aftermath of the Euro-elections, but confirmed he would carry out a mid-term reconstruction by the end of July. Sir Norman's announcement is bound to increase speculation at Westminster about the scale of the Cabinet changes. Already there are signs that talk of a reshuffle is having a destabilising effect on Whitehall, with some key Government announcements including a policy paper on Civil Service reform, delayed until the future shape of the Government is clear. The vacuum at the top of the party could also increase the infighting between the Tory Euro-sceptics and pro-Europeans. In the wake of the more sceptical line adopted by Mr Major during the Euro- elections, with the call for a "multi-speed" EC, his choice of chairman will be seen as an indication of the direction of the party in the run-up to the next election. In a letter to Mr Major last night, Sir Norman promised he would give the "sturdiest possible support" from the backbenches. It was a strong signal that he would use his influence to prevent any challenge to Mr Major this autumn. Sir Norman singled out party unity as one of the main problems he had faced as chairman. Although the Tories lost 14 Euro-MPs and saw their share of the vote fall to the lowest level this century, he said the European elections had shown they could fight a ``united and successful campaign, confounding predictions. ``In the next two or three years the Conservative Party must behave as it did in the last three weeks, not as it did in the 18 months before that,'' said Sir Norman. Mr Major praised Sir Norman's efforts in streamlining the party organisation and putting it back on a sound financial footing.
