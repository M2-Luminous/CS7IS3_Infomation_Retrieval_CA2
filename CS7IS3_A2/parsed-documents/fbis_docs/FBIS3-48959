Rakowski in the case relating to the illegal turnover of hard currency in 1990 between the former CPSU and the former PZPR [Polish United Workers Party] has been directed to the Regional Court for Warsaw by the capital Prosecutor's Office, its head, Prosecutor Jerzy Labuda, has reported. The Prosecutor's Office accuses Rakowski of having in January 1990 received from the then CPSU Central Committee a loan of $1.2 million and 500 million zloties without the required hard currency permit, which broke the Treasury Penal Law. This was to have been financial aid for the PZPR prior to its final congress. On 8 December, the Prosecutor's Office discontinued proceedings against Leszek Miller in the face of a lack of evidence of his having committed a crime. He had been accused of having repaid $600,000 of this loan in November 1990, transgressing the law. In accordance with the regulations in force in 1990, the actions of which Rakowski is accused carried the penalty of a fine of up to 2 million zloties. The capital Prosecutor's Office commenced an investigation in November 1991 on the basis of materials gathered by the State Protection Office. It had been waiting for many months for a reply from the Russian prosecutor's office, which it had addressed with a request for legal assistance and the questioning of USSR former Vice President Yanayev and a number of employees of the former CPSU Central Committee. In the middle of October this year, Prosecutor Janusz Regulski, who was then leading the investigation, decided to discontinue it, inter alia in the face of the low credibility of the testimony of the two Russians involved in the financing by the former CPSU of other communist parties. The implementation of this decision was suspended though; in the view of the heads of the capital prosecutor's office, Regulski inter alia deemed the action of which Rakowski is accused an action "of low degree of social threat," whereas the amount of money at hand was the not at all modest sum of over a million U.S. dollars.
