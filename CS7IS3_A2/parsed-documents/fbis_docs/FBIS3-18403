Bik: "G-7 Outlining Requirements for Aid to Russia"] [Text] Bonn -- The seven major Western industrialized nations (G-7) are willing to continue to support Russia only if it pursues its reform process and shows some tangible results. According to the G-7, the world economy is evolving reasonably well, mostly thanks to the recovery in the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. In France and Italy, privatization programs should rev up the economy, while in Japan deregulation and an announced stimulation program should do the same. These were the conclusions of the talks between the finance ministers and bank governors from the G-7 countries, which were concluded in the German city of Kronberg last weekend. On behalf of Russia, which attended the meeting as an observer and the main beneficiary of aid, Finance Minister Dubinin came to Kronberg. His delegation received many critical questions regarding the progress of the Russian reform process. In a nine-point statement, the G-7 states that Russian "goodwill" has shown "insufficient results." Dubinin had announced that Russia wants to push back the monthly inflation rate from 20 percent now, to between 6 and 9 percent by the end of 1994. The budget deficit should be maximum 5 percent of the GNP by then, which Dubinin considered to be "quite feasible." Reactions to his statements were sceptical, due to the success of the former communists and ultranationalists in Russia's recent elections. Aids of German Minister Theo Waigel reported that U.S. Finance Minister Lloyd Bentson's attitude had been very standoffish during the talks on the continuation of aid to Moscow, because of the commotion around the Russian CIA spy exposed last week. An important part of the $55-billion aid agreed in 1992 and 1993, has not yet been provided, including $10 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and $4.5 billion (out of 5 billion) from the World Bank. Host Waigel made it clear that his country, which has provided two-thirds of all Western aid (almost 100 billion German marks) since 1989, for the time being must ease up because of its own economic problems. Anyway, Waigel believes an extension of aid is not necessary right now, although he labelled the situation of the Russian economy as "infinitely intricate." European Commissioner Henning Christophersen stated that the European Union is considering the possibility of creating a free-trade area with Russia by 1998. However, a prior condition for opening up the West European market to Russian products is still that Moscow should guarantee the fixing of realistic market prices and that subsidies to companies should be lifted, a demand which is also applicable to other East European countries.
