After 1990, it was almost fashionable to talk about foreign policy as a kind of success story and to refer to the foreign policy consensus between the parties. However, by now, this consensus is almost entirely broken and foreign policy has become an organic part of the election campaign. In fact, disagreements can be suspected in the approach to certain issues within the coalition and within the opposition parties. Regarding major foreign policy goals, the political parties tend to agree; however, there is a sharp debate among them on the order of priorities and the means to implement these goals. In our report, we investigated how the current and possible future parliamentary parties would form foreign policy in the next governmental cycle. Federation of Young Democrats: Foreign Policy Triangle The Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] has formulated its concept as a foreign policy triangle that coincides considerably with the line followed by Hungary since the change of the regime, Jozsef Szajer, chairman of the party's National Committee, told MAGYAR NEMZET. Szajer said that this triangle consists of European integration, national minority policy, and regional and neighborly cooperation, three factors that are closely interrelated. The Young Democrats believe that, for Hungary, there is no alternative to integration and gaining membership of the European Union [EU], because the cost of staying out of it would be much higher than the possible costs of joining. The Fidesz believes that drawing up the program of domestic preparations is the most important element of membership, namely forming the real mechanisms of market economy in a way that will also conform to the EU's conditions. The Fidesz also considers legal harmonization necessary, which presumes social and economic decisions that may cause serious problems and can even attract heavy burdens. Therefore, the Fidesz believes that the aim has to be that this preparedness can be proved when the conditions of joining are set out. In the case of a nation a third of which is living outside the borders, the national minority issue will always be a fundamental and central element of foreign policy, Szajer said. Neglecting this can cause serious domestic political problems both in Hungary and in the neighboring states. Therefore, the Fidesz believes that it has to have a very circumspect policy, bearing in mind the sentiments of national minorities and of the majority nations. They see the Antall government's national minority policy as basically correct, but they found it lacking empathy with the nations of the neighboring countries. Hungarian leaders have made statements on a number of occasions which were ambiguous and did not improve the relationship between the minority and majority; however, in terms of deeds, the government has not made any serious mistakes in the past period, Szajer said. In addition to all this, the Fidesz feels it necessary to improve communication with the leaders of the neighboring countries, and considers the continuation of dialogue very important even if it does not lead to early results. The long-term solution of the national minority issue presumably depends on the development of economic cooperation, which in turn can be very positively influenced by intergovernmental dialogue. In connection with signing the basic treaties, Szajer said: If these documents lay down national minority protection guarantees -- which are essential for the region's stability -- then the Fidesz does not see any obstacles to this "symbolic decision." At the same time, they feel that the basic treaties have to be based on already functioning economic, cultural, and church agreements. Christian Democratic People's Party: A Quicker Way to Europe For us, of primary importance is to live in peace with neighboring states, which in turn have to respect the rights of the Hungarian minorities. It is important to accelerate our approach to Europe. In the interest of strengthening our security, we believe that NATO should give certain guarantees to Hungary even before we become full NATO members, was how Laszlo Varga, deputy chairman of the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], summed up the party's foreign policy goals. Talking about relations with our neighbors, he said that the UN decision of 19 December 1992 clearly laid down the rights of the national minorities. According to Varga, there is no point again including the border issue in the basic treaties to be made with our neighbors because this issue was clearly settled by the Helsinki Final Act: The borders of countries cannot be forcefully changed, but it would be a mistake to surrender the possibility included in the Final Act on facilitating certain changes through peaceful means and negotiations. Varga also said that our neighbors should realize that the Hungarian minorities do not threaten their statehood and territorial integrity; therefore, it is pointless raising anxiety and fears. According to Varga, the settlement of the national minority issue might be advanced by the fact that, after the emergence of the south Slav crisis and the critical areas in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the West has also recognized the importance of this issue. Talking about our approach to Europe, Varga explained that, according to their experience, our membership request that was submitted at the beginning of April has the support of all the EU member states, and our efforts are viewed with sympathy; therefore, it would presumably be possible to accelerate our process of gaining membership, which might, in an optimal case, lead to membership in 1998 or 1999. Hungarian Democratic Forum: European Integration and Hungarians Beyond the Border The foreign policy priorities of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] can be summed up as two points: European integration and Hungarians beyond the border, Gyorgy Csoti, foreign affairs spokesman of the MDF, told MAGYAR NEMZET. These two elements of the foreign policy program are inseparable and neither can be placed above the other. Good-neighborly relations have a basic importance and they are in the interests of Hungary and of the Hungarians living beyond the border, while, at the same time, they are inseparable from the situation of these Hungarians. Good-neighborly relations can only be a result of the settling of the problems of minority Hungarians because this is virtually the only reason for our tense relations with the neighboring countries. According to Csoti, it is inconceivable for the Hungarian Government first to form good relations with the leadership of the neighboring countries and then the situation of the Hungarians beyond the border to improve as a result of this. He pointed out that, in the history of the past 74 years, none of the governments was able to resolve this issue; in fact, although interstate relations were excellent, the situation of the Hungarians beyond the border has continued to deteriorate over the past 45 years. According to Csoti, the situation of the minority Hungarians is most critical in Romania. Owing to the new Moravcik government, the prospects are better in Slovakia, and in Serbia, too. Csoti denied that the MDF's foreign policy has changed in connection with Yugoslavia. A year and a half ago, the Hungarian Government said that limited military intervention can curb the violence and the escalation of the war, and, at that time, a chance still existed for this. However, these constant threats that are never implemented will lose their credibility, and even if Belgrade takes them seriously, they are having a decreasing effect on the events. By now, we probably have a Lebanon-style crisis that can only be handled in the long term. For this very reason, certain doubts were raised, among other things, in connection with the fruitless embargo. Csoti believes that it has to be reassessed, rather than discarded. It has to be eased, or made total, even together with military actions, in the interest of an early result, because it is untenable since a long drawn-out embargo is also a burden on other countries of the region. However, on the embargo issue, the MDF is not in favor of unilateral Hungarian measures; UN decisions have to be observed even if Hungary, as a badly affected country, raises doubts. Csoti also denied that, even initially, the government had tried to keep distance from the region of the former Soviet Union. The initial difficulties can be explained through the completely collapsed economies and the approximately $2 billion debts of Russia, Ukraine, and the other former Soviet republics. However, the Hungarian Government immediately stood by Gorbachev and Yeltsin when anti-democratic coups were attempted against them, and it was Budapest that first made an agreement with Russia and Ukraine. However, according to the MDF, Hungary cannot commit itself to any of the major powers even if, for historical reasons, relations with certain countries are closer than with others. Hungarian Socialist Party: To Reestablish Consensus It is the responsibility of the future governing parties to change the perception of consensus and to reestablish it by including the opposition in foreign policy decisions that affect the country's fundamental interests, and by acquiring for these the support of the broadest possible public, Laszlo Kovacs, chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, said for the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], also using this as an argument for his party's proposal to confirm our EU and NATO membership in a referendum. In his view, the major directions of foreign policy that were contained in the 1990 government program accepted by Parliament have to be preserved: close ties with the West, normal relations with the neighbors, and support for the assertion of the rights of Hungarians living beyond the border. These major directions follow from Hungary's interests and circumstances, and from the international conditions, and the parties have had a consensus on these issues. However, Kovacs believes that, owing to the "government's clumsiness," we have not managed to get as close to these goals as was possible; in fact, relations with our neighbors have deteriorated -- "with some of them expressly" -- which, together with other factors, has damaged Hungary's foreign image and limited the effectiveness of Hungarian foreign policy, including the efficiency of efforts made in the interest of Hungarians living beyond the border. In his party's view, the relationship between the major directions of foreign policy has to be changed. A balance has to be established because these three directions are closely interrelated and if we try to assert any one of them to the detriment of the other two, this will have a negative effect on the whole foreign policy. The foreign policy attitude also needs to be changed. We cannot start from a sense of a mission, and foreign policy cannot be based on historical grievances or merits, on desires or assumptions. Foreign policy has to be based on interests, mutual interests of Hungary and the partner states have to be found, or the opportunity has to be established to coordinate these interests, Kovacs emphasized. He also said that we have to take international realities as a basis, and we have to keep assessing them and gauging the changes. We have to start from the "actual support" for the country's international efforts, and we "must not overestimate Hungary's international importance and role." The MSZP would also like to change the foreign political instrument system and the style of foreign policy. It would stop the practice of trying to "exert pressure" on our neighbors as this has not been successful in the past four years, either. The restriction of relations cannot be a foreign policy instrument, either, because none of our neighbors needs cooperation as much as we do; and we must not try to isolate any of our neighbors and hinder their access to international organizations. At negotiations, the partner must not be treated in a condescending manner or lectured, not even on Hungarian history. It is not the task of Hungarian politicians to make up for the deficiencies, for example, of Western history education, Kovacs says. On the other hand, we have to initiate confidence-building gestures. In politics, we need "to understand the partner's way of thinking," and it is very important to remove the possibilities of misunderstandings and misinterpretations. This is one of the reasons that respect for expertise in foreign policy has to be restored, and the practice that "ambassadors and diplomats, fearing their positions, report what they believe the government or the Foreign Ministry leadership would like to hear" has to be stopped. Workers' Party: Opening Also to the East A serious party cannot ignore the European directions of development; therefore, the Workers' Party is in favor of developing extensive relations in all directions, including the East, Joachim Vasas, member of the party's Executive Committee, emphasized. However, a referendum will have to decide on EU and NATO membership. It is essential that the integration processes are not implemented to the detriment of the country. Up to now, the agricultural sector and industry have been sacrificed at the altar of EU membership and the market of Hungarian goods in Hungary and in the neighboring countries has been destroyed. The country will continue to be waiting for EU membership for years to come because the European Union always backtracks, shuts itself off, makes conditions, and dictates. For professional and political reasons, the Workers' Party does not support NATO membership, because this is against Hungary's elementary national interests. Yugoslavia, Romania, or Ukraine are unlikely to become NATO members, and a Hungarian membership would only increase distrust, further annoy our neighbors, and damage the situation of Hungarians living there. We must strive for normal and balanced economic and political relations with the neighboring countries, Vasas continued, because this establishes the basis for improving the situation of Hungarian minorities living there. As a matter of fact, the Hungarian Parliament, by denying the right to the national minorities living in Hungary to set up independent electoral lists, has lost its ground to speak up for the Hungarians living beyond the border in a credible way. Alliance of Free Democrats: Small Steps Toward Our Neighbors The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] starts from the premise that the three major foreign policy areas, namely European integration, relations with neighboring countries, and the problem of Hungarian minorities living beyond the borders, need to be handled together, Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, foreign affairs spokesman of the SZDSZ, told MAGYAR NEMZET. As for the Europe policy, it is the party's strategic goal that membership of the European Union must follow adequate preparations. This foreign policy task also has many domestic political implications, mainly in the area of the economy and legal harmonization, and the necessary institutions will have to be established to coordinate the preparations. Rather than the time of membership, they consider it vital that the process actually begins and talks on membership are started as soon as possible. Until then, the SZDSZ advocates that cooperation with the European Union should be increasingly diverse. At the same time, in the area of foreign and security policy, they wish to ensure an earlier participation of Hungary in European institutions, and they would also like to achieve our participation in the work of the important European decision-making bodies with consultative rights before full membership is achieved. As for neighborhood policy, according to Szent-Ivanyi, this is the weak side, the most vulnerable part of Hungarian foreign policy at the moment. While there is a general consensus of goals on Europe policy, the approaches fundamentally differ on neighborhood policy. We must not set ideological-style conditions; rather, our interest lies in the ability to make progress concomitantly in two closely related areas, namely in ensuring the rights of Hungarians beyond the border and improving bilateral relations. In the area of neighborhood policy, the politics of small steps is important to make various economic agreements and strengthen cultural links, and it is the SZDSZ's goal that we contribute to the improvement of the situation of Hungarians beyond the border through these links, too. As for the possible signing of the basic treaties, the SZDSZ starts from the premise that these treaties are a means rather than an end: A means to settling the existing problems. Therefore, they advocate such basic treaties that can contribute to easing the disagreements. They do not reject that issues considered important by the partners -- including the border issue -- can be part of these treaties; however, they only see any point in this if the treaties can also resolve the issues considered important by Hungary. In the SZDSZ's view, security policy is inseparable from foreign policy. They consider Hungary's NATO membership a strategic goal. They hope that this can be achieved in a foreseeable period, within a few years. Until then, it is necessary to prepare the proposal that outlines Hungary's tasks within the "Partnership for Peace" program as soon as possible. Independent Smallholders Party: Turning Toward Asia Although the traditional directions of foreign relations have to be maintained, instead of the "one-sided foreign policy orientation," the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] wishes to lay emphasis on areas hitherto neglected. The party led by Jozsef Torgyan would conduct a foreign policy that also considers our economic interests and would pay more attention to Europe, and, for example, to the Scandinavian region. An orientation toward Asia is marked in the party's foreign policy program, they would a "give new meaning" to our policy on this region, mainly to cooperation with India and China, and they would also lay more emphasis on relations with Japan and the "Asian tigers," including Taiwan. On the issue of Hungarians living beyond the border, the FKGP intends to form good-neighborly relations with all neighboring countries, but a triple autonomy, namely cultural, personal, and territorial autonomy, is a condition for this. According to the FKGP, collective rights, self-determination, and autonomy are the three basic pillars of the rights due to Hungarians living beyond the border. Hungarian Justice and Life Party: National Interest Comes First The Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] considers European integration important but this cannot enjoy priority over national interests, MIEP Cochairman Lajos Horvath said. The MIEP feels that Hungarian foreign policy's lukewarm attitude to the national minorities is due to the fact that, in the interest of European integration, its politicians are trying to give the impression that Hungary would even be prepared to abandon the interest protection of its own national minorities in the interest of gaining membership. From the Hungarian security point of view, it would be good if NATO accepted it as a member, but we have to be aware that, through the peace partnership, NATO has actually rejected Central Europe, so we have to organize our security policy cognisant of this fact. Only a referendum can decide on possible membership. The fate of the national minorities living beyond the border has a definite priority within the MIEP's policy. It is important to build good relations with the neighboring countries but this cannot depend on basic treaties, and certainly cannot be a repeat of the formula laid down in the basic treaty with Ukraine. In the spirit of the Helsinki Accord, the MIEP is against the forceful alteration of borders but, apart from this, it is totally unnecessary to lay down these principles again. This would be a gesture submitting ourselves to the will of others, which cannot be accepted by a proud nation.
