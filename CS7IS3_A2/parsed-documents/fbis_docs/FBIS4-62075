In compliance with the Constitution he had to abandon that position when he was elected to parliament. But he was reappointed to that position and simultaneously made a government minister on May 1. This enabled him to retain his seat in parliament. Travkin made it clear that he had not been given any instructions on what he is to be doing in the government. He added he had not had any talks with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin or any other minister on his new appointment. Travkin thought that the government had to include somebody representing local interests. He attributed all failures of the reform to the inability of the government to hear what local officials had to say about its grandiose plans. Travkin thought that with his new appointment the government had an opportunity and had to use it. He dismissed press reports on a split in his parliamentary group in the aftermath of his new appointment. He also thought that his signing of the Civic Accord Pact had nothing to do with the appointment.
