[Al-Sayyani] As you know, the fighting is proceeding well and is moving toward a resolution in favor of the constitutionally legitimate authorities. The forces have made noticeable progress on various lines along an approximately 1,000-km-long front, breaking the secession barrier forever; and they are now near Aden City and are tightening the blockade of the city. Forces in the east are at the gates of 'Ataq city, seeking to gain final control over Shabwah Governorate. Other forces also are advancing toward their targets steadily. [Al-Warraq] What about the other side's claims? [Al-Sayyani] The actual situation on the battlefield answers their claims and falsifications.

We will defeat the forces of apostasy and secession that are trying to harm the brightest aspect of our Arab situation, Yemeni unity, and they will not be allowed to achieve their aims. [Al-Warraq] How long will this take? [Al-Sayyani] The time will be decided by the battle and the field situation. [passage omitted]
