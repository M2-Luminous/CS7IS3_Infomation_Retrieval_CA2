It was followed by full scale R&D of power plants which started in the late 1970s. Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells (1) Development of On-site 200-kW Fuel Cells Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (MELCO) has been developing the phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC) with the intention of early practical use, through the advancement of component technology and demonstration power plants, mostly conducted under the ``Moonlight Project'' promoted by the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, MITI. As a typical activity, the 200-kW cogeneration system installed at the Hotel Plaza was able to obtain excellent results in both performance and practicability through the field operation, and accomplished more than 130,000 hours generation at the end of October, 1991. The second 200-kW power plant for Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. (KEPCO) was installed on Rokko Island in November, 1991 as a demonstration project of new power generation for dispersed use, supported by MITI, and various testings such as switching to the isolated grid without interruption at an occurrence of utility failure are progressing successfully. The third 200-kW on site co-generation plant for the Technical Research Center (TRC) of KEPCO was installed in April 1993 and operation is now being conducted. (Figure 1 [figure not reproduced]) Most recently, a 200-kW system for Yanai P/S of Chugoku Electric Power Co., was installed in May 1993, aiming to test for dispersed use. (Figure 2 [figure not reproduced]) (2) Status and Plan of PAFC Development It can be said that the basic technology for PAFC has already been developed and verified through the aforementioned experiences. At present, development efforts on PAFC are made to realize a compact and low cost plant with high reliability which can meet the market needs. Table 1 shows our activities and plans for 200-kW PAFC. The technical subjects in Table 1 are going to be overcome for the next plant and commercial plants. Table 1.

Max. 2,656 hr 3,380 hr - (1 year) (1 year) Continuous Running Time Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells The development of molten carbonate fuel cells lays emphasis on the realization of the internal reforming, which is a process of reforming fuel such as natural gas, inside the cell by placing reforming catalyst in the cell and effectively utilizing heat and generated steam. This process is subdivided into direct reforming and indirect reforming. The development of the direct internal reforming (DIR) type has been carried out under support by NEDO. A 5kW stack (5000cm<sup> 2</sup> , 10 cells) was successfully operated for more than one year (10,190 hours) with the decay rate of 4mV/1000 hours, performance of averaged cell voltage of 0.78V at 150 mA/cm<sup> 2</sup> , 80% fuel utilization. In addition, a 30kW stack is now under operation and shows good performance which meets the target set by NEDO. (Figure 3 [figure not reproduced]) The indirect internal reforming (IIR) type has a structure in which the reforming catalyst is placed in separate containers and inserted between stacked cells. Although its power generating efficiency is lower than that of the direct type, it is free from the problem of catalyst deterioration and it can expect an early practical application. MELCO is pursuing the development of the indirect type jointly with the Kansai Electric Co., Inc. A 100-kW stack was successfully operated in 1992. Output power of the stack was 109kW and it was operated for 2,308 hours. In the testing, CO<inf> 2</inf> recycle and the use of city gas were evaluated. Based on the results accumulated in these years, a new concept which hybridizes DIR with IIR, is now going to be developed. A 5-kW stack for conceptual evaluation is already successfully being operated now. This concept brings high system efficiency as well as long life time which leads to a practical next generation technology (dispersed and/or central power station application) in the near future.
