Opposition groups have accused the National Republican Alliance (Arena) government of committing fraud in Sunday's general elections. Members and supporters of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), the Unity Movement, the National Conciliation Party (PCN), and Christian Democratic Party (PDC) yesterday occupied a school facility where ballot boxes were being stored. FMLN member Ricardo Samayoa said riot police broke down the main entrance of the school while residents of Jucuapa, in the northern part of Usulutan, surrounded the building to prevent police from taking the ballot boxes to San Salvador. Samayoa added that no one was injured or beaten in the incident. He said members of the right-wing Arena party marked hundreds of ballots before voting began two days ago in nationwide general elections to elect a new president, mayors, and deputies. "All of the political parties were able to confirm this. We found several Arena members with several marked ballots before the voting process began," he said. The ballot boxes were being guarded by representatives of opposition political parties demanding that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] annul the elections in this municipality in the eastern part of the country. They warned that if the TSE does not annul the elections in Jucuapa, those parties that took part in the elections in this region will elect a municipal government by consensus. The TSE has not issued a statement on this incident, which is unprecedented. So far, the ruling Arena party has garnered 49.18 percent of the votes counted up until Monday afternoon to elect the president and vice president. The leftist coalition comprising the FMLN former guerrilla organization, Democratic Convergence (CD), and the National Revolutionary Movement (MNR) has obtained 25.66 percent of the votes, while the PDC has obtained 15.94 percent. The TSE has announced the possibility of a 24 April runoff in which the Arena and leftist coalition candidates will compete for the presidency.
