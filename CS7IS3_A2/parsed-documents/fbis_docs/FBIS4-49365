These new U.S.-made planes include eight Boeing-737, one Boeing-747, one Boeing-757 and one Boeing-767. An official from the China Aviation Suppliers Corporation said that in the past few years, while the world's civil aviation industry has experienced a sluggish market, the Chinese aviation industry has maintained a sustained high-speed increase of over 30 percent. With the expansion of the country's air fleet, Boeing planes have become the first choice for the Chinese market. In 1993 alone 47 Boeings were delivered to the Chinese mainland, constituting 14 percent of the Boeing company's output for the year. At present China is the biggest overseas buyer of Boeings. The official said that the 12 major Chinese airlines use 164 Boeing planes, ranging from Boeing 737-500s, with more than 100 seats to Boeing 747-400s, with 420 seats. Sources said that by the end of this year the number of Boeing planes used by Chinese airlines will exceed 200. In 1995 China Southern Airlines will be the first to receive a Boeing-777, the latest product of the Boeing company. Last year China Southern Airlines ordered six Boeing-777 passenger planes.
