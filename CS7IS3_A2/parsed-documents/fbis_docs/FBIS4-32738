They said that the indictments are full of slanders stressing that they had been maltreated during investigation. The defendants described the grave tortures they had suffered by inspectors of the Serbian State Security, such as the use of electric shock or violent drinking of chemical substances. The head of the jury, Dragolub Zdravkovic, admitted cynically but unwillingly a truth: "According to declarations by the defendants who described the tortures against them by the security, it comes out that not they but those who have caused this violence should be held responsible. It seems to me that this process is not an ordinary one." Defence attorneys of the defendants approved completely Zdravkovic's statement, stressing that their clients are telling the truth in the court.
