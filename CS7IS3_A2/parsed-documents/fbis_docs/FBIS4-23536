A French cameraman was shot and wounded in the southwestern Nyamirambo district of Kigali where government troops and militiamen from Rwanda's Hutu majority have dug in to resist an assault by the mainly Tutsi rebels. General Romeo Dallaire, the head of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) said the talks between general staff officers from the warring sides had been "very positive" and that they had agreed to meet again on Thursday. "We studied the principal document (put forward by UN mediators) and discussed the modalities of a ceasefire, but there is still work to be done," Dallaire said after after chairing the discussions. Two months of clashes and ethnic bloodletting between the minority Tutsis and the majority Hutus have left up to 500,000 dead and displaced another two million people, according to estimates by relief workers. Half a million Rwandans have fled abroad. The warring sides met under UN auspices last week and came to an agreement on the security of UN relief operations and safe passage for civilians being evacuated, but failed to cut a ceasefire deal. During a break in Wednesday's talks, rebel delegation chief Colonel Frank Mugambage said the RPF was insisting on "firm commitments" from the government, which the rebels want to halt massacres behind Hutu lines. The RPF also wants pro-government radios to stop broadcasting incitements to ethnic slaughter. The army wants the civil war to stop before agreeing to anything. After the previous round of talks last Thursday, Mugambage declared that the rebels were "capable of fighting and winning this war if that is the (only) option." The rebels, who have the upper hand on the battlefronts, refuse to recognise the all-Hutu interim government formed after president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in a suspected rocket attack on his plane on April 6. The government has left Kigali for Gitamara, some 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the capital, where further fighting was reported Wednesday. The RPF claims to have pushed back government counter- offensives in the area. The French journalist, Jean-Christophe Klotz, 32, who works for the French film agency CAPA, was hit in the thigh as he accompanied aid workers in a visit to a school where displaced people have sought shelter from the fighting. He was taken to a hospital run by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), where medical staff said he needs rapidly to be evacuated from Rwanda, the ICRC delegation chief in Kigali, Philippe Gaillard said. The Rwandan military delegation led by General Marcel Gatsinzi met the rebel team headed by Mugambage at the UN headquarters in the Amohoro hotel in northeastern Kigali. The army's team was brought to the talks in a UN armoured vehicle, but the rebels later arrived aboard their own transport at the hotel, which lies in a district of the largely abandoned city controlled by the guerrillas. Dallaire, a Canadian, chaired the talks exceptionally in the absence of his deputy, Ghanaian General Henry Anyidoho, who was unable to return to Kigali in time from a mission abroad because the airport was closed. The United Nations suspended flights on Sunday after government troops fired a shell as a UN plane was on the tarmac at the airport, which is jointly administered by the rebels and UN forces.
