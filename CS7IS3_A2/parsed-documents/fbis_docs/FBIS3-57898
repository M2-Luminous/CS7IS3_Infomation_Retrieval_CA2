Unfortunately, this is no longer what the UN mission is about, but to keep the civilian populations from suffering too much, and to facilitate humanitarian aid. What one can see is that there is doublespeak in a way, and that the warring factions, whether Serbs, Croats, or even Muslims, all three behave the same way. They talk about peace and agreements when they are in Geneva, and when they are in Bosnia -- and I do not know whether they are the same ones, because I do not really know how they are organized -- they jeopardize the transport of humanitarian aid and the safety of UN soldiers. I believe that the time has come to put the following question to them: What is happening, and when do you say what you really believe -- when you are in Geneva, where you discuss with the UN and EU representatives, or when you are on the ground, where you jeopardize the safety of UN soldiers, including the French soldiers who are the most numerous and who defend civilians? [Ockrent] Could this question be put formally at the next NATO summit, which is due to take place in Brussels next Monday and Tuesday [10-11 January]? [Balladur] As far as I know, it is not on the agenda, but I would be surprised if the question was not raised. [passage omitted]
