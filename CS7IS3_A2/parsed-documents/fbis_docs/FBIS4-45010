It was, he said, the duty of every rational person and every official in Yemen to stop this war: "We call for urgent Arab intervention, and for redoubled efforts to stop this war and this bloodshed." Al-Asnaj asserted, in a statement to AL-SHARQ, that "the union is not the private property of any one person; it is the expression of the steadfast wish of the Yemeni people." He explained that the continued present military confrontations would make it possible to say that the union was drowning in blood. On another front, AL-SHARQ met with Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, the envoy of Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the [Yemeni] Socialist Party and member of the party's politburo. Al-Dali discussed the current situation in Yemen as follows: [Husayn] Is the Socialist Party ready for a unilateral halt to the fighting? [Al-Dali] We are ready, but this will not happen as long as the other side continues to fight. In principle, we are ready to stop fighting. [Husayn] Are you prepared to accept the deployment of Arab forces? [Al-Dali] If circumstances demand it, and there is no other way to stop the fighting but that solution, then we would not oppose it, if all other paths are closed to us. The other parties that were mediating have suggested the need to meet, in the framework of safeguarding Yemeni unity and implementing the document. [Husayn] Are you prepared to accept the holding of a meeting in any Arab country that offers to host it? [Al-Dali] Yes, we accept that. Inevitably, first of all, the basis for this meeting must be the necessity of a halt to the fighting, first of all, and studying all ways of implementing the pledge and agreement document. It would be mistaken to say that this is an internal matter. If it were an internal matter, why wouldn't we agree to solve the problem? Since we have failed to solve this problem and have resorted to bearing arms, and to fighting, this means that the situation is no longer an internal one; I believe that the situation has become dangerous and complicated, and now concerns every Arab nation. [Husayn] What is the real way out for solving the crisis and stopping the bloodshed? [Al-Dali] We think we are enduring the caesarian birth of a new situation in Yemen, and when we ask for a halt to the fighting, we want to ease the pain of this caesarian birth. We insist on a halt to the fighting, not because we feel defeat, or are running away from the outcome, but to spare the blood of the youth of Yemen who are fighting there.
