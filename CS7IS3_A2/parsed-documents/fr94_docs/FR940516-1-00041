FR940516-1-00041 FR940516-1-00003 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Minerals Management Service 30 CFR Part 250 RIN 1010&hyph;AB52 Safety Requirements Governing Production Platforms and Pipelines AGENCY: Minerals Management Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This rule proposes to revise various safety-related regulations regarding the design and operating procedures of production platforms and pipelines in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The purpose of the revisions is to reduce or prevent the unintentional release of hydrocarbons from pipelines on or near offshore platforms during emergency situations and thereby reduce the potential for explosions or fires. DATES: Comments must be received or postmarked no later than July 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed or hand-carried to the Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, Mail Stop 4700, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, Virginia 22070&hyph;4817; Attention: Chief, Engineering and Standards Branch. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Schneider, Technology Assessment and Research Branch, telephone (703) 787&hyph;1559, or Bill Hauser, Engineering and Standards Branch, telephone (703) 787&hyph;1600. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The MMS is proposing to revise regulations governing design, operation, and maintenance of oil and gas facilities in the OCS. These revisions were recommended by an internal task group that reviewed information on tow tragic offshore incidents in 1988 and 1989. Safety Review Task Group A safety review task group of MMS personnel was established to review available information in the 1988 Piper Alpha platform fire in the North Sea and the circumstances related to an interactive pipeline and platform fire in 1989 at ARCO Oil and Gas Company's (ARCO) South Pass 60 Platform ``B'' facility in the Gulf of Mexico. The group was asked to make specific recommendations regarding regulations and operating practices that would reduce the risk of such incidents occurring in U.S. waters. Following is a capsule summary of each incident. Explosion and Fire on Piper Alpha Platform, North Sea, 1988 Piper Alpha was an oil and gas production platform in the United Kingdom (U.K.) sector of the North Sea that was destroyed by fire in 1988. On July 6, 1988, a series of events and operational mistakes caused an explosion and fires that ultimately destroyed the platform and killed 167 people. Maintenance personnel mistakenly activated an out-of-service injection pump causing a repair flange in the pipework to rupture. Liquid condensate leaked into the production module for several minutes. The gas ignited and exploded, damaging the electrical power generator and the fire pumps. Eventually the fire ruptured the shut-in gas pipelines releasing high pressure gas on the platform. The fire burned for several hours until the pressure was relieved. The platform was completely destroyed.
