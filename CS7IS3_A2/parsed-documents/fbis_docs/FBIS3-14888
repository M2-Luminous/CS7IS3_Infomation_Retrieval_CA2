President Leonid Kravchuk justified his idea by the insufficient time for holding elections at all levels. It cannot be ruled out that the process of election and formation of supreme bodies of legislative and executive power may go beyond the time assigned for it and may overlap the course of early presidential elections and elections to local organs of power. This may lead to a vacuum of power, when the old Supreme Council is no more, a new one is not yet in existence, and Ukraine's Supreme Council, which might take upon itself the entire executive power, has not yet been formed. In this situation, the president alone may actually fulfill state functions. If he also participates in elections at that time, executive structures may collapse and control may be totally lost. This is the determining argument. In view of the fact that the idea expressed in the aforementioned interview is being ambiguously commented upon both in Ukraine and abroad, the Ukrainian Presidential and Cabinet of Ministers Press Service points out that the position expressed by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk was due to precisely that specific situation in the life of our society and state that took shape today and to its possible development in the near future.
