The strategy allows these companies to market their share of discovered crude if they desire. In a statement made today, he said the Egyptian General Petroleum Authority will buy the foreign partner's share of the discovered natural gas under a gas-selling accord. A 75-percent share of gas will be purchased to provide natural gas for production and services as part of a plan to replace oil products with natural gas and secure oil for export to acquire foreign currency necessary to implement the five-year economic-social plan and avoid borrowing. He noted that the Egyptian General Petroleum Authority is constantly working to attract as many international oil and natural gas prospecting companies as possible by inviting international bids for basins with new high oil and natural gas potential to allow these companies to make appropriate decisions on investing in Egypt. He remarked that this policy has succeeded in attracting numerous new companies to Egypt over the past years and that major international companies that left Egypt 10 years ago have decided to return after discovering that Egyptian oil agreements have improved and developed. Dr. al-Banbi said that the oil sector recently opened the door to the Egyptian private sector to participate in oil and natural gas exploration and prospecting because that sector has gained experience in the field. The aim of this plan, he added, is to close the gap that might be caused when some international companies withdraw from the Egyptian market for any reason.
