Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have already been removed from the COCOM lists. While featuring in the COCOM lists, Poland cannot buy the world's most advanced commodities and technologies that may be used for civilian and military purposes. COCOM demanded from the countries concerned to introduce legal regulations allowing for a strict control exports of strategically important goods and technologies to third countries. Poland has launched related legislative procedures but failed to introduce them in time as required by COCOM as a condition to abolish the restrictions. While in Paris the Polish delegation presented the system of controls created in Poland and actions envisaged to guarantee their efficiency. The system of controls is supervised by the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations and a special department of turnover with goods and technologies of strategic importance. Its main aim is to control the possible exports of these goods to third countries. A French mission has been invited to Poland to convince the COCOM authorities about the efficiency of the system. So far over a dozen American, German and British missions have visited Poland. According to the Polish commercial counsellor in Paris, it is possible that Poland will disappear from the COCOM lists before March 31, which is the deadline for the COCOM existence in its present form.
