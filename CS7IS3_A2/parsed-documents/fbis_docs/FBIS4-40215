As already reported, Igor Smirnov, leader of the Dniester region, accused Chisinau last week of silently blocking the dialogue to settle the crisis. He appealed to Vladlen Vlasov, the Russian president's special envoy at the talks, requesting that the latter use his influence over Snegur who, in Tiraspol's view, is avoiding talks. A statement issued today by an official representative of the president of Moldova says that the Republic's leadership has set up a group of experts to draft a bill on the special juridical status of the region on the left bank of the Dniester River. It has been ready to begin work for a long time, but Tiraspol is delaying setting up a similar group for joint work on the bill, as agreed during the meeting held at the end of April between the leaders of Moldova and the Dniester region.
