Over 200 guerrillas launched a pre-dawn attack on Boeng Trakuon village, which was defended by about the same number of government troops headed by Lt Gen Chea Tun. Thai military sources said the Khmer Rouge appear to have routed the defenders and captured the base, which is located opposite Ban Ta Phraya of Ta Phraya district. A black market at Boeng Trakuon, an ammunition dump and a storage bungalow were burned down by the guerrillas. The blaze sent big black plumes of smoke twisting into the sky which were seen from the Thai side of the border. Cambodian army major Kong Savin, who fled to Ban Ta Phraya with the refugees, said at least 20 civilians were killed and an unknown number were captured. He said the Khmer Rouge attack caught the government forces by surprise. He added that the guerrillas had threatened to kill every man who was seen wearing an army uniform. Maj Kong said he deeply appreciated Thailand's humanitarian support for the refugees. Col Atchawin Sawetserani, deputy commander of the Burapha Task Force, said he had received a report that 628 Cambodian refugees had arrived in Thailand and the number was still increasing. The refugees, he said, will be given refuge and food. But armed Cambodian soldiers will be disarmed, he added. The colonel added that the refugees would be repatriated as soon as possible to safe areas where there is no fighting. He said the border passes at Phnom Phra and Phnom Chat would be the repatriation route. He also warned that the Thai military would retaliate if stray shells land in Thailand. "Only one artillery shell landed on the Thai side yesterday, but there has been lots of small arms fire," said the colonel, acknowledging that the cross-border firing might be accidental. A military source said Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been spotted advancing towards Thmar Puok which is the head quarters of the 7th Division.
