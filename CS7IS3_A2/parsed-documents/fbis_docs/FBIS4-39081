[Begin Smirnov recording in Moldovan fading to English translation] I put a political settlement of disturbances between Moldova and Pridnestrovye at the head of the list. Issues were widely covered in the press but nonetheless, continuing this topic, I must say, that for the time being a number of contracts and agreements have been concluded following the agreement signed by President Snegur and President Smirnov in the presence of the CSCE mission and the special envoy of the Russian president. These agreements include not only economic matters but also those concerning the cooperation of law enforcement bodies, the mutual exploitation of air space, cooperation in the customs affairs and the public health protection. So we can see our cooperation is continuing. There are various opinions about these problems both in Moldova and Pridnestrovye. For instance, in Moldova they say that Snegur has recognized Pridnestrovye, while Pridnestrovyan oppositions have said [words indistinct] enough in the question on the Pridnestrovyan confederation. I would like to make some explanation. What is important for a concrete [as heard] man are not only negotiations or any political (shape). The only things which matter is his living standard, which is the fundamental principle that forms the basis of our relations, and which is stipulated in the agreement, [words indistinct], the further progress in our economic relations. The main achievements so far in the establishment of the bank accounting center provide payment between Moldova and Pridnestrovye. Generally speaking, I must stress that we have a positive trade balance in our trade with Moldova because we sell them more goods than we get from them. That is, the normal process of cooperation is going on. As for our relations with Russia, I must say that they are the best and [words indistinct]. No matter what our enemies say, but we work on the government level, we work on the parliament level, they understand us and our cooperation is mainly of economic character. Pay attention that we don't put forward any questions, we don't ask to recognize us as a state. You see, we don't need to get involved in political affairs because these can destabilize the situation in nearby countries. We propose just to cooperate as equal partners which means in principle by de-facto recognition -- not even the political recognition or economic alone. Our economic relations with Ukraine are much better now but still there is the main problem in creating trade joint ventures. I must say that we have the expert balance of trade not only with Moldova, but also with Russia and Ukraine, where it amounts respectively to 14 and 25 milliard rubles. Of all our neighbors, only Belorussia [Belarus] is an exception from this rule. Our import from Belorussia exceeds our export there which should be corrected because the exporting country is always in more preferential position. This process is much influenced by the different national currencies and other difficulties in payment. Of course we don't refuse from the cooperation with Western countries. This year, by the way, a number of foreign businessmen invested their money in the development of our economy [word indistinct]. Speaking about Western investment in our economy, we can't help mentioning such enterprises as [words indistinct] plants of refrigerated trucks/trailers in Tiraspol, metallurgic and [word indistinct] plants in [words indistinct] and many other and I won't enumerate them all because they'll take a long time. Nevertheless, this fact is not a confirmation that European countries are ready to cooperate with us in this sphere. The situation in agriculture is not brilliant as it was expected to be. I mean first of all bad weather conditions. Due to the recent drought and continued spell of hot dry winds and also because of light frost, the situation in agriculture has worsened which requires additional expense. We had to restore about 70 percent of area under crops and in this case against the main burden is shouldered on our industry. Industrial enterprises must earn enough money to buy grain not only for baking but also for fodder. Our sowing campaign was followed by a re-sowing one but all the crops however will be used as a fodder due to bad weather. Except for power sources, grain and sugar are two main products whose production is strictly controlled by the government, and I must say that we have taken certain measures to provide us with a sufficient quantity of elementary products. As for the livestock breeding, here we have chosen another way and now we have completed a special agreement in order to provide a full capacity (operation) of livestock breeding complexes on the following conditions. We'll sell 50 per cent of meat (and they'll) supply us with forage. Another 50 per cent will be distributed on our own market. This scheme allows us to provide enough forage to increase the total amount of livestock and especially of pedigreed livestock. In agriculture, we also welcome foreign investments. We have many joint ventures with Israeli firms, with (agri-business) enterprises from Hungary and Germany and we will continue our cooperation but we are not going to sell our land for our main means of production. Our task is to attract investors in order to provide jobs for all [words indistinct] population. During more than three years of its existence, our republic becomes more firm in its position from day to day and our main position remains the same as before. Every man [word indistinct] on this land should have equal rights with others, should be able to display his abilities and live free regardless of his nationality or language. [end recording]
