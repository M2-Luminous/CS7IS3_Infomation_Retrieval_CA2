The last similar destroyer of the first rank was built at the "Northern Shipyard" joint-stock company back in the time of the USSR. The "Besstrashnyy" will become part of the Northern Fleet, where several such ships are already based. Viktor Chernomyrdin noted that task of building the new Russian fleet must be resolved under extremely difficult conditions in connection with the loss of a number of military bases in the Baltic, Black Sea, and Caspian Sea and also with the complex economic situation and the difficult political circumstances. In commenting on the raising of the Andreyevskiy flag on the destroyer "Besstrashnyy," Andrey Kokoshin said that this was a real celebration for the Armed Forces. It was very difficult for the Ministry of Defense and the personnel of "Northern Shipyard" to complete the construction of the "Besstrashnyy" under the conditions of the extremely acute situation with respect to the financing of the state defense order, noted Andrey Kokoshin. The leadership of the Ministry of Defense continually had to follow the course of the work and provide for even financing. Presently, analogous work is being done with respect to the completion of the heavy nuclear missile cruiser "Petr Velikiy," a destroyer, and an antisubmarine ship.
