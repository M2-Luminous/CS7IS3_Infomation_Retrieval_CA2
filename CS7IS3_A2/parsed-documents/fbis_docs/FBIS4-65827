FBIS4-65827 "drweu100__a94017" FBIS-WEU-94-100-A Daily Report 24 May 1994 ANNEX Italy Summary of Media Reaction to EP Warning Summary of Media Reaction to EP Warning 94P20792A 94P20792A CSO [Editorial Report] On 4 May the European Parliament (EP) passed a motion in Strasbourg reminding Italy, which is currently organizing a new government that includes members of the neofascist National Alliance (AN), that it must continue adherence to the principles it endorsed as a founding member of the European Union (EU). Reaction in the Italian press has varied from condemnation of the motion to demands that the AN formally reject fascism. The motion, which passed by one vote, stated: "The European Parliament demands that EU members let the president of the Republic of Italy clearly know that his government must be faithful to the fundamental values upon which the European Community was founded, after the horrors of fascism and Nazism." Only the Italian-language version of the motion contained the reference to the "horrors of fascism and Nazism," which prompted an apology and a promise to investigate the matter from EP President Egon Klepsch, according to the Turin daily LA STAMPA of 5 May. Top Leaders React An article in the Milan daily IL SOLE--24 ORE of 6 May reported that Italy's top political leaders denounced the EU motion. According to the daily, the motion prompted a "harsh" reply by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. The president of the Senate, Carlo Scognamiglio, and of the Chamber of Deputies, Irene Pivetti, wrote letters to Klepsch expressing their "strong regret" for the approval of a motion which to many "seemed like interference in national sovereignty." The article reported that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Luigi Abete, president of the General Confederation of Italian Industry (Confindustria), lauded Scalfaro's reply, as did outgoing Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. According to the article, Berlusconi said the EP is "incapable of understanding the new" and is guilty of "reasoning with the old schemes." National Alliance (AN) leader Gianfranco Fini said the motion was "an instrumental polemic carried out by the Left, destined to be deflated as soon as the government receives the confidence of parliament." Northern League ideologue Gianfranco Miglio said it was a "classic case of limitation of sovereignty." The leftist opposition, from Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary Achille Occhetto to Communist Renewal member Ersilia Salvato, were less offended and said they could not understand Scalfaro's reaction, because the motion in no way damaged Italy's independence and was a "legitimate" and even "opportune" political act, the article reported. Outgoing Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta of the Italian Popular Party said the motion expressed the "sentiment that is widespread among European leaders." Invalidating Motion Considered An article by IL SOLE's EU correspondent Adriana Cerretelli, which appeared on the same date, reported on efforts by Klepsch to smooth things over by saying he "deplored the assembly's undeserved unwarranted interference in the affairs of a member state" and did not exclude that the vote could be invalidated because of the difference in the text between the Italian version and those in other languages. Italian Social Movement Eurodeputy Cristiana Muscardini has requested that the vote be invalidated, saying the motion was "unjust interference in the nomination process of Italian ministers and a serious injury to the dignity of, as well as discrimination against, the new majority which resulted from democratic elections." According to Cerretelli, certain "ill-intentioned" individuals connected the affair to PDS leader Occhetto's presence at the parliament during the vote. Commentaries Assess EU Jurisdiction, AN Values In a commentary in Milan's PANORAMA of 14 May, Gianni Baget Bozzo wrote that in trying to exert power the EP often exceeds its jurisdiction, but that it has never gone as far as its recent instructions to Scalfaro on the moral and political standards of the new government. According to Baget Bozzo, Italy's longtime loyalty has been repaid by an insult. It is understandable, he wrote, that the mere fact "postfascists" will sit in the EP could upset some individuals, but the concern is excessive and self-serving. After having accepted for years that Italy was a country where communism was different because of national character, it was incorrectly believed Italy's European partners would think the same about the neofascist party. Baget Bozzo suggested that Italians explain to their European counterparts that the neofascists have been members of Italian democracy since 1947 and have in fact been regularly used in the political game by both the Christian Democrats (DC) and the Communists. The DC used them as allies and the Communists never wanted the party outlawed for fear their votes would go to the DC, giving it an absolute majority. Thus the European partners have collaborated with a political system in which the neofascists were a functional part, Baget Bozzo wrote. It is precisely because it is so old that the Italian neofascist party cannot be compared with the French, German, and Austrian nationalist movements. The National Alliance is more postfascist than the progressives are postcommunists, Baget Bozzo maintained. In any case, Baget Bozzo argued, no EU institution can dispute the composition of the government of a member state. PANORAMA correspondent Renzo Rosati wrote on the same day that the verb "demand" is not part of the regular Europarliament vocabulary. It has never been used in reference to the highest institutions of an EU member. Rosati thus found Scalfaro entirely justified when he wrote the EU that "Italy's loyalty to the principles which are at the roots of Europe is a clear and undisputed fact that does not need reminders or instructors." Commentator Marcello Sorgi wrote in the Turin daily LA STAMPA of 5 May that, although the Parliament's motion "constitutes an absolutely exceptional incident and unprecedented interference by a supranational organ in the political and institutional life of a member country," it is also a fact that the current situation in Italy is seen throughout West Europe as an anomaly. To date, little emphasis has been placed on the problem of having postfascists in a government that is a member of the EU, Sorgi maintained. Thanks to the European reaction to this phenomenon it can no longer be ignored. In addition to its news reports on the incident, LA STAMPA of 6 May reported the comments of former Chamber of Deputies President Nilde Iotti of the PDS. Iotti said she could understand how the Italian situation may be viewed as worrisome but added that the Europarliament's resolution was a little "overbearing." She could not recall a position of this type ever being taken before and called it an interference in Italian internal affairs. Iotti termed the motion "something unusual and of a certain seriousness." She said that President Scalfaro, rather than express offense, should have tried to offer the Europeans some guarantees. Also on 6 May, LA STAMPA ran a front-page commentary by journalist Sergio Romano in which he said that although no European forum exists that can dictate regulations on the formation of the Berlusconi government, an "Italian problem" does exist which can "upset foreign observers." If the First Republic had not gone into crisis, Romano wrote, the AN would still be an outsider and no one would have asked AN leader Fini to cut his ties with the hardline members of his party. According to Romano, Fini seems determined to promote democracy in his party; he must, therefore, recognize the two souls of the AN, reject the undemocratic one, and bring to full completion the democratization process begun a few months ago. Fini must do this, Romano wrote, because the people have a right to know exactly what the AN is, what its ideology and political values are, what programs it intends to work for. If he does this quickly, Romano concludes, "no one will pay attention to the `Catos' in Strasbourg; if he continues to hesitate, the Berlusconi government will be born with an `original sin' for which everyone will end up paying." Angelo Bolaffi's commentary in the Rome daily IL MESSAGGERO of 6 May tried to assess whether the "Italian case" was provoked by "unjustified reactions and ill-intentioned insinuations." He concluded that the EP motion expressed a real problem in the wrong way. Thus the motion cannot be ignored and rejected as an inadmissible intrusion in the internal affairs of the country. According to Bolaffi, the way the vote was held was a mistake, as it split the Parliament in two. Since those who voted against the motion can hardly be suspected of being fascists, it is evident, he wrote, that the motion distorted the facts in a way that damaged the image of European institutions. "Why criticize Berlusconi's intentions without first waiting to see what the outcome will be?" Romano asked. A real problem does exist, he added, observing that during AN demonstrations the fascist "Roman salute" is still in use and Fini pretends not to see it. More clarity is needed from the AN, especially a formal condemnation of the fascist era. The AN must do what the old Italian Communist Party did--make a formal act of abjuration. Otherwise, it will continue to be politically excluded in Europe. The Rome daily LA REPUBBLICA of 6 May published a front-page commentary by journalist Alberto Cavallari saying that the clash between Scalfaro and the EP over the entry of neofascists in the Italian Government presents some real problems. First, it is an interference by the EU in the internal affairs of a member state. Second, it shows a lack of respect for the will of the Italian people, which was violated by the warning issued in Strasbourg. Third is the international isolation Italy is risking with a government that includes neofascists; the Rome-Strasbourg clash confirms this possibility. While the EP motion has created these problems, Cavallari nevertheless wrote that the EP has a right to make appeals and issue instructions to its member states because it was legally elected by those states. The EU is no longer an economic community but a European political union that is headed towards supranationality. It therefore has the legitimate right to issue ethical and political guidance to its member states. Were that not the case, the EP could never vote on decisions that in any way modify the sovereignty of its members. Europe, Cavallari observed, is not "foreign": "We are this Europe; its parliamentarians are ours."
