Democratic leader of whip in the House of Representatives Richard Gephardt said the United States must deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea, resume the "Team Spirit" nuclear war exercises and additionally dispatch U.S. troops to South Korea. Republican leader of whip in the Senate Robert Dole also made such remarks, crying for "a deliberation of economic sanctions against North Korea." Meanwhile, U.S. State Secretary Christopher, in his interview with CBS, openly revealed the intention to put pressure on the DPRK by abusing "a resolution of the United Nations" and thus bring the situation of the Korean peninsula to a hopeless phase. All this clearly indicates that the U.S. hardline conservatives are invariably pursuing the reckless policy of isolating and stifling the DPRK. Any pressure and sanctions, however, can never work with the DPRK. The Korean people value peace. But, they will not tolerate anyone who dares infringe upon the nation's sovereignty and dignity. The U.S. war-thirsty elements would be well advised to stop running rashly, clearly knowing of the DPRK where the leader, the party and the popular masses are united in one mind.
