Last year it imported 1.6 million tons of grain. Deputy Minister for Bread Products Mikhail Petrashkevich told INTERFAX that since the beginning of the year, Belarus had imported only 287,000 tonnes of grain (including 87,000 tonnes, purchased by the Ministry for Bread Products and 200,000 tonnes by individual enterprises). Grain is mostly imported from Denmark, Germany and France at $105 to $120 for a tonne. In addition, 5,000 tonnes of grain were bought in the Krasnodar Region and 15,000 tonnes in the Stavropol Territory. Petrashkevich said that grain imports were reduced due to sharp cuts in the production of mixed fodder. Moreover, the population prefers to buy cheap rye bread (previously, wheat was the main import item.) In 1993, Kazakhstan was the biggest grain supplier of Belarus (1 million tonnes). The other CIS countries exported a total of 600,000 tonnes of grain to Belarus. Petrashkevich noted that Belarus did not care from which country it imported grain. Whereas last year, Kazakhstan exported grain to Belarus at reduced prices, this year, the Kazakh Government is demanding $110 for a tonne on the condition that payment is made in advance. Wheat ranks first in Belarusian grain imports (about 600,000 tonnes a year). Observers estimate that as in 1993, Belarus is to harvest about 60,000 tonnes of grain this year. The entire grain crop is to amount to 7-8 million tonnes, compared to almost 7.7 million tonnes in 1993.
