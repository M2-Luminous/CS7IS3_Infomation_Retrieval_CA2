FR940913-0-00038 FR940913-0-00011 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ASW&hyph;51] Modification of Class D: Lawton, OK AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action modifies the Class D airspace at Lawton, OK. The current Lawton, OK, Class D airspace encompasses both the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton, OK, and Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK. The local aircraft operators requested and the FAA decided to divide the Lawton Class D airspace into two individual areas of Class D airspace; one area covering the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton, OK, and the other area covering Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK, as well as re-designate the former Lawton Class E airspace as Fort Sill, OK, Class E airspace. This action is intended to provide for more flexibility in airspace utilization and provide control over each individual area of airspace, particularly during times when the towers are non-operational. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, December 8, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On November 24, 1993, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class D airspace at Lawton, OK, was published in the Federal Register (58 FR 62057). A request was made by local aircraft operators to divide the Lawton Class D airspace, Lawton, OK, into two separate areas of Class D airspace; one area covering the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton, OK, and one covering Henry Post Army Airfield (AAF), Fort Sill, OK. This proposed modification would allow for more flexibility in controlling each individual area of airspace to the extent deemed necessary, particularly during the times when the towers are non-operational. Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. The current Lawton Class D airspace has Class E extension's to the surface area. When Lawton Municipal Airport and Henry Post AAF were designated as separate Class D airspace areas, it became necessary to re-designate the Class E extension's to the previous Lawton Class D airspace area as Class E extension's to the Fort Sill Class D airspace because of their locations. The original proposal failed to address this situation. Therefore, this action corrects that oversight by revoking the Class E extension's to the Lawton Class D airspace. The Class E airspace extension's that have been revoked by this action have been re-instated in the rulemaking action that establishes the Class D airspace for Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill OK. Except for this change, the amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. The FAA has determined that this change will not increase the scope of this rule because it is relieving, i.e. it revokes previous Class E airspace making it less restrictive. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and Class E airspace designations are published respectively in paragraphs 5000 and 6004 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace at Lawton, OK, to separate the Lawton Class D airspace into two separate Class D airspace; one area covering the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton, OK, and one covering Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK. This action also revokes the Class E extension's to the previous Lawton, OK, Class D airspace so it can be redesignated as Fort Sill, OK, Class E airspace. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
