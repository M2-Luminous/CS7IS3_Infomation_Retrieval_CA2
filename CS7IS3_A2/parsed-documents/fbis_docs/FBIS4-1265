Minister Dhokie said Liberians should all be prepared to (?find solutions at the) conference table, noting that the gun can only continue to bring untold suffering to our people instead of helping to heal the wounds inflicted as result of the four-year civil war. Speaking yesterday when he officially took over at the Internal Affairs Ministry, Mr. Dhokie appealed to all warring factions, including the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, NPFL, to effectively implement the disarmament aspect of the Cotonou Accord so as to give participatory democracy a chance in Liberia. Minister Dhokie emphasized that what has happened to Liberia has equally happened to most of the great and developed nations of the world and said what Liberians need now is a demonstration of the virtue of reconciliation, love for one another, and forgiveness in order to rebuild the country. Minister Dhokie said that his ministry is one of the bedrocks upon which the achievement of lasting peace, reconciliation, and reunification rests and assured that he would work tirelessly to bring the people together under the Liberia National Transitional Government [LNTG]. He reminded the Internal Affairs Ministry family of the important role the ministry must play at this crucial time and urged them to remain dedicated, committed, and responsible for the mandate of the LNTG. Minister Dhokie then apologized to the traditional leaders in the country, especially those who left their various counties and got stranded in Monrovia for the suffering the war has caused them and appealed to them to fully contribute to the success of the LNTG. The newly commissioned defense minister, retired Major General Sande Ware, has called on officials of the Defense Ministry to work in unison for the enhancement of policies and programs of the LNTG. He said that it is only through a united front that people of one goal can withstand the test of time in the service of their community and nation. Minister Ware, who retained his position as defense minister, maintained that the hallmark of his administration will be division of land, labor, and hard work at the Defense Ministry. [sentence as heard] The LNTG defense minister made the remark yesterday during his first meeting with officials of the Defense Ministry and members of the general and special staff of the Armed Forces of Liberia. On the crisis in ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], Minister Ware asked the Defense Ministry family to assist in bringing the parties together for the peaceful resolution of the conflict. He described the ULIMO crisis as the most dangerous conflict in the country and appealed to peace-loving Liberians and friends of Liberia to get involved to quickly bring the ULIMO internal crisis (?to a speedy end).
