The chairwoman of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] sent a fax to the prime minister in which she asked him to explain whether it is true that the Council of Ministers is supposed to accept or reject legal documents prepared by the experts. "We absolutely reject the possibility of such a situation. We cannot have decisions that will be binding on everyone but that will only come out of government-Solidarity talks. We also have something to say here," Ewa Spychalska told RZECZPOSPOLITA. Solidarity activists have been saying the whole time that the team of experts is supposed to deal with the trade union's demands, so that they may be referred to the government in due course. "The experts will transform the demands into the language of legal acts, while the Council of Ministers will make the political decision whether to approve," Piotr Zak, a spokesman for the [Solidarity] National Commission told us. But the OPZZ rules out such a situation. "My feeling is that there is a discrepancy between the information I received from the prime minister in our conversation and the way the media reported on the results of the prime minister's talks with Solidarity," OPZZ Chairwoman Ewa Spychalska said Tuesday [22 March], during a break in a session of the OPZZ Council's Presidium. Spychalska is concerned about the fact that, according to media reports, the experts for the government and Solidarity are to work out legislative drafts regarding implementation of the trade union's demands and then submit them to the Council of Ministers for approval. "That suggests a different procedure used by the government in its talks with my colleagues from Solidarity," Spychalska said. The OPZZ chairwoman had been informed that all the experts were to do was to put the demands of Solidarity in a certain order and then refer them to multiparty negotiations within negotiating teams or within the Trilateral Commission because the "demands apply to all employees, not just to Solidarity members." So she sent a fax to the prime minister asking for an explanation. "In every civilized country, differences are resolved within trilateral arrangements. Representatives of all trade unions must be partners for deciding issues that concern all employees," Spychalska said. She also added that, when it comes to a point where the government treats various trade unions differently, the OPZZ will make decisions on what to do next. But she refused to explain what kinds of decisions these could be, apart from saying that they will try to get the desired results "with every legally allowed method." The OPZZ is waiting for the prime minister's decision regarding the activity of experts for the government and Solidarity. When asked to comment on the OPZZ chairwoman's doubts, Dariusz Jadowski, director of the Government's Press Office, only cited an excerpt from a joint communique issued after the Pawlak-Krzaklewski meeting: "Results of the prime minister's meeting with the chairmen of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union `Solidarity' and other trade unions, like the results of the experts' work, will be presented to a session of the Council of Ministers and debated there." --The following trade unions declared that they are joining the OPZZ: The Polish Bailiffs Trade Union and the Copper-Industry Employees Trade Union. The latter was a member of the trade union center as a member of the Miners Trade Union Federation, which it left along with the ZFFG [expansion unknown]. In December of 1991, the Copper Industry Employees Trade Union received the legal status of an all-Polish trade union. Ryszard Zbrzyzny, its chairman, headed a strike committee that conducted a 32-day strike in the KGHM SA "Polish Copper" in July and August 1992. According to Zbrzyzny, the trade union has 12,000 members. --The Presidium of the National Commission of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity" has issued an appeal to the Brown Coal National Section not to begin an active strike that was planned for 24 March and to wait until the strike headquarters issues a decision.
