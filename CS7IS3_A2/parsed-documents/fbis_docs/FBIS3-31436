Only two days later, a car accident occurred in which Liviu Luca was seriously injured, while the "offender," SRI [Romanian Intelligence Service] Lieutenant Colonel Ion Buica, died. Although the interview, which was granted confidentially in Mr. Luca's office, was published only on Monday, 14 February 1994, by TINERETUL LIBER, we ask ourselves to what extent his bold statements and the accident that was caused by a SRI officer were just an ordinary coincidence.
