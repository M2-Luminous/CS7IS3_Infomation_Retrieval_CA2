This question has been asked by many people after information reached us from Livno that Mate Boban had laid down the presidential mandate of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna. There had been rumors about Boban's resignation for a long time, but no one expected that it would happen that dramatically. Boban publicly announced his resignation at the end of his speech in the extraordinary session of the chamber of counties of the parliament of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna. His decision was neither voted for nor was it discussed very much. The information that the duties of the president will be performed by a collective body -- the presidential council -- confirms that Mate Boban is not the first man in Herceg-Bosna any longer. The fact that the chamber of representatives of the parliament of Herceg-Bosna adopted in its session in Livno the declaration that confirmed the present politics and the attitude that a sovereign Croatian state in the future union of Bosnia-Herzegovina would be the optimal solution to the Croatian national problem in this area made the confusion caused by Boban's resignation even worse. Boban's resignation can also be discussed in the light of the meeting held in Sarajevo, in which -- regardless of the legitimacy of its participants -- the idea about Herceg-Bosna as the only possible solution to the Croatian problem in Bosnia-Herzegovina was rejected. Most of the participants in the Livno meeting denied the Sarajevo meeting participants the right to speak on behalf of the Croats who live both in Bosnia and in Herzegovina, but nothing more than that was done. That is why many people are ready to conclude that Boban's resignation is a sign of a certain turn in the politics of those Croats who have so far supported the idea of Herceg-Bosna as the only possible option. The basic elements of this option will probably not be changed, but it is obvious that other proposals might also be accepted. We have to see Boban's resignation in that light. The space for new ideas has been created, although it is obvious that the two Croatian options -- the one in Bosnia and the other in Herzegovina -- cannot come closer soon. We have to wait for the international political factors to act and see how they will assess the resignation of the Croatian leader of the republic of Herceg-Bosna. If we can judge by the contacts Mile Akmadzic has had so far on behalf of Herceg-Bosna, there are good prospects for future negotiations.
