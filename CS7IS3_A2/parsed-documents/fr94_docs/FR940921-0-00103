FR940921-0-00103 FR940921-0-00016 54. Section 86.132&hyph;90 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(4) introductory text and (a)(4)(ii) introductory text, to read as follows: §86.132&hyph;90 Vehicle preconditioning. (a) * * * (4) The Administrator may also choose to conduct or require the conduct of additional preconditioning to insure that the evaporative emission control system is stabilized in the case of gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles, or to insure that the exhaust system is stabilized in the case of petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel vehicles. * * * * * (ii) Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. The preconditioning shall consist of either of the following: * * * * * 55. Section 86.132&hyph;96 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraphs (b), (e)(2) heading and introductory text and (f), to read as follows: §86.132&hyph;96 Vehicle preconditioning. * * * * * (b)(1) Gasoline- and Methanol-Fueled Vehicles. Drain the fuel tank(s) and fill with test fuel, as specified in §86.113, to the ``tank fuel volume'' defined in §86.082&hyph;2. The fuel cap(s) shall be installed within one minute after refueling. (2) Gaseous-Fueled Vehicles. Vehicle fuel tanks to be filled with fuel that meets the specifications in §86.113. Fuel tanks shall be filled to a minimum of 75% of service pressure for natural gas-fueled vehicles or a minimum of 75% of available fill volume for liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Prior draining of the fuel tanks is not called for if the fuel in the tanks already meets the specifications in §86.113. * * * * * (e) * * * (2) For petroleum-fueled diesel, methanol-fueled diesel, and gaseous-fueled vehicles. The preconditioning shall consist of either of the following: * * * * * (f) (1) Gasoline- and Methanol-Fueled Vehicles. Within five minutes of completion of the preconditioning drive, the vehicle shall be driven off the dynamometer and parked. For gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles, drain the fuel tank(s) and fill with test fuel, as specified in §86.113, to the ``tank fuel volume'' defined in §86.082&hyph;2. The vehicle shall be refueled within one hour of completion of the preconditioning drive. The fuel cap(s) shall be installed within one minute after refueling. (2) Gaseous-Fueled Vehicles. Within five minutes of completion of the preconditioning drive, the vehicle shall be driven off the dynamometer and parked. Vehicle fuel tanks shall be refilled with fuel that meets the specifications in §86.113. Fuel tanks shall be filled to a minimum of 75% of service pressure for natural gas-fueled vehicles or a minimum of 75% of available fill volume for liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Prior draining of the fuel tanks is not called for if the fuel in the tanks already meets the specifications in §86.113. * * * * * 56. Section 86.133&hyph;96 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3), to read as follows: §86.133&hyph;96 Diurnal emission test. (a)(1) The diurnal emission test for gasoline-, methanol- and gaseous-fueled vehicles consists of three 24-hour test cycles following the hot soak test. Emissions are measured for each 24-hour cycle, with the highest emission level used to determine compliance with the standards specified in subpart A of this part. The Administrator may truncate a test after any 24-hour cycle without affecting the validity of the collected data. Sampling of emissions from the running loss and hot soak tests is not required as preparation for the diurnal emission test. The diurnal emission test may be conducted as part of either the three- diurnal test sequence or the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence, as described in §86.130&hyph;96. * * * * * (3) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence, the diurnal emission test outlined in paragraph (p) of this section follows the alternate hot soak test specified in §86.138&hyph;96(k). This test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles. * * * * * 57. Section 86.134&hyph;96 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §86.134&hyph;96 Running loss test. (a) Overview. Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles are to be tested for running loss emissions during simulated high-temperature urban driving; this test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles. During operation, tank temperatures are controlled according to a prescribed profile to simulate in-use conditions. If the vehicle is determined to have exceeded the standard before the end of the running loss test, the test may be terminated without invalidating the data. The test can be run either in a sealed enclosure or with the point-source method, as specified in paragraph (g) of this section. * * * * *
