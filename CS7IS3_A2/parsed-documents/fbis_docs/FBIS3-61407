Raw material and the intellect - these are the basic wealth of our Fatherland which, at the present historical juncture, are the only basis of social-economic transformations. Much is said and written about raw materials. The intellectual resource, of course, also is of colossal economic potential. If it is not to be lost... However we are losing it. Expenditures for science at the beginning of 1980s were 4.5-4.7 percent of the national income; in the past and current years they are about one percent. And, the national income itself has dropped. The technical armamentarium of national science which, even without this fact, constitutes just a little more than 1 percent of the U.S. level, continues to fall. The average salary of a scientist here is approximately half that in industry; in America the proportion is the reverse. A substantial number of our more highly qualified specialists are emigrating. Thus, in the NASA system alone (USA) more than 100 of our former citizens are engaged in space-related research. In Israel 90 percent of military-industrial complex specialists are former Soviet citizens. In France, 30 percent of mathematics teachers hired in the universities in the past year are Russian. All these are merely particular facets to the dangerous process which is already turning into a catastrophe for Russia. National technological security is an integral part of a more general concept, the national security. A clear definition of the latter remains to be developed on the basis of a formulation of contemporary and future national state interests of Russia. However, the alarm must be struck quickly in the case of an obvious threat to these interests. Otherwise, no formulations at all will be needed. The task of ensuring technological security can be represented as a system of measures directed toward the maintenance of the maximally achievable level of the development of the domestic scientific-technical and production potential given any development in the international situation. This refers to a level which would guarantee the survival of the national economy through our own intellectual and technical resources, which would guarantee its defense adequacy and economic independence. The most evident signs of the breakdown of the countryUs technological security is the disintegration of the national scientific and technical potential and the formation of a one-sided technological dependence on the more developed Western countries. Today Russia is experiencing the influence of both of these factors. Moreover, there is on hand a process of intense disintegration of RussiaUs scientific-technical potential in the form of the erosion of its personnel component, brain drain, deterioration of the material-technical and information base of science, the lack of demand for scientific and technical achievements, etc. Domestic science and technology, in particular, have been placed in circumstances in which their further development has begun to a substantial degree to depend on Western material and financial assistance. However, even with the outwardly entirely positive role of this assistance, it even now carries within itself the anlagen of further disintegration of national technological security. Analysis of the forms and methods of the rendering of financial and material support to Russian science by the West (the amount of the help, both actually furnished as well as promised, amounts today to nearly half a billion dollars, or almost 500 billion rubles at today's dollar exchange rate) shows that, apart from a large number of positive factors, it also has definite negative consequences. Above all, the system of information collection itself, concerning scientific developments, institutions, and research personnel for the submission of applications to receive grants and other forms of assistance from foreign organizations (scientific establishments, funds, international organizations, etc.), offers the West the possibility of possessing an exhaustive notion of the contemporary state and problems of the development of the Russian scientific-technical potential, to a degree of knowledgeability that Russian governmental bodies responsible for the development of domestic science and technology do not have. It seems appropriate to point out that by now more than 10 different funds have been established in the West for the support of science in Russia and the other countries of the CIS. Among these are the well-known Soros Fund (USA), which has allocated $100 million to the countries of the Commonwealth for 1993-1994, the National Science Fund of the USA ($25 million), the McArthur Foundation ($3 million), and the Mitterand Fund, a general European fund (4 million ECU). The detailed knowledgeability regarding our potential enables the West to identify the most promising lines of research and the most qualified and productively working scientific personnel for their later use in one form or another in the interests of the development of Western science and technology, and economy as a whole. The financing of the work of individual Russian scientists and of scientific collectives through the system of foreign grants and other forms of assistance, the provision of contemporary research equipment, instrumentation, and materials, and other forms of aid to the general extent indicated above, which is also comparable to the extent of domestic financing of Russian science (680 billion rubles in 1993), have yet another negative aspect. This offers the West the possibility of destroying a substantial portion of the scientific-technical potential of Russia from the solution of urgent national economic scientific and technological problems confronting it, thus creating in our country a peculiar sector serving the needs of the Western economy. In truth, whoever pays the piper calls the tune. Moreover, the possibility arises of the closing down of particular lines of development of Russian science and technology, even of blocking them, especially in those fields in which the particular achievements might prove competitive on the world market for the industrial products prepared on their basis. Due to the substantial (up to 60-100-fold) difference in the pay of the Western and the Russian scientist, the West thus saves a great deal of money for science. On the other hand, the receipt by Russian scientists and specialists of currency from Western grants and other assistance leads to social tension in scientific collectives, and places scientific establishments and institutes under obviously unequal conditions. In their race for currency wages, given the acute deficit in domestic investments in science and technology, many scientists and whole scientific collectives are ready to sell scientific and technical achievements abroad for nothing, which in a number of instances exceed the world level and which constitute a genuine national property of Russia. The latter phenomenon is especially dangerous in the sphere of the military-industrial complex, since it is directly related to the weakening of the country defense potential. This practice has become very noticeable recently; however, measures for its control had not been worked out. In fact, the transfusion to the West of a substantial portion of RussiaUs national wealth is taking place without equivalent compensation. It must be stated, regrettably, that the question of RussiaUs technological security has somehow fallen from the field of view of the countryUs leadership. The blunder that has been permitted, which is of strategic significance, must be eliminated as fast as possible, since the process of undermining the national technological security has reached a limit beyond which it takes on an uncontrollable character. From our point of view, the core of the preservation and strengthening of Russia's national technological security under the new conditions must be the principle of equal technological dependence of the partners in international collaboration, to be formed exclusively under the conditions of international scientific-technical cooperation. This principle presupposes the openness of Russian scientific-technical potential to the outside world, and rejection of autarchy, which corresponds to the spirit of economic reform, RussiaUs interests, and the interest of the international community. We have in mind also the equivalence of the potential damage to the partners in case of a rupture in international technological relations. There is a stake in the guarantee of an even-handed, synchronized technological development of the participants in international collaboration, which excludes the possibility of their lagging markedly one behind the other or of one outstripping the other. The reality is such that the preservation and growth of the scientific-technical potential of our country is possible only given the provision of the optimal combination of internal and external sources of influence. External factors will probably be predominant in todayUs conditions. However, Western aid in its various forms should not simply be welcomed, but the appropriate mechanism for its most effective acquisition, distribution, and use in the interests of Russia should also be created. The viability of domestic science, and consequently, the technological security of Russia can and must be achieved through our own efforts, through the mobilization of internal sources and reserves, above all through broad state support of a national scientific-technical potential. It is advisable above all to strengthen the legal foundation. For this purpose a package of laws should be adopted regarding scientific-technical policy, the scientific academies of Russia, the academic scientific institution, the status of the scientific worker, and the protection of intellectual property, state and other secrets. An ensemble of legislative and normative acts, regulating the process of brain drain both from Russia abroad and from the countries of the former USSR into Russia is also required. It would make sense to create a data bank on Russian scientists and specialists (including undergraduates and graduate students) who would be able to go abroad for possible on-the-job training or contract work. A data bank on Russian technologies of interest for potential foreign partners is also a practical necessity, with the aim of possible commercial sale without harm to the countryUs security. It is evident that this logically presupposes also the creation of an interdepartmental authority (similar to the existing Gostekhkomissiya [State Commission for New Technology], but expanding and supplementing its function) to control the process of the transfer of Russian technology abroad for temporary or permanent operation, a kind of Russian COCOM [Coordinating Committee]. It seems advisable to organize on a comprehensive basis the coordination of the efforts of the international community to offer assistance for the preservation and development of the Russian scientific-technical potential. Such coordination would include also the creation of an international information system in this sphere, of a unified financial fund or bank, and of an insurance company. All this would make access to external sources of financing simpler and socially fair in the interests of all of Russian science, and not of an isolated portion of it. From the Editorial Board.
