Thank you for granting us this interview. [Peres] Thank you. [Zabludovsky] Mr. Peres, Israel and Mexico have had diplomatic relations since 1952. What is the current state of these relations? [Peres] Between Mexico and Israel? [Zabludovsky] Yes, please. [Peres] Well, first of all, Mexico has changed considerably. It is not the same Mexico since I last visited. I think Mexico is in the middle of a change and in the future it will undergo greater change. Soon, we will see great economic, social, and other changes in Mexico. I have a lot of admiration for all that Mexico has achieved and is achieving. Israel has also changed. We went through many wars; we won them and now we are waging the greatest war of all, which is the war for peace. I am sure that we will win this war as well. We would like to establish cooperation with Mexico in four different areas. In the economic area, we would like to have a parallel agreement between Mexico and Israel like the one that exists between the United States of America and Israel. Second, we would like to avoid double taxation. Third, we would like to establish scientific and technological cooperation between Mexico and Israel. Fourth, and most important from my viewpoint, is the need to strengthen our cultural exchanges. Mexico, like the rest of Latin America, is a great continent for literature, art, painting, and sculpture. In Israel, culture is a priority. I think we should bring our respective countries' authors and the readers together to have a cultural exchange and not only political and economic exchanges. [Zabludovsky] Can you tell us about relations between Israel and the Vatican? [Peres] That is really something sensational. For the past 1,994 years, our relations with the Catholic world have had their ups and downs, more downs than ups. For the first time, we have reached an understanding that was formulized by the Vatican and Israel. In January of this year, we signed an agreement to exchange ambassadors. The signing of the agreement was done in Jerusalem. It is a dramatic, historic, and religious change between two important religions. This is the result of a diplomatic event that happens once every 2,000 years and I am very glad that it happened this year. I am looking forward to a new understanding for tolerance between the Christian world and the Jewish world. I have had the pleasure to invite the Pope to visit Israel and I understand that he will do it in the near future. He told me that the Lord extended his life so that he would be able to visit Israel, Jerusalem, and the Holy Land. [Zabludovsky] Mr. Peres, you have been one of those who made many efforts to attain peace with the PLO. What is currently happening in the Middle East? [Peres] I think the Middle East will change like the rest of the world. There is a new wind blowing all over the place. What is happening today is that the real political strengths are neither the political parties, nor the traditional armies, nor the influential super powers. The most important force is this camera because people, young and old, are waking up every morning and seeing what is happening in the world. They ask themselves: Why is it that in other countries people can move around freely, have a better life, and behave in a civilized matter? They ask themselves: What is wrong with our country? For example, I believe that what brought down communism was not an army, invasion, or party. What brought communism down was information of what was happening in the world. The silver curtain became stronger than the iron curtain. The government could no longer lie to the people. The same is happening in the Middle East. Whatever you see today is what happened yesterday. Tomorrow, and perhaps even today, young people, Arab, Palestinians, Israeli, Christian, Muslim, and Jew, will try to compare their lives with the lives of others and ask: Why should we have wars? Why should we waste hundreds of millions of dollars on weapons? Why should we support a dictatorship? Dictatorships in our days have become so expensive that only the rich countries can have dictatorships. The poor people are no longer willing to pay for the craziness and egomania of dictators. I deeply and sincerely believe that in the near future, the next generation will prefer peace, freedom, and science. That is the future. [Zabludovsky] What is the future of Jerusalem? [Peres] Jerusalem is politically closed and religiously open. Throughout history, Jerusalem has never been the capital of Arab life. On the other hand, in Jewish life, we have never had another capital but Jerusalem. Jerusalem is not only the capital of our prayers, but the capital of our existence. So we are not going to divide Jerusalem; we are not going to turn Jerusalem into a Berlin; we are not going to divide Jerusalem and build a wall. It will remain united as the capital of Israel. But while politically it is closed, religiously it will remain open. Every believer, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, who wishes to come and pray to God in his language, in his tradition, in his church, mosque, or synagogue, will have the right and the opportunity to do so. It will be our responsibility to secure his free coming, to secure his free worship, to respect his own faith and his own heritage and tradition. [Zabludovsky] Were you pleased with the explanation Mr. 'Arafat gave to the call to a Holy War for Jerusalem? [Peres] No. 'Arafat is using the language of yesterday. It is old and dangerous. But when it comes to policies, he made a change. So when I judge 'Arafat by his words I feel very bad; but when I judge 'Arafat by his decisions, I feel that we must continue and provide peace for Palestinians and Israelis. [Zabludovsky] Do you trust 'Arafat? [Peres] Do I talk to him? Oh, my God, day and night. You know, in the Middle East you shake hands during the day and you negotiate at night. I have forgotten what a morning is like because usually the negotiations begin late at night and go through the night. There have been many long nights, some of them extremely complicated and difficult. [Zabludovsky] Will Israel withdraw its support for Arab autonomy? [Peres] I am sorry, I did not get the question. [Zabludovsky] Could Israel suddenly back out of the Palestinian autonomy issue? [Peres] Who? [Zabludovsky] Israel. [Peres] No. We made up our minds. In many ways we are negotiating with ourselves more than with the Palestinians. The reason why we are negotiating -- and we are on the giving side and not on the receiving side -- is because we do not want to become, or remain, a dominating nation. Jewish history is 4,000 years old. Never in our lives did we control, govern, or dominate other people. The people who tried to dominate us have disappeared from history. We do not want to dominate the Palestinian people or Palestinian life. We would like to see the Palestinians elect their leaders, nominate their judges, appoint their police, have the right economy, raise their standards of living, and become good neighbors. They will be our neighbors and Israel will be their neighbor and neither of the two should attempt to impose their will on the other. [Zabludovsky] Can a similar agreement be reached with Syria on the Golan Heights? [Peres] It is possible, but, for the time being, President al-Asad has not opened up. He is speaking about normalizing relations with Israel, but how can he normalize relations with Israel if he is not willing to normalize negotiations with Israel? We cannot conduct negotiations in a narrow channel full of microphones. We negotiate and there is no progress. We believe that if al-Asad wants peace then he must do it as it is being done at the end of the 20th century. These negotiations must be open, conducted at political level and highly professional. These negotiations must be conducted with the knowledge of the people. The parties meeting in private must do so with the knowledge of the people because it is not a negotiation between leaders but between peoples. Today, everyone is a diplomat and everyone is a judge. We would like to see the Israeli people convinced that Mr. al-Asad means business. He wants something from us that is tangible, a mountain. We want something from him that is not tangible, peace. Now peace must be as clear as the mountain is. [Zabludovsky] Mr. Peres, do you think it is possible for Israel to live in peace with its neighbors? [Peres] Yes, Israel could and would live in peace with its neighbors if the neighbors do likewise. All the things that are important today in the lives of the people cannot be attained through war. Whatever war can achieve is no longer important. In the past 10 years, the Middle East spent a trillion dollars in weapons. This money was taken away from the mouths of the children; it was taken from their schools and their future. We do not have the right to continue doing this. With half that money, we would have been able to dramatically change the Middle East. I believe more and more Arabs are beginning to see this. [Zabludovsky] Thank you Mr. Peres. [Peres] Thank you.
