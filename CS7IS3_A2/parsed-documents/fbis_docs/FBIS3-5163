"SBSI is an illegal organisation. If workers wish to forward complaints, they should do so through the SPSI," he said, referring to the country's only recognised labour organisation, the All-Indonesia Workers Union. Suyono, speaking to reporters during a meeting with Tyfountex Co. Ltd. employees in Sukoharjo district, said workers should consult the legal SPSI in the event of any disputes. "If there is any dispute between you and your company, you may lodge your complaints through SPSI who should respond immediately," he urged the company's workforce who went on strike on February 11 to protest against working conditions. Tyfountex, meanwhile, has not given the workers any assurance. Suyono reminded employers to meet all regulations of workers' rights in order to improve productivity. "Employers should meet all the rights of the worker in accordance with regulations so that they can improve on their job performance." During his visit, the military commander also stopped over at Batik Keris Co. Ltd., who similarly faced a strike a few days ago. Batik Keris director said the company had settled the dispute with its workers. "All our employees have gone back to their work," he said. The company employs some 25,000 workers.
