FR940920-1-00019 FR940920-1-00003 Wyoming DEQ has now completed the negotiated rule making process, only to be notified by the State Attorney General's office that the proposed rule is in conflict with two sections of existing statutes [W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) and (c)] and that conflict prohibits DEQ from promulgating the rules until the statutes are changed. In view of this opinion, and on September 1, 1994, the State of Wyoming, Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) submitted a second request to extend the time frames at 30 CFR 950.16(bb) through (gg), as codified in the January 24, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 3521), in order to allow the State time to introduce new statutory changes to the Wyoming Legislature during the 1995 Legislative Session (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;26&hyph;7). Wyoming DEQ has prepared the required modifications to the statutory language for submission to the Wyoming Legislature's Mines and Minerals Committee for sponsorship in a bill to be introduced during the next Legislative Session which begins in January 1995. Wyoming is requesting an extension to November 1995. The State's request outlines a time line schedule from October 1994 to November 1995. The schedule identifies milestones such as: When the Mines and Minerals Committee received the proposed statutory changes from DEQ: submission of the proposed rule to the Land Quality Advisory Board; introduction to the Legislature for debate; approval by the Governor; required revisions to the rule based on Statutory changes; required 45 days comment period; Environmental Quality Council hearing; and, submittal of a formal State Program amendment to OSM in November 1995. OSM is now considering Wyoming's request to further extend the time frames and is seeking public comments on whether the proposed extension can and should be granted. III. Public Comment Procedures In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed extension request satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the extension request is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Wyoming program. Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under DATES or at locations other than the Casper Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included in the administrative record. IV. Procedural Determinations 1. Executive Order 12866 This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). 2. Executive Order 12778 The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.
