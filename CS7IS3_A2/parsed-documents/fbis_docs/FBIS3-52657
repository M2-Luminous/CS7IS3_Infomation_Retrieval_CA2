The sources said that the Aden military commanders rejected the document, which carried the slogan "prohibition of secession and condemnation of infighting," and called instead for a comprehensive dialogue on the future of the armed forces and ways of building that institution in a way that would keep it out of partisan, family, regional, and sectarian loyalties and make it the safety valve of unity. According to the same sources, the document of the military figures who came from Sanaa offered three options to keep the explosive fuse away from the Army. They are: 1. The first option: the transfer of some adjacent units facing one another in some areas in the governorates of Ta'izz, Lahij, Ibb, Shabwah, Ma'rib, and al-Bayda' to areas to be agreed upon in the governorates of Hadramaut, Shabwah, Ma'rib, al-Jawf, and Sa'dah (border areas) in a way that would fulfill the state's strategic defense requirements, protect vital targets, and seal off smuggling routes in these areas. The units whose transfer is required are: A. The 3d infantry brigade (Ta'izz); the Labbuzah brigade (Kirsh). B. The 2d independent armored brigade (al-Hurrah camp in Ibb); the 'Abbud brigade (al-Dali'-al-'Anad) C. The 56th brigade (al-Bayda'); the 20th brigade (Mukayris) D. The Mulham brigade (Bayhan); the 6th infantry brigade (Harib). 2. The second option: The merging of the abovementioned adjacent units -- that is merging each unit with the one facing it. 3. The third option: An exchange of camps between the adjacent units by having them replace one another, and the transfer of the 2d armored brigade from al-Hamrah camp to al-Dali'-al-'Anad camp and the transfer of the 'Abbud brigade from al-Dali'-al-'Anad camp to al-Hamrah camp. The document also proposes that the political leadership give absolute authority to the defense ministry command and the chief of the general staff in determining the ideal size of the armed forces and in the reorganization and redeployment of these forces and completion of the measures for their merger in accordance with the strategic defense requirements and the homeland's higher interests. Other proposals included return of military commanders and, especially, the defense minister to their posts in Sanaa and Aden, ending conscription, armament, and mobilization of units, militias, border guards, popular guards, and others, and cancellation of the measures already taken. The Aden military reject that document and, according to the sources, see it a "military and political trap." Responsible military sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the military meeting held in Aden last week flatly rejected that document and called for a general dicussion of the armed forces situation not just the circumstances relating to the current political crisis. The sources confirmed that the military will resume their meetings today in the capital, Sanaa, on the basis of the points raised by the Aden military commanders at the previous meeting, which include the following: 1. Abolition of the Republican Guard (attached to the presidency), merging it with the armed forces. 2. Abolition of the military police and and keeping its tasks confined within the framework of the armed forces. 3. Abolition of the central security [force], merging it with the interior ministry and the general security [forces]. 4. Assignment of guards for political figures including the president, the vice president, and the other Presidential Council members on the basis of the importance of the country's political figures and also tribal leaders. 5. Agreement to move all camps out of the towns and provincial capitals. 6. The political leadership should leave management of the army to the military, which means giving the defense minister vast powers. [passage omitted]
