Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (``Act''), notice is hereby given that on May 25, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act, the NASD hereby files a proposed rule change to delete Part IX of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws which contains procedures for market maker access to The Nasdaq Stock market (``Nasdaq'') by certain broker-dealers that do not receive Level 3 Nasdaq Workstation service (``Level 3 service''). Below is the text of the proposed rule change; deleted language is bracketed. [Part IX] [Procedures for Access to the NASDAQ System by Non-NASDAQ Market Makers] [These procedures permit a registered NASDAQ market maker, upon approval by the Corporation, to enter quotations into the NASDAQ System on behalf of another market maker who does not subscribe to Level 3 NASDAQ Service.] [A. Definitions] [1. An ``access market maker'' is a member of the Association who does not subscribe to Level 3 NASDAQ service, but is or intends to be a market maker in a security for which quotations are displayed on the NASDAQ System.] [2. An ``entering subscriber'' is a registered NASDAQ market maker who has entered into an arrangement with an access market maker to enter quotations in the NASDAQ System on behalf of such access market maker.] [B. The entering subscriber may enter quotations in the NASDAQ System on behalf of an access market maker only upon submission and approval by the Association of the following:] [1. A fully executed copy of the access arrangement agreement which shall contain all agreements and conditions concerning the access arrangement.] [2. An application for registration as an access market maker for each security.] [C. Access market makers and entering subscribers shall be limited to one access arrangement in each security.] [D. Quotations displayed by the entering subscriber on behalf of the access market maker shall be accompanied by the entering subscriber's market maker identifier and a special symbol designating that an access arrangement exists. The identity of the access market maker must be made available by the entering subscriber upon request.] [E. All transactions resulting from the display of quotations in the NASDAQ System by the entering subscriber shall be executed by the entering subscriber and he shall be responsible for the transaction. Both the entering subscriber and the access market maker shall be subject to and be responsible for compliance with the provisions of Schedule D.] [F. Access market makers shall pay to the Corporation an access fee of $70 per month for the first security and $52.50 per month for each additional security which is subject to an approved access arrangement.] II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to eliminate an outmoded procedure by which certain NASD member firms could participate as market makers in Nasdaq without procuring the necessary computer equipment and subscribing to Level 3 service. Currently, Part IX of Schedule D permits a member firm that does not receive Level 3 service to qualify as an ``access market maker'' by entering into a suitable agreement with another firm that is a Level 3 subscriber (``entering subscriber''). After the NASD's approval of such an arrangement, the entering subscriber can input two-sided quotations reflecting the dealer interest of the access market maker. These quotations would be displayed with the entering subscriber's market maker identifier; a special indicator would also be displayed to inform other dealers that an access arrangement existed with respect to the quotations displayed in the subject security. In this circumstance, the entering subscriber assumed responsibility for executing trades at the displayed bid and offer. The entering subscriber and access market maker were jointly responsible for compliance with the various market maker obligations set forth in Part V of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws. In conjunction with defining the system requirements for Nasdaq's technology migration, the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (``NSMI'') staff analyzed the cost and feasibility of providing functionality for access market makers in the new environment. The staff found that changes in market making practices in recent years had dramatically reduced the use of the access market maker arrangement. The staff also found that no NASD member was currently utilizing this access feature. Given the absence of interested firms and the lack of any regulatory purpose in preserving the access market maker feature, it was determined that this feature did not warrant the expenditure of resources necessary to provide this functionality in the new environment. The NASD also believes that it is preferable to limit market maker participation to Level 3 service subscribers to ensure integrity of its audit trail file, including the ability to fix responsibility at the source for every quotation entry and reported transaction. The NASD believes that this proposed rule is consistent with Sections 15A(b)(6) and 15A(b)(11) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the Association's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, and processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities. Section 15A(b)(11) authorizes the Association to adopt rules governing the form and content of quotations disseminated by member firms for the purposes of providing fair and informative quotations, preventing fictitious or misleading quotations, and promoting orderly procedures for collecting and distributing quotation information. The NASD submits that elimination of the access market maker feature is fully consistent with the foregoing statutory provisions. Market makers in Nasdaq securities now will be required to subscribe to Level III service in order to enter quotations into the Nasdaq system. This requirements will eliminate an extra step in the quotation process by which an ``entering subscriber'' may act as an intermediary. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The NASD believes that the proposed rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.
