The time allocated for our main program theses is extremely short, and I think it is impossible to go over all of them. I am sure that you have read the programs; people have made up their minds and have a good idea of the programs through the media. Yet, a few words about the main theses. I would divide my program and my work into three conventional parts. The first part, which I call "Development," is about the development of the economy, the development of society, and the development of relations between people. If we take the economic part, it is about creating equal conditions for all businesses and creating conditions to encourage production, because everything depends on production. To that end, we have already taken and will continue to take measures to give a boost to production. At the state level, it means the introduction of a new taxation system, a new system of prices and wages, customs duties, that is, everything we refer to the macrolevel. If we take sectors of production, we are talking about priorities. I am giving the top priority to the production of food and to energy provision. Without these, the national economy will not be able to function, and human life will be doomed. I call my next part "Establishment of law and legality in society." Until we learn to respect the law, respect the Constitution, it will be hard to gain respect for each other. At the state level, for power structures, compliance with the law is mandatory, and those who do not obey the law must face the consequences, no matter in what branch of power they belong. Every citizen must follow certain norms, must respect certain principles, and work in a legal framework. If we take the most important thing, it is protection of the individual's life from the crime world, from infringement on its freedom and rights. Here, we must act promptly, act by legal means, by means of creating a rigid system of responsibility for those who make attempts on human life and taking steps appropriate for the situation. A war has been declared on us, and we must respond appropriately. My third part is called "Peace and Concord in Society." Life is the most important and the dearest thing to everyone, and the entire system of legal principles, all legislative processes, all laws and the entire state policy must be aimed at securing peace and concord. Concord among people within the country, which is a must, unity and understanding. As for outside factors, our policy must be aimed at establishing friendly partnership relations with all countries of the world, especially with our neighbors, above all, with Russia. I am convinced that Ukraine's political stability, its economic progress, its national security, and the development of democracy are impossible without establishing the kind of relations with our neighbors which would ensure these basic [word indistinct] in Ukraine. But we must take steps to persuade our neighbors, including such a major neighbor as Russia, to make Ukraine one of their priority countries. This is very important. As soon as we agree on this, as soon as Ukraine's policy and the policy of our neighboring states become more predictable, as soon as they become policies of concord and respect for one another, we will definitely live in peace, friendship and harmony. Thank you for your attention.
