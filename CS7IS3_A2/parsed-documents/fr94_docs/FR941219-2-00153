FR941219-2-00153 FR941219-2-00080 As a result of the ``equal dollar-weighting'' calculation methodology, 4 no individual component stock in the Index represents more than 25% of the weight of the Index following each quarterly rebalancing. Additionally, the top five highest weighted stocks in the Index do not constitute more than 60% of the weight of the Index. Finally, because the sole ADR component of the Index (British Airways PLC) has standardized options trading on it, the Index also satisfies the criteria that no more than 20% of the weight of the Index can be composed of non-options eligible foreign securities (including ADRs). 4 See discussion of Index calculation, infra. Maintenance of the Index The Exchange will maintain the Index so that (1) the total number of component securities will not increase or decrease by more than 331/3% from the number of components in the proposed Index ( i.e. , 10) and in no event will the Index have less than nine components; (2) component stocks constituting the top 90% of the Index by weight, must have a minimum market capitalization of $75 million and the component stocks constituting the bottom 10% of the Index, by weight, must have a minimum market capitalization of $50 million; (3) the monthly trading volume of each component security shall be at least 500,000 shares, provided, however, that components accounting in aggregate for no more than 10% of the Index, by weight, shall have a monthly trading volume of at least 400,000 shares; and (4) the Index shall satisfy the criteria that no single component will represent more than 25% of the weight of the Index and that the five highest weighted component shall represent no more than 60% of the weight of the Index, as of each quarterly rebalancing. The Exchange shall not open for trading any additional option series should the Index fail to satisfy any of the maintenance criteria set forth above unless such failure is determined by the Exchange not to be significant and the Commission concurs in that determination. Index Calculation The Index is calculated using an ``equal dollar-weighting'' methodology designed to ensure that each of the component securities is represented in an approximately ``equal'' dollar amount in the Index. The Exchange believes that this method of calculation is important since even among the largest companies in the airline industry there is great disparity in market value. For example, although the stocks included in the Index represent many of the most highly capitalized companies in the airline industry, the five most highly capitalized companies in the airline industry currently represent approximately 80% of the aggregate market value of the Index. It has been the Exchange's experience that options on market value weighted indexes dominated by relatively few component stocks are less useful to investors because the index will tend to represent those few components and not the broader target sector that the index is designed to represent. The following is a description of how the equal dollar-weighting calculation method works. As of the market close on October 21, 1994, a portfolio of airline securities was established representing an investment of $10,000 in the stock (or ADR) (rounded to the nearest whole share) of each of the companies in the Index. The value of the Index equals the current market value ( i.e., based on U.S. primary market prices) of the sum of the assigned number of shares of each of the securities in the Index portfolio divided by the Index divisor. The Index divisor was initially determined to yield the benchmark value of 200.00 at the close of trading on October 21, 1994. Each quarter thereafter, following the close of trading on the third Friday of January, April, July, and October, the Index portfolio will be adjusted by changing the number of whole shares of each component security so that each company is again represented in ``equal'' dollar amounts. The Exchange has chosen to rebalance following the close of trading on the quarterly expiration cycle because it allows an option contract to be held for up to three months without a change in the Index portfolio while at the same time, maintaining the equal dollar-weighting feature of the Index. If necessary, a divisor adjustment is made at the rebalancing to ensure continuity of the Index's value. The newly adjusted portfolio becomes the basis for the Index's value on the first trading day following the quarterly adjustment.
