At 0400 near dawn on 15 May the NADK and people attacked the invading forces of the two-headed government in Mongkolborei township from three directions. The first prong engaged the enemy at the Mongkolborei Bridge. The second prong hit their position in the Mongkolborei market. The third attacked the defense networks protecting the Mongkolborei township along the Mongkolborei River south of Route 5. As initial results: 1. We completely destroyed the position defending the Mongkolborei Bridge and destroyed the Mongkolborei Bridge itself. 2. We destroyed the position of the invading forces in the Mongkolborei market and completely liberated the market. 3. We crushed the invading forces and the brutal authorities of the two-headed government along the Mongkolborei River from Bat Trang to Rohat Toek. The NADK and people are carrying on the attack against the invading forces and brutal authorities of the two-headed government both on and along Route 5. The strategic transport line of the invading forces from Battambang to Sisophon and from Sisophon to Poipet which for months has been intermittently closed is now completely cut off. In whole units, the invading troops are fleeing in all directions, trying to return to their homes and loved ones, especially those who have been forcibly sent by the two-headed government from Oddar Meanchey, Siem Reap, and Preah Vihear. The brutal authorities are also running for their lives. Those who were forcibly drafted have pledged to the people that they will no longer serve the leading puppets of the communist Vietnamese and the Americans against their own nation and people. They said they have seen with their own eyes and heard with their own ears that the alliance headed by the United States has overtly colluded with the communist Vietnamese and their stooges in the two-headed government in trying to do away with our nation. Our people both in the countryside and the cities as well as those living elsewhere must unite and fight most vigorously to defend our nation and race and save it from being wiped out by the aggressors, be it the communist Vietnamese, the alliance, or their running dogs in the two-headed government.
