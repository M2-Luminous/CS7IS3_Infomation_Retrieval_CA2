Also taking part in the meeting at the Prime Minister's Office were Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Environment Minister Yosi Sarid. Steve Linde has the details. The Israeli delegation returned home this morning carrying a draft agreement on security arrangements in Hebron which they presented to the prime minister. Chief Palestinian negotiator Nabil Sha'th said the proposal worked out in a 14-hour negotiating session in Cairo needed the approval of the PLO and Israeli leaderships. The details have not been disclosed but the security package apparently includes plans for lightly armed foreign observers, probably from Norway, and Palestinian police in Hebron. Both Israeli and Palestinian negotiators said significant progress was made in Cairo but several issues remain to be settled. The head of the Israeli team, Major General Amnon Shahaq, said the negotiations would resume in Cairo on Tuesday. Shahaq and Sha'th would not elaborate but reporters in Cairo said they were both upbeat, laughing and joking before the Israeli team headed home for the Passover holiday. An Israeli source said the differences between the two sides were mainly on numbers, of both foreign observers and Palestinian police. The source said Israel would agree to several dozen Palestinian police employed by the Hebron municipality and connected to the police force in Gaza and Jericho; but, the Israeli Army would have ultimate responsibility for security. Terry Larsen, the Norwegian envoy, confirmed that the stationing of observers from his country was being negotiated. When asked about early reports of a 1,000 observers, he said: take away one zero, presumably meaning 100. Israeli sources say both the Norwegians and the Palestinian police would be armed with pistols for self-defense. Sources in Jerusalem say once the final details for security in Hebron are agreed, Israel and the PLO will announce the resumption of talks on the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho.
