On 29 January Yuriy Voronov, deputy chairman of the Abkhaz Council of Ministers, appealed to delegates of the second World Congress of Russian Unity to send a request to Boris Yeltsin to postpone his visit to Tbilisi. In Voronov's opinion, the Russian president's visit to Georgia could result in bloodshed in Abkhazia because among the documents to be signed is an agreement on major deliveries of Russian military equipment to the Georgian army. Voronov said that Yeltsin's previous two visits to the region led to military conflicts, first in South Ossetia and then in Abkhazia. Yuriy Voronov also called for the scrapping of special procedures on the Russian-Abkhazian border which are aggravating the crime situation in the border area.
