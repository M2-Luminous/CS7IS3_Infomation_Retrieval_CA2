Happily gathered in a hall were leaders of the provincial party committee, the provincial people's congress, the provincial government, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] provincial committee, and the provincial party discipline inspection commission, as well as leaders of military and armed police units stationed in Zhejiang. They freely enjoyed the harmonious ties between the military and the masses and discussed general plans on further improving double-support programs under new circumstances. Li Zemin, secretary of the provincial party committee, chaired the meeting. Military and local leaders attending the meeting fully affirmed the accomplishments Zhejiang has made on double-support work in 1993. They pointed out: Various localities in Zhejiang have earnestly implemented the instructions and guidelines of the party Central Committee and the State Council on paying attention to and supporting military and local reform and construction projects. They have conscientiously involved themselves, have performed realistic tasks, and have actively helped military units resolve various problems, including fulfilling duties for combat-readiness, enhancing military training, raising production, and improving living conditions. Various relevant provincial departments have closely coordinated with one another and actively supported military units to enhance production and operations in an effort to effectively improve the placement of retired soldiers. Consequently, these efforts have considerably enhanced army building and have further consolidated and strengthened the unity between the military and the government and between the military and the masses. Attending comrades indicated: In 1994, we should strictly concentrate our energies on the overall task of economic construction, proceed from grass-roots units, pay attention to achieving realistic results, and actively join in Zhejiang's reform and opening-up undertakings. Meanwhile, we should continually and actively support army building and properly serve the military units. We should improve our campaigns, whereby military units and localities perform realistic tasks for one another, and whereby the military, the police, and the masses can develop jointly. Li Zemin listened to attending comrades' speeches. Then, on behalf of the provincial party committee, the provincial people's congress standing committee, the provincial government, the provincial CPPCC committee, and the people of Zhejiang, he extended festive greetings and lofty respects to officers and men of military and armed police units stationed in Zhejiang. He said: In 1993, Zhejiang earnestly implemented the party's basic line, seized opportunities, deepened reform, and promoted development. Consequently, the province has maintained political and social stability, has enhnaced economic progress, and has contniually raised living standards. The overall situation has been good. Such results are inseparable from the effective support and help given by all the officers and men of military and armed police units stationed in Zhejiang. Besides executing their duties in safeguarding coastal and border defense in 1993, officers and men of military and armed police units stationed in Zhejiang also joined in protecting local social order and in waging anti-smuggling struggles, thereby maintaining social stability. The broad ranks of officers and men also enthusiastically participated in local key construction projects. They have, as always in the past, joined in emergency-rescue work and in providing disaster relief. Wherever there is a disaster, there will be the People's Liberation Army, which regards emergencies of the locality and the people as its own. Officers and men of military and armed police units stationed in Zhejiang have also joined in campaigns that facilitated "the joint development of the military, the police, and the masses" and have done a lot of work to enhance spiritual civilization drives in various localtities. He pointed out: While doing double-support work in 1994, Zhejiang must obey and serve the overall requirements for performing the whole party's work in accordance with the central authorities' instructions: We must "seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability." Additionally, we must regard developing grass-roots units, promoting education programs, and performing realistic tasks as our major work. We should pay attention to enhancing army building and living conditions of officers and soldiers so as to further foster the ties between the military and the government and between the military and the masses. Leaders at various levels should pay close attention to double-support work. They should intensify education programs among the broad ranks of cadres and people, stressing the importance of unity between the military and the government and between the military and the masses. Consequently, various double-support tasks can be earnestly carried out at the grass-roots units, and Zhejiang's double-support work can be raised to new heights. Provincial party, military, and government leaders, as well as leaders of various military units stationed in Zhejiang, attended the meeting.
