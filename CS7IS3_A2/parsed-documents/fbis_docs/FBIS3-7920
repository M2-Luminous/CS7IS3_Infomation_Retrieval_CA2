In this context, both states would retain their membership in the United Nations while the Croats and Muslims would be two constituent peoples equally represented in a balanced way in state bodies. A two-chamber parliament would not be able to make decisions detrimental to any people. Cantons, which vest some functions in a federal government, are at the heart of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. The [present] administration and defense chain of command remains the same in Bosnia until a new constitution is introduced. A council of Croat cantons and Croat municipalities in Muslim cantons and vice versa, and the federal organs jointly created by the Croats and Muslims are the basis for a team of experts in Vienna to draw up a final agreement by 15 March that would be signed in the White House in Washington by Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic in President Clinton's presence. Last night President Clinton spoke to Sarajevo and Zagreb over the phone. President Tudjman thanked him for the efforts that the United States had invested in the Croat-Muslim agreement. I am honored and I appreciate the fact that this has taken place, President Clinton said, adding: I appreciate your leadership and you in your capacity as a statesman. The Croatian president said that he appreciated the U.S. Government's involvement and asked for guarantees regarding the UNPA [UN protected areas]. We continue to support Croatia's sovereignty and integrity, was the answer coming from the White House. [passage omitted]
