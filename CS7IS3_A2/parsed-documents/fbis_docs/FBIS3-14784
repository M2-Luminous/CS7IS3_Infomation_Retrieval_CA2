Spot calculation of the ballots has shown that the despite forecasts, the coalition of the Socialist Party and International Movement Unity, mainly backed by the Russian-speaking population, are in the lead in Chisinau, some cities and rural districts of the republic. Together with the Agrarian Democratic Party headed by parliament speaker Petr Luchinschi, the socialists are ahead of all the other parties. Judging by the preliminary results, the opposition in the new parliament will be made up of pro-Romanian coalition of intellectuals and peasants and the Christian Democratic Popular Front, which rank third and fourth but will be unable to for a majority in new parliament. The above four parties cleared the four-per cent election hurdle and won seats in the new parliament. If the forecasts based on the preliminary returns materialise, the Agrarian Party will have to team up with the socialists to form a majority in the parliament and form a new government to lead the republic out of the crisis. If this does not happen, "Moldova is in for difficult times", according to Petr Luchinschi.
