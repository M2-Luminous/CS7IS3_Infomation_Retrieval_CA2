Ilgonis Upmalis, head of the Latvian bureau for monitoring the Russian Army withdrawal, told the Baltic News Service that until now there has been only the radar station itself and an MT [expansion unknown] battalion, but now an additional hospital and a counterintelligence unit have been formed as separate military units. Although the Russian military personnel who are already stationed in Latvia serve with the units, Upmalis believes that the stationing of the units on just the territory of the Skrunda radar station is wrong, because the issue of the status of that facility in Latvia has not yet been coordinated at interstate talks.
