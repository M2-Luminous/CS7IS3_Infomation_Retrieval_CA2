Senator Clark Parent raises the question of security. [Begin recording in Creole] [Parent] Well, I do not believe it even reached the stage of postponement because it had not yet been convened, because safety ... [pauses] a lot of other things are taken into consideration ... [pauses] because it is ... [pauses] we are experiencing coup d'etat logic and ... [pauses] I think these are the reasons. [Unidentified correspondent] Sen. Parent, do you think this session will be possible within the next few days, given that many parliamentarians are already on vacation? [Parent] Well, I believe the vacation period will end between now and 13 June. The vacation period will come to an end and the Chamber of Deputies will return to work. Its vacation will come to an end and everything will return to normal. [Correspondent] Do you not believe, nonetheless, that there will be opposition toward the unofficial office? [Parent] Do you mean the office of Bernard Sansaricq or ...? [Correspondent, interrupting] That is it. [Parent] Well, I think a time will come, a time when the country can no longer carry on with this demagogy. I do not think the country can carry on indefinitely while a small group of people holds the country hostage, preventing the people's choice from being respected. [end recording]
