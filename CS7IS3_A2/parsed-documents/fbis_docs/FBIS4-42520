This assessment was reached by Defense Minister Fasslabend after a visit to the large successor state of the Soviet Union. However, the minister came to some conclusions which contradict many other critical reports about the country: In his view, the city of Kiev or the large Antonov works (aircraft) work better than other East European states. [sentence as published] "What does not work is the reorientation of the economy. In that regard there are big problems." Fasslabend also noted that Ukraine is still defining itself very much in its old context, that of the Soviet Union. "The country's identity must be strengthened." In the establishment of the new Ukrainian Armed Forces, there is great emphasis on external symbols -- new uniforms, new defense districts. Bilaterally, the minister wants to cooperate more with Kiev. The first step is sending a military attache to Kiev. Particularly important for the new state is the current Crimean crisis with Russia. "This is an emotional issue. It is so important that Ukraine will do anything to prevent the Crimea from seceding."
