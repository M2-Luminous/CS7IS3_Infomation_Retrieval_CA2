All juridical persons within the territory of Ukraine, irrespective of property status and type of activity, and physical persons--citizens of Ukraine, foreign citizens, and stateless individuals--participating in business activity will do the following: --make separate settlements with one another for goods, work, services, and securities costing more than six times the minimum wage only in non-cash forms. The amount of money issued by banks within a calendar month to enterprises, institutions, and organizations with up to 3,000 employees for current expenses will not exceed 15 times the minimum wage, or 30 times the minimum wage in the case of those with over 3,000 employees. Currency for business-related travel expenses will not be included among current expenses and will be issued by the banks according to the established procedure; --keep currency in their cash funds within the established limits. The procedure for setting limits on the amount of cash on hand and for organizing the oversight of their observance will be defined by the National Bank of Ukraine; --keep currency in excess of established limits in their cash funds only for the payment of wages, social insurance benefits, stipends, and pensions and only for a period of no more than three working days, including the date of receipt of the currency in banking establishments. The second paragraph of this section will not apply to the settlements of collective agricultural enterprises and farmers with trade organizations and enterprises. The provisions of the third and fourth paragraphs of this section will not apply to physical persons engaged in business activity. 2. The limits on the amount of currency kept in cash funds for juridical persons will be decided by the commercial banks serving them on the basis of financial reports submitted by these juridical persons. In the absence of these reports, the limits will be set autonomously by the commercial banks. Commercial banks will issue currency only on valid grounds and will oversee the use of this currency for the designated purpose. 3. Juridical and physical persons engaged in the purchase of agricultural products, wild fruits and berries, medicinal herbs, waste paper, rags, glass, and scrap metal from the population and juridical persons conducting pawning operations will receive currency for the full amount of settlements with the population. Motor transport enterprises and organizations (enterprises and organizations specializing in the performance of transport services) offering inter-oblast transport services will receive currency to cover the cost of fuel to be purchased outside the oblasts where these enterprises and organizations are located. Expenditures of funds advanced for the purchase of products (or to cover the cost of fuel) will be overseen by commercial banks. The amounts owed to citizens for the products they sell may be deposited in savings accounts only at the request of the citizens. 4. Banking establishments will issue funds to juridical persons conducting insurance operations for the payment of insured amounts (the coverage of claims) connected with voluntary and compulsory insurance contracts in non-cash forms, with the exception of the following: amounts subject to payment in cash to citizens after the expiration of insurance contracts or their early termination; compensatory payments to citizens in the form of insured amounts and claims. 5. Enterprises, institutions, and organizations, including trade organizations engaging in regular currency trading operations and relying on them for the payment of wages and pensions and the purchase of agricultural products will be entitled to keep currency over and above expenditure limits in their cash funds only for three working days prior to the payment date. 6. The observance of the requirements of this edict by juridical persons, with the exception of commercial banks, and physical persons engaged in business activity will be overseen by commercial banks, agencies of the Ukrainian State Tax Service, the State Auditing Service, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The observance of the requirements of this edict by commercial banks will be overseen by institutions of the National Bank of Ukraine. 7. Sales of non-food items to citizens by trade organizations and other enterprises and organizations, as well as settlements with physical persons acting as the agents for goods sold on commission or consignment (per unit or lot, irrespective of the type and category of commodity) at a cost exceeding 200 times the minimum wage will be conducted with the use of Ukrainian bank checks or transfers to personal accounts. No service fees will be charged on bank checks issued to citizens and on transfers to their personal accounts in excess of 200 times the minimum wage. 8. State tax inspectors will impose financial penalties on enterprises, institutions, and organizations, irrespective of property status and type of activity, and physical persons engaged in business activity for violations of the requirements of this edict, in the form of fines in the amount of the settlement operations or currency in cash funds exceeding the limit, on the basis of the information of their own audits and information submitted by commercial banks, the State Auditing Service, and agencies of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs and the National Bank of Ukraine. The parties liable for violations of the requirements of the second paragraph of Section 1 of this edict in reference to the separate settlements will be the juridical and physical persons making the payments in cash.
