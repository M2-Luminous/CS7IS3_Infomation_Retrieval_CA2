The title of the PLO office will be changed to the General Palestinian Delegation. Announcing the move, Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said it did not involve any change in the diplomatic status of the PLO's representation. It did not involve the granting of any diplomatic privileges or immunities. Senator Evans said conditions had not been satisfied for Australia to recognize Palestine as a sovereign state or the PLO as a government of a state. Australia's foreign minister has said the creation of an independent state of Palestine might well be the independent ultimate outcome of the peace process, but it was premature to anticipate the process at this stage.
