The expansion of business links in the wake of the opening of the borders of the former socialist camp has led to the emergence of a new sale market, where the relationship between the sellers and buyers is determined by the offer. Aside from big deals, such as the import of infested sugar and corn and of other foodstuffs from the Middle East, a special place among the various products currently on offer is taken by the trade with arms and radioactive materials. Armaments and Radioactive Materials Are Delivered From the States of the Russian Federation The dismemberment of the former Soviet Union in 1990 has led not only to the appearance of new political forces and of new concepts about whether to remake "Great Russia" or not, but also to the redivision of the huge military arsenal of the former USSR. Part of this arsenal -- the nuclear part, which is deployed in such areas of the former USSR that were suitable, from a geographic viewpoint, for pointing missiles at capitalist targets -- are under the control of the Western powers and will be dismantled by 1996. The other part of this arsenal, which is active, can jeopardize life in Central Europe and throughout the world at any moment, not only because of the political instability prevailing in the area of the former USSR, but also because of the maintenance of various armed conflicts, which can generate true nuclear holocausts at any time. In keeping with existing treaties on nonproliferation and nuclear disarmament, one portion of the nuclear charges resulting from the dismantlement of the nuclear weapons of the former USSR is earmarked for peaceful purposes, while the other part is meant to be securely destroyed, so as not to endanger human life and the environment. Since the quantity of radioactive material resulting from the destruction of nuclear weapons is very large, a good part of it was sold for further use either to countries in the Middle East or to other countries currently interested in producing or acquiring nuclear weapons. Equally true is the fact that the former USSR countries possess mineral resources containing very many radioactive elements, such as radium, scandium, osmium, plutonium, and other strategic elements used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. The new trade in radioactive materials has attracted people from both the former USSR states and from the former Warsaw Pact countries, since the profits inherent in this trade are large and immediate. Among the Russian companies involved in the sale of radioactive substances, we would mention just two: LUCH-3, whose owner is Sergey Alekseyevich Pushkin, and LEGION, represented by Russian citizen Klynchagov [name as received]. Romanian Firms Are Involved in the Traffic of Radioactive Materials In a short period of time, several people from Romania -- including Niculae Costel, representative of several Romanian companies such as ROMBEL and SIRCOM, and Elisabeta Ana Stefanescu, owner and sole associate of TECHNOTOURS company -- have managed to establish contacts with Russian companies from the Russian Federation and with various firms in Romania. Under the cover of ROMBEL company, Niculae Costel managed to contact several people and representatives of certain foreign companies, such as EURONOR BUSINESS PARTNER Ltd., with headquarters in Norway, DB FINANZ CONSULTING AG from Germany, or DHS MERGER-Alois Geissler, offering to deliver red mercury, osmium 192, radium, and scandium in quantities varying between 15 and 200 kilograms, at a cost price of $73,000 per gram, which would be tantamount to a profit of $1 billion. Throughout the 1992-93 period, Niculae Costel made several visits to Russia to decide on the ways and means of delivering the goods as well as on the amounts of hard currency to be paid into various banks. Codes Are Used for the Transactions of Radioactive Materials The offers of the supplier of the respective commodity were sent by fax, with the analysis certificate attached. The analysis bulletins also specified the purity of the radioactive material and the density of the other component substances. In order to ensure the secrecy of the transaction, the two sides used codes. The codes, containing various names such as "Sunshine," "Apple," "Stardust," or "Nautilus," were used to codify both the transaction and the product. For instance, the code "Nautilus" was used to denote osmium 187, while the code "red oil" was used for the red mercury-RM 20/20. The letters of intent received from the party interested in buying the product always mentioned that the transaction can only take place after a sample of the respective material was submitted to chemical analyses that would attest to the purity and quality of the product. Only analysis certificates in accordance with the "Karpov" and "Frieberger" methods are valid for such radioactive substances. The Transport of Red Mercury Samples Is Done With TAROM Airplanes Although red mercury is a nonactive substance, its characteristics can turn it into a very strong explosive when it merges with other chemical substances. As a matter of fact, red mercury RM 20/20 is used in the manufacture of the neutron bomb. Using not only her imagination, but also her relations, the owner of TECNOTOURS company, Elisabeta Ana Stefanescu used the Bucharest-Rome TAROM flight of 5 July 1992 -- which landed in Rome at 1415 hours local time -- to transport a sample of red mercury. The red mercury sample was handed over to the airplane captain by Rosca Stanescu, deputy commander of Otopeni Airport. In Italy, the "small package" was handed over by the airplane captain to Florin Groman, head of the TAROM office in Rome. The package was then passed on to another man within the Rome Airport by Florin Groman himself, who was ostentatiously carrying a sign with the name of the individual supposed to take over the package, namely the Italian citizen Egidio Musso. Once the transaction was completed, Elisabeta Ana Stefanescu told her Italian business partner, Egidio Musso, to open a dollar account for her at the Italian bank Credito Italiano, with herself as the only one entitled to withdraw money from that account. Using the "Rosso" code for the red mercury, Elisabeta Stefanescu informed the Italian company OMNIA TECNO SRL, with headquarters in the town of La Spezia, that the "Rosso" sample was brought to Romania by an agent of an embassy empowered to deal with this affair. In the same message, Elisabeta Stefanescu -- who until 1989 had occupied various administrative posts at several foreign diplomatic missions in Romania -- expressed the fear that she had attracted "too much attention" at home. For the same material, RM 20/20, Elisabeta Stefanescu used the code "992/LDEASGC/101-M" in a transaction involving 138 kg of red mercury for the MUELLER TREUHAND company of Zurich, Switzerland, asking for $340,000 per kilogram. She also made clear that the deal was concluded in Moscow with Russian partners, with the red mercury procured from the Russian town of Chelyabinsk. In the July-December 1992 period, Elisabeta Stefanescu spent a "long vacation" in Italy, more precisely in Lerici town, staying at the most luxurious hotel in the region. On that occasion, she got in touch with the business connections in Italy and also established new contacts with people interested in purchasing radioactive material. At the end of a prosperous business trip abroad, she returned home with two boxes full of jewelry, two fur coats, two Mercedes 220D, a Nissan Patrol cross-country vehicle, and "small gifts" for her connections in Romania. In May 1992, Elisabeta Stefanescu moved out of her parents' home in Londra Street No. 25 into a villa (number 45) in Snagov, which she is renting for 500,000 lei per month. From the Trade in Red Mercury to the Trade in Military Technology TECNOTOURS' business turnover, which in 1992 stood at 2 billion lei, exceeded 23 billion lei in 1993, but registered zero profits??! All this was achieved with only three employees and a sole "single associate," Elisabeta Ana Stefanescu. All was made possible by expanding the company's sphere of activity to include the trade in military technology. By establishing several contacts with the Russian citizen Anatoliy Ivanov, general director of the BIISIK [name as received] Ltd. company, and with Eduard Hiznicenco, director of the COMINET SRL company from Odorheiul Secuiesc, Elisabeta Stefanescu began offering the Middle East "market" a whole range of products from the Russian armaments industry: from AKM and AK-47 machine guns -- each costing $170, with some 3 million pieces on offer -- up to MI-26 and MI-35 helicopters, T-72 and T-80 tanks, and MiG-29 planes, with the prices varying between $19 million and $55 million. The Use of Coded Messages and Other Codes in Arms Transactions Another private entrepreneur involved in the transactions with radioactive materials and armaments, Niculae Costel, representative of SIRCOM company, contacted the ROMTEHNICA company. In a letter marked "confidential" and "ultra confidential," Niculae Costel informed Rear Admiral C. Raducanu, deputy chief of the Army Supply and Equipment Service, of an impending transaction, namely the confidential project "Yacht," whose destination was the Great Lakes region in Canada. The customer was demanding that the name of the vessel should be kept secret and that the Romanian crew should train the foreign crew during the voyage. In exchange, the customer was offering, in codified terms, "stinger, hot, and patrol" plus "some money." Meanwhile we have managed to identify the meaning of "stinger" and "hot," which stand for antitank missiles.
