He said: Today I am lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam, because I am absolutely convinced that it offers the best way to resolve the fate of those who remain missing and unaccounted for. The President reviewed U.S. efforts to search for missing American servicemen and stressed that efforts will continue to obtain more information about American servicemen who are prisoners or who are missing. He also announced that a United State liaison office will be set up in Vietnam to provide services to Americans in Vietnam and help follow up on human rights dialogue with the Vietnamese Government. President Clinton also said that the decision does not involve the normalization of relations: Before that happens, we must have more progress and cooperation; more answers. In this regard, he will send another high-ranking delegation to Vietnam to search for additional human remains and documents. Secretary of State Christopher; Secretary of Defense Aspin; Joint Chiefs Chairman Shalikashvili; and many other high-ranking officials and senators, including Mr. John Kerry, were among those who attended the conference.
