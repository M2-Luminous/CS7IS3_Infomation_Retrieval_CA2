Waste also expected to contain tribromophenol, potentially of concern, but unquantified in waste. None found in leachate from landfill where waste was deposited Defer action. Tribromophenol Wastewaters Inadequate toxicology data on major constituents in waste, tribromophenol and dibromophenol. Used surrogate analysis for tribromophenol No list. ␣ l␣ Risk analysis shows only low risks; tribromophenol not detected in groundwater at site. (Also, level of tribromophenol in this waste is 2000 times less than the listed hazardous waste, K131.) ␣ Filter cake Used surrogate analysis for tribromophenol. Leachate analysis estimates risk of 10 ^3 to 10 ^5 if waste disposed in unlined Subtitle D landfills List as hazardous waste.
