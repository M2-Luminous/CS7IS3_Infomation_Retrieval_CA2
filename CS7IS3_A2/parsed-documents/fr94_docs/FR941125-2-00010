FR941125-2-00010 FR941125-2-00006 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Foreign-Trade Zones Board [Docket 36&hyph;94] Foreign-Trade Zone 93_Raleigh/Durham, NC, Application for Subzone Status, R.G. Barry Corporation, (Footwear and Thermal Comfort Products), Goldsboro, NC An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Triangle J Council of Governments, grantee of FTZ 93, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the distribution facilities of R.G. Barry Corporation, located in Goldsboro, North Carolina. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on November 16, 1994. R.G. Barry is a manufacturer and distributor of comfort footwear (household slippers) and thermal comfort products (heat seats, scarves, back warmers, hand warmers, pocket warmers, ear muffs and bread warmers) with total sales of over $100 million (1993) and worldwide employment of 3,685 persons. The company has U.S. plants in San Angelo, Texas, Goldsboro, North Carolina, and Laredo, Texas, with operational headquarters in San Antonio, Texas. An application is pending with the FTZ Board for subzone status for warehouse/distribution activities at Barry's San Angelo plant (FTZ Docket 34&hyph;94, 59 FR 56459, 11/14/94). R.G. Barry's Goldsboro, North Carolina plant is located at 2201 South John Street (172,020 sq. ft. on 35 acres), some 45 miles southeast of Raleigh. The facility (65 employees) is engaged in the warehousing and distribution of R.G. Barry's footwear and comfort products. The products are generally made of domestic materials (polyester and other man-made fibers), which are cut at Barry plants in the U.S. and sent to company plants abroad to be sewn. The finished products are then shipped to Barry's U.S. distribution centers. While currently over five percent of the finished products are reexported, the company plans to increase export activity to 14 percent. Zone procedures would exempt R.G. Barry from Customs duty payments on the foreign value involved in products that are reexported. On its domestic sales, the company would be able to defer Customs duties on the value added abroad. The application indicates that zone savings would help improve the international competitiveness of the company's domestic operations. In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is January 30, 1995. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period (to February 13, 1995). A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following locations: U.S. Commerce District Office, 400 W. Market St., Suite 400, Greensboro, North Carolina 27401 Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3716, 14th Street & Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230 Dated: November 17, 1994.
