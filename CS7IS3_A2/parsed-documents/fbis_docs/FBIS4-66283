In fact, Hebei was no exception. We are here discussing several issues involved in China's eastward population movement as seen from this "special case." I. Hebei's Population Outflow and Western Population Immigration A 10 percent sampling from the "fourth census" showed that from mid-1985 to mid-1990, while Hebei's population movement was a net outflow, its permanent-residence-registration movement showed a net inflow, with the net outflow being caused by the inclusion of the large population that had moved out temporarily for more than one year. 1. As to the population movement into Hebei from mid-1985 to mid-1990, all mainland provinces and cities showed an immigration to Hebei of 469,140 people, of whom 190,850 were male and 278,290 were female, for a male-female ratio of 1:1.46. A) As to place of origin, the numbers were greatest from Sichuan, which accounted for 15.03 percent of Hebei's immigrant population; Heilongjiang came next, accounting for 9.63 percent; then in descending order came Inner Mongolia, accounting for 8.54 percent, Shanxi for 6.1 percent, Shandong for 5.4 percent, Henan for 5.38 percent, Guangxi for 4.8 percent, Liaoning for 4.46 percent, Shaanxi for 4.15 percent, Beijing for 3.72 percent, Jilin for 3.7 percent, Guizhou for 2.94 percent, Yunnan for 2.3 percent, and Xinjiang for 2.2 percent; the other provinces and cities accounted for less than 10,000 people each, with Hainan and Tibet accounting for the least, and Shanghai for only 1,160. These figures show that: As to the population immigration into Hebei, the southwestern region, which historically had less population exchange with Hebei, accounted for the largest percentage. The "three north" region, which historically had close population exchange with Hebei, came second. The immigration from southeastern coastal provinces and cities was least. B. As to sexual distinction, the sexual composition of the immigrant population to Hebei from all provinces and cities had clear regional features. The places with the highest female percentages were Guangxi, where females made up 94.33 percent, Guizhou at 90 percent, Sichuan at 87.64 percent, and Yunnan at 87 percent, with secondarily Inner Mongolia at 60.73 percent, Shaanxi at 60.6 percent, Heilongjiang at 57.79 percent, Liaoning at 54.49 percent, and Jilin at 51.2 percent. As to other provinces and cities with immigration to Hebei of over 10,000, such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Henan, and Xinjiang, males ranked first in all cases. This shows that: Of the immigrant population to Hebei from the southwest, females ranked exceptionally high, with the northeast coming in second. All of the immigrant population to Hebei from its periphery and other economically developed regions was mostly male. 2. As to the population movement out of Hebei from mid-1985 to mid-1990, the figure was 665,590, of which 431,460 was male and 234,130 was female, for a male-female ratio of 1:0.54. A. As to emigration destination, the numbers were greatest to Beijing, which accounted for 33.73 percent of Hebei's emigrant population, with Tianjin second, accounting for 15.93 percent; then in descending order came Shanxi for 7.65 percent, Inner Mongolia for 6.13 percent, Shandong for 4.62 percent, Henan for 4.35 percent, and Liaoning for 3.17 percent; then came Shanghai, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Anhui, and Hubei, all accounting for 10,000-20,000 emigrants; all other provinces and regions accounted for less than 10,000; the lowest was Hainan, with only 570 emigrating to Hebei, and only 1,180 to Guizhou. This shows generally that: Hebei's emigrant population was concentrated mostly in the two cities of Beijing and Tianjin, which together accounted for nearly 50 percent of Hebei's emigrant population; second came other peripheral provinces, making up nearly 26 percent. Provinces and cities far from Hebei but economically developed also accounted for more of Hebei's emigrant population. Hebei's emigrants to interior and economically backward regions were least. B. As to sex composition, Hebei's emigrants to all provinces were mostly male. For instance, males accounted for 68.35 percent of Hebei emigrants to Beijing, 50.5 percent to Tianjin, 65.74 percent to Shanxi, 63.6 percent to Inner Mongolia, 60.87 percent to Shandong, 64.71 percent to Henan, and 64.19 percent to Liaoning; of Hebei emigrants to economically developed regions, such as Shanghai and Guangdong, males made up an even higher percentage. 3. From mid-1985 to mid-1990, Hebei had a net outflow of 240,610 people, of whom 196,450 were male and 44,160 were female, for a male-female ration of 1: 0.18. A. As to Hebei's net-inflow population distribution, of Mainland China's 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, 11 had a net outflow to Hebei, in descending order being 53,920 from Sichuan, 30,440 from Heilongjiang, 12,600 from Guizhou, 8,500 from Yunnan, 8,470 from Jilin, 6,140 from Xinjiang, 5,080 from Gansu, 4,590 from Shaanxi, 4,100 from Zhejiang, 1,590 from Hunan, and 680 from Fujian. Of these, except for Zhejiang and Fujian that are coastal provinces, all of the rest are located in China's southwest, northwest, and northeast. Except for these 11 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, Hebei had a net outflow to all others. This included a net emigration to Beijing of 207,040; second to Tianjin of 70,840; then came 5,500 to Liaoning, 5,390 to Shandong, 3,670 to Henan, and 760 to Inner Mongolia, all of which are perpherial provinces and regions to Hebei Province; in addition, Hebei had respective net outflows to Shanghai and Guangdong of 17,640 and 9,510; Hebei's net outflow to other provinces and municipalities was very low. This shows that: Hebei had a net population outflow to all peripherial provinces and municipalities, focused particularly on Beijing and Tianjin. Economically developed regions, such as Shanghai and Guangdong, have begun to become the destinations for Hebei's net outflow population. Hebei had a net inflow from all interior and economically backward regions. In short, the directions of net outflow and net inflow in Hebei are very clear. B. As to the sexual composition of Hebei's net migrant population, the sexual flow had very prominent regional features: of the net outflow to Hebei from the 11 provinces, except for Fujian, all were mostly female; on the contrary, Hebei's net outflow was all mostly male. To sum up Hebei's net migration, it can be said that: the border and interior population had a net inflow to Hebei, mostly female, while Hebei's mostly male population had a net outflow to perpherial provinces and municipalities and economically developed regions. 4. As to the net migration by permanent residence registration, as stated above, based on provincial public security bureau data on permanent residence registration movement from the founding of the PRC [1949] to 1990, while Hebei's population movement has fluctuated sharply, it has been a cumulative net inflow; in the 1980s, this net inflow grew, peaking at 258,700 people, second only to that of the First Five Year Plan; from 1985 through 1990, the net inflow was 322,100, averaging 53,700 a year. As to population movement in the fourth census, including the two categories of officially transferred permanent residence registration and "temporary residence," while we are temporarily unable to differentiate the two precisely, we can do so roughly based on reason for moving: this is because the five categories of work transfer, assigned employment, resignation or retirement, moving as dependents, and moving for marriage generally all require official transfer of permanent residence registration, while all others do not; on this basis, from mid-1985 to mid-1990, Hebei had a net permanent residence registration inflow of 47,050 people, averaging less than 10,000 a year; while these figures are much lower than public security ones, they still show that Hebei Province is the destination in the eastward movement of China's western population. So the fourth census conclusion that Hebei is a net outflow province was due to the inclusion of the "temporary residence" population that had moved out for more than one year. II. A Discussion of Several Issues Involved in the Eastward Population Movement Summing up the above, we can say that in China's population exchange of the 1980s, Hebei on one hand received mostly female population emigration from the west and north, while on the other experiencing a large outflow of its own mostly male population to mainly Beijing and Tianjin. Such population change had many causes and impacts. We are discussing our views on just a few of the issues involved below. 1. The Basic Cause of the "Displacement" in Hebei of the Eastward-Moving Population The eastward movement of China's western population since the 1980s is generally held to have two basic causes: a) The eastern region already had a higher level of economic and technological development than the western region, with reform and opening having widened this gap. b) In correspondence to the above-mentioned conditions, the western region has a larger surplus rural workforce and less conversion capability, so that commodity economy development has made an eastward population shift inevitable. Macroeconomically, why has Hebei become merely a temporary "displacement" for the eastward-moving population? This is because while Hebei has rich and diversified natural resources, which are well disposed, giving it resource advantages and quite good development potential, its economic development level is still not high. Until the last few years of the 1980s, Hebei Province's key economic and technological indexes, in contrast to the national and three major regional ones of eastern, central, and western, such as per capita gross output value, per capita GVIAO [Gross Value of Industrial and Agricultural Output], per capita national income, and per capita consumption, were all about 15 percent below the national average, equal to the central region, but ranking ninth in gross output value among the 12 eastern coastal provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. In addition, as to capital construction investment, in contrast to peripheral provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions where population was moving to more, Hebei was backward in both investment scale and investment growth rate. In all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions with which Hebei had a net outflow, capital construction investment was higher than in Hebei; on the contrary, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions with lower capital construction investment had net population outflows to Hebei. In light of this, I would make the following two points: 1. Population movement and flow is due generally to imbalanced overall regional potential, causing population flow from lower-potential regions to higher-potential ones. Where economic and technological development levels are lower, regions with better dispositions of resources, higher resource potentials, and stronger resource potential attract population immigration, with Hebei being in this category. This is the major reason why, with a still low level of economic devlopment, Hebei is both a "spigot" and a "receptor" in population movement. 2. Capital construction investment has played a key role in population movement and mobility ever since the founding of the PRC. The northward and westward movement of China's population center after the founding of the PRC was consistent with our national capital construction investment priorities, just as today's eastward shift of population center is consistent with our current national capital construction investment orientation. So the facts prove that national capital construction investment orientation remains the key driving force in China's population movement and mobility. 2. The Final-Assembly "Destination" of the Eastward-Moving Population A conspicuous feature of Hebei's population movement is a net inflow on one hand, along with a net outflow on the other. Such population-movement change, in addition to the resource-environment factor, also involves an inevitable outward-mobility capability. The historical population-movement trend and the fourth census show that Beijing and Tianjin have always been the priority destinations of Hebei's outflow population. In a certain sense, if Hebei's resource advantages were not mutually complementary with Beijing and Tianjin's economic and cultural advantages, to form a comprehensive regional advantage, it would seem hard to imagine that Hebei could absorb such a large number of western population immigrants. But the west to east population-movement change has formed a process of western to Hebei to Beijing and Tianjin, with Hebei as in intermediate "displacement," and the final destination being Beijing and Tianjin. So from a macro perspective, the final-assembly destination of the eastward movement of the western population is Beijing and Tianjin. This view is supported by the following figures: a) In the four-plus decades since the founding of the PRC, Hebei has had a net immigration of about 2 million. But projected from a typical survey of our population movement, about 1 million have moved from Hebei to Beijing and Tianjin during the same period. b) The fourth census shows that from mid-1985 to mid-1990, Hebei had a net inflow of over 190,000, along with a net outlfow to Beijing and Tianjin of more than 270,000. So it could be said that Hebei has guided over 80,000 western immigrants to Beijing and Tianjin. In light of this, how can the populations of large cities, such as Beijing and Tianjin, not be uncontrollable? This is essentially a matter of not paying enough attention to controlling urban functions, as sound functions inevitably increase population. As to the laws of urban evolution, the lack of decentralized urban functions makes it hard to control population size. In addition, population control of large cities, such as Beijing and Tianjin, requires overall planning with the whole nation, particularly neighboring regions, as well as coordination measures, without which it would be hard for it to be effective. Furthermore, in light of China's large population and its uneven distribution, unless effective steps are taken to strictly control our urban population, the population-expansion consequences will be even more severe than otherwise. There are two figures here that are much deserving of mention: a) Sample surveys show that in the first 35 years after the founding of the PRC, about one-third of the net immigrant population to Beijing was from Hebei. b) The fourth census showed that from mid-1985 to mid-1990, about one-third of the net inflow to Beijing of approximately 600,000 was from Hebei. If this reflects a certain pattern, in which Hebei receives an unending stream of western population and Beijing and Tianjin a similar population inflow from Hebei, then it will be hard to prevent the expansion of the populations of Beijing and Tianjin. While these superficial views are likely somewhat biased, it is hoped that they will arouse attention and thorough study.
