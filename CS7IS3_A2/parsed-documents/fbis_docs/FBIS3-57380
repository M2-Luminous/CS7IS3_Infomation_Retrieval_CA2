Shkil pointed out that "if some people lack action, words are brought to the fore, and affairs like this one arise." The UNA regional commander underlined: "When Mykhaylo Boychyshyn was still Shevchenkivskyy Rayon Council chairman in Lvov he had certain connections that could be the motives behind his disappearance" and added that "we cannot rule out that in a day or two Boychyshyn will emerge safe and sound, and will tell tales about his kidnapping." Boychyshyn's wife's televised appeal gave this idea to Shkil because "one had the impression that she had recently seen her husband." UNA Chairman Yuriy Shukhevych said: "Mykhaylo Boychyshyn is not an outstanding Rukh activist. Why has there been no similar actions against Vyacheslav Chornovil?" The UNA leadership believes that Boychyshyn's mysterious disappearance might be linked to Rukh's financial activities. Meanwhile, according to a report by Maryana Chorna published in Lvov's RATUSHA on 22 January, the newspaper had received "unsubstantiated information from law enforcement circles" that Mykhaylo Boychyshyn's dead body had been discovered.
