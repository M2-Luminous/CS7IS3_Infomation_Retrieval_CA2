V. Dashkevich considers that "Gaydar acted correctly, as you cannot combine market methods of managing the economy with administrative ones." In Dashkevich's opinion, if the Russian and Belarusian Governments adopt such a decision, it "will soon demonstrate its unviability and force Belarus to return to setting up a full-fledged monetary system." "If a short-term effect is possible at the initial stage, the negative consequences associated with superimposing Russia's internal economic disorder onto the Belarusian economy, will become apparent by the end of the year." The Russian Federation and Belarusian premiers signed a statement in Moscow on the upcoming union of the two countries' monetary systems.
