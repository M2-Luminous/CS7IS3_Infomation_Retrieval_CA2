[Ibrahimli] At this stage, we have laid the foundations of a principle of changing from quantity to quality. Determining the place and role of a social and political organization in society depends on this factor to a great extent. We can say that in our inner-organizational work questions of revival are over despite the fact that for well known reasons great obstacles stood before the solution of these questions. Many offices of rayon departments of the APF were empty and there was uninterrupted persecution and pressure on our members. Although preparatory work for our regular congress had stalled, the organizational conferences had concluded. Some mechanisms to enable the APF to perform its role in the political process again have been prepared. Primarily, the creation of an alliance of democratic forces has turned into the need of the day. The deepening of the economic crisis in the country and problems in the war zone have created a bad psychological mood among the people. The number of those looking optimistically toward the future has fallen. In such a situation, no political group can influence public opinion alone. We will join in a democratic alliance and also reinforce the guarantees of democracy in the country. This alliance, as a guarantor of democracy in Azerbaijan, will awaken the special interest of international organizations acting according to the general game rules in government-opposition relations. [Seljuk] For a number of months preparatory work has been done for the regular congress of the APF. When is it planned to hold this event, which will bring clarity into a number of issues? [Ibrahimli] As you know, since the day the organizational committee for congress preparation began to work, we have not been satisfied with inner-organizational discussions connected with the activity of the APF. With the goal of bringing the public into these discussions, a series of articles have been published in the mass media. Thanks to these, we have drawn the necessary conclusions from our mistakes. Purely organizational conferences for holding the congress are over. We have begun to hold theoretical conferences as a preliminary step, and broad discussions on the status of the APF, and on its place, role and duty in the system. Analysis connected with the sociopolitical and military situation in the republic have been conducted at these conferences. [Seljuk] Ibrahim, how much time was set aside for these theoretical conferences you mentioned? [Ibrahimli] Taking into consideration the breadth and actuality of the questions proposed for discussion, it would not be correct to set time limits on the organizational conferences. [Seljuk] How are intergroup relations regulated in the APF? As first deputy chairman of the APF, those who wish to have "talks" with you connected to the fact that you are a member of the Musavat Party... [Ibrahimli] The broad social basis of the APF differentiates it from other political groups. Thus, the activity of different groups within the APF is natural. The basic issue is finding the mechanism of common principles among these groups and conducting a joint struggle for the goals of the program of the organization. The cadre changes in the higher organs of the APF were born from this need. As for the gossip about my membership in the Musavat Party, in order to cast some light on this question I want to talk about it in some detail. I have been in the front ranks of the people's movement in Azerbaijan since the day it began. At that time I conducted my activity in Nakhchyvan. As a result of this activity I was elected a people's deputy of Azerbaijan from the district in which I declared myself, and then a member of the National Assembly. Since I had the idea of reviving the Musavat Party in Azerbaijan, I was in a position to realize this question. As I was a member of the revival bureau of the Musavat, we held a revival congress. Then I was elected to the Board of Musavat. During the June events the chairman of the APF and the chairman of the APF Executive Committee left Baku for well known reasons. Those coming into the government selected the APF, which was a real force, as their first target. Driving this organization from the political arena was carried out without deviation. APF members were persecuted at various levels. In such a tense political atmosphere, I took on myself the defense of the overthrown government and the democratic opposition in the National Assembly. Because of my speeches in the National Assembly and the position I held, I was both praised and reviled. The electoral organs of the APF recommended my candidacy for the duty of chairman of the APF Executive Committee to E. Elchibey. Although I was a member of the electoral organs of the Musavat Party, I wrote a petition saying that the fate of the movement and the APF was the more important for me, and left Musavat. I returned once again to the Zeyneddin village support point of the Babek Rayon chapter of the APF -- to the organization of which I was a member until Musavat. Subsequently, the instructions of the APF chairman were turned over to the High Assembly. [Seljuk] Can Ibrahim Ibrahimli, who was elected as the second man in terms of duties in a large organization like the APF, fulfill his commitments? [Ibrahimli] It would be better if you asked those of the members of this organization who are engaged in policy. [Seljuk] What do you think about the recent use of force by the police in Khachmaz Rayon against opposition forces wishing to hold a meeting, and the arrest of a national representative, journalists, and members of the APF, Musavat and the ADP? [Ibrahimli] I view the Khachmaz events as part of an intentional policy conducted at the state level conducted against the opposition. This fact shows once again that the APF leadership, taking the dangerous situation in the republic into consideration, has listened to proposals on general game rules in government-opposition relations for the protection of stability. The application of these measures against members of the opposition weakens the government's position. As in every other time, this time we turned officially to law enforcement organs in the name of the organization. We will try to place questions connected with this fact on the daily agenda of the National Assembly. At the same time, we have submitted documents to international organizations connected with human rights in Azerbaijan.
