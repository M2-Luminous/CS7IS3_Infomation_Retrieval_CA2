FR941227-2-00135 FR941227-2-00088 [Release No. 34&hyph;35116; International Series Release No. 762; File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;94&hyph;01] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Boston Stock Exchange, Inc; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Boston-Montreal Linkage December 19, 1994. I. Introduction On February 7, 1994, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to establish a northbound trading linkage with the Montreal Exchange (``ME''). On November 7, 1994, the BSE submitted amendment no. 1 to the rule filing. 3 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 See letter from Karen A. Aluise, Assistant Vice President, BSE, to Holly Smith, Associate Director, SEC, dated November 1, 1994. The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34456 (July 28, 1994), 59 FR 39802 (August 4, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. II. Background In 1984, the Commission approved the first phase of a southbound linkage between the BSE and the ME for the routing of orders for the purchase and sale of securities listed on the BSE. 4 The initial phase of the linkage permitted ME members to direct to the BSE marketable limit orders in approximately forty U.S.-listed Canadian national stocks available for trading on the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS''). In 1985, phase two of the linkage was approved permitting the BSE to expand the list of securities eligible to be traded on the linkage to include most ITS securities traded on the BSE. 5 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21449 (November 1, 1984), 49 FR 44575. 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21925 (April 8, 1985), 50 FR 14480. In 1989, the Commission approved a Linkage Plan that allowed the BSE to connect the southbound linkage with the BSE's automated communications order-routing network (``BEACON'') system. 6 The Commission also approved at that time a generic linkage rule that allows the Exchange to establish trading linkages, provided that the BSE submits a Linkage Plan for each new proposed linkage to the Commission for its approval. 7 6 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27080 (July 31, 1989). 7 See supra note 6. Under the Linkage Rule, the Exchange is required to file with the Commission a Linkage Plan that contains the details of each proposed new linkage pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b). III. Description of the Proposal The proposed rule change establishes a trading linkage for the transmission of orders in certain Canadian securities from the BSE to the ME (``northbound linkage''). The linkage will be administered pursuant to the Linkage Plan agreement between the BSE and ME. The Linkage Plan contains provisions relating to management of the linkage, resolution of trade disputes, comparison and settlement of trades, and surveillance of transactions. 8 8 The Exchange has filed with the Commission a trade execution monitoring program for the surveillance of orders directed to the ME from the BSE's BEACON system. As a result of the northbound linkage, BSE members will be able to route orders for dually traded Canadian securities 9 directly to the ME for execution. The broker-dealers may enter orders for Canadian securities into their in-house electronic systems, which are linked to the BSE's BEACON system. BEACON receives and records the details of each order 10 before routing them directly to the ME's automated order-routing and execution system. 11 The ME system then logs each order and directs it to the ME specialist's electronic book. 12 9 To be eligible for trading over the northbound linkage, securities must be registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง78 l (b). Each eligible Canadian security will either be listed on the BSE or traded on the BSE pursuant to unlisted trading privileges under Section 12(f) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง78 l (f). 10 The order will contain the terms for the price, if any, stated in Canadian dollars, and an identifier indicating that its transmission is for the ME. 11 The BSE specialists assigned to the eligible Canadian securities are not given an opportunity to interact with orders routed directly to the ME. 12 The northbound orders routed through the BSE linkage to the ME will be handled by the ME according to the same rules and policies as orders sent to the ME floor from Canadian broker-dealers.
