Here is a report from Washington: [Unidentified correspondent] It cannot exactly be said that the talks between the delegations of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, which began at the State Department yesterday, have achieved any particular progress. However, the fact that the timing of the talks, set by the Americans, has been observed promises that a positive conclusion of the Washington talks on internal organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina can be expected as early as tomorrow afternoon. This morning the formulation of the republic's name was on the agenda, a name which should -- mapart from the geographic and historical name of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- also contain a constitutional solution, such as federation, confederation, union, and so forth. None of the solutions has been adopted so far. Bosnian territories currently under the control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina army, and the territories under HVO [Croat Defense Council] control, which -- we must not forget -- are also Bosnian territories, should during the negotiations be defined as parts of the overall territory which is currently not under occupation, populated by citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bosniaks, Croats, Serbs, and others, with the right to have the occupied territories reintegrated into the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina when this is rendered possible. Let me also emphasize that the future state, according to this agreement, looks increasingly similar to the original Vance-Owen plan. According to the plan Bosnia-Herzegovina is divided into 17 cantons. The unified Bosnian [word indistinct] is only the western and central territory; that is, the Bosnian territories populated by the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bosniaks, Croats, and others. It would be the successor of the state sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina and would remain a recognized member of the United Nations. The Americans particularly insist that in this phase the reintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be approached by first halting the Bosnian-Croat hostilities, then by restoring their alliance, and by articulating the territorial interests of the Bosnian people, who would thus preserve their own access to the sea, which they have had throughout their history, but which has been territorially reduced in repeated enemy agression.
