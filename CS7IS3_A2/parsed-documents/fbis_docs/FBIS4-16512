The demonstrators, mainly representatives of Communist and Socialist movements as well as Cossacks, voiced their discontent over the social and economic situation both in their city and the republic as a whole and passed a resolution demanding the government's resignation. In their opinion, the Kazakh president must bear responsibility for the republican government which has proved unable to lead the economy out of the crisis. The demonstrators supported the region's economic independence and free trade with neighboring regions of Russia. One of the organizers of the rally, Valeriy Ilyin, told INTERFAX that if these and other demands, mainly concerning state regulation of prices, centralized rationing of basic food staples, indexation of people's deposits with savings banks, were neglected, they could resort to other forms of civic protest allowed by the Kazakh Constitution. The rally appealed to the Kazakh parliament session to open on April 19 to consider the issue of dual citizenship and making Russian the official language. The demonstrators also demanded the leader of the local Russian-speaking community, Boris Suprunyuk, be set free. Suprunyuk had been detained on April 13 on charge of spreading ethnic strife. The participants of the rally also said they had no confidence in the region's prosecutor.
