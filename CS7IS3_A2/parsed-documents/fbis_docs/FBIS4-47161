He is Russian, and has a college education. He has great experience in party and economic work. Dyomin was the first secretary of the Kominternovskiy Rayon Committee, and later a secretary of the CPSU Kharkov City Committee. After the CPSU was banned, he moved on to the Ukrainian-Siberian investment corporation as vice president. He is president of the Prospect 21 foundation. Dyomin calls himself a nonparty member. He did not engage in political activities between September 1991 and the moment of his nomination for the Supreme Council. He was nominated for the post of mayor in Kharkov, but withdrew as a candidate after his election as deputy speaker. The Election The candidate was nominated in Kominternovskiy Electoral District No. 371 by a group of voters, the labor collective of the Budhidroprylad state enterprise, and Motor Vehicle Pool 16,328. During the election campaign he drew on his old connections in the rayon since the time of his tenure as secretary. He was virtually the only candidate whose victory was predicted unanimously by the political observers of Kharkov. He did not shrink from directly flirting with voters, for example, as he spoke on 8 March in the imeni Artem park before members of the Soldiers' Brotherhood club of veterans, he arranged for a free smorgasbord and presents for the wives packaged in brand-name paper bags with Ukrsybinkor labels. In the first round he got 24.4 percent, and his closest rival--9.4 percent. In the second round he got 53.54 percent, or 31.2 percent of the total number of voters. His political views--a supporter of the Chinese way and strong centralized power. His vision of transformations is in keeping with this pattern: economic reform, reform of social consciousness, reform of the political system. He believes that only a soviet political system is capable of conducting economic reform in the direction of the market. For this reason he denounces the destruction of this system. He calls the 1 December referendum a "deception of the people" because "the people were in favor of independence but within the Union." The introduction of the coupon was a tragedy and a national disgrace. "Ukraine has been ripped out of the ruble zone!" About the Belovezha agreements: "Unfortunately, the personal mercenary interests of individual princelings prevailed rather than the interests of the people." For this reason it is "necessary to resume relations with Russia to the full extent not only in the economic but also in the military-political sphere." Dyomin's participation, along with that of Sibinkor President Taranov, in the proceedings of a roundtable panel of the representatives of centrist forces of the three independent states in Kharkov on 21 May 1994 is explained precisely by this vision of relations between Ukraine and Russia. Together with another group of moneybags, he signed a declaration before the second round of voting to deflect accusations about forming an anticommunist bloc. The declaration said in particular: "An anticommunist bloc is out of the question. All of us are the children of our motherland and our time. We know well, perhaps better than others, what our country achieved under socialism and how many people were inspired and propelled into battle and labor by the communist idea. We do not renounce our convictions at present, either. Prospects The Unity group of deputies, which in addition to Dyomin, the residents of Kharkov Taranov, the Sibinkor president, Alekseyev (Civic Congress of Ukraine) and Chornousenko (SBU) [Ukrainian Security Service] joined, was established on a nonparty basis on the principles of counteracting the spread of "dense nationalism," mutually advantageous economic relations with Russia, and putting the economy in order. They quickly found a common language with the left. The latter, lacking a real program for overcoming the crisis, agreed to yield a string of key positions to their allies (Taranov's appointment as head of the economic policy commission). The new postcommunist bourgeoisie which comes from the communist circles suits them just fine because it voices (at least publicly) views that are quite close to theirs. On the other hand, it may serve as a guide of sorts to the future. Under the circumstances, Hrynyov and his ilk are the losers because this new bourgeoisie has come to power itself, and it no longer needs the services of overly talkative and continuously hungry intermediaries. Power is gradually acquiring the features of an oligarchy. This, in turn, indicates that a quite stable trend toward some kind of Chinese-Latin American way of sociopolitical development has emerged in Ukraine. FROM THE FILES OF POST-POSTUP: The origins of the Ukrsybinkor joint-stock company date back to the moment of the creation in 1991 of the Universal Ukrainian-Siberian Exchange (UUSB), of which the Rapid plant (director, Taranov) and the organizations of the city of Tyumen were founders. In 1992 the AT [Joint-Stock Company] Ukrsybinkor investment corporation was created with a statutory fund of R250 million. Hundreds of enterprises from the former USSR are its shareholders. In 1992 the controlling share of the Kharkivvinkombank was purchased, which was transformed into the Ukrsybbank. At present there are more than 30 enterprises and institutions in the joint-stock company, including a plant for recycling precious metals. The sphere of operations of the joint-stock company includes production, commercial, intermediary, and banking services, and glass production. Since summer 1992 the USB [Ukrainian-Siberian Exchange] has engaged in the sale of Russian weapons (planes, tanks, artillery systems, air defense materiel, and firearms). For example, on 28 January 1993 a delivery of weapons worth more than $2 billion was put up for sale. The AT Ukrsybinkor has its own guard in the form of the 250-strong Alfa-Profi detachment of the guardians of legal order set up under the aegis of the Prospect 21 foundation. All of them have the certificates of auxiliary militia employees. The detachment was actively used during Oleg Taranov's election campaign. On one occasion this resulted in a noisy scandal when its combatants seized in the street citizens who were pasting up anti-Taranov leaflets. The USB engages in extensive charitable activities, supporting the development of children's athletics in particular. People's Deputy Taranov is president of the AT Ukrsybinkor. Dyomin, the deputy speaker and people's deputy, is vice president.
