In response to a question about the reason for choosing this name, one of those who had taken part in the play answered saying: "We wanted to send a message to the Israeli people telling them that it is okay to be a Kurd." Kamran Qurrah Daghi believes that this response is an indication that there is a Jewish-Kurdish special relationship that started in the year 720 BC. Kurdish Jews in Israel cherish their Kurdish identity and sympathize with and support Muslim Kurds. Israeli Kurds compare the annihilation of Iraqi Kurds in the al-Anfal and Halbajah operations in May 1988, when poisonous gas was used, to the annihilation of Jews during the Holocaust. At the time of the above mentioned operations, Kurdish Jews organized protest campaigns and tried to adopt those children who were saved in Halbajah. However, Turkey, where a large number of Iraqi Kurds had taken refuge, refused to help Kurdish Jews reach their goals. Moreover, Israeli Kurds tried to give humanitarian support to Iraqi Kurds during the refugee catastrophe in April 1991, yet, sensitive relations with Turkey hindered that; they still do to the present day. Kurdish Jews state that their emigration to Israel was to flee neither ethnic nor religious persecution, but was due to their Zionist affiliation. Until now, they continue to have their affiliation with Kurdistan. If Kurdish Jews are to be compared with the Jews of Baghdad, it is found that the isolated mountainous geographic environment has impacted the Kurdish Jews and made them cling to Kurdish rather than to Arab or Turkish values. Though Kurdish Jews have been in Israel for decades, the nonreligious aspects of their culture, such as language, customs, and social values, have not much changed. However, as for the new generation of Kurds born in Israel, because they have had no contact with the Kurdish society, it is found that their understanding of Kurdish affiliation is different from that of the generation raised in Kurdistan. Nevertheless, the latter feel that if the current political circumstances continue to prevail, their Kurdish life-style might vanish in the long run. This state of affairs made Israeli Kurds long very much for their past Kurdish environment. It is the elderly from among them, in particular, who are bound to feel the pain when Israeli Kurds become cut off from their roots. Even the youths still cling to Kurdish customs, such as food, dance, music, and even sometimes the Kurdish language, which many of these youth insist on learning. Moreover, Kurdish Jews in Israel are still inclined to intermarry. In order to remain in touch with the Kurdish culture, the national council of the Society for Kurdish Jews in Israel in 1971 decided to organize an annual festival [Saharanah] for the Israeli Kurdish community. This festival is a good opportunity for them to "express their joy, brotherly feelings, and to bring back to life the prayers, singing, dancing, food, costumes, and life-style of this ethnic group. This culture developed over about 3,000 years while the group lived in Kurdistan." Around 25,000 to 30,000 Kurdish Jews take part in this two-day open-air festival. The head of state, the prime minister, and other official dignitaries usually attend this festival. Yitzhaq Rabin, the current prime minister, inaugurated the last festival. Before establishing the Jewish state in 1948, there were about 20,000 Kurdish Jews in Palestine. Between 1950 and 1951, another 40,000 Kurdish Jews immigrated to Israel from Iranian and Iraqi Kurdistan. Kurdish Jews in Israel are currently estimated at 100,000, most of whom have come from Iraqi Kurdistan. In Jerusalem 35,000 of the 100,000 Kurdish Jews live; in Tiberias, 5,000; in Haifa, 7,000; and in the settlements and the rest of Israel, about 20,000. A number of Kurdish Jews have become prominent in Israel's political and public life. Some of these are representatives and prominent members of political parties and municipalities. Habib Shaymuni [name as transliterated], current president of the Organization for Kurdish Jews, who was born in the Iraqi Kurdish city of 'Aqrah, was a Labor Party member of the Knesset. However, the most prominent Kurdish Jew would be General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, commander of the northern front, who was also born in the city of 'Aqrah and is considered one of the most active of Israeli Kurds. This elite group of Kurdish politicians, lawyers, and academicians took the initiative to establish an organization that brought together Kurdish Jews in Israel. This organization is especially interested in cultural activities. Besides, it tries to establish relations with Kurds resident outside Israel. It also supports Kurdish researchers and artists and sometimes invites them to visit Israel. However, the activities of the organization outside Israel remains limited, because it cannot establish relations with Iraqi, Iranian, or Syrian Kurds. The organization therefore has contacts only with Kurds resident either in Europe or in the United States. Israeli Kurds can only visit Turkish Kurdistan, which they do in disguise. Moreover, with the worsening of the Kurdish-Turkish war, these visits have become difficult. Travelers and scholars who visited Kurdistan from the 12th to the 20th century indicated that there were Jews who shared the life-style of Muslim Kurds living among the Muslims. This meant that honor and disgrace were important values for Kurdish Jews just as they were for the Kurdish society as a whole. Only religious rituals differentiated Jews from either Christians or Muslims in Kurdistan. A number of Kurdish Jews immigrated to Palestine at the beginning of the 20th century, yet, most of the rest immigrated in the 1940s and the beginning of the 1950s. Between 1970 and 1973, about 3,000 Jews, who had remained in Baghdad, helped the Kurds flee across the Kurdish borders to Iran, from where they traveled to Israel. It is no secret that through Iran, Israel offered material and military aid to the Kurdish movement in Iraq during the 1963-74 period. The original language of the first generation of Kurdish Jews in Israel was Aramaic, which resembles contemporary Hebrew and is sometimes wrongly called "Kurdish" in Israel. Their second language was Kurdish, which was dominated by the "Karmangi" [as transliterated] dialect. These languages were followed by Turkish, Persian, and Arabic. However, currently, Hebrew is considered the first language for the majority of Israeli Kurds. It seems strange that the Israeli Kurdish environment is the only one where the term "Kurdistan" is used officially and legally. Many Kurds do not know which country currently rules the region where their ancestors lived. The museum of Israel in Jerusalem displays some samples that are described as "Kurdish" so that they may be distinguished from "Iranian," "Turkish," or "Iraqi." Kurdish Jews came to this homeland in the first temple era. Some Kurdish Jews believe that they are the descendants of the 10 Jewish tribes that the Assyrians captured and enslaved after they destroyed the Kingdom of Israel in 720 BC. They were joined by the Jews captured and enslaved in Babylon 150 years later. Since that time, Jewish settlements were established in this region. However, for geographic reasons, these settlements soon lost contact with the Jewish centers in Babylon. However, in spite of this isolation, Kurdish Jews managed to preserve their religion and religious identity. In the 12th century, a messianic movement sprang up. It was led by two false "messiahs," Miyhim ben Shalumu ibn Ruhi [name as transliterated][?Shlomo Molkho] and David al-Ruwi [name as transliterated][?David Ha'renveni], after whom the Jews named the first settlement in Kurdistan. In the 13th century, the Moguls invaded Iraq and a large number of Jews fled to the Kurdistan mountains where they built settlements in protected areas. Due to the national instability that lasted for many centuries, because of the struggle between Kurds and Ottomans, many Jews were killed. However, Jews did not face any religious persecution from Muslim Kurds. There were natural social relations between Jews and Kurds; friendships were also established between the heads of families. Kurdish Jews had developed folklore-type literature inspired by the Old Testament. Music using drums and flutes, which are the two instruments common all over Kurdistan, accompanied their dancing and singing. Like Kurds, both men and women take part in Kurdish dancing [al-Dabkah]. Kurdish Jews verbally transmit from one generation to another stories from their folklore, relating historic events. However, because there were no religious schools [Yishivot] in Kurdistan, Jews who wished to study Judaism had to go to Baghdad. One of the two prominent rabbis in Baghdad was of Kurdish descent. Only a few Kurdish Jews who resided in al-Mawsil and Karkuk could provide a European-style education for their children after the British occupation of Iraq. Since the beginning of the 18th century, relations have been fostered between Kurdish Jews and Jewish centers in Palestine. A group of Kurdish Jews immigrated to Palestine in 1812 and resided in Jerusalem. However, the major immigration happened after the establishment of the Jewish State in 1950 and 1951. This immigration was known as the two campaigns of "Ezrah" and "Nehemiah." Currently, only a few Jews are left in Iranian, Turkish, and Syrian Kurdistan. Will the new peace and openness between peoples open these folders that have remained closed and abandoned for a long time?
