FR940105-2-00110 FR940105-2-00052 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;33401; File No. SR&hyph;CHX&hyph;93&hyph;29] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Proposed Rule Change Relating to Extended Trading Hours for the Chicago Stock Basket December 29, 1993. On October 27, 1993, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to extend the trading hours for the Chicago Stock Basket (``CXM''). 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33241 (November 23, 1993), 58 FR 63407 (December 1, 1993). No comments were received on the proposal. The CHX's primary trading session, including trading of the CXM, currently ends at 3 Central time (4 Eastern time). 3 The CXM is a standardized basket product consisting of twenty-five shares of each of the stocks included in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (``Merc'') ``MMI'' futures contract. That contract is based on the American Stock Exchange's (``Amex'') Major Market Index (``MMI''), a broad-based price-weighted index of twenty stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''). 4 3 See Article IX, Rule 10 of the CHX Rules. 4 For further discussion of the terms of the CXM contract and the market structure for trading the CXM, see Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33053 (October 15, 1993), 58 FR 54610 (October 22, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;CHX&hyph;93&hyph;18) (``CXM Approval Order''). The Exchange proposes to extend the hours for trading the CXM until 3:15 Central time (4:15 Eastern time). This proposal will make the trading hours of the CXM consistent with the trading hours of derivative products that are based on the same index as the CXM and other derivative products that could be used as a hedge against the CXM. According to the Exchange, similar trading hours should provide risk management benefits when trading the CXM. The Exchange states that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of section 6(b). 5 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. 5 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). In recent years, concerns have been raised about the role that index-related trading strategies (e.g., use of the equity cash market to hedge positions in stock index futures and options contracts) played in increasing market volatility. 6 As a result, the Commission has, among other things, encouraged the national securities exchanges to list and trade standardized baskets of stocks. 7 The Commission believes that, in comparison to other methods of portfolio trading, basket products, such as the CXM, are an efficient means to make investment decisions based on the direction of standardized measures of stock market performance, and may enhance the market's ability to absorb program trading. 8 6 See, e.g., SEC, Division of Market Regulation, The October 1987 Market Break (February 1988). 7 In addition to the CXM, the Commission has approved the trading of market baskets on the NYSE and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE''). See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 27382 (October 26, 1989), 54 FR 45834 (October 31, 1989) (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;89&hyph;05) (approving trading of basket of stocks comprising the Standard & Poor's (``S&P'') 500 Portfolio Index); and 27383 (October 26, 1989), 54 FR 45846 (October 31, 1989) (File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;88&hyph;20) (approving trading of basket of stocks comprising the S&P 100 and S&P 500 Indexes). 8 See CXM Approval Order, supra, note 4. The Commission has concluded that extending the trading hours for the CXM will enhance market participants' ability to use that basket for hedging purposes. The CXM offers a highly correlative hedge to the Merc's ``MMI'' futures contract. In addition, the CXM could be used to offset a position in the options on the MMI futures contract that are traded on the Merc; in the options on the MMI that are traded on the Amex; or in derivative products on other broad-based stock market indexes. 9 At the moment, however, CXM trading ends at 3 Central time (4 Eastern time), while trading of such derivative products continues until 3:15 Central time (4:15 Eastern time). The Commission recognizes that the current lack of coordination may hinder market participants' ability to adjust their risk in response to late price movements in the derivatives market. 9 For example, the promotional literature for the CXM illustrates how that basket could be used as a hedge against the S&P 100 options contract.
