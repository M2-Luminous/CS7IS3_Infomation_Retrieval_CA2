FR940118-2-00012 FR940118-2-00010 [A&hyph;588&hyph;604; A&hyph;588&hyph;054] Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, From Japan and Tapered Roller Bearings, Four Inches or Less in Outside Diameter, and Components Thereof, From Japan AGENCY: International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of amendment to final results of antidumping duty administrative reviews. SUMMARY: On December 9, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register the final results of administrative reviews of the antidumping finding on tapered roller bearings, four inches or less in outside diameter, and components thereof, from Japan, and the antidumping duty order on tapered roller bearings and parts thereof, finished and unfinished, from Japan. The reviews of the finding covered the periods from August 1, 1990 through September 30, 1991, and October 1, 1991 through September 30, 1992. The reviews of the order covered the periods from October 1, 1990 through September 30, 1991, and October 1, 1991 through September 30, 1992. Subsequent to the publication of the final results, the Department discovered that it had made a ministerial error affecting the margins for Nachi-Fujikoshi. The Department also discovered ministerial errors affecting the margins for NSK Ltd., Koyo Seiko, and NTN Corporation; however, since appeals have already been filed by these parties, we are precluded from correcting these errors at this time. We have corrected the error affecting Nachi by assigning to Nachi in the A&hyph;588&hyph;604 reviews of both periods the proper rate to be used as best information available (BIA), 40.37 percent. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Maureen Shields or John Kugelman, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, telephone: (202) 482&hyph;5253. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 9, 1993, the Department published in the Federal Register the final results of its 1990&hyph;91 and 1991&hyph;92 administrative review of the antidumpting finding on tapered roller bearings, four inches or less in outside diameter, and components thereof, from Japan, and the antidumping duty order on tapered roller bearings and parts thereof, finished and unfinished, from Japan (58 FR 64720). Subsequent to the publication of the final results, the Department discovered that it had made a ministerial error affecting Nachi. Section 353.28(d) of the Department's regulations defines a ``ministerial error'' as ``an error in addition, subtraction, or other arithmetic function, clerical error resulting from inaccurate copying, duplication, or the like, and any other type of unintentional error which the Secretary considers ministerial'' (19 CFR 353.28(d)). Although Nachi submitted comments on November 1, 1993, concerning the rate it should receive as BIA in the A&hyph;588&hyph;604 reviews, the Department inadvertently failed to address these comments in the final results. Nachi pointed out that the rate of 45.95 percent, which the Department assigned to Nachi in the final results, is a rate from a previous review of the order which was later amended to correct clerical errors. We agree with Nachi, and have assigned, as BIA, a rate of 40.37 percent to Nachi in both reviews of the A&hyph;588&hyph;604 case. Amended Final Results of Review As a result of this correction, we have determined that the rate for Nachi is 40.37 percent for tapered roller bearings and components thereof (A&hyph;588&hyph;604) for the periods October 1, 1990 through September 30, 1991, and October 1, 1991 through September 30, 1992. The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between the United States price and foreign market value may vary from the percentages stated above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions on each exporter directly to the Customs Service. Furthermore, the following cash deposit requirements are amended as follows: A&hyph;588&hyph;604: Nachi 40.37 percent. All other cash deposit requirements remain unchanged from the notice of December 9, 1993. These deposit requirements shall remain in effect until the publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This amendment to the final results of administrative reviews and this notice are in accordance with section 751(f) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1675(f)) and section 353.28(c) of the Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.28(c)). Dated: January 7, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1142 Filed 1&hyph;14&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
