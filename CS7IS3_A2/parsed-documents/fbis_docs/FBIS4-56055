This futile attack began with fierce shooting from light infantry weapons. The chetniks then started gradually to introduce anti-aircraft guns and machineguns, mortars, and similar types of weapons. The fighting culminated with the infantry attack, which the ever ready defenders of Sarajevo uncompromisingly repelled, forcing the chetniks to return to where they set off on their night adventure. The town is quiet this morning, but one must not forget to remain cautious. The Ilijas front, which has been simmering with chetnik attacks for several days, was subjected to a fierce artillery attack during which more than 100 shells landed on [word indistinct] Brdo, [words indistinct] and other places in the free territory. The chetniks also carried out attacks from artillery and armored mechanized weapons from their position in Nisici, (?Buljetovac), Medojevici, Nabozici, (?Pudraz), and Duboki Potok. There are dozens of these weapons in this region. They are mainly inside the Sarajevo 20 km zone. [passage omitted]
