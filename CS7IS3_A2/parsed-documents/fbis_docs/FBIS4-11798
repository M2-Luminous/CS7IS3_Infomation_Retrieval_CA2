Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports the decision was made unanimously following a session lasting more than four hours. The NRP faction also states that a government decision to evacuate Jews from their homes and lands in Eretz Yisra'el is a terrible edict which contradicts Zionism, Jewish law, and human ethics. The NRP promises to do everything within its power to foil such a decision and calls on the entire Israeli public to evince passive, nonviolent civil resistance to foil such a decision, if it is made.
