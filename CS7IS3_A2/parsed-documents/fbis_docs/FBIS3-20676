The news that trucks with aid for the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina are waiting at a military checkpoint is certainly nothing new, but the attempt to transport the aid to the Tuzla region through the northern corridor, more exactly from Zagreb via Zupanja, Orasje, and Srebrenica to Tuzla, could change not only the humanitarian but also the political situation in the Tuzla and Posavina region. The action for opening the northern corridor called "The Road of Salt and Wheat -- Humanitarian Convoy of Love for Tuzla and Posavina" is organized by nongovernment organizations, primarily International Workers' Aid and the Tuzla Logistics Center, under the general patronage of the European Parliament, with the support of numerous individuals and the Croatian political opposition (Mika Tripalo, Ivan Zvonimir Cicak, Silvije Degen, Milorad Pupovac). We discuss this action, the situation in Tuzla, and the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Edhem Asceric, president of the organizational committee of the action for opening the northern corridor. [Peranic] How did the idea of trying to open the northern corridor come about? [Asceric] International Workers' Aid from London and the Tuzla Logistics Center have been trying for five months to accomplish the most natural thing -- the opening of the northern corridor to Tuzla. Trade organizations from Scotland, Ireland, Spain, France, Portugal, Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Slovenia have been included in this action. They drafted a miniprogram of activities for opening a northern corridor at a recent meeting in Stuttgart. The northern corridor was mentioned for the first time when the English workers delivered their aid for Tuzla to Split and remained there unable to continue because of the Croatian-Muslim conflict. We explained to them that Tuzla has never been connected with other towns or states through the southern corridor and that a highway exists on the northern side, which is the most natural and fastest way of linking the region of Tuzla and Posavina with Croatia and, farther away, with European countries. One could reach Zagreb via this corridor, i.e. a regular road, in less than five hours. [Peranic] Nevertheless, you used the southern corridor through Herzegovina to central Bosnia and onward to Tuzla up to the beginning of the Croat-Muslim conflicts. [Asceric] The use of the southern corridor to deliver supplies during the first year of the war was intentionally imposed by blockading Tuzla from all the other sides. Up to the beginning of the war, these roads were not used at all, except for forestry work, because the distance from Tuzla to Zagreb via these roads is about 1,150 kilometers, and one had to travel as long as three to four days even when there were no conflicts or war activities. Today, when this southern corridor does not even function and when it is the site of a major flashpoint, it is illogical to make efforts to use it for transportation of humanitarian aid to Tuzla, and it is questionable whether the aid would get there at all. Not long ago, in May 1993, a large convoy for Tuzla was attacked in this southern corridor. Many of our people died, and of the 476 vehicles only about 200 half-empty vehicles made it to Tuzla, while the others were destroyed. Our total loss, in addition to the irreplaceable human losses, amounted to about 35 million German marks. [Peranic] Recently a letter was sent from the Tuzla municipal government claiming that the situation regarding food supplies for residents and the numerous refugees is exceptionally difficult and that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was unsuccessful in delivering any kind of aid during the last month. [Asceric] Humanitarian aid supply for Tuzla is very bad indeed. There are 226,000 inhabitants, of whom 130,000 are residents of Tuzla and the rest refugees from northern and eastern Bosnia. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees specifies in its program only the provision of aid for refugees and not for residents, and even this aid satisfies, according to the estimates of our statistics office, only 17 percent of total needs. Unfortunately, the warehouses in the Republic of Croatia and in other European countries are full of goods intended for Tuzla, but they cannot be transported. Every day we set aside money for storage charges for these goods, because every square meter of storage area has its price. The goods are melting away, benefactors are impatient because we are unable to give them confirmation of the receipt of goods, and on the other hand, the residents of Tuzla cannot believe that nobody wants to help them. As you know, even after all the stories that have been told for months, the Tuzla airport remains closed, and only shells land on it. [Peranic] In almost all the blockaded Bosnia-Herzegovina towns, goods that should have been distributed as humanitarian aid have been appearing on the black market. Is this also happening in Tuzla? [Asceric] Of course. Those who are blockading Tuzla are bringing into the town goods which have not been allowed to arrive legally. In this way, they extract from the citizens their very last dinar or foreign currency which, in one way or another, was sent to them by their closest relatives abroad. The black market is very profitable in a war, and thus some are not at all interested in lifting the blockade of the town. An average salary in Tuzla is about four German marks, and prices on the black market are going wild: a kilogram of sugar is 40 German marks, oil is 30 German marks, and flour as much as 40 German marks, depending on the quantity of goods that have been smuggled into the town. Such a black market does not know of ethnic borders, what is important is to earn well. It is precisely for this reason that the multiethnically oriented government of Tuzla is interested in opening the northern corridor, because smuggling of food products would be hindered and prices of basic products would be guaranteed to remain at some rational and acceptable level. [Peranic] If the average salary is 4 German marks, that means that some institutions and firms continue to work, despite the blockade. [Asceric] Of course. Schools, university faculties, and some services sectors are working. Almost all the production sectors that are working are operating at reduced capacity. All our workers are threatened because they are dependent on the thermoelectric system. The circle is closing here, and problems are occuring. The Tuzla thermoelectric power plant capacity is 869 megawatts, half of which is sufficient for the region. We used to export the rest: some of it to Sarajevo, some as far as Dalmatia, when it was on the brink of darkness. But today, as a result of the blockade, we are unable to bring raw materials for the mines -- powder, detonators, explosives, and crude oil -- and the thermoelectric power plant is working at reduced capacity. We have offered our cooperation to almost everyone in order to obtain raw materials. We even offered to let Croatia have their people come and distribute raw materials, in order to convince them that they were not used for military purposes, but nothing came of it. We cannot produce electricity because we cannot extract the coal, and, without electricity, we had to reduce the production of all products and resources in the polyurethane industry and the Dita detergent factory. If we had a roadway to transport raw materials, we could feed the entire region without any humanitarian aid, since the products of Tuzla are highly competitive. Thus, if we were able to open this northern corridor, which is the most favorable roadway to Tuzla and if the passage through this road were open continuously, this would virtually mean the end of the war for us. The citizens not only of Tuzla but of other parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina would have clear proof that they can live together without a war and ethnic hatred. Tuzla was and will remain the proof of this. [Peranic] It seems that Tuzla is, in fact, blocked by all three sides, i.e. that intolerance toward Tuzla exists in all three ethnic groups in Bosnia- Herzegovina. The Serbian media, for example, have published that Selim Beslagic, the mayor of Tuzla and the president of the Reformists, has either been killed or arrested, while the Sarajevo media constantly accuse you of secessionism and of being autonomous. [Asceric] Others want us to have autonomy more than we wish it ourselves. In spite of the three ethnic options which are against us, we believe that only two sides exist in the Tuzla region -- those who are for Bosnia-Herzegovina and those who are against it. Nationalistic programs were unfortunate for Bosnia-Herzegovina, and they only pointed to which ethnic group.one belonged in this state. The trouble is that everyone calls himself or wants to be called something other than what the name of their state is. Had they been calling themselves citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Bosnians and Herzegovinians, there would be by far fewer problems than there are today. I believe that the Tuzla multiethnic option will subsist, and it will expand all over Bosnia-Herzegovina. Mr. Selim Beslagic is politically wise, and I think that one should listen to him. The citizens of Tuzla are together, and that is the greatest force. It is less important whether one is Orthodox, Catholic, or of the Islamic faith. Incidentally, the slogan of the party headed by Beslagic is worded like this: "Bosnia defends itself best in the Tuzla fashion."
