FR940719-1-00086 FR940719-1-00015 §75.301 Definitions. * * * * * Return air. Air that has ventilated the last working place on any split of any working section or any worked-out area whether pillared or nonpillared. If air mixes with air that has ventilated the last working place on any split of any working section or any worked-out area, whether pillared or nonpillared, it is considered return air. For the purposes of existing §75.507&hyph;1, air that has been used to ventilate any working place in a coal producing section or pillared area, or air that has been used to ventilate any working face if such air is directed away from the immediate return is return air. Notwithstanding the definition of intake air, for the purpose of ventilation of structures, areas or installations that are required by this subpart D to be ventilated to return air courses, and for ventilation of seals, other air courses may be designated as return air courses by the operator only when the air in these air courses will not be used to ventilate working places or other locations, structures, installations or areas required to be ventilated with intake air. * * * * * 3. Section 75.310 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4) and (c), to read as follows: §75.310 Installation of main mine fans. (a) *␣*␣* (3) Equipped with an automatic device that gives a signal at the mine when the fan either slows or stops. A responsible person designated by the operator shall always be at a surface location at the mine where the signal can be seen or heard while anyone is underground. This person shall be provided with two-way communication with the working sections and other established locations where persons are normally assigned to work; (4) Equipped with a pressure recording device or system. If a device or system other than a circular pressure recorder is used to monitor main mine fan pressure, the monitoring device or system shall provide a continuous graph or continuous chart of the pressure as a function of time. At not more than 7-day intervals, a hard copy of the continuous graph or chart shall be generated. Records of the fan pressure shall be retained at a surface location at the mine for at least 1 year and be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners. Mines that are permitted to shut down main mine fans under §75.311 may use an alternative device for monitoring main mine fan pressure that does not provide a continuous record, provided it is approved in the ventilation plan; * * * * * (c) If a main mine fan monitoring system is used under §75.312, the system shall_ (1) Record, as described in paragraph (a)(4) the mine ventilating pressure; (2) Monitor bearing temperature, revolutions per minute, vibration, electric voltage, and amperage; (3) Provide, on demand, a printout of the monitored parameters, including the mine ventilating pressure; and (4) Be equipped with an automatic device that signals when_ (i) An electrical or mechanical deficiency exists in the monitoring system; or (ii) A sudden increase or loss in mine ventilating pressure occurs. (5) Provide monitoring, records, printouts, and signals required by paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) at a surface location at the mine where a responsible person designated by the operator is always on duty and where signals from the monitoring system can be seen or heard while anyone is underground. This person shall be provided with two-way communication with the working sections and other established locations where persons are normally assigned to work. * * * * * 4. Section 75.311 is amended by revising paragraph (d) to read as follows: §75.311 Main mine fan operation. * * * * *
