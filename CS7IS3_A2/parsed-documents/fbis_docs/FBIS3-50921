He also denied the charges pressed by six Mexican human rights organizations of the alleged genocide of civilians, wondering "what could be done if when subversion takes to arms, those who are killing people are said to be preserving human rights." "Our interpretation is the same we had for the subversion in Argentina, even though the situation is not similar and has deeper connotations, such as the ethnical side. In Argentina, subversion tried to reach power after the declaration of liberated zones such as that in Tucuman," the president said. In a conversation with journalists accredited to Government House, Menem said the situation in Mexico was not "improvised, because even if at the beginning it appeared to be something unplanned, it was later seen that the EZLN was well organized." The president admitted that "displeasure" is the main reason for the creation of subversive organizations that "take advantage of this to engage in something broader, which does not meet the people's demands and which upsets legal order."
