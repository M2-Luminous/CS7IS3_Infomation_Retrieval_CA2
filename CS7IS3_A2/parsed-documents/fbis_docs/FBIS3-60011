Gaston Martinique [no title given] informed us about existing and future agreements. Martinique: There is an agreement that will remain in force until March. The Bolivian Government has committed itself to eradicating 4,500 hectares. I am deeply satisfied to report that so far we have fulfilled the second target of the agreement. We have eradicated approximately 2,350 hectares. Reporter Amalia Pando: Gaston, what amount will the United States give as credit in return for this, although this is not actually a credit but a donation, sort of compensation, right? Martinique: It is a fund of approximately $40 million, which supports the balance of trade. They disbursed $10 million after we fulfilled the first target. Now that we have fulfilled the second target, we expect disbursement of another $10 million installment, and the remaining $20 million before March. Pando: To start from scratch after March? Martinique: Right. At that time we will design the new targets under the new policy that I described to you, a policy of agreement and coordination with coca growers. Summing up, to date the government has fulfilled only 50 percent of its eradication commitment, and it has only three months to eradicate the other 50 percent, that is, 2,200 hectares. The government is confident this will be done through a policy of agreements with coca growers. This will decide the fate of $20 million the United States will deliver to the Bolivian Central Bank. According to Martinique, the alternative development policy will be maintained. In 1994, this policy will demand investments of $25 million, which the government will obtain from foreign countries and international organizations interested in the replacement of coca farms.
