Tshisekedi told a news conference Mobutu, who also dissolved the National Assembly, had carried out a "constitutional coup d'etat". On Friday Mobutu said an accord signed by his own supporters and the radical opposition meant that the government of Faustin Birindwa set up nine months ago should be dissolved "with immediate effect" along with the transitional High Council of the Republic (HCR) and the rival National Assembly. A long-running power struggle between Mobutu and the opposition had left the country with two governments, including one led by Tshisekedi, and two parliaments. Tshisekedi, at a press conference on Sunday, condemned the dissolution of the HCR and claimed there had been "abuse" in interpreting the agreement signed by the opposition Holy Alliance, which was concerned mainly with reforming the HCR and drawing up an election timetable. Presidential supporters and the opposition had been engaged in talks since last September to resolve the political crisis. Mobutu ordered the HCR and the National Assembly to unite to form a new transitional assembly and to choose a new prime minister. The first session of the enlarged body, originally set for Monday, has been put back to Wednesday.
